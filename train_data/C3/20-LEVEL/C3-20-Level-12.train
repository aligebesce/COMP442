Cheaper?

No matter how bad he doesn't like it  he's well and truly gutted.
Er so him for Deane and
Yeah but Deane won't be available till the end of the season.
There's no way Sheffield United
Er I dunno.

"Oh yeah, Deane."
Deane.
But Deane didn't score today.
It was Beazley apparently.

That was a really silly thing wasn't it?
Can I just have a look Kath?
Yeah.
He organized it all and then I think was it a week before he suddenly said  well we can't possibly have two hundred people walking along  a nature trail  that we want to protect.
And he was really of the illusion that there might be  I think two hundred no six hundred people
Two hundred people might turn up.

"Wasn't satisfied with it, he goes and makes a big one as well but I don't want a big one, I don't wanna do a big one  for the sale I just wanna do a small one."
Ah well he's always wanted a big one.
Yes

Oh
Eh?

The sweets
They are marginally easier to eat that way
"I don't mean, I mean why have you taken up the other, the plastic bag and put it in that?"
"Mm, why it's a horrible bag?"

"erm,bom bom bom"
And the visibility didn't seem very good out of them.
"But the smallest one, the twelve foot ones, there's only one window."
The door's in the back end.
Erm  so I presume that was the opposite end to where the tow bar  would be
Mm.
and then just one window in it.
Maybe just down the length of one side.
Or even just at the end.
Yeah.
No I think it was down the side I think he said.
But I  I think that'll be too expensive anyway.
Mhm.
And that's why Mr  said he  he'd er
"He'd do it, yeah."
And we know where we are then with the toilet.
"You know, you know what you're getting don't you?"
Yeah.
How much ?
Yeah it'd be erm  Jim  said there would be no problem because his men have to empty their own chemical loos anyway.
But the bowl coupling could be a problem.
"He said but we'll sort it out, don't worry love."
They're all very nice   people.
They have got an accent  this  's got one  but he sounds more Lancashire than anything.
And he's nowhere near.
Perhaps he's just moved there.
Mm.
I'll have to er  give her a ring to   and tell them to send me the advert.
Tell them to buy .
Mhm.
When does it go out?
I don't know.
Today.
Through them  they have to have first option.
They're the one that gets the benefit!
Well  two weeks ago
But then they can't sell it!
They can't sell it!
And that's only the new one!
"Cos they said, I won't be able sell it cos they  they've got so many new ones on the site!"
Last week there was people in here!
So how could that water be like it is?
Cos you can't use it!
There is no hot water!
Well he can't!
Well everything  everything is
in their favour.
"And I've  well the people, all the people I've spoken to  and everybody I've spoken to  is very unhappy!"
I haven't spoken to one who's satisfied yet!
I've been on the telephone to people!
"I'm taking numbers off of caravans where they're letting  and I've been round and spoken to people who are in them caravans, and not one is happy!"
"Last week a chap down here, David"
Yeah.
"Told me, he said, well  ninety five per cent are happy."
"I said, really?"
Well I haven't found one yet!
Out
Yes.
of all the people I've spoken to!
What did they say now?
They're all very unhappy!
I tell you!
"This woman doesn't know anything, like!"
"She just said there's two boys out on there on site  and the one, the, the ginger haired boy knows the  you know  the problem."
And I
Because I'm because John Gummer's responsibilities extend a long way into things like housing and stuff as well don't they?
Whereas Robert Atkins has more specific responsibility perhaps for getting this area.
People of one
I don't know that's what I imagine.
people of one  of the environment and the other's Secretary of State for the Environment.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
It's just bizarre rules of procedure.
There are more Ministers of State that there are Secretaries of State.
Yeah.
To be honest I think we should be grateful they don't have to have the court magician come in
Wave their wand and recite the Lords Prayer.
Fair enough.
I assumed there would be a reason  assume there was going to be a good reason.
Erm so who else was on your  list of people we ought to write to
South East Cambridgeshire who's the Parl Parliamentary Secretary to John Gummer.
Who's the sorry your  and I can't

number.
If they want to know I know exactly what number it is.
Do you?
Do you?
"Well I gave my dad's to put, I gave dad his to take"

What time's he getting up now?
It's quite a nice day today.
Oh yes!
"When I got up this morning, I nearly died!"
I got out the bed at five and twenty to eleven and the curtains were still drawn and I thought oh my God!
"So, I opened the door and I was so pleased when he answered, you know."
"He said, just at the right time he decided that he can't get bath any more."
Well that's not a problem.
"I said to him yesterday  wash all your important little places and I'll do the rest, you know."
"So when I got there this morning he was  still in his pyjamas he'd got on quite well, all he wanted me to do was wash his face."
Would you like another drink?
Would you like some more
Er
drink?
he wasn't too bad but he's
"No , I'm alright."
"still, he can't say anything, the pain's there all the time."
"No, they're alright Bill."
But with a bit of luck we'll know tomorrow.
We're all okay here.

"So I sa have, so I told him what he said, and he said  well that's exactly what it says in the book!"
"I said yes, well why don't you do it?"

It has to for it to be  festering at the bottom!
But erm
Good grief man!
Good Lord Ken!
You've gone to town tonight seeing all this!
Yeah.
Ooh I put loads of weight on out there.
"And then you've got all the outskirts around that, you know?"
"Cos you're talking about thirty, forty mile."
I'm supposed to be trying to watch me weight now.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's massive.
"I've er, I've lost about a stone in  a couple of months or so, that's all, but it's er  better than gaining I suppose."
Back to where I started I think.
"Unless you've got two pictures of that same street, no"
"No, you're back to where you started."
This is
Rocetta Clive.
Mm.
Funny little place.
Ah.
Right Rocetta Now where's this?
"Oh this is the palace  this is the, the  Monte Casino This is where"
It's the abbey
The abbey at Monte Casino Do you remember
Oh I've heard about the abbey  yeah.

You know where it all got bombed
Yeah.
and what they took all the treasures down into the  cellars so they were saved and they rebuilt it.
"In the same style as it was years ago, using some of their old bricks and everything that they could but  it's been"
Yeah.
rebuilt in the same style and all the treasures are still there.
"Yeah it's amazing, all these"
I've seen the film of this where they're trying to g and all around from outside you can see the graves  the graveyard.

What's that?
My .
You bought it?
Yeah.
More money than sense.
Wonder what he looks like now?
How old was he there?
"Nineteen sixty eight, so that's  twenty three years ago."
He was only twenty three then I should think.
Let us have a bit of the paper.
Listen to this.
Absent minded spinsters Beryl and Doris  lost their car in a repair shop .
Yeah I know!
I read that.
The sisters are eighty and eighty one reported the mini stolen
And bought another one.
got the  er three months later they received thirteen hundred pound pay off from insurance Commercial Union and promptly bought a replacement car.
"But when they booked their new car into Tristar Motors for its first service, they found their old model waiting for them ."
"That is  dreadful garage that didn't phone to find out why they hadn't picked it up though, isn't it?"
I'd have thought
Unless they lost their address.
Hee hee hee hee.
I mean the fact that this come  out is that the
That was in the Mail  That was in the Mail.
Yeah but the fact it's come out is that they've been honest.
Isn't it?
Yeah.
Why?
What are we talking about?
Mum what's Hamlet about?
Pardon?
What's Hamlet about?
Hamlet?
Yes.
"I don't know much about Shakespeare, the only play I've seen is Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream."
to er see Rome and Juliet.
Mm.
And I think I need to make it up.
When is
I dunno.
Well you better find out then.
What do ya mean I alw I'm only saying it cos I got
Well no if you can go.
You give me the money for it?
If it's within reason as I assume it will be.
Five Pounds.
That's okay.
W would it make much difference for you lending me the money.
Not a lot.
Well there's a quite a bit of difference between five and fifty isn't there  and the one thing is for your educational needs and the other I'm so convinced about.
Well
Yeah.
I thought a computer
"No, but I know that you're dying to have a computer, and if money was no object, then we probably wouldn't hesitate in lending it to you, but really and truly at this moment things are  tight and we can't afford to commit ourselves with things  unless it's absolutely necessary."
Well
"And that's it, I mean I've made it as plain as I can."
That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging.
I won't go and see Romeo and Juliet.
It is.
"And it's covered in a, in a  po polythene would you say?"
Plastic  or what it is covered?
Cloth.
Cos you couldn't put that by the fire.
Yeah.
It would melt.
It's a cloth cover on it.
But I bet it's plastic inside it.
It's like these cushions isn't it?
It's foam.
Yes.
Foam.
But why was it so damp and cold here then?
Because it's wet and it's damp.
Well plastic doesn't hold the damp.
"It isn't plastic, it's foam!"
"Well the foam, it doesn't"
"Oh god, yes."
Well you couldn't put them in the car could you?
What?
The mattresses.
Mm?
Well I've put the big one in but I know that the rest wouldn't go in.
Mm.
But then the little bedroom wasn't so  didn't seem so damp.
"But you didn't try it did you, really?"
"In that caravan  a caravan's a caravan, call it what you like  but in that caravan that Mark is in  there was that little  room where the w hot water heater is"
Mm.
and there was a hole er on the floor over there with a grating on it that was  you could see through to the ground.
Mm.
"Well if  through the winter months  when there's no fire in there, no nothing in there  the damp is bound to be coming through there."
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then you see you come along  where you're pushing them to live on their own and you  make suggestions.
That's right yeah.
And erm I went to a place in  and that's what I wanted to do.
But you see they ain't got no places here.
No.
Erm and it's a shame.
I mean Mencap are all men
It is really isn't it?
I mean there's there's more people now
When you've got so much to offer.
Yeah.
"There's more people like that nowadays isn't there, than?"
Mm.
I think there's gonna be more and more.
Because at one time th I mean you never saw them because they were pushed away in in these
That's right.
great big hospitals and forgotten about.
Whereas now
That's right.
th they're coming out into community so you're seeing more of them.
Oh yeah.
And th th there's more but I mean  the facilities for them is there?
Well you see and I've also put in for a job  for the the marina at Northampton which is another mental home.
But that's for a mobility assistant where  I go in and befriend somebody and they employ me to take them somewhere for two hours.
Whether it be
Yeah.
pictures or  shopping or round the market or just for a walk or  for a meal.
Whatever you  they employ
Yeah.
Mm.
His wife's really slow now.
Yeah.
She hangs on to his arm and
But they used to come into the shop.
"Oh yes, yes."
"They use to have a, is it a ."
"She's a sweetie, she's always got a soft looking smile on her face, he's always smiling too please him"
Oh excuse me.
"Yes, he's worried were"
"Not a lot on tonight, there's only a very  apparently dropped."
Really.
"So,."
Well anything else is a let down.
Take .
Want to get a comedy or a thriller or a drama .
"I don't know ,."
Dances with Wolves is coming out on video now.
"Ooh, do you think?"
"Well, it's going to be released on the twenty seventh ."
I'd love to see that .
.
It's a shame cos if they sold the video .
"Well I may not, I may not find it as good, don't, they always show you clips as trailers of the best bit's."
I think it's .
But if it's got anything about
.
"if they've got the American Indian culture in it then it will fascinate me, yeah ."
"I think it has, it's  , it's got a lot of ."
"It's basically a love story between him and a, see he's a, he's a cowboy officer, and she, she's a Indian Squaw obviously, they fall in love and they all this sort of vote of comment on ."
"Yes, yes."
"But there is a lot of erm, obviously the , the Indian ways and so on."
a vehicle from anybody else cos I think he's messed
That's right
everybody up there!
I tell you  I think he owe  a lot of money.
But can you   him?
Well we've got a tenner to go have we?
"but I ain't had chance to say to you, but I was saying to  cos when I called in and see   you think about it  he"
He was desperate to get there  desperate!
Absolutely
Yeah.
desperate!
Now he's never ever offered to pay that fifty odd quid.
Not till today.
"Yes so   and I reckon  quite frankly cos he's living on that lay by up the end  and I reckon he was hiding, do a runner or something or he ain't up to something no good!"
Well he weren't gonna have my vehicle.
He's such a devious little tyke!
Yeah.
I even got Ken to try it on us.
Did you read them that couple in there?
He had what?
"He had Ken over by the allotments, when he used to stay in the car"
for a couple of weeks rent.
"And he went out to pay,first place."
Yeah.
That's how he was in the first place though.
So the young  he was
Jonathan!
he really had me !
Why don't you sit on the pouffe and let grandma sit there.
Yeah I'm alright.
There's a place there!
No  I'm alright !
"How's , how's your eye."
"Keep still a minute, let's have a look, come here, Sam, Sam"
"Hey, Sam, Sam , come here."
Keep your head still a minute we want to look at your nutter.
It looks much better doesn't it?
Getting your fur fur back.
"That's right, you see to him, go on you see to him, you see to him,."
"Trouble is Rocky, Rocky's knackered from his walk and so is ."
", hello Davy ."
"That's great , Rocky, Rocky's panting a bit, seems a bit tired but Sam's all fresh."
"He has, he hasn't been very active actually"
There is an unfair advantage here
He was looking
"sleeping in the car today, that's what it is he's just woken up."
Cos I looked  .
He's been asleep in the car .
"didn't get a bite on any of them, not even a take, crabs"
oh the fish are about down there
Where?
can you see?
Seagulls are out there
They're not gonna catch any big ones are they?
"Nothing noticeable, it's normally a good sign though"
put some speed on
you are  oh speed is ninety around here
What?
Speed limit's ninety around here
Seventy
"Yeah, but we always go eighty, they always allow you to go ten"
what is she doing?
Pulling over to the right lane to turn right down the Royston Bypass
"What a prat, she should of been further al further along"
The whole team fades at the moment.
"I, I, that's what I would do."
"I'd drop Mortimer now and er  keep, I wouldn't, I'd  keep McGoldrick up  don't have him as a sweeper."
I mean if you're gonna have McGoldrick as a sweeper then you'd have to bring Mortimer back but
Why not
I noticed it was quite odd that he didn't use McGoldrick as a sweeper did he?
"I mean we, we went out to win that game didn't we, again?"
"Well, don't you think?"
Yeah.
We didn't play a  and yet the defence played well enough.
So I think drop Mortimer and bring Colimore in for a full  ninety minutes and then and and again and again and again.
Get sort of like  half a dozen games.
I think drop Bright  Colimore.
Well.
"I mean Bright, I mean"
"Well yes, you could say, yes"
"you've got, you've got an excuse to drop Bright."
Bright's tired.
You could say Bright is absolutely tired.
He looks tired at the moment.
Just drop Bright .
There's no need to drop Mortimer.
Not when he's playing well.
Mm yes.
"Well he, he didn't play well in the second half though did he?"
I don't think.
He sort of
"Give me a player that did, outside"
"Yes, well, yes."
Coleman and Southgate.
"Well it  it was one of the, I mean when you saw"
"Oh look, that's where Fergie made those funny faces."
There's only us who never moved.
Oh yeah.
Angie  how long's me mother been in there.
"I'm forty-eight this year, me mum must have been in there nearly fifty year."
And we've only moved into here.
"In actual fact your Pete and Margaret have moved more, in the twelve years that they were married, I know they've been married longer now, but when,th they been married twelve years and they moved four times,"
Yeah.
"we've been married twelve years, and we've moved three times, so we haven't moved as much as them, really."
No.
No.
I couldn't keep moving and
I couldn't move like that.
"I mean, a couple of moves, is fair enough, yeah, but bloody twelve."
No.
"And it's not as if they made money every time they moved, 'cos they haven't, 'cos they lost money on that 'ouse, there."
Yes.
I  won't it.
"Well, Chris said they moved because er,"
Give up.
"er, transport, you know."
"It would be difficult for 'er to get back'ards and for'ards, and she were on her own all the time."
Yeah.
That's why they moved.
"But they moved down, they moved from 'ere because he says, er,"
"Too noisy, weren't it."
Too too noisy and dogs were keeping them up all night.
Oh.
So I don't what the excuse is for moving from   Road.
"Same thing, 'cos it's noisy down there."
Yeah.
"I could scare you, Auntie June."
Could ya.
"Right, yeah."
I'm always worried that his enthusiasm is stretched to the limit
"No, no I mean the number of pe ."
I've just passed my A levels I've got loads of papers  going what can I do.
"Well I said, ring Birchanger scouts!"
And as far as I know he always .
I mean the address is on there  anyway.
"Yeah, oh right."
Is it?
Oh.
er
quite  pertinent actually if we are actually going to do one.
What?
"To ask people  sorry in my, in the letter"
Yeah.
"to the press, ask  people to er  submit any information."
Yeah.
"Oh what you mean you're gonna put at the bottom  of the of, the same letter or"
"Well, yes."
Yeah.
just write down all the information we've got now so there is  can recycling at the swimming pool and at Tesco privately run.
Swimming pool
Erm  swimming pool
who's going to get the information who runs that?
Who?
Mm?
Well I can do that I suppose.
Well who runs what?
The swimming pool
Because I know the scouts do the Tesco one and whenever they are put in these cardboard boxes they have to be sorted so somebody must sort them.
"Oh they're not, they're not asking  sorting, oh I see."
"Erm  so there must be somebody responsible and I think if, if we write swimming pool and people take their cans there"
but when he gets
"It's not like that, no!"
"What they thought is because he's assessing them and she's, they're assessing us while he's assessing them."
If you know what I mean?
Alright!
"Now, they thought it was only gonna be two because there's only two assessing people, right?"
Yeah.
"But it turned out to be three and she was put in this  an awkward position and she doesn't know what to do, the poor girl who got picked!"
Mm.
"They a they'll have the other two, they got told in advance  but this one, she never."
And  that's all that happened.
"But she says you do,sh that you do get told."

He said yes.
"So I shouldn't be surprised, they're both retired  and, and er   pension."
"She said they've had  they've had a couple of days out here trekking, trying to catch people!"

Cos he said  somebody's got to bring them down!
Mm.
"And he said, we're disgusted with our caravan!"
Yes.
"Well of course, that might be a private !"
Well that's what I would say about this  if this was new I wouldn't let people go in!
"Theirs might be a private caravan on the site, and le , like Jackie's."
And letting it as private.
"See, Jackie won't let anybody in her caravan."
But she said  they've let it to people and they've just wrecked the inside of it!
Everything she said!
It's a total mess!
"And it's a brand new last July we've had it, she said!"
Mm.
And it's filthy !
Yeah.

So we talked to him but erm we didn't actually see Mrs  until about a quarter to eleven.
"And she said you know, on no account must he strain."
Obviously he's got dissolving stitches in.
On his insides.
And she said there was so little muscle  left.
It had been so stretched and strained by .
But she had to do the best she could .
Peter will .
And of course Audrey's not too quick on her feet you see since she broke her hip.
So I was trying to  help Audrey and that and help Herbie.
So Herbie didn't try and jump in the car before I could lift him and trying to get Audrey in with her stiff leg.
And then get the rug across her .
She didn't turn a hair when   she said two hundred and ninety three pounds.
I suppose it's like anything.
You get an estimate for it.
Well it's cheaper than  I suppose.
Parts and labour  .
Parts and labour.
Eh?
Does it come with a three month guarantee?
Cheaper than princess  princess Margaret or .
No Mrs  said she was very lucky.
She'd been to three lectures .
One of the topmost veterinary surgeons in Europe.
Yeah.
And that's why Mrs  asked her to do it.
She'd actually seen it done.
Seen slides and been to lectures on it.

I'm not sure.
"You should really do it like a, like make a little folder thing up and then date it Monday, you know"
Yeah.
"If you do it for when you've actually left home , when you, when you've actual left at twenty past seven  no"

.
"How quick can you get to the surface, must be strong ,, two, three  riding down to the  and you're gonna push it out the way, it's like, it's like the tide, it comes in and then goes back out,."

"Aye it was sti , yes it was still going when I came up here."
Mhm
Aha.
"Was it Mrs , from  took it ?"
And were there men went to the country dancing as well?
"Oh yes , oh yes, aye."
Not so many men as went ladies but er
Do you think
there was a lot of men.
"the rise of the Country Dancing Clubs was maybe be to kind of try and compensate in a way for the dances themselves going down, ordinary dances, folk were wanting to do the Scottish dancing and things?"
It could have been but you found
"you found at the Country Dancing, it was different people that was at the Country Dancing than what than what it was at the  more at the the ordinary dances."
Folk that maybe would have been shy to go to a
Mhm.
a big dance?
Yes er maybe but
would come to the country dancing.
Or some of the older folk maybe that
"Folk, I think yes, it was more, mhm."
Right.
But you get country dancing that's very energetic really.
Yes.
"We've got twelve people coming, right?"
Er yep  what's that gotta do with anything?
Well cos I'm gonna have  pairs  I think here
And one you!
Oh  singles then?
It's more
No
fun in pairs isn't it cos the people can have the scraggle and talk to each other.
You'll have to have pairs and put one three.
Chips.
Well that's not fair then.
Put Michael with
Oh yeah
"if you put Michael with two other people, it's completely fair."
But then your implying something aren't you.
"Why don't you say if you're a child  you can go in a group of three, if your adults you'll have to be in a group of two, so the children can attach themselves to any group."
Right.
Right.
You've got eleven people you need four groups  you don't have four groups it's not worth doing is it?
"Gotta share it all out perfect even  why don't you say, stick it on the wall, give them each a piece of paper and they've gotta do it  I've got an idea, you can compile a quiz"
Fine I'm
and then you could have a treasure hunt for the children
you know
Couldn't I.
Most amusing
Are you gonna sort of read out the question and they each gonna scribble down their answer.
Nope.
What you gonna do?
"No, just leave"
Have a chart.
your father!
What?
What's that one?
That's what my brother's son did to his father.
bloody having them then is he?
"I paid fi fifteen bleeding quid for that  and I sai cos this year, I didn't know he'd done this  cos he sits it like that"
Mm.
or clips it like that and you can't tell
Mm.
"anyway he give it to his father and, well I'd already bought the other one I'd"
Mm
cos I says if he looks after it I'll buy him one with radio on as well
Yeah.
so  I just paid that one  with radio.
"But I wish he'd stop nicking my bleeding torch, he's getting a swine for that."
"I only got it back, you know when I got it back?"
When he moved out.
No when batteries are dead.
Oh.
I get all me torches back when battery's dead.
"I got one with a big chunky battery, it should've lasted about six month to a year"
Yeah.
"a right good'un it were, our Arthur give me torch and I had to buy a battery, I paid about three pound odd for this battery"
Tell you what I bet he had it under the blankets  reading his books.
He did.
You've got it.
Exactly.
I wondered what that was?
It's something clanging round in your washing machine.
It'll be zip on his erm  tracksuit.
"I found jacket, did I tell you?"
No.
I got jacket and bottom.
And some underwear.
Cleaned out his dinner bowl and  eat more biscuits.
Foxes you after is it?
"Good lad, good lad, good lad."
Hurry up.
Good boy  good boy  good boy.
I'll have to try that.
You looking at your favourite tree again?
"Gorgeous isn't it?, beautiful tree."
Strange how the lebanon should be cover with them isn't it?
"Chance of bright spells this afternoon, getting horrendously murky."
.
"Oh look over there, it's, it's"
.
"black, except for the occasional, little topping of gold."
"Yeah,is it?"
"Try and get one of these gadgets, and see if we can er get the nightingales next week."
There's
"I don't suppose the radio part of this is put in then,."
"I'm not messing with it, just  recording playing back."
.
"Not that I like walking around with music blasting anyway, I'd rather listen to the birds."
"Mm  oh, I'm warm now after that walk."
Good.
.
"No sign of Sam, ah here he comes, hold on then, the dogs gonna have a talk."
"Your friend's coming, your friend's coming, your friend's coming, look, look who's that, who's that, who is it?"
"Who's down there, who is it, who is it, who is it?."
"Hello Sam, hello, hello, hello, hello."
He don't know who to say hello to.
Hello Sam.
He don't know who to say hello to  you or me or what .
"Three of us  he's gonna have a widdle, that'll sort all the problems out, hello."
Yeah but well you look that  that jaguar  four litres!
. Four litre car!
Yeah but what are you gonna do with four litres?
I dunno.
Well quite.
It does about  eighteen miles to the gallon.
How many miles do we do to the gallon?
I hope we do something like thirty six.
Thirty six!
Don't think it's much more than that.
"How can his, well  if ours is one point six  there's three times"
No it doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work like that?
No.
So what  how long will it take him to get eighty miles filling up every ?
Well I mean do they have huge tanks?
"I mean they take  if you, if you filled up you could put I think it's about twenty six gallons in that car."
And how many can we put in?
Nine?
Eleven?
Cor.
Eleven.
"It was eight, nine."
I think this might take eleven.
So how much do they spend if they filled it ?
"Don't forget if you've got all that weight, you've got that you're gonna lose even more petrol."
"So if you filled that up, how much would that cost them?"
"Well, twenty six  I think it's something like  isn't it something like two pounds a gallon now?"
"You don't, they do it all by litres now so it's really hard"
About fifty P?
"About fifty, fifty pounds?"
Fifty pounds to fill up!
", but he died soon after that but he'd realised that he'd worked hard all his life"
Mm.
you know
Yes.
really worked hard
Yes.
"and at the end of it, see you always think that you're going on don't you?"
"Mm, mm."
and you think oh well I'll get my prize at the end.
Mm.
Mm.
"But, but, you don't know whether or not."
You never think this is my last day .
"No, it can be can't it?"
". Go and enjoy every, every minute of it."
"Yeah, every days a bonus."
"Yeah, get, get the best out of it anyway ."
"Yeah, you're quite right, or he's quite right."
You don't have to worry too much about money do you really so long as you can manage with it.
"Ha Harry, Harry Secombe is said after his heart attack there's no pocket in the shroud."
No.
"Well he's right, there are no pocket's in a shroud and he's seemed much happier since."
"Yeah, oh yeah."
It's a shame with .
"That's what annoys me with erm these big company's you know, opening on Sunday's really, because er, you can only get the money, I mean they've only got a certain amount"
Yeah.
"I mean if they could open nine days a week, they couldn't get any more money out of me because"
"No, you haven't got it."
No.
No.
"They're, they're ,"
"No, me neither ."
"There's the German graveyard, the Italian  the, the erm British and Canadian"
"No, the German one's not there."
The German one is not round Monte Casino
I thought it was.
It's further out.
W way out.
And it's only a small one.
Oh I thought it was.
I want a tissue.
handbag.
"Can you pass me my handbag, Marje please."
Oh dear me.
Derek said he might come up tonight.
"Yeah we saw Jenny down town yesterday, she said they were coming up tonight."
"Ooh, can't stand this."
"How, how high up were you there Tone?"
Could you also  for your passports just note the following information.
"Country of issue, whether it's a five or ten year passport  expiry date and your passport numbers."
"Again we can, we use that information when we go through various customs and border points."
If  if we can give the lists in it just makes it easier.
So if I could ask you just to complete that.
forms?
Yes
"Er there's some more over here, they're on their way round."
"Right, has everybody  got one now?"
Are there any spare green forms anywhere?
Here.
Thank you.
"Can you, if you can let, simply let me have those in at the end of the session or if you can give them to Eleanor at the end of the session."
Right.
Okay wh what er I'll give you time to fill that in at the end.
How am I gonna get them in the van?
What van?
"In, back into the caravan."
On me own.
Oh.
"It's a double mattress, a double bedded mattress."
I can't bloody lift that.
So the only thing that I would suggest is to
Well still Mark will be  there.
Or he could come down with you on Saturday?
Or Sally maybe would be able to come down with you Saturday and help you?
Unless we went over the same day that Susan went over.
And kept the mattresses till Susan goes.
But the understanding is  that like Mark has got the caravan this week.
Mm.
"But if they had a booking to go into it, Mark's gotta get out."
Oh well he could ring you up and you could take them back down but at least they would be dried.
Cos if anybody  who could they come on if they caught cold and and
Well I dunno.
You or him?
I dunno.
It's like fighting a losing battle isn't it?
If someone else
I wouldn't worry at all.
I wouldn't hesitate.
It's an embarrassment for people to come in and catch cold and think it's your mattresses that's done it.
Mm.
"If those men were not working on the gas I would go over there now, and I'd switch the fire and I'd leave it on."
Mm.
Yes.
The thing is old Mark is there to see to it.
Mark won't be there to see to it?
Friday the thirteenth.
What a day to buy a motorbike.
"See the value of the bike came down, the value of the insurance came down cos I put the value at twelve hundred pounds."
See erm there was a ten percent discount if you had it erm  under twelve hundred and fifty pounds.
Yeah.
So in some ways it's cheaper insurance but in others  it's erm  a bit of a sting.
Have you done?
Come on.
Oy.
See that machine there?
What does it do?
It hides behind mother so that Brian can't get at it.
No.
This plates go in this way.
Well I'm not allowed to use this machine so er
Knives and forks should go in  that way.
Right?
Why that way?
There are glass plates   somewhere.
Have you made any tea Mary?
No.
No.
Do you want some tea?
I want to get into the habit of finishing  and getting the dishwasher on and ge cleaning the kitchen completely.
I told him to ring  I told him ring Apex up in case they were recruiting.
Because there are jobs up on the notice board.
But he said Apex  didn't know anything about it at the moment.
"So I mean, if Apex don't know anything about it I don't know why they don't ."
Now you know I don't get on with plastic.
Oh I got it first time.
I got it first time.
Oh god.
"oh right, oh I didn't realize, there were just two parcels on the erm"
Yeah look
"on the thing and, and I picked them both up"
you see.
I thought they were both for me.
Oh dear.
Ah!
Oh well erm
Yeah I didn't fancy
let's see
going up to the senile
No I don't I don't blame you.
Erm
I sort of started to feel a bit ill before so
Yeah.
Well do er do come in er  well did you have a pleasant trip down?
"Erm yeah it was okay, it wasn't too bad."
Mm.
Alright  cos I think we've been sent these on approval to see if we want to adopt them for course material
Yeah.
you see so erm
They seem quite nice.
Yeah.
"Erm well I, I don't know quite what erm they'll be teaching you out of in your er abnormal course but erm er I do find the, the  the sort of current generation of American textbooks quite erm"
Mm.
"quite a nice, quite exciting erm I tell you what, swivel that swivel chair round and, and sit on that"
Okay.
Do you have a drink please or
Yes of course.
Now erm what sort of flavours appeal?
"Now we've got ordinary tea, we've got herbal tea, we've got coffee out of a coffee machine, we've got Lapsang Souchong, we've got ordinary tea  I've mentioned that already haven't I?"
Erm
Cos a lot of stuff isn't in.
They could be put a manager in and   the benefits.
I suppose they would.
Mm.
Perhaps they do.
And then there's staff there to run it.
I dunno.
"Well the man with the bike, that's his business."
"And the ma and the people then with clothes last year, who were they now?"
To the shop?
Was M was Mark's caravan warm?
"Well he didn't have a fire on, nothing."
He was just lying there watching telly and reading the paper and
Did he have a paper?
Mm.
"Should have brought it back, did you?"
No.
He bought the Saturday one that's got the week  part in it.
Why didn't he come over and fetch the car then?
"Because he said there's no point, I don't want it."
"Well I've got to take his over now, he'll have to bring me back."
Yeah.
"What I was going to tell him, if he was to come over, take my car there  when I'd have taken this car over, I would have had a car to come back."
Well that's what he said.
He said you'd better keep the car there in case his won't be ready or something.
Mm.
Lot of kids about though.
In another couple of weeks  spring then.
Would if the weather would take up.
But still they book regardless of weather don't they?
Mm.
Mm.
And she said well it does take a time for the vans to dry out.
Mm.
Not until the sun comes hot and heavy on it.
"So whoever goes there, to anybody's van, that's what they're getting."
"Oh well, I should take advantage now Mark is in, bring the damn things from there."
Then you can get him to help you take them back on Friday.
I think we'd have to ring them up and let them know what we're doing.
Well go in office and tell them.
You can talk  personally better than on the phone.
Cos they are your mattresses aren't they?
When you take them back they're there for their inspection.
Unless you  you  take electric blanket down?
"Put it on, oh  You can't put that on a damp bed can you?"
Not really.
Don't think so.
Not
Well they are protected.
What?
Er er electric blankets.
Don't know.
"They're built er pretty, pretty good that way I think."
I don't know what about the lags for the wall
"And another thing, I didn't even look in Mark's room."
Was there pillows and blankets and quilts in his  caravan?
I didn't look.
Well perhaps Sally had a hunt
Dunno.
Oh well   Well I dunno I think I'll go and wash me hair.
It's desperate for it.
I've gotta have a bath in the morning.
tomorrow.
Is it?
Have we got any in ?
Mm.
No.
No I didn't think we had.
"No, I don't think so."
Sorry?
Do you own your
No!
Do you?
We we have acquired a large chunk of the the  yes.
"So you should, you should nominate that as a"
site of the interest shouldn't you?
Erm  it's valuable but not that valuable.
"But it says here, written written to Linda Chalker about the I T P O."
"Now I, I rang, I sent a postcard  which was ready written."
Do you think that counts?
Promoted the .
Well we did try.
"Yeah, put that we did do that."
Didn't get very far though did we?
Actually that seems to have fizzled out.
Haven't heard anything about that for a while.
Erm  written to the government in U K  bank about the bank propose new foreign  policy.
I think we might have done that.
I think we might have done that.
I know that I've written to British gas.
And I think I wrote  world bank.
"That was, thing is that was quite a long time ago."

"No I can't cos I, I can't screw it in there, that's sitting there look see, see that, that"
"in there look, if I can get that out I'll be able to"

"Oh yeah, they colonised all these places but  it makes you wonder, you know, you see all this unemployment  and of course this John Major's in his  answer now is ooh well it's the same everywhe , it's not, not here, it's everywhere!"
They don't say why?
Well it is.
"Yeah, but why?"
But
Oh but I mean  that is not
"the concern, and that is not the question,i the question is what are you going to do about it in our country?"
What are
Exactly!
you
Mm.
Exactly!
But I mean the  have an excuse don't they?
Well that's  that's it  you know that er  it's an excuse.
"I mean, it's a convenient excuse, that is"
Course it is!
that .
I mean  I was reading in the paper the other day  it was on about recycling
"Yes, just a  please."
And the different counties
Say stop!
and the way they've approached it and some
Yep.
"of the more progressive ones, you know they've er  addressed the problem of  rubbish and  recycling wo erm  one spokesperson for  somewhere like Milton Keynes, I think it was  said there's  you know, there's no money to made out of ri , recycling"
No.
and yet he said
Not at the moment.
that they would save  erm  on the erm actual tipping of rubbish
How isn't there any money
because
"But she said they tell you that and she said they tell you, it's on computer she said, but animals do go in the vans."
"Well I can tell you one thing, animals will not go into ours."
And I tell you she's got a different contract with me altogether.
"You read our contract didn't you, last night?"
It's there in black and white.
"Mm I know, that's what she said."
I don't how she knows.
"If I, if if I found out there was animals in our caravan, I'd take them to town."
But how do you know if you're not there every second?
"You  you for one, like her, when you went to the caravan, you'd smell it like that."
Oh I .
But you'd smell it wouldn't you?
Mm.
And they know this.
"Cos there are dogs there, great big ones."
Yeah.
Mm big white ones.
"That   that man yesterday, he paid six thousand pound for his caravan."
He s he said that on the tape.
Mhm.
I listened to the tape with her last night.
He paid six thousand pound.
We paid fourteen thousand seven hundred for ours.
Mm.
"He hasn't got, ours is a gold golden olympic."
He's not having the rent we're having.
No.
He's got a .
He hasn't got a brand new caravan.
But he nearly gave six thousand pound for it.
That's what they said though.
Yeah I know.
Probably doesn't matter does it?
No I would have thought
The other thing might be to ring up  Borough Council  cos they've got offices in Caernarvon.
"Suppose that  that place  they might, there might be a er a parish hall there or something"
That pub would be alright wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"Okay, or"
"That would be twenty five pound a day as well, or fifty pound a day as well ."
Anyway it's a thought.
I mean if we have to
er obviously what you're saying with  it's already in use and we can't have it?
Yeah.
It's not erm  it's no good just saying oh we can have three days out of the week anyway.
No.
"You know, it's gotta be Monday to Friday or none at all hasn't it?"
Mm.
Well if it was four days it would be alright but
Mm.
anyway
Okay so they're a few options to try as regards the coding
Alright and if we can't find anyway where we'll have to   out and come back here.
Yeah.
problem as well.
"I think we, we should find somewhere."
Yeah.
Really.
Erm so that's a few options as regards the coding.
Now
Right
The interviewing  and the briefing session I think we'll probably get away with in  Debbie  's
"Yeah we're not going to, I mean we're only going to  we're, we're"
Well it's not a sort of formal interview
Oh Sari .
Yes I spoke to her .
"Yes, she's definitely going isn't she?"
"Mm, mm."
"Any, anybody else."
Anybody else thinking of going?
Any other offers?
"Cos, cos you're going by car are you or?"
"I'll, I'll drive yeah, so there are three seats spare in my car, vehicle."
So that you  Plymouth .
"Instead of writing a check, send the cheque ."
If you can stand the strain of the noise and diesel engine all that way.
.
All the girls in the back.
"You can get there, you can get there, perhaps, if you can get there"
I've got a seat in the back mate.
"You can get there on motorway, erm, all the way practically, can't you?"
.
Mm.
You can get there on motorway all the way.
"I ha I haven't looked at the round there, yeah, I'm, I'm sure it's not too bad really, you know, you know ."
M four .
Right is there anybody else cos we have got forms haven't we?.
.
"It's not that long if that's the case then, er, not that long a journey either."
No.
It's motorway all the way.
"Erm, anybody else interested for it, you said not didn't you."
It's not to late to book I think it says something about surcharge after sixth of March or something on the form doesn't it?
We'll make it  .
I don't think she was in  no.
.
It was totally wild
That pool that pool would be really good if it wasn't for the water.
Why what's wrong with the water?
It's shitty.
Ah it's fucking chlorinated to fuck.
Is it?
there'll be dickheads and
I know it's right  but that's a laugh I think.
You just  you just watch them and all and you just
"I thought they were in every pool like, you can m even do it yourself without thinking about it  if you want  some people"
I don't start thinking about it cos I fart under the water
"Well I'd, I,buy your poster"
I   I'm going down south next week and I intend
"Oh Paul we don't wanna hear your problems, buy the poster."
Credit?
"You'll be off work, I'll be off work"
when you get your test.
Aye of course if I get the  test .
"Don't, don't be going fuck mad and taking"
Ah I've no intention of going fuck mad.
You know what happened on Sunday?
"cos there is so many people  get their licence, bang they're out the door, in the car"
Bang
"bash it five minutes down the road, bang  bang"
"on Sunday, Sunday morning I was up"
Was it that guy that crashed before?
Yeah.
"It wasn't his fault this time, I mean, I'm serious, it was, it was not his fault"
I can't believe this .

Well I worked  for the past two year really
"Where, at the ?"
I used to work in Oldham and then then I come over here.
.
So how long have you been at these particular premises?
Er  about a month ago.
Mr  Mr .
"Well no she says, she said er  she said"
it is  responsibility .
"Cos she's just given up her  her er any  er,possibly?"
And er  Miss  do you intend to apply for the transfer of this license?
Yeah.
Has an application been submitted  for that purpose?
Yes.
"To the, which transfer"
Oh!
Er to er
I'm not so sure this applicant knows very much about what's going on here anyway your worship!
"Do you see what I mean, see most of this has been done for the convenience of the Quick Save Supermarkets  on that er, I should say."
Mm.
"Well, practical purposes at this stage sir she maintains insufficient   I've no doubt the licensee will want to know a lot more about  the situation, it's very apparent   it's not long ago that they last ta transferred  to their present holding."
You are aware Miss  that any persons working in that  department have got to be of age?
Mm.
But erm
"You know, we need to find out where to take"
somebody needs to  collect somebody needs to be a contact for getting all the information to  by a certain date.
"Well you can  get it through me, yeah."
Okay.
Tesco do they actually do   now?
No.
Has anybody been there?
No.
Well  they collect aluminium cans.
Oh do they?
"Yeah, that's what I was told."
I acted on what everyone had told me I then asked my friend who had a contact in Tesco's about it she said well there is one.
"It's just inside the doors, where you don't see it."
walk in like that and you're looking at all the things in the shop not where
It's not in the recycling centre.
Why don't they put it in the recycling centre?
"I think it's cos, it looks like it's made out of cardboard."
"It's, it's probably run by the scouts."
They're in charge of it like
"Yeah, cos there's one at the swimming pool isn't there?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
"Does anybody know anything about, there's this little note in  about erm recycling paper, all sorts of paper magazines, cardboard er on the first Monday of the month."
Does anybody know anything about that?
Is this for Boots?
every first Monday of the mo month is the Birchanger scout
scout
and he gave me that information repeatedly and he's terribly involved.
"It, it's fantastic."
And I said
Didn't bother with them.
See they're alright.
"I said then  well I said from the time now, I said  there is nobody I said, can sleep on those mattresses."
"No she said, it does take a while for caravans to dry out."
Well  say what you were saying
So in other words  you don't go to the caravan.
". Let it be their responsibility, they put them in there."
"Well Mark's going in at his own risk, see?"
They sold them to you complete.
So?
So they're yours.
What's the good of a bed  a bed without a mattress?
I'm talking about the mattresses.
What are you talking about?
The caravan!
Well I thought you was talking about mattresses airing in front of the fire.
Well that subject's gone!
Oh well
"I'm saying  that  Park, what the woman said that she went down to check the vans  last summer"
Mm.
end of last summer.
long time since then .
And to see that the salt was there and the mattresses were up and that was great.
And she went down to check in the winter time and she said your van was really dry.
Oh.
Well it all depends how she checked.
perhaps.
Well then they then they went and put the mattresses back  in their places.
Now the mattresses are soaking.
Mm.
And I said there's nobody can go and sleep on those mattresses.
All of it?
"Yeah, don't usually get them for nothing"
"three, four out, half a dozen"
"No tomorrow, I went into town and then I went to Emma's"
Oh did you?
Yeah
Did you have a look at the wallpaper?
"I forgot all about it, when I got to Emma's then I realized, I'm going over"
I don't usually buy that sort anyway but the last couple of
"They've got so much work, those safety ones"
"that's it, yeah"
Cor they dunno
well they would I
oh dear
all depends on the nature of
they won't need
If they thought it was that bad they would of picked it up on the M O T wouldn't they?
"That's what they said, cos I, I said is it something that has to be checked regularly, he said no, it doesn't really go that often"
Yeah
so erm  something
so you'd be paying out for some more tyres if you don't have that checked or anything
Yeah
ain't you?
"So Emma's given me his present to drop round, ha"
How long
she doesn't finish work until about half past five
Oh
and in between time she goes to meet Gordon so er
Oh yeah
"I don't know where they live, I know the court but I don't know whereabouts they are."
No
only where erm Mrs  and that live and that's about it
"And if we if if we ring up, he puts he just puts the phone straight down, soon as you tell him who it is."
Probably goes back from when they went
"He said, I, she said I can live without him anyhow."
"It'll drop off, that."
It won't.
It will.
"Come on,yella."
"I found some Mighty Muscle in garage, you know."
How much.
You know that big round tin.
"I, not how much is in it, but it'll probably be about that much in bottom."
"I know  wanting  to do this room, really, 'cos it would be too cold."
Get away with one.
I wish we'd just  too cold.
"You won't, as far as  we're having to buy coal at that price."
"No, I know."
"Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal."
how much.
You know that big round tin?
Yeah.
"I don't know how much is in it, but probably be about that much in bottom."
"might be  really, couldn't  too cold."
Get away with one.
"I wish we'd afford some  I mean, it's cold."
"You won't  while we're having the buy coal, at that price."
"No, I know."
"Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal."
"We'll probably just buy some, and that lad'll ring up."
He probably will.
Especially if this mild weather stops.
"But it is mild today, ain't it."
Yeah.
Again if I collect more material than I have to use no problem.
Got an item on media watch there did anyone notice that the Green Party was actually mentioned in the Guardian today?
No.
Quite a celebration.

Wow.
First mention I've actually seen in months.

No problem I'm sure.
In future I'll try both to get the dates that are supposed to be in in there and get the copy into my mouth rather than my compatriots.
Okay do we have any other matters arising from the minutes?
Because I do.
I've decided that this isn't any other business at all.
I've got a picture of Hugh.
Have you?
Yeah I've got a picture of Hugh with one end of a decontaminate  poster.
Yeah.
Because er he was down there er trying to dip his nose in the toxic chemicals.

"I mean, our Colin's there waiting for a grant and what's happening."
Sweet nothing.
"Now we're, it were in bloody paper last  on Thursday, they don't get nothing when they're on holiday."
"No, they don't,"

Mm.
"If they have a job, they don't get no grants."
"And how can you have, hold a  a job down"
I don't think
And do education at same time.
"I'm not sure, but  I think I don't got my family allowance until I were eighteen, I think, I think they used to give us"

Oh.
"So I've got a form to fill in, actually."

Sasha

"No, you'll rip it."
"Left home, you know, we are, like, say our Karen to leave home."
Aye.

You'll end up with about a dozen letters on mantel again cos I always forget to post things.
Well I'll post that tomorrow.
Well there's no rush.
"Aye you can, yeah."
"Well usually if there's not a stamp wanted, is there a stamp wanted?"
No.
"Yeah usually if there's no stamp wanted I get one of lasses while I'm at work, they'll drop it off for me."
I always say will you do me a favour and they shove it in box.
Erm  ah

Mm.

Oh.

Mhm.

Did did they know you'd gone home?
Pardon?
Did they know that you went?
No.
No?
"What did your mother say then, was she cross with you?"
"No she said, Oh, she said, What do you want?"
"So I says, I I don't like there I want to go I want to come back."
"So she said, Look here my dear girl, she said, you go back and tell the lady that you"
Do you remember how much they paid you?
Pardon?
well there was a lot of call for that.
Mhm.
"And women worked in that department, whereas the men worked at the huge broadloom"
Mhm.
"looms which are very heavy, very heavy, and through fashion, fashion changing and I mean people don't have these things any more."
A lot of pubs and hotels will do the the their places out in these narrow sections so if one gets worn they can lift it up and
"Mhm, yeah."
replace it.
"But houses, when you're doing a house you, you don't tend to do that now, you just have your broad loom"
Mm.
and fit it in.
So in that relationship
"the d the, the women are redundant as it were."
Yes.
"There only is two, well there are two, one, they do shiftwork."
Mhm.
You have a lot of nicknames in the factory?
"Er  well er the just these two people that retired there, er they used to come  this man in a car from , that was their lift to their work."
And it was the days of the C B
Mhm.
"and he had this handle,a and er they were saying, we'll need to get ourself a handle,"
"ah, I said, well what about the Dolly Sisters?"
"So that stuck and eventually when that place folded and we came over here, er we just called them the Dollies and that was, they were referred to, everybody knew who they were,"
Aha.
the Dollies.
Aha.
"So that, that's a bit of it in there."
Aha.
"So you just basically, you all"
"A and, and"
know each other by your ordinary names?
Mhm.
You don't shout nicknames
Mhm.
"at each other, no?"
"Well not in our department anyway, I don't know, I can't speak for anybody else."
"Aha, right."
Although I've worked in nearly all the departments you don't really get to know the people that well.
Mhm.
"have we missed out anything, is there anything"
I don't know.
you'd like to tell us?
Cos we're novices at this.
Och aye.
I mean er does it bother you at all that  well I mean are most of the men managers?
Managers men?
Er the management
Where's the opportunities for like female apprentices and things like that?
Never seen that.
Well they all have.
It's customary to go to work dressed in black or white or suits or
Not at all.
It's navy blue with flowered blouse they've got.
I've never seen it.
Each bank's different.
Well they've had them for years.
Well in the Midland Bank and they were wearing them the last time you were there.
The electric board wears them.
The gas board wears them.
Woolworths wear them.
Mm.
"And so really it is no different, just that they are making a song about it."
But there's no need to go to that prices.
a name on.
You can have the firm's name and give them a brooch or something.
"Well they've got them anyway, haven't they?"
But  Val was on about it last summer.
They was talking about it then.
But she said that they had been so many months  or when everybody else had a pay rise they only had a little bit.
And the extra that they should have had is going to pay for these uniforms.
Oh.
didn't want the uniforms.
Well a percentage is taken out of your money for them.
There's no doubt about that.
Mm.
"Well that's what she was on about that, and and they was  they were going"
Well everybody has got to do that.
to go on strike because of it.
"And really, it would be a good thing for Val."
Why?
Where?
I have done I've
"Let me see then, round your kneecaps?"
"No I have, I have lost it, I tell you what, now listen"

"I have lost it though, I have"
"There are, don't tip that over the cloth then"
"Alright then, come on then  you know I forgot I didn't have me keys with me this morning, of course the first one"

Oh hang on the ex-directory number's ringing.
That's the boss he'll be complaining.
So there's no chance of getting rid of all these coaches and getting people to walk round the er the guided tours and stuff like that?
Er well that would defeat the whole object of offering the open topped tours if people were actually walking.
Well it would defeat you making a few bob .
There is actually there is actually walking tours around the city for those people who wish to opt for
Mm.
for a walking tour.
So there is the option of doing both the walking tour or the bus tour.
Okay hang on just a minute.
Er Danny?
He's the bo he's what they call the editor of the programme.
Right.
Okay just in case you're wondering who I'm talking t Danny anything else you want me to ask her?

The problem is we're buttoned down on deliveries on standard bearings cos of the balls up about .
Well okay so you've got to talk
.
you've got to talk your way through that.
It's the precision bearings that's really the prize.
I mean that's why .
Yes.
"And and and of course now that er now that we've got the total business beginning to operate as one, the chances of letting them down on standard bearings is very much smaller than it ever was before."
Yeah.
The problem the reason we've let her down on standard bearings is because of this changeover.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
You see it's got nothing to do with the with our
No no.
competence as a supplier.
No.
Yeah okay.
Erm minus infinity.
"So, it's minus infinity or plus infinity."
When X is very large or very very small.
at minus a million.
Erm
What would that approximate to?
A million plus six.
No
"Do you  enter a big competition, and you could win a million pounds plus six."
"Compared to the million pounds nobody bothers much about the six, so"
Just a
"when it gets very large, Y is roughly equal to X squared."
"So if you know the graph of Y equals X squared which unfortunately I can't draw tonight it's  draw it for you, could draw it from the inside  keep telling everyone else."
Right.
"Now, there's a Y equals X squared."
Yeah.
"So around here, round this bit,there won't be any difference."
Hmm.
"Around  six plus six, let's say plus six in there."
"For, for some length, that'll be sort of almost flat, won't it?"
I mean
Mm.
"till we get to X equals a one and it starts making a bit of difference, so it'll probably go like this."
"Okay, so a lot of it, that's a very important, those are sort of very important parts of the graph."
Tend to
Mm.
get neglected.
People say oh I'll take it from minus five to plus five.
Right?
If we had something like Y equals erm X minus ten.
Right.
"Times  X minus erm or times ten minus X  like that, okay."
"Inflammable, ain't it."
"Anyway, er, the bloke who managed to get him insurance, this this, the premises are insured with him,"
Yeah.
"so I thought, well, if he's already got, er, part of his insurance without having"
"Yeah, because he was in, paper, waste paper, and the fire insurance on that must have been colossal."
That's where  cardboard and paper.
Yeah.
"Sasha come in here, shut door."
He's not coming in.
"But er, I can't understand why, because I mean, let's face it,he he's only using fibre-glass and they're not that flammable"
"No, what they're saying is."
"Not the flammable, it's the er indemnity, nobody can breathing it in who's in"
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"They're frightened like, in years to come, like, they're gonna try and make a claim against them 'cos their er, been on the chest, is summat like that."
Yeah.
"I, it's health and safety, yeah."
er.
"Through the health and safety, but."
Eighty four we had this extension put up.
Yeah.
Sasha come in here.
"But, after saying that,"
There's a draught in
"what you gotta do, is make up your mind, what chemicals you're gonna use"
Yeah.
and then find out all about
What ya got?
Don't know.
"them particular chemicals and then submit it to the, the insurance company, what them's the only chemicals you use, and the company said this and that."
they told him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
"because if if you do that, and it begins to erm o occur to her and if she's fairly bright"
Mm she doesn't seem daft yeah.
"She's not clever cos she's  bearings ,"
Erm it it it no
she doesn't seem engineering clever.
No.
But she's not daft.
No but but you're gonna help them.
Yeah yeah.
You're going to your object in life is to help her do the job better.
Right.
And explain to her.
And by sitting down and having a technical and commercial conversation together
Mm.
you can sort of chair that that
Mm.
meeting and help her to understand
how much we're helping them through this  .
and appreciate how much else we can do.
And and okay if we're a pound or two different.
We're forty minutes up the road.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If we can't e e I've had a couple of months of stock on the shelf for 'em.
Yeah.
"In fact I must admit, I hinted to Dave  if if linear will do consignment stock for , why shouldn't we if we're only forty minutes away."
But I mean that's the last thing I wanna do but
Yeah.
"but even then we could have consignment stock here in effect cos they're only forty minutes away, we could throw 'em in the back of the car and have 'em delivered."
"Well that's what we've got we've got consignment stock here, it's on our premises"
Yeah.
They had a working committee didn't they and a sub
It's East Herts isn't it?
I think.
Was it East Herts?
"East Herts, yeah."
Yeah East Herts.
Environmental sub committee?
Yeah.
He sits on it.
"Well he had this environment mental officer, they they in inaugurated him  then at this meeting  meeting when  erm  the thing you handed over"
Charter.
The environment charter.
Why's it a sub committee?
What happened to the  proper committee as well.
Yeah.
reports then back to the proper actual coun the er
The work's  committee
district council meeting.
"Well I know at district  council there was two environmental groups, was it the officers group and the  members group."
Oh.
I wonder which group
Herts county council.
Cos when I was on the Hertfordshire Environmental  of the group which has folded
"I've got all this money in the Abbey National and there's no, no group any more, I think I'll have to keep"
Keep quiet.
I'll have to send it off to .
But anyway it transpired that there were two groups sort of working towards the same end and nobody could work out what sort of erm role each played and it was terrible.
Because you knew that they both had to agree before anything was done.
Oh.
I suppose that was one way of nothing being done.
"Yes, they didn't communicate."
The officers group and the members group that was right.
Let's throw the keys away
I was saying to David this morning there was a  on the police  that was good
probably terribly naive
oh it says something like J R Green a number which doesn't exist and any tradesperson could have the name address type of trade and a real phone number
course they would
yeah
You could change the signs quite regular though couldn't you
Painter and decorator one day and er butcher the  other
Quite easily
"throw, throw some paint over the back and everything  paint running out the back"
Mm yeah
detail like that
Hear that
"rubbish really, not our problem, anybody else want to bring any points up"
No no
"We've got dates for the meeting, I've got two suggestions, one is that I can't see any point anymore why"
here here
and it's  to one
"yeah, here here"
"better headquarters,"
"yeah, where where"
"S thirty one, if we book it in advance we can get in S thirty one downstairs  in the canteen, cos we're only an hour and half, two hours meeting"
yeah
We can be finished by quarter to twelve
"Good idea, any items of agenda for Sergeant , who will be organising the next meeting in S thirty one"
Okay yeah fine twenty eighth of March
Hang on
He's on holiday
bloody right
The meetings
coming for comments like that
There's an S L O's meeting on the twenty eighth of March
Yes.
I'm finding something totally wrong with   and got shot of it  and then things have been
"Well actually he didn't, but he says"
worse  thinking he'd been to solicitors  but I'm trying to track down anybody!
Just trying to get some information.
Apparently  oh my God tha they're that much within the law.
"Yeah, that's what we've been told."
"They must have a legal section cos this is one of the biggest organisations,leisure group in Britain"
Yeah.
for caravans.
"They, they, they,they own"
They're going to clear themselves aren't they?
You clear you!
More than that!
Apparently
They're not going to
"one man told me, he said"
"well if you think you might get some money at the end of the season, he said, you may find that you'll be paying them at the end of the season!"
"I mean, what's the good of it?"
"Yeah, you see!"
Well we may as well have got that money and thrown it down the toilet!
Gone straight in the bin!
Well that's right!
"Straight away this year, you get a list through  now, do you want winter cleaning done, curtains cleaned,"
Yeah.
"carpets cleaned, upholstery cleaned?"
"Or outside valet, do you want the underneath painted with grease and everything?"
I say we did have it done.
By the time you add all that up  if you're not local.
All your profit's gone!
You'll  you will end up paying them!
Yeah.
Now we're gonna be  using acid  very very dilute acid.
Nevertheless we have to take proper precautions.
"So, if you would be so kind as to get into a position where you can see what I'm doing without being too close  it means that if we do splash any acid by accident er the likelihood of it causing any problems to anyone are minimal."
Have you come to  supervise Miss  's class?
As it happens it would seem that most of those children are out on an English trip.
Oh.
Perhaps you would like to go and do your own thing.
Perhaps you'd like to stick around and watch this happening because I remember you subbing once for an etching lesson.
Oh it's an etching lesson is it?
Yes can you remember?
Yes
Yesterday wasn't it?
And you thought well I'd better not
I'm not having them running around .
That's right.
I remember you saying.
So perhaps you'd like to  keep them right
Have a .
and make sure I do it right.
But on the other hand if you
I don't know how to do it .
Oh well I meant from the point of view of .
Safe safety point of view.
Safety
Oh I'll stay for this.
Is that alright?
Mm.
Smashing.
Thank you very much.
This by the way is er Donald who is making sound recordings of  in the school today.
. So  swearing.
Er  right my friends.
No cos I wasn't too sure if it was available  you telling me it is available.
A as I said this morning t to the management team it is available.
The only problem is as a one-off exercise on
er existing jobs.
We will have to put in er a summary of the existing remit.
Including
Right.
all the variations and what not.
"And that's something that Mike  and Ken  will help dig the historical contracts out and, and suggest er a remit."
"Erm b cos, cos he, it prints a remit back out out the client ."
"But it, it, it's ready"
"When, when are we likely to, to have the contract reports available?"
The Q S
the physical works
The physical works.
Yeah.
"We're gonna start specifying that now and Brian will, will er"
Right.
"will start to, to, to work that up."
But of course that can become quite a complex thing depending on how much we want to sort of use it to produce certificates and things like that.
Right.
So that's gonna incorporate the Q S cost report as well as the physical works is it?
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
"A and that's, that's gonna be quite a complex erm"
Right.
thing to specify.
As it's a p it's a pound to a penny
Mm.
"that, what we're doing at the moment, we won't want to b put it all in this system"
Fine.
Alright
erm which is quite  management at
right
erm I suppose one of the er things I'd like to er get out of this would be a bit more
Okay so putting all the  that positive
Yeah sort of ums and ahs
Oh right okay okay so I mean are are you saying that's about confidence?
Is it or  ?
"Well maybe , maybe, maybe thinking ahead too much"
"er right, okay okay so better preparation so that when you make the presentation it's more effective, yeah?"
"Yeah I mean you're trying to think ahead, you're umming and ahing"
So effective preparation
yeah
effective preparation so that you so that when you you stand up here you're more confident you're more
yeah
"Good, do you do you make present any sort of presentations ?"
Well I meet clients quite a bit erm the last one I actually made was last week
Oh really
To Tarmac  financial directors  directors
How do you how do you feel it went?
"It went pretty well actually, the feedback I got from my immediate boss  fairly pleased with it was pleased with it"
Good
Obviously
Right
"yeah, good okay good."
So effective preparation.
Mike.
I'm a senior  with South West I  management course I cover site planning right the way through.
erm been in the game now for something like forty years.
Started as an apprentice and worked my way through to management.
Erm  this course or mainly my presentations are written
Okay
That's fine
your using a name.
Oh no.
He's responsible.
No.
"Because within, within our, within our procedures and our quality systems, the word project engineer crops up quite a lot."
Project team
Yeah.
"But it's, it's not defined as er an M S two or an M S three."
"I mean take the example that Hugh is always using, is that if I wanted to knock a wall through, a hole through that wall and put a door in there with a link in it surely to goodness we"
Right.
don't need an M S two.
If that's
Mm.
"the case then can I suggest that we define within our quality systems, that project engineers will be M S twos or above, for check categories of zero or above, and that for jobs with a category of double zero"
Oh no.
they can't be beneath
"Very, making it very rigid."
Yes.
You see what our policy is M S two except b except by exception.
"For instance erm we would give certainly the better M S ones the smaller jobs to project manage, but that has to be very carefully thought about."
Project engineer.
Project engineer.
That's right.
What happens if everybody wants to
panel view this
Now I would imagine if we had suggested
In broad terms
I would imagine that if we'd suggested that project engineering duties would beco
Could be done at M S one
At M M S one and S T O
Thank you.
And for one reason or another the subcontractor bowled up on site on the Saturday afternoon and decided to do it then.
And he set up his own system of work using wal er er lookouts etcetera using er walkie-talkie radios and
staff exposed themselves to danger by standing in the four-foot.
His staff?
his staff.
Yeah.
There was nobody else's staff around at the time.
"It's likely we will ban the contractor for three months from, at least three months, from doing the work"
Mm.
although h he took a very professional erm attitude in dealing with the inquiry afterwards.
And didn't hide behind erm didn't try to make any excuses.
He said that it had been done wrong.
"He's actually sacked his own foreman, the main contractor cos the main, the foreman turned up on site and this I think is one of the lessons to be learnt, is that foreman turned up on site and saw what was happening"
and didn't stop it.
Mm.
And so condoned what was going on.
Mm.
And it's the major contractor.
Er may as well tell you i it's
So possession had already been arranged?
For the night.
The April the ninth.
For the night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But they did it.
Mm.
Yeah.
"That's the only reason we found out, is our supervisor turned up to take possession, and the contractor's guy said, there's no point, we've done it."
So.
we've actually found it.
Could have been an inquiry into a death.
"Their performance reports, training r reviews, schedule of objectives etcetera."
And that's J two stop zero.
E five stop one.
Contract documents and specifications for works and bridges.
E five stop one.
Sorry.
There is an X on it.
Works bridges and Q and Q S.
Erm there is now a standard pro forma for identifying liquidated damages.
The project engineer to agree with the client what the liquidem liquidated damages ought to be.
And there's a pro forma that goes through to the quantity surveyor's section.
P on it either.
Mhm.
Eh?
yours
Erm
got P on.
No.
Con H five stop two.
Contract variation orders.
"Erm contract variation orders are to be signed by the project engineer, irrespective of value."
Er subject to him of course having the nec necessary financial authority from the project manager or the client.
There are
Mm.
"arrangements in here that if it's in the middle of a possession and the project engineer cannot be contacted, then obviously the resident engineer can sign it."
"Erm but obviously there's er a, a need, the need to advise the project engineer, and the project manager, erm following the possession."
"Can I, can I raise a small point on that?"
That is
Mm.
"a number of my staff have repeatedly asked me the question, what is a project engineer?"
"And I've told them what a B E S one is and they said, why?"
Why are works ones different then?
"Give me a figure, that you might have seen in an advert, when you're drooling over BMWs and things, Maseratis."
Miles per hour.
Telling you about its acceleration.
What does it say?
Goes from nought to sixty.
Good.
In?
Six seconds.
Six seconds.
Nought to sixty in six seconds.
So those are the units of acceleration.
"From one speed to another speed,"
In however qu
"in so, so much time."
"So let let's say, instead of quoting from nought, they said well a much more useful figure is perhaps, which they do quote in lots of these car magazines, is erm forty to sixty"
Mm.
because that's what you need for overtaking someone.
"You can go from forty to sixty in point three seconds or something, you can really shoot past anything on the road."
"So forty to sixty, miles per hour, metres per second, whatever you like, let's say metres per second."
Let's say it goes from  forty to si forty metres per second to sixty metres per second in ten seconds.
"More of a slug, this car."
So what would that acceleration be?
How w what would the units of acceleration be?
Twenty metres per second per second.
"Twenty metres per second, per second."
Per second.
It's simpler to say per second per second .
"It's  Or per second squared, or second to the minus two."
"What is this rubbish, it doesn't, doesn't, cannot possibly mean anything real."
Mm.
"Well, it is real."
It's  erm fifty miles per hour  per hour.
"What I'm looking for, this is part of"
I know
Sorry.
this is part of the
the spirit.
"The reason this came about Dennis, is because some people were, were playing ducks and drakes."
"And the spirit of the exercise is that we will work as a team, and the most cost-effective procedure will exist."
"And in m in many cases the most cost-effective procedure will be for the lad on site, the R E or the assistant R E to measure, and provide the measure to the Q Ss who will put that forward and process that in the way they do now and send out a certificate."
And I don't see anything contentious about that.
Can I take it that if
"I don't, I don't like how it is worded then, because I don't think you said that."
Sorry to
No.
"It, it was worded that way because there are"
It says  the project Q S is responsible for agreeing all site measurements .
That's what it says.
Yes.
He is responsible for that.
He is.
And he may delegate that
He may delegate to
I agree with you  but
and in many cases will delegate that.
He is also responsible for the valuation
He has raised it with the contractor.
It doesn't say that here.
It does.
But there's no .
The letter of delegation normally says that
"It says, normally it says, normally obtaining them personally"
The letter of delegation has always said that Q S will measure
Yeah.
Yeah  the role
but he but it is the day to day d detailed development
of a project to meet the cost specification and timescale defined in the client's remit.
Undertake the requirements of the project quality plan.
"Undertaking all design construction, installation to meet all necessary current standards, statutory requirements,a and the civil engineering design manual er safety manual."
In a broad sense.
Mhm.
Which seems alright.
Yeah.
"L let us then debate, I mean you actually have a load of projects which are maybe two or three thousand pounds apiece"
Mm.
where I presume you would just wanna hand that out to some guy and say get on with it.
And that guy may be an M S one.
"The problem is a lot of those are not being managed properly by the M S ones, M S twos."
Right.
We will
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's debate that then when we get together.
Thanks for raising it Jim.
Fair point.
Have you read what
"It's, it's important that we nail it down very very quickly because the clients' reports depend very much upon the input of the project engineer."
Project engineer.
"The only, the, there is only the project engineer can get into the databases to put anything in, or, or their clerical support, to get anything into the general notes about that particular"
Yeah.
project.
I think we're meeting early next week isn
Yeah.
Tuesday isn't it?
Tuesday
So we'll bottom that Tuesday.
"They'd take a long time to dry wouldn't they, then, on the sticks and that"
stacks of it
"and my father was in the woods before the war and they, he, he looked after the woods and cut the trees down and everything and then they were sent to"
"Oh no, slowly, dried slowly you see"
"Slowly to dry it was always as, as he went up to about a"
"for pupation, yeah"
"I'd like to seen how they did the, the ribbon book out of the heart"
Oh yes
used to do a lot of drawer bottoms out of it
yes
"must of had a knife or something to it, sliced wasn't it?"
"Mind you I'm going, I've got a pub"
"Nice to see there, there was a certain way of cutting the tree"
this is going back
to get the figure into it
"I, a cut"
on the diagonal
Yes
"you see, a diagonal, the"
"raise so you've got a lovely figure in the, on the oak,"
Yeah
but expensive that was
yeah that's right
"cutting waste with it, as I say the ribbon stuff it must it, the georgian furniture you usually see that in"
Yeah
"this wide drawer bottoms you know, beautiful oak that's been sliced"
Yeah
"because that, presumably the heart was easier to cut, I don't know, very hard"
"I wouldn't of thought so, it was"
I wouldn't of thought so
the
I'll have to find out of this
"The Queen ordered him to kneel , and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart ."
"Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of his heart , but for a long time he hesitated , not being certain what it was himself ."
"`` If I chose to go back to mother , '' he asked at last , `` could you give me that wish ? ''"
"Now this question vexed them , for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music , so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said , `` Pooh , ask for a much bigger wish than that . ''"
`` Is that quite a little wish ? ''
he inquired .
"`` As little as this , '' the Queen answered , putting her hands near each other ."
`` What size is a big wish ? ''
he asked .
She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length .
"Then Peter reflected and said , `` Well , then , I think I shall have two little wishes instead of one big one . ''"
"Of course , the fairies had to agree , though his cleverness rather shocked them , and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother , but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her disappointing ."
His second wish he would hold in reserve .
"They tried to dissuade him , and even put obstacles in the way ."
"`` I can give you the power to fly to her house , '' the Queen said , `` but I ca n't open the door for you . ''"
"`` The window I flew out at will be open , '' Peter said confidently ."
`` Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back .
`` How do you know ? ''
"they asked , quite surprised , and , really , Peter could not explain how he knew ."
"`` I just do know , '' he said ."
"So as he persisted in his wish , they had to grant it ."
"The way they gave him power to fly was this : They all tickled him on the shoulder , and soon he felt a funny itching in that part and then up he rose higher and higher and flew away out of the Gardens and over the house-tops ."
"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his old home he skimmed away over St. Paul 's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent 's Park , and by the time he reached his mother 's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird ."
"The window was wide open , just as he knew it would be , and in he fluttered , and there was his mother lying asleep ."
Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her .
"She lay with her head on her hand , and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair ."
"He remembered , though he had long forgotten it , that she always gave her hair a holiday at night ."
How sweet the frills of her night-gown were .
He was very glad she was such a pretty mother .
"But she looked sad , and he knew why she looked sad ."
"One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something , and he knew what it wanted to go round ."
"`` Oh , mother , '' said Peter to himself , `` if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed . ''"
Rilla 's fear lifted .
Dog Monday howled no more and resumed his routine of train meeting and watching .
When five days had passed the Ingleside people began to feel that they might be cheerful again .
"Rilla dashed about the kitchen helping Susan with the breakfast and singing so sweetly and clearly that Cousin Sophia across the road heard her and croaked out to Mrs. Albert , '' ` Sing before eating , cry before sleeping , ' I 've always heard . ''"
But Rilla Blythe shed no tears before the nightfall .
"When her father , his face grey and drawn and old , came to her that afternoon and told her that Walter had been killed in action at Courcelette she crumpled up in a pitiful little heap of merciful unconsciousness in his arms ."
Nor did she waken to her pain for many hours .
"CHAPTER XXIII `` AND SO , GOODNIGHT '' The fierce flame of agony had burned itself out and the grey dust of its ashes was over all the world ."
Rilla 's younger life recovered physically sooner than her mother .
For weeks Mrs. Blythe lay ill from grief and shock .
"Rilla found it was possible to go on with existence , since existence had still to be reckoned with ."
"There was work to be done , for Susan could not do all ."
"For her mother 's sake she had to put on calmness and endurance as a garment in the day ; but night after night she lay in her bed , weeping the bitter rebellious tears of youth until at last tears were all wept out and the little patient ache that was to be in her heart until she died took their place ."
"She clung to Miss Oliver , who knew what to say and what not to say ."
So few people did .
"Kind , well-meaning callers and comforters gave Rilla some terrible moments ."
"`` You 'll get over it in time , '' Mrs. William Reese said , cheerfully ."
"Mrs. Reese had three stalwart sons , not one of whom had gone to the front ."
"`` It 's such a blessing it was Walter who was taken and not Jem , '' said Miss Sarah Clow ."
"`` Walter was a member of the church , and Jem was n't ."
I 've told Mr. Meredith many a time that he should have spoken seriously to Jem about it before he went away . ''
"`` Pore , pore Walter , '' sighed Mrs. Reese ."
"`` Do not you come here calling him poor Walter , '' said Susan indignantly , appearing in the kitchen door , much to the relief of Rilla , who felt that she could endure no more just then ."
`` He was not poor .
He was richer than any of you .
"It is you who stay at home and will not let your sons go who are poor -- poor and naked and mean and small -- pisen poor , and so are your sons , with all their prosperous farms and fat cattle and their souls no bigger than a flea 's -- if as big . ''"
"`` I came here to comfort the afflicted and not to be insulted , '' said Mrs. Reese , taking her departure , unregretted by anyone ."
"Then the fire went out of Susan and she retreated to her kitchen , laid her faithful old head on the table and wept bitterly for a time ."
Then she went to work and ironed Jims 's little rompers .
Rilla scolded her gently for it when she herself came in to do it .
"`` I am not going to have you kill yourself working for any war-baby , '' Susan said obstinately ."
"`` Oh , I wish I could just keep on working all the time , Susan , '' cried poor Rilla ."
"He was a pale , tallowy creature , wanting two fingers of the left hand , and though he wore a cutlass , he did not look much like a fighter ."
"I had always my eye open for seafaring men , with one leg or two , and I remember this one puzzled me ."
"He was not sailorly , and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too ."
"I asked him what was for his service , and he said he would take rum ; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it , he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near ."
"I paused where I was , with my napkin in my hand ."
"`` Come here , sonny , '' says he ."
`` Come nearer here . ''
I took a step nearer .
`` Is this here table for my mate Bill ? ''
he asked with a kind of leer .
"I told him I did not know his mate Bill , and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain ."
"`` Well , '' said he , `` my mate Bill would be called the captain , as like as not ."
"He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him , particularly in drink , has my mate Bill ."
"We 'll put it , for argument like , that your captain has a cut on one cheek -- and we 'll put it , if you like , that that cheek 's the right one ."
"Ah , well !"
I told you .
"Now , is my mate Bill in this here house ? ''"
I told him he was out walking .
"`` Which way , sonny ?"
Which way is he gone ? ''
"And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return , and how soon , and answered a few other questions , `` Ah , '' said he , `` this 'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill . ''"
"The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant , and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken , even supposing he meant what he said ."
"But it was no affair of mine , I thought ; and besides , it was difficult to know what to do ."
"The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door , peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse ."
"Once I stepped out myself into the road , but he immediately called me back , and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy , a most horrible change came over his tallowy face , and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump ."
"As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner , half fawning , half sneering , patted me on the shoulder , told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me ."
"`` I have a son of my own , '' said he , `` as like you as two blocks , and he 's all the pride of my ` art ."
"But the great thing for boys is discipline , sonny -- discipline ."
"Now , if you had sailed along of Bill , you would n't have stood there to be spoke to twice -- not you ."
"That was never Bill 's way , nor the way of sich as sailed with him ."
"And here , sure enough , is my mate Bill , with a spy-glass under his arm , bless his old ` art , to be sure ."
"You and me 'll just go back into the parlour , sonny , and get behind the door , and we 'll give Bill a little surprise -- bless his ` art , I say again . ''"
"I 'm glad ... I really feel the need of some diversion , for what with Anthony Pye in school and Davy Keith at home my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day . ''"
"IX A Question of Color `` That old nuisance of a Rachel Lynde was here again today , pestering me for a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room , '' said Mr. Harrison wrathfully ."
`` I detest that woman more than anybody I know .
"She can put a whole sermon , text , comment , and application , into six words , and throw it at you like a brick . ''"
"Anne , who was perched on the edge of the veranda , enjoying the charm of a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray November twilight and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted firs below the garden , turned her dreamy face over her shoulder ."
"`` The trouble is , you and Mrs. Lynde do n't understand one another , '' she explained ."
`` That is always what is wrong when people do n't like each other .
I did n't like Mrs. Lynde at first either ; but as soon as I came to understand her I learned to . ''
"`` Mrs. Lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks ; but I did n't keep on eating bananas because I was told I 'd learn to like them if I did , '' growled Mr. Harrison ."
"`` And as for understanding her , I understand that she is a confirmed busybody and I told her so . ''"
"`` Oh , that must have hurt her feelings very much , '' said Anne reproachfully ."
`` How could you say such a thing ?
I said some dreadful things to Mrs. Lynde long ago but it was when I had lost my temper .
I could n't say them DELIBERATELY . ''
`` It was the truth and I believe in telling the truth to everybody . ''
"`` But you do n't tell the whole truth , '' objected Anne ."
`` You only tell the disagreeable part of the truth .
"Now , you 've told me a dozen times that my hair was red , but you 've never once told me that I had a nice nose . ''"
"`` I daresay you know it without any telling , '' chuckled Mr. Harrison ."
`` I know I have red hair too ... although it 's MUCH darker than it used to be ... so there 's no need of telling me that either . ''
"`` Well , well , I 'll try and not mention it again since you 're so sensitive ."
"You must excuse me , Anne ."
I 've got a habit of being outspoken and folks must n't mind it . ''
`` But they ca n't help minding it .
And I do n't think it 's any help that it 's your habit .
"What would you think of a person who went about sticking pins and needles into people and saying , ` Excuse me , you must n't mind it ... it 's just a habit I 've got . '"
"You 'd think he was crazy , would n't you ?"
"And as for Mrs. Lynde being a busybody , perhaps she is ."
"But did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor , and never said a word when Timothy Cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife he 'd bought it from her ?"
Mrs. Cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and Mrs. Lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly . ''
"`` I suppose she has some good qualities , '' conceded Mr. Harrison grudgingly ."
`` Most folks have .
"Rilla , be awfully good to mother while I 'm away ."
It must be a horrible thing to be a mother in this war -- the mothers and sisters and wives and sweethearts have the hardest times .
"Rilla , you beautiful little thing , are you anybody 's sweetheart ?"
"If you are , tell me before I go . ''"
"`` No , '' said Rilla ."
"Then , impelled by a wish to be absolutely frank with Walter in this talk that might be the last they would ever have , she added , blushing wildly in the moonlight , `` but if -- Kenneth Ford -- wanted me to be -- '' `` I see , '' said Walter ."
"`` And Ken 's in khaki , too ."
"Poor little girlie , it 's a bit hard for you all round ."
"Well , I 'm not leaving any girl to break her heart about me -- thank God for that . ''"
Rilla glanced up at the Manse on the hill .
She could see a light in Una Meredith 's window .
She felt tempted to say something -- then she knew she must not .
"It was not her secret : and , anyway , she did not know -- she only suspected ."
Walter looked about him lingeringly and lovingly .
This spot had always been so dear to him .
What fun they all had had here lang syne .
"Phantoms of memory seemed to pace the dappled paths and peep merrily through the swinging boughs -- Jem and Jerry , bare-legged , sunburned schoolboys , fishing in the brook and frying trout over the old stone fireplace ; Nan and Di and Faith , in their dimpled , fresh-eyed childish beauty ; Una the sweet and shy , Carl , poring over ants and bugs , little slangy , sharp-tongued , good-hearted Mary Vance -- the old Walter that had been himself lying on the grass reading poetry or wandering through palaces of fancy ."
They were all there around him -- he could see them almost as plainly as he saw Rilla -- as plainly as he had once seen the Pied Piper piping down the valley in a vanished twilight .
"And they said to him , those gay little ghosts of other days , `` We were the children of yesterday , Walter -- fight a good fight for the children of to-day and to-morrow . ''"
"`` Where are you , Walter , '' cried Rilla , laughing a little ."
`` Come back -- come back . ''
Walter came back with a long breath .
"He stood up and looked about him at the beautiful valley of moonlight , as if to impress on his mind and heart every charm it possessed -- the great dark plumes of the firs against the silvery sky , the stately White Lady , the old magic of the dancing brook , the faithful Tree Lovers , the beckoning , tricksy paths ."
"`` I shall see it so in my dreams , '' he said , as he turned away ."
They went back to Ingleside .
"Mr. and Mrs. Meredith were there , with Gertrude Oliver , who had come from Lowbridge to say good-bye ."
"Everybody was quite cheerful and bright , but nobody said much about the war being soon over , as they had said when Jem went away ."
They did not talk about the war at all -- and they thought of nothing else .
"At last they gathered around the piano and sang the grand old hymn : `` Oh God , our help in ages past Our hope for years to come ."
Our shelter from the stormy blast And our eternal home . ''
"`` We all come back to God in these days of soul-sifting , '' said Gertrude to John Meredith ."
`` There have been many days in the past when I did n't believe in God -- not as God -- only as the impersonal Great First Cause of the scientists .
"As we went , he stopped and spoke with all the wayfarers and workers that we met or passed ; and though of course I could not tell what they discoursed about , yet I judged Mr. Henderland must be well liked in the countryside , for I observed many of them to bring out their mulls and share a pinch of snuff with him ."
"I told him as far in my affairs as I judged wise ; as far , that is , as they were none of Alan 's ; and gave Balachulish as the place I was travelling to , to meet a friend ; for I thought Aucharn , or even Duror , would be too particular , and might put him on the scent ."
"On his part , he told me much of his work and the people he worked among , the hiding priests and Jacobites , the Disarming Act , the dress , and many other curiosities of the time and place ."
"He seemed moderate ; blaming Parliament in several points , and especially because they had framed the Act more severely against those who wore the dress than against those who carried weapons ."
"This moderation put it in my mind to question him of the Red Fox and the Appin tenants ; questions which , I thought , would seem natural enough in the mouth of one travelling to that country ."
He said it was a bad business .
"`` It 's wonderful , '' said he , `` where the tenants find the money , for their life is mere starvation ."
"-LRB- Ye do n't carry such a thing as snuff , do ye , Mr. Balfour ?"
No .
"Well , I 'm better wanting it . -RRB-"
But these tenants -LRB- as I was saying -RRB- are doubtless partly driven to it .
"James Stewart in Duror -LRB- that 's him they call James of the Glens -RRB- is half-brother to Ardshiel , the captain of the clan ; and he is a man much looked up to , and drives very hard ."
And then there 's one they call Alan Breck -- '' `` Ah ! ''
"I cried , `` what of him ? ''"
`` What of the wind that bloweth where it listeth ? ''
said Henderland .
`` He 's here and awa ; here to-day and gone to-morrow : a fair heather-cat .
"He might be glowering at the two of us out of yon whin-bush , and I wouldnae wonder !"
"Ye 'll no carry such a thing as snuff , will ye ? ''"
"I told him no , and that he had asked the same thing more than once ."
"`` It 's highly possible , '' said he , sighing ."
`` But it seems strange ye shouldnae carry it .
"However , as I was saying , this Alan Breck is a bold , desperate customer , and well kent to be James 's right hand ."
"His life is forfeit already ; he would boggle at naething ; and maybe , if a tenant-body was to hang back he would get a dirk in his wame . ''"
"`` You make a poor story of it all , Mr. Henderland , '' said I. `` If it is all fear upon both sides , I care to hear no more of it . ''"
"`` Na , '' said Mr. Henderland , `` but there 's love too , and self-denial that should put the like of you and me to shame ."
"There 's something fine about it ; no perhaps Christian , but humanly fine ."
"Even Alan Breck , by all that I hear , is a chield to be respected ."
"There 's many a lying sneck-draw sits close in kirk in our own part of the country , and stands well in the world 's eye , and maybe is a far worse man , Mr. Balfour , than yon misguided shedder of man 's blood ."
"Ay , ay , we might take a lesson by them ."
-- Ye 'll perhaps think I 've been too long in the Hielands ? ''
"he added , smiling to me ."
"So they both shouted till they were hoarse , yet nothing answered but the frogs in full chorus ."
"`` There is another tall tree over there , perhaps that 's the one , '' said Nan , whose heart sunk within her , though she still spoke bravely ."
`` I do n't think I can go any more ; my boots are so heavy I ca n't pull 'em ; '' and Robby sat down on a stone quite worn out .
`` Then we must stay here all night .
"I do n't care much , if snakes do n't come . ''"
`` I 'm frightened of snakes .
I ca n't stay all night .
"Oh , dear !"
"I do n't like to be lost , '' and Rob puckered up his face to cry , when suddenly a thought occurred to him , and he said , in a tone of perfect confidence , `` Marmar will come and find me she always does ; I ai n't afraid now . ''"
`` She wo n't know where we are . ''
"`` She did n't know I was shut up in the ice-house , but she found me ."
"I know she 'll come , '' returned Robby , so trustfully , that Nan felt relieved , and sat down by him , saying , with a remorseful sigh , `` I wish we had n't run away . ''"
"`` You made me ; but I do n't mind much Marmar will love me just the same , '' answered Rob , clinging to his sheet-anchor when all other hope was gone ."
`` I 'm so hungry .
"Let 's eat our berries , '' proposed Nan , after a pause , during which Rob began to nod ."
"`` So am I , but I ca n't eat mine , 'cause I told Marmar I 'd keep them all for her . ''"
"`` You 'll have to eat them if no one comes for us , '' said Nan , who felt like contradicting every thing just then ."
"`` If we stay here a great many days , we shall eat up all the berries in the field , and then we shall starve , '' she added grimly ."
`` I shall eat sassafras .
"I know a big tree of it , and Dan told me how squirrels dig up the roots and eat them , and I love to dig , '' returned Rob , undaunted by the prospect of starvation ."
"`` Yes ; and we can catch frogs , and cook them ."
"My father ate some once , and he said they were nice , '' put in Nan , beginning to find a spice of romance even in being lost in a huckleberry pasture ."
`` How could we cook frogs ?
we have n't got any fire . ''
"`` I do n't know ; next time I 'll have matches in my pocket , '' said Nan , rather depressed by this obstacle to the experiment in frog-cookery ."
`` Could n't we light a fire with a fire-fly ? ''
"asked Rob , hopefully , as he watched them flitting to and fro like winged sparks ."
"`` Let 's try ; '' and several minutes were pleasantly spent in catching the flies , and trying to make them kindle a green twig or two ."
"`` It 's a lie to call them fire-flies when there is n't a fire in them , '' Nan said , throwing one unhappy insect away with scorn , though it shone its best , and obligingly walked up and down the twigs to please the innocent little experimenters ."
"`` Marmar 's a good while coming , '' said Rob , after another pause , during which they watched the stars overhead , smelt the sweet fern crushed under foot , and listened to the crickets ' serenade ."
"`` I do n't see why God made any night ; day is so much pleasanter , '' said Nan , thoughtfully ."
"`` It 's to sleep in , '' answered Rob , with a yawn ."
"`` Then I shall send him right home , '' said Daisy , with decision ."
"`` People do n't do so at parties , it is n't proper . ''"
`` I shall never ask him any more . ''
`` That would do .
"He 'd be sorry not to come to the dinner-ball , would n't he ? ''"
`` I guess he would !
"we 'll have the splendidest things ever seen , wo n't we ?"
"Real soup with a ladle and a tureem -LSB- she meant tureen -RSB- and a little bird for turkey , and gravy , and all kinds of nice vegytubbles . ''"
"Daisy never could say vegetables properly , and had given up trying ."
"`` It is ` most three , and we ought to dress , '' said Nan , who had arranged a fine costume for the occasion , and was anxious to wear it ."
"`` I am the mother , so I sha n't dress up much , '' said Daisy , putting on a night-cap ornamented with a red bow , one of her aunt 's long skirts , and a shawl ; a pair of spectacles and large pocket handkerchief completed her toilette , making a plump , rosy little matron of her ."
"Nan had a wreath of artificial flowers , a pair of old pink slippers , a yellow scarf , a green muslin skirt , and a fan made of feathers from the duster ; also , as a last touch of elegance , a smelling-bottle without any smell in it ."
"`` I am the daughter , so I rig up a good deal , and I must sing and dance , and talk more than you do ."
"The mothers only get the tea and be proper , you know . ''"
"A sudden very loud knock caused Miss Smith to fly into a chair , and fan herself violently , while her mamma sat bolt upright on the sofa , and tried to look quite calm and `` proper . ''"
"Little Bess , who was on a visit , acted the part of maid , and opened the door , saying with a smile , `` Wart in , gemplemun ; it 's all weady . ''"
"In honor of the occasion , the boys wore high paper collars , tall black hats , and gloves of every color and material , for they were an afterthought , and not a boy among them had a perfect pair ."
"`` Good day , mum , '' said Demi , in a deep voice , which was so hard to keep up that his remarks had to be extremely brief ."
"Every one shook hands and then sat down , looking so funny , yet so sober , that the gentlemen forgot their manners , and rolled in their chairs with laughter ."
"`` Oh , do n't ! ''"
"cried Mrs. Smith , much distressed ."
"`` You ca n't ever come again if you act so , '' added Miss Smith , rapping Mr. Bangs with her bottle because he laughed loudest ."
"`` I ca n't help it , you look so like fury , '' gasped Mr. Bangs , with most uncourteous candor ."
"`` So do you , but I should n't be so rude as to say so ."
"He sha n't come to the dinner-ball , shall he , Daisy ? ''"
"cried Nan , indignantly ."
`` I think we had better dance now .
"Did you bring your fiddle , sir ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Smith , trying to preserve her polite composure ."
"`` It is outside the door , '' and Nat went to get it ."
"`` Better have tea first , '' proposed the unabashed Tommy , winking openly at Demi to remind him that the sooner the refreshments were secured , the sooner they could escape ."
"`` No , we never have supper first ; and if you do n't dance well you wo n't have any supper at all , not one bit , sir , '' said Mrs. Smith , so sternly that her wild guests saw she was not to be trifled with , and grew overwhelmingly civil all at once ."
Do not let yourself slump like poor Cousin Sophia .
"She said , when the word came , ` Ah , it is nothing but a rift in the clouds ."
We are up this week but we will be down the next . '
"` Well , Sophia Crawford , ' said I , -- for I will never give in to her , Mrs. Dr. dear -- ` God himself can not make two hills without a hollow between them , as I have heard it said , but that is no reason why we should not take the good of the hills when we are on them . '"
But Cousin Sophia moaned on .
"` Here is the Gallipolly expedition a failure and the Grand Duke Nicholas sent off , and everyone knows the Czar of Rooshia is a pro-German and the Allies have no ammunition and Bulgaria is going against us ."
"And the end is not yet , for England and France must be punished for their deadly sins until they repent in sackcloth and ashes . ' '"
"I think myself , ' I said , ` that they will do their repenting in khaki and trench mud , and it seems to me that the Huns should have a few sins to repent of also . '"
"` They are instruments in the hands of the Almighty , to purge the garner , ' said Sophia ."
"And then I got mad , Mrs. Dr. dear , and told her I did not and never would believe that the Almighty ever took such dirty instruments in hand for any purpose whatever , and that I did not consider it decent for her to be using the words of Holy Writ as glibly as she was doing in ordinary conversation ."
"She was not , I told her , a minister or even an elder ."
"And for the time being I squelched her , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
Cousin Sophia has no spirit .
"She is very different from her niece , Mrs. Dean Crawford over-harbour ."
You know the Dean Crawfords had five boys and now the new baby is another boy .
"All the connection and especially Dean Crawford were much disappointed because their hearts had been set on a girl ; but Mrs. Dean just laughed and said , ` Everywhere I went this summer I saw the sign `` MEN WANTED '' staring me in the face ."
Do you think I could go and have a girl under such circumstances ? '
"There is spirit for you , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
But Cousin Sophia would say the child was just so much more cannon fodder . ''
"Cousin Sophia had full range for her pessimism that gloomy autumn , and even Susan , incorrigible old optimist as she was , was hard put to it for cheer ."
"When Bulgaria lined up with Germany Susan only remarked scornfully , `` One more nation anxious for a licking , '' but the Greek tangle worried her beyond her powers of philosophy to endure calmly ."
"`` Constantine of Greece has a German wife , Mrs. Dr. dear , and that fact squelches hope ."
To think that I should have lived to care what kind of a wife Constantine of Greece had !
The miserable creature is under his wife 's thumb and that is a bad place for any man to be .
I am an old maid and an old maid has to be independent or she will be squashed out .
"But if I had been a married woman , Mrs. Dr. dear , I would have been meek and humble ."
It is my opinion that this Sophia of Greece is a minx . ''
Susan was furious when the news came that Venizelos had met with defeat .
"`` I could spank Constantine and skin him alive afterwards , that I could , '' she exclaimed bitterly ."
"`` Oh , Susan , I 'm surprised at you , '' said the doctor , pulling a long face ."
`` Have you no regard for the proprieties ?
Skin him alive by all means but omit the spanking . ''
Jem and Walter were yours but Shirley is mine .
And I can not bear to think of him flying -- his machine crashing down -- the life crushed out of his body -- the dear little body I nursed and cuddled when he was a wee baby . ''
"`` Susan -- do n't , '' cried Anne ."
"`` Oh , Mrs. Dr. dear , I beg your pardon ."
I ought not to have said anything like that out loud .
I sometimes forget that I resolved to be a heroine .
This -- this has shaken me a little .
But I will not forget myself again .
Only if things do not go as smoothly in the kitchen for a few days I hope you will make due allowance for me .
"At least , '' said poor Susan , forcing a grim smile in a desperate effort to recover lost standing , `` at least flying is a clean job ."
"He will not get so dirty and messed up as he would in the trenches , and that is well , for he has always been a tidy child . ''"
"So Shirley went -- not radiantly , as to a high adventure , like Jem , not in a white flame of sacrifice , like Walter , but in a cool , business-like mood , as of one doing something , rather dirty and disagreeable , that had just got to be done ."
"He kissed Susan for the first time since he was five years old , and said , `` Good-bye , Susan -- mother Susan . ''"
"`` My little brown boy -- my little brown boy , '' said Susan ."
"`` I wonder , '' she thought bitterly , as she looked at the doctor 's sorrowful face , `` if you remember how you spanked him once when he was a baby ."
I am thankful I have nothing like that on my conscience now . ''
The doctor did not remember the old discipline .
But before he put on his hat to go out on his round of calls he stood for a moment in the great silent living-room that had once been full of children 's laughter .
"`` Our last son -- our last son , '' he said aloud ."
"`` A good , sturdy , sensible lad , too ."
Always reminded me of my father .
I suppose I ought to be proud that he wanted to go -- I was proud when Jem went -- even when Walter went -- but ` our house is left us desolate . ' ''
"`` I have been thinking , doctor , '' old Sandy of the Upper Glen said to him that afternoon , `` that your house will be seeming very big the day . ''"
Highland Sandy 's quaint phrase struck the doctor as perfectly expressive .
Ingleside did seem very big and empty that night .
"Yet Shirley had been away all winter except for week-ends , and had always been a quiet fellow even when home ."
Was it because he had been the only one left that his going seemed to leave such a huge blank -- that every room seemed vacant and deserted -- that the very trees on the lawn seemed to be trying to comfort each other with caresses of freshly-budding boughs for the loss of the last of the little lads who had romped under them in childhood ?
Susan worked very hard all day and late into the night .
"When she had wound the kitchen clock and put Dr. Jekyll out , none too gently , she stood for a little while on the doorstep , looking down the Glen , which lay tranced in faint , silvery light from a sinking young moon ."
But Susan did not see the familiar hills and harbour .
She was looking at the aviation camp in Kingsport where Shirley was that night .
"`` He called me ` Mother Susan , ' '' she was thinking ."
We could n't make out the words but Diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them .
"I ca n't believe that of Mr. Blair , for he is always so quiet and meek ; but at least he had great provocation , for Marilla , when that poor man came to the door , red as a beet , with perspiration streaming down his face , he had on one of his wife 's big gingham aprons . '"
"I ca n't get this durned thing off , ' he said , ` for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I ca n't bust 'em , so you 'll have to excuse me , ladies . '"
We begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down .
"Mr. Blair sat down too ; he twisted the apron around to his back and rolled it up , but he did look so ashamed and worried that I felt sorry for him , and Diana said she feared we had called at an inconvenient time ."
"` Oh , not at all , ' said Mr. Blair , trying to smile ... you know he is always very polite ... ` I 'm a little busy ... getting ready to bake a cake as it were ."
My wife got a telegram today that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she 's gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea .
She writ out the recipe and told me what to do but I 've clean forgot half the directions already .
"And it says , ` flavor according to taste . '"
What does that mean ?
How can you tell ?
And what if my taste does n't happen to be other people 's taste ?
Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake ? ''
`` I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man .
He did n't seem to be in his proper sphere at all .
I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt that I saw one .
"It was on my lips to say , ` Mr. Blair , if you 'll give us a subscription for the hall I 'll mix up your cake for you . '"
But I suddenly thought it would n't be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain with a fellow creature in distress .
So I offered to mix the cake for him without any conditions at all .
He just jumped at my offer .
"He said he 'd been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared cake was beyond him , and yet he hated to disappoint his wife ."
"He got me another apron , and Diana beat the eggs and I mixed the cake ."
Mr. Blair ran about and got us the materials .
He had forgotten all about his apron and when he ran it streamed out behind him and Diana said she thought she would die to see it .
He said he could bake the cake all right ... he was used to that ... and then he asked for our list and he put down four dollars .
So you see we were rewarded .
But even if he had n't given a cent I 'd always feel that we had done a truly Christian act in helping him . ''
Theodore White 's was the next stopping place .
"Neither Anne nor Diana had ever been there before , and they had only a very slight acquaintance with Mrs. Theodore , who was not given to hospitality ."
Should they go to the back or front door ?
While they held a whispered consultation Mrs. Theodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers .
"Deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the porch steps , and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified callers ."
"`` Oh , dear no !"
"I 'm the first boy Mrs. Jo ever had to take care of , and I was such a bad one that she is n't done with me yet , though she has been working at me for years and years . ''"
`` How old she must be ! ''
"said Nat , innocently ."
"`` She began early , you see ."
Poor thing !
"she was only fifteen when she took me , and I led her such a life , it 's a wonder she is n't wrinkled and gray , and quite worn out , '' and Mr. Laurie looked up at her laughing ."
"`` Do n't Teddy ; I wo n't have you abuse yourself so ; '' and Mrs. Jo stroked the curly black head at her knee as affectionately as ever , for , in spite of every thing Teddy was her boy still ."
"`` If it had n't been for you , there never would have been a Plumfield ."
"It was my success with you , sir , that gave me courage to try my pet plan ."
"So the boys may thank you for it , and name the new institution ` The Laurence Museum , ' in honor of its founder , wo n't we , boys ? ''"
"she added , looking very like the lively Jo of old times ."
`` We will !
we will ! ''
"shouted the boys , throwing up their hats , for though they had taken them off on entering the house , according to rule , they had been in too much of a hurry to hang them up ."
"`` I 'm as hungry as a bear , ca n't I have a cookie ? ''"
"asked Mr. Laurie , when the shout subsided and he had expressed his thanks by a splendid bow ."
"`` Trot out and ask Asia for the gingerbread-box , Demi ."
"It is n't in order to eat between meals , but , on this joyful occasion , we wo n't mind , and have a cookie all round , '' said Mrs. Jo ; and when the box came she dealt them out with a liberal hand , every one munching away in a social circle ."
"Suddenly , in the midst of a bite , Mr. Laurie cried out , `` Bless my heart , I forgot grandma 's bundle ! ''"
"and running out to the carriage , returned with an interesting white parcel , which , being opened , disclosed a choice collection of beasts , birds , and pretty things cut out of crisp sugary cake , and baked a lovely brown ."
"`` There 's one for each , and a letter to tell which is whose ."
"Grandma and Hannah made them , and I tremble to think what would have happened to me if I had forgotten to leave them . ''"
"Then , amid much laughing and fun , the cakes were distributed ."
"A fish for Dan , a fiddle for Nat , a book for Demi , a money for Tommy , a flower for Daisy , a hoop for Nan , who had driven twice round the triangle without stopping , a star for Emil , who put on airs because he studied astronomy , and , best of all , an omnibus for Franz , whose great delight was to drive the family bus ."
"Stuffy got a fat pig , and the little folks had birds , and cats , and rabbits , with black currant eyes ."
`` Now I must go .
Where is my Goldilocks ?
"Mamma will come flying out to get her if I 'm not back early , '' said Uncle Teddy , when the last crumb had vanished , which it speedily did , you may be sure ."
"The young ladies had gone into the garden , and while they waited till Franz looked them up , Jo and Laurie stood at the door talking together ."
`` How does little Giddy-gaddy come on ? ''
"he asked , for Nan 's pranks amused him very much , and he was never tired of teasing Jo about her ."
"`` James must have tint his wits , '' said Alan ."
"`` If this was the soldiers instead of you and me , he would be in a bonny mess ."
"But I dare say he 'll have a sentry on the road , and he would ken well enough no soldiers would find the way that we came . ''"
"Hereupon he whistled three times , in a particular manner ."
"It was strange to see how , at the first sound of it , all the moving torches came to a stand , as if the bearers were affrighted ; and how , at the third , the bustle began again as before ."
"Having thus set folks ' minds at rest , we came down the brae , and were met at the yard gate -LRB- for this place was like a well-doing farm -RRB- by a tall , handsome man of more than fifty , who cried out to Alan in the Gaelic ."
"`` James Stewart , '' said Alan , `` I will ask ye to speak in Scotch , for here is a young gentleman with me that has nane of the other ."
"This is him , '' he added , putting his arm through mine , `` a young gentleman of the Lowlands , and a laird in his country too , but I am thinking it will be the better for his health if we give his name the go-by . ''"
"James of the Glens turned to me for a moment , and greeted me courteously enough ; the next he had turned to Alan ."
"`` This has been a dreadful accident , '' he cried ."
`` It will bring trouble on the country . ''
And he wrung his hands .
`` Hoots ! ''
"said Alan , `` ye must take the sour with the sweet , man ."
"Colin Roy is dead , and be thankful for that ! ''"
"`` Ay '' said James , `` and by my troth , I wish he was alive again !"
"It 's all very fine to blow and boast beforehand ; but now it 's done , Alan ; and who 's to bear the wyte * of it ?"
"The accident fell out in Appin -- mind ye that , Alan ; it 's Appin that must pay ; and I am a man that has a family . ''"
* Blame .
While this was going on I looked about me at the servants .
"Some were on ladders , digging in the thatch of the house or the farm buildings , from which they brought out guns , swords , and different weapons of war ; others carried them away ; and by the sound of mattock blows from somewhere farther down the brae , I suppose they buried them ."
"Though they were all so busy , there prevailed no kind of order in their efforts ; men struggled together for the same gun and ran into each other with their burning torches ; and James was continually turning about from his talk with Alan , to cry out orders which were apparently never understood ."
"The faces in the torchlight were like those of people overborne with hurry and panic ; and though none spoke above his breath , their speech sounded both anxious and angry ."
It was about this time that a lassie came out of the house carrying a pack or bundle ; and it has often made me smile to think how Alan 's instinct awoke at the mere sight of it .
`` What 's that the lassie has ? ''
he asked .
"`` We 're just setting the house in order , Alan , '' said James , in his frightened and somewhat fawning way ."
"`` They 'll search Appin with candles , and we must have all things straight ."
"We 're digging the bit guns and swords into the moss , ye see ; and these , I am thinking , will be your ain French clothes ."
"We 'll be to bury them , I believe . ''"
`` Bury my French clothes ! ''
cried Alan .
"And then there was water there , and water 's a thing that dauntons even me ."
"No , no , '' said Alan , `` it 's no you that 's to blame , it 's me . ''"
I asked him why .
"`` Why , '' said he , `` I have proved myself a gomeral this night ."
"For first of all I take a wrong road , and that in my own country of Appin ; so that the day has caught us where we should never have been ; and thanks to that , we lie here in some danger and mair discomfort ."
"And next -LRB- which is the worst of the two , for a man that has been so much among the heather as myself -RRB- I have come wanting a water-bottle , and here we lie for a long summer 's day with naething but neat spirit ."
"Ye may think that a small matter ; but before it comes night , David , ye 'll give me news of it . ''"
"I was anxious to redeem my character , and offered , if he would pour out the brandy , to run down and fill the bottle at the river ."
"`` I wouldnae waste the good spirit either , '' says he ."
"`` It 's been a good friend to you this night ; or in my poor opinion , ye would still be cocking on yon stone ."
"And what 's mair , '' says he , `` ye may have observed -LRB- you that 's a man of so much penetration -RRB- that Alan Breck Stewart was perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar ' . ''"
`` You ! ''
"I cried , `` you were running fit to burst . ''"
`` Was I so ? ''
said he .
"`` Well , then , ye may depend upon it , there was nae time to be lost ."
"And now here is enough said ; gang you to your sleep , lad , and I 'll watch . ''"
"Accordingly , I lay down to sleep ; a little peaty earth had drifted in between the top of the two rocks , and some bracken grew there , to be a bed to me ; the last thing I heard was still the crying of the eagles ."
"I dare say it would be nine in the morning when I was roughly awakened , and found Alan 's hand pressed upon my mouth ."
`` Wheesht ! ''
he whispered .
`` Ye were snoring . ''
"`` Well , '' said I , surprised at his anxious and dark face , `` and why not ? ''"
"He peered over the edge of the rock , and signed to me to do the like ."
"It was now high day , cloudless , and very hot ."
The valley was as clear as in a picture .
"About half a mile up the water was a camp of red-coats ; a big fire blazed in their midst , at which some were cooking ; and near by , on the top of a rock about as high as ours , there stood a sentry , with the sun sparkling on his arms ."
"All the way down along the river-side were posted other sentries ; here near together , there widelier scattered ; some planted like the first , on places of command , some on the ground level and marching and counter-marching , so as to meet half-way ."
"Higher up the glen , where the ground was more open , the chain of posts was continued by horse-soldiers , whom we could see in the distance riding to and fro ."
"Lower down , the infantry continued ; but as the stream was suddenly swelled by the confluence of a considerable burn , they were more widely set , and only watched the fords and stepping-stones ."
"I took but one look at them , and ducked again into my place ."
"It was strange indeed to see this valley , which had lain so solitary in the hour of dawn , bristling with arms and dotted with the red coats and breeches ."
`` What 's this ? ''
"`` We 're a-changing of the powder , Jack , '' answers one ."
"`` Why , by the powers , '' cried Long John , `` if we do , we 'll miss the morning tide ! ''"
`` My orders ! ''
said the captain shortly .
"`` You may go below , my man ."
Hands will want supper . ''
"`` Aye , aye , sir , '' answered the cook , and touching his forelock , he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley ."
"`` That 's a good man , captain , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Very likely , sir , '' replied Captain Smollett ."
"`` Easy with that , men -- easy , '' he ran on , to the fellows who were shifting the powder ; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships , a long brass nine , `` Here you , ship 's boy , '' he cried , `` out o ' that !"
Off with you to the cook and get some work . ''
"And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say , quite loudly , to the doctor , `` I 'll have no favourites on my ship . ''"
"I assure you I was quite of the squire 's way of thinking , and hated the captain deeply ."
"10 The Voyage ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place , and boatfuls of the squire 's friends , Mr. Blandly and the like , coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return ."
"We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work ; and I was dog-tired when , a little before dawn , the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars ."
"I might have been twice as weary , yet I would not have left the deck , all was so new and interesting to me -- the brief commands , the shrill note of the whistle , the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship 's lanterns ."
"`` Now , Barbecue , tip us a stave , '' cried one voice ."
"`` The old one , '' cried another ."
"`` Aye , aye , mates , '' said Long John , who was standing by , with his crutch under his arm , and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- '' And then the whole crew bore chorus : -- `` Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
And at the third `` Ho ! ''
drove the bars before them with a will .
"Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second , and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus ."
"But soon the anchor was short up ; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows ; soon the sails began to draw , and the land and shipping to flit by on either side ; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure ."
I am not going to relate that voyage in detail .
It was fairly prosperous .
"The ship proved to be a good ship , the crew were capable seamen , and the captain thoroughly understood his business ."
"But before we came the length of Treasure Island , two or three things had happened which require to be known ."
"Mr. Arrow , first of all , turned out even worse than the captain had feared ."
"He had no command among the men , and people did what they pleased with him ."
"But that was by no means the worst of it , for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye , red cheeks , stuttering tongue , and other marks of drunkenness ."
Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace .
`` Of course you may !
"This proves to me that we have a hold on the boy 's heart , and I would no more send him away now than I would my own Rob . ''"
"Dan heard a soft little sound , as if Mrs. Jo thanked her husband without words , and , in the instant 's silence that followed , two great tears that had slowly gathered in the boy 's eyes brimmed over and rolled down his dusty cheeks ."
"No one saw them , for he brushed them hastily away ; but in that little pause I think Dan 's old distrust for these good people vanished for ever , the soft spot in his heart was touched , and he felt an impetuous desire to prove himself worthy of the love and pity that was so patient and forgiving ."
"He said nothing , he only wished the wish with all his might , resolved to try in his blind boyish way , and sealed his resolution with the tears which neither pain , fatigue , nor loneliness could wring from him ."
`` Come and see his foot .
"I am afraid it is badly hurt , for he has kept on three days through heat and dust , with nothing but water and an old jacket to bind it up with ."
"I tell you , Fritz , that boy is a brave lad , and will make a fine man yet . ''"
"`` I hope so , for your sake , enthusiastic woman , your faith deserves success ."
"Now , I will go and see your little Spartan ."
Where is he ? ''
"`` In my room ; but , dear , you 'll be very kind to him , no matter how gruff he seems ."
I am sure that is the way to conquer him .
"He wo n't bear sternness nor much restraint , but a soft word and infinite patience will lead him as it used to lead me . ''"
`` As if you ever like this little rascal ! ''
"cried Mr. Bhaer , laughing , yet half angry at the idea ."
"`` I was in spirit , though I showed it in a different way ."
"I seem to know by instinct how he feels , to understand what will win and touch him , and to sympathize with his temptations and faults ."
"I am glad I do , for it will help me to help him ; and if I can make a good man of this wild boy , it will be the best work of my life . ''"
"`` God bless the work , and help the worker ! ''"
"Mr. Bhaer spoke now as earnestly as she had done , and both came in together to find Dan 's head down upon his arm , as if he was quite overcome by sleep ."
"But he looked up quickly , and tried to rise as Mr. Bhaer said pleasantly , `` So you like Plumfield better than Page 's farm ."
"Well , let us see if we can get on more comfortably this time than we did before . ''"
"`` Thanky , sir , '' said Dan , trying not to be gruff , and finding it easier than he expected ."
"`` Now , the foot !"
Ach !
this is not well .
We must have Dr. Firth to-morrow .
"Warm water , Jo , and old linen . ''"
"Mr. Bhaer bathed and bound up the wounded foot , while Mrs. Jo prepared the only empty bed in the house ."
"It was in the little guest-chamber leading from the parlor , and often used when the lads were poorly , for it saved Mrs. Jo from running up and down , and the invalids could see what was going on ."
"When it was ready , Mr. Bhaer took the boy in his arms , and carried him in , helped him undress , laid him on the little white bed , and left him with another hand-shake , and a fatherly `` Good-night , my son . ''"
"A splashing noise near by drew him down to a valley through which ran a large river , and up a waterfall some salmon were leaping ."
"How their silver sides glistened in the light , and how he longed to catch some of the great fellows !"
But how could he do it ?
"He had beheld no one except the old women , and it was not very likely that they would be able to help him ."
"So with a sigh he turned away and went back to them , but , as he walked , a thought struck him ."
"He pulled out one of his hairs which hung nearly to his waist , and it instantly became a strong line , nearly a mile in length ."
"` Weave me a net that I may catch some salmon , ' said he ."
"And they wove him the net he asked for , and for many weeks he watched by the river , only going back to the old women when he wanted a fish cooked ."
"At last , one day , when he was eating his dinner , the old woman who always spoke first , said to him : ` We have been very glad to see you , grandson , but now it is time that you went home . '"
"And pushing aside a rock , he saw a deep hole , so deep that he could not see to the bottom ."
"Then they dragged a basket out of the house , and tied a rope to it ."
"` Get in , and wrap this blanket round your head , ' said they ; ` and , whatever happens , do n't uncover it till you get to the bottom . '"
"Then they bade him farewell , and he curled himself up in the basket ."
"Down , down , down he went ; would he ever stop going ?"
"But when the basket did stop , the young man forgot what he had been told , and put his head out to see what was the matter ."
"In an instant the basket moved , but , to his horror , instead of going down , he felt himself being drawn upwards , and shortly after he beheld the faces of the old women ."
"` You will never see your wife and son if you will not do as you are bid , ' said they ."
"` Now get in , and do not stir till you hear a crow calling . '"
"This time the young man was wiser , and though the basket often stopped , and strange creatures seemed to rest on him and to pluck at his blanket , he held it tight till he heard the crow calling ."
"Then he flung off the blanket and sprang out , while the basket vanished in the sky ."
"He walked on quickly down the track that led to the hut , when , before him , he saw his wife with his little son on her back ."
` Oh !
"there is father at last , ' cried the boy ; but the mother bade him cease from idle talking ."
"` But , mother , it is true ; father is coming ! '"
repeated the child .
"And , to satisfy him , the woman turned round and perceived her husband ."
"Oh , how glad they all were to be together again !"
"And when the wind whistled through the forest , and the snow stood in great banks round the door , the father used to take the little boy on his knee and tell him how he caught salmon in the Land of the Sun ."
How the Stalos Were Tricked -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
"` Mother , I have seen such a wonderful man , ' said a little boy one day , as he entered a hut in Lapland , bearing in his arms the bundle of sticks he had been sent out to gather ."
"` Have you , my son ; and what was he like ? '"
"asked the mother , as she took off the child 's sheepskin coat and shook it on the doorstep ."
"The little wild creatures peeped at him from beneath the bushes , and he nodded and smiled , and wished them ` Good-morning . '"
After he had been walking for some time he met an old white-bearded man who was coming along the footpath .
"The boy would not step aside , and the man was determined not to do so either , so they ran against one another with a bump ."
"` It seems to me , ' said the old fellow , ` that a boy should give way to an old man . '"
"` The path is for me as well as for you , ' answered young Hans saucily , for he had never been taught politeness ."
"` Well , that 's true enough , ' answered the other mildly ."
` And where are you going ? ' '
"I am going into service , ' said Hans ."
"` Then you can come and serve me , ' replied the man ."
"Well , Hans could do that ; but what would his wages be ?"
"` Two pounds a year , and nothing to do but keep some rooms clean , ' said the new-comer ."
"This seemed to Hans to be easy enough ; so he agreed to enter the old man 's service , and they set out together ."
"On their way they crossed a deep valley and came to a mountain , where the man opened a trapdoor , and bidding Hans follow him , he crept in and began to go down a long flight of steps ."
When they got to the bottom Hans saw a large number of rooms lit by many lamps and full of beautiful things .
While he was looking round the old man said to him : ` Now you know what you have to do .
"You must keep these rooms clean , and strew sand on the floor every day ."
"Here is a table where you will always find food and drink , and there is your bed ."
"You see there are a great many suits of clothes hanging on the wall , and you may wear any you please ; but remember that you are never to open this locked door ."
If you do ill will befall you .
"Farewell , for I am going away again and can not tell when I may return ."
"No sooner had the old man disappeared than Hans sat down to a good meal , and after that went to bed and slept until the morning ."
"At first he could not remember what had happened to him , but by-and-by he jumped up and went into all the rooms , which he examined carefully ."
"` How foolish to bid me to put sand on the floors , ' he thought , ` when there is nobody here by myself !"
I shall do nothing of the sort . '
"And so he shut the doors quickly , and only cleaned and set in order his own room ."
"And after the first few days he felt that that was unnecessary too , because no one came there to see if the rooms where clean or not ."
"At last he did no work at all , but just sat and wondered what was behind the locked door , till he determined to go and look for himself ."
The key turned easily in the lock .
"Hans entered , half frightened at what he was doing , and the first thing he beheld was a heap of bones ."
That was not very cheerful ; and he was just going out again when his eye fell on a shelf of books .
"Here was a good way of passing the time , he thought , for he was fond of reading , and he took one of the books from the shelf ."
"It was all about magic , and told you how you could change yourself into anything in the world you liked ."
"Both were glad to get out of sight , and dropped upon the steps red , rumpled , and breathless , after the late exciting scene ."
"Gus generously forebore to speak , though he felt that he was the least to blame ; and Frank , after eating a bit of snow to moisten his dry lips , said , handsomely , -- `` Now , do n't you worry , old man ."
"I 'll pay the damages , for it was my fault ."
"Joe will dodge , but I wo n't , so make your mind easy ."
"`` We sha 'n' t hear the last of this in a hurry , '' responded Gus , relieved , yet anxious , as he thought of the reprimand his father would give him ."
`` I hope mother wo n't hear of it till I tell her quietly myself .
"She will be so frightened , and think I 'm surely smashed up , if she is told in a hurry ; '' and Frank gave a shiver , as all the danger he had run came over him suddenly ."
`` I thought we were done for when we saw that train .
Guess we should have been if you had not had your wits about you .
"I always said you were a cool one ; '' and Gus patted Frank 's back with a look of great admiration , for , now that it was all over , he considered it a very remarkable performance ."
"`` Which do you suppose it will be , fine or imprisonment ? ''"
"asked Frank , after sitting in a despondent attitude for a moment ."
`` Should n't wonder if it was both .
"Running off with an engine is no joke , you know . ''"
`` What did possess me to be such a fool ? ''
"groaned Frank , repenting , all too late , of yielding to the temptation which assailed him ."
"`` Bear up , old fellow , I 'll stand by you ; and if the worst comes , I 'll call as often as the rules of the prison allow , '' said Gus , consolingly , as he gave his afflicted friend an arm , and they walked away , both feeling that they were marked men from that day forth ."
"Meantime , Joe , as soon as he recovered from the shock of seeing the boys actually go off , ran away , as fast as his legs could carry him , to prepare Mrs. Minot for the loss of her son ; for the idea of their coming safely back never occurred to him , his knowledge of engines being limited ."
"A loud ring at the bell brought Mrs. Pecq , who was guarding the house , while Mrs. Minot entertained a parlor full of company ."
"`` Frank 's run off with No. 11 , and he 'll be killed sure ."
"Thought I 'd come up and tell you , '' stammered Joe , all out of breath and looking wild ."
"He got no further , for Mrs. Pecq clapped one hand over his mouth , caught him by the collar with the other , and hustled him into the ante-room before any one else could hear the bad news ."
"`` Tell me all about it , and do n't shout ."
What 's come to the boy ? ''
"she demanded , in a tone that reduced Joe to a whisper at once ."
"`` Go right back and see what has happened to him , then come and tell me quietly ."
I 'll wait for you here .
"I would n't have his mother startled for the world , '' said the good soul , when she knew all ."
"`` Oh , I dar ` s n't !"
"I opened the switch as they told me to , and Bill will half kill me when he knows it ! ''"
"cried Joe , in a panic , as the awful consequences of his deed rose before him , showing both boys mortally injured and several trains wrecked ."
`` Then take yourself off home and hold your tongue .
"Only you must unfasten the halter you lead it with and bring it back , and do n't return by the high road , but through the forest . '"
"The next day , when the couple rose , they saw an enormous head looking in at their bedroom window , and behind it was a cow which was nearly as big as their hut ."
Kirsten was wild with joy to think of the money the cow would bring them .
` But how are you going to put the rope over her head ? '
asked she .
"` Wait and you 'll see , mother , ' answered her husband ."
"Then Peder took the ladder that led up to the hayloft and set it against the cow 's neck , and he climbed up and slipped the rope over her head ."
"When he had made sure that the noose was fast they started for the palace , and met the king himself walking in his grounds . '"
"I heard that the princess was going to be married , ' said Peder , ` so I 've brought your majesty a cow which is bigger than any cow that was ever seen ."
Will your majesty deign to buy it ? '
"The king had , in truth , never seen so large a beast , and he willingly paid the thousand dollars , which was the price demanded ; but Peder remembered to take off the halter before he left ."
After he was gone the king sent for the butcher and told him to kill the animal for the wedding feast .
"The butcher got ready his pole-axe ; but just as he was going to strike , the cow changed itself into a dove and flew away , and the butcher stood staring after it as if he were turned to stone ."
"However , as the dove could not be found , he was obliged to tell the king what had happened , and the king in his turn despatched messengers to capture the old man and bring him back ."
"But Peder was safe in the woods , and could not be found ."
"When at last he felt the danger was over , and he might go home , Kirsten nearly fainted with joy at the sight of all the money he brought with him ."
"` Now that we are rich people we must build a bigger house , ' cried she ; and was vexed to find that Peder only shook his head and said : ` No ; if they did that people would talk , and say they had got their wealth by ill-doing . '"
A few mornings later Hans came again .
"` Be off before you get us into trouble , ' said his father ."
"` So far the money has come right enough , but I do n't trust it . '"
"` Do n't worry over that , father , ' said Hans ."
` To-morrow you will find a horse outside by the gate .
Ride it to market and you will get a thousand dollars for it .
Only do n't forget to loosen the bridle when you sell it . '
"Well , in the morning there was the horse ; Kirsten had never seen so find an animal ."
"` Take care it does n't hurt you , Peder , ' said she ."
"` Nonsense , wife , ' answered he crossly ."
"` When I was a lad I lived with horses , and could ride anything for twenty miles round . '"
"But that was not quite the truth , for he had never mounted a horse in his life ."
"Still , the animal was quiet enough , so Peder got safely to market on its back ."
"There he met a man who offered nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars for it , but Peder would take nothing less than a thousand ."
"At last there came an old , grey-bearded man who looked at the horse and agreed to buy it ; but the moment he touched it the horse began to kick and plunge . '"
"I was dead weary , deadly sick and full of pains and shiverings ; the chill of the wind went through me , and the sound of it confused my ears ."
In this poor state I had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a persecution .
"He spoke a good deal , and never without a taunt ."
`` Whig '' was the best name he had to give me .
"`` Here , '' he would say , `` here 's a dub for ye to jump , my Whiggie !"
I ken you 're a fine jumper ! ''
And so on ; all the time with a gibing voice and face .
"I knew it was my own doing , and no one else 's ; but I was too miserable to repent ."
"I felt I could drag myself but little farther ; pretty soon , I must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox , and my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast ."
"My head was light perhaps ; but I began to love the prospect , I began to glory in the thought of such a death , alone in the desert , with the wild eagles besieging my last moments ."
"Alan would repent then , I thought ; he would remember , when I was dead , how much he owed me , and the remembrance would be torture ."
"So I went like a sick , silly , and bad-hearted schoolboy , feeding my anger against a fellow-man , when I would have been better on my knees , crying on God for mercy ."
"And at each of Alan 's taunts , I hugged myself ."
`` Ah ! ''
"thinks I to myself , `` I have a better taunt in readiness ; when I lie down and die , you will feel it like a buffet in your face ; ah , what a revenge !"
"ah , how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty ! ''"
"All the while , I was growing worse and worse ."
"Once I had fallen , my leg simply doubling under me , and this had struck Alan for the moment ; but I was afoot so briskly , and set off again with such a natural manner , that he soon forgot the incident ."
"Flushes of heat went over me , and then spasms of shuddering ."
The stitch in my side was hardly bearable .
"At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther : and with that , there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan , let my anger blaze , and be done with my life in a more sudden manner ."
He had just called me `` Whig . ''
I stopped .
"`` Mr. Stewart , '' said I , in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string , `` you are older than I am , and should know your manners ."
Do you think it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth ?
"I thought , where folk differed , it was the part of gentlemen to differ civilly ; and if I did not , I may tell you I could find a better taunt than some of yours . ''"
"Alan had stopped opposite to me , his hat cocked , his hands in his breeches pockets , his head a little on one side ."
"He listened , smiling evilly , as I could see by the starlight ; and when I had done he began to whistle a Jacobite air ."
"It was the air made in mockery of General Cope 's defeat at Preston Pans : `` Hey , Johnnie Cope , are ye waukin ' yet ?"
And are your drums a-beatin ' yet ? ''
"And it came in my mind that Alan , on the day of that battle , had been engaged upon the royal side ."
"`` Why do ye take that air , Mr. Stewart ? ''"
I do n't mind as long as Grandma is all right .
"She is away to-night , or I should not be here , '' he added , as if some excuse was necessary ."
"Merry needed no hint , for her tender heart was touched by the vision of her friend in a garret , and she suddenly rejoiced that there was ham and eggs for supper , so that he might be well fed once , at least , before he went away to feed on artistic crusts ."
"`` Being here , come in and spend the evening ."
"The boys will like to hear the news , and so will father ."
"Do , now . ''"
"It was impossible to refuse the invitation he had been longing for , and in they went to the great delight of Roxy , who instantly retired to the pantry , smiling significantly , and brought out the most elaborate pie in honor of the occasion ."
"Merry touched up the table , and put a little vase of flowers in the middle to redeem the vulgarity of doughnuts ."
"Of course the boys upset it , but as there was company nothing was said , and Ralph devoured his supper with the appetite of a hungry boy , while watching Merry eat bread and cream out of an old-fashioned silver porringer , and thinking it the sweetest sight he ever beheld ."
"Then the young people gathered about the table , full of the new plans , and the elders listened as they rested after the week 's work ."
"A pleasant evening , for they all liked Ralph , but as the parents watched Merry sitting among the great lads like a little queen among her subjects , half unconscious as yet of the power in her hands , they nodded to one another , and then shook their heads as if they said , -- `` I 'm afraid the time is coming , mother . ''"
"`` No danger as long as she do n't know it , father . ''"
"At nine the boys went off to the barn , the farmer to wind up the eight-day clock , and the housewife to see how the baked beans and Indian pudding for to-morrow were getting on in the oven ."
"Ralph took up his hat to go , saying as he looked at the shade on the tall student lamp , -- `` What a good light that gives !"
"I can see it as I go home every night , and it burns up here like a beacon ."
"I always look for it , and it hardly ever fails to be burning ."
"Sort of cheers up the way , you know , when I 'm tired or low in my mind . ''"
`` Then I 'm very glad I got it .
"I liked the shape , but the boys laughed at it as they did at my bulrushes in a ginger-jar over there ."
"I 'd been reading about ` household art , ' and I thought I 'd try a little , '' answered Merry , laughing at her own whims ."
"`` You 've got a better sort of household art , I think , for you make people happy and places pretty , without fussing over it ."
"This room is ever so much improved every time I come , though I hardly see what it is except the flowers , '' said Ralph , looking from the girl to the tall calla that bent its white cup above her as if to pour its dew upon her head ."
`` Is n't that lovely ?
I tried to draw it -- the shape was so graceful I wanted to keep it .
But I could n't .
Is n't it a pity such beautiful things wo n't last forever ? ''
and Merry looked regretfully at the half-faded one that grew beside the fresh blossom .
`` I can keep it for you .
It would look well in plaster .
May I ? ''
asked Ralph .
"`` Thank you , I should like that very much ."
I fondly expected it would turn my hair black -- and it turned it green .
So it had to be cut off . ''
"`` You had a narrow escape , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' exclaimed Susan ."
`` Of course you were too young then to know what a German was .
It was a special mercy of Providence that it was only green dye and not poison . ''
"`` It seems hundreds of years since those Green Gables days , '' sighed Mrs. Blythe ."
`` They belonged to another world altogether .
Life has been cut in two by the chasm of war .
What is ahead I do n't know -- but it ca n't be a bit like the past .
I wonder if those of us who have lived half our lives in the old world will ever feel wholly at home in the new . ''
"`` Have you noticed , '' asked Miss Oliver , glancing up from her book , `` how everything written before the war seems so far away now , too ?"
One feels as if one was reading something as ancient as the Iliad .
This poem of Wordsworth 's -- the Senior class have it in their entrance work -- I 've been glancing over it .
"Its classic calm and repose and the beauty of the lines seem to belong to another planet , and to have as little to do with the present world-welter as the evening star . ''"
"`` The only thing that I find much comfort in reading nowadays is the Bible , '' remarked Susan , whisking her biscuits into the oven ."
`` There are so many passages in it that seem to me exactly descriptive of the Huns .
"Old Highland Sandy declares that there is no doubt that the Kaiser is the Anti-Christ spoken of in Revelations , but I do not go as far as that ."
"It would , in my humble opinion , Mrs. Dr. dear , be too great an honour for him . ''"
"Early one morning , several days later , Miranda Pryor slipped up to Ingleside , ostensibly to get some Red Cross sewing , but in reality to talk over with sympathetic Rilla troubles that were past bearing alone ."
"She brought her dog with her -- an over-fed , bandy-legged little animal very dear to her heart because Joe Milgrave had given it to her when it was a puppy ."
Mr. Pryor regarded all dogs with disfavour ; but in those days he had looked kindly upon Joe as a suitor for Miranda 's hand and so he had allowed her to keep the puppy .
"Miranda was so grateful that she endeavoured to please her father by naming her dog after his political idol , the great Liberal chieftain , Sir Wilfrid Laurier -- though his title was soon abbreviated to Wilfy ."
Sir Wilfrid grew and flourished and waxed fat ; but Miranda spoiled him absurdly and nobody else liked him .
Rilla especially hated him because of his detestable trick of lying flat on his back and entreating you with waving paws to tickle his sleek stomach .
"When she saw that Miranda 's pale eyes bore unmistakable testimony of her having cried all night , Rilla asked her to come up to her room , knowing Miranda had a tale of woe to tell , but she ordered Sir Wilfrid to remain below ."
"`` Oh , ca n't he come , too ? ''"
said Miranda wistfully .
`` Poor Wilfy wo n't be any bother -- and I wiped his paws so carefully before I brought him in .
He is always so lonesome in a strange place without me -- and very soon he 'll be -- all -- I 'll have left -- to remind me -- of Joe . ''
"Rilla yielded , and Sir Wilfrid , with his tail curled at a saucy angle over his brindled back , trotted triumphantly up the stairs before them ."
"`` Oh , Rilla , '' sobbed Miranda , when they had reached sanctuary ."
`` I 'm so unhappy .
"The doctor and his wife went to the Manse , Shirley and Miss Oliver went they alone knew where , Susan went to the store for household supplies , and Jims went to Dreamland ."
"Rilla put on her georgette gown , knotted up her hair and bound a little double string of pearls around it ."
Then she tucked a cluster of pale pink baby roses at her belt .
Would Ken ask her for a rose for a keepsake ?
She knew that Jem had carried to the trenches in Flanders a faded rose that Faith Meredith had kissed and given him the night before he left .
Rilla looked very sweet when she met Ken in the mingled moonlight and vine shadows of the big veranda .
The hand she gave him was cold and she was so desperately anxious not to lisp that her greeting was prim and precise .
How handsome and tall Kenneth looked in his lieutenant 's uniform !
"It made him seem older , too -- so much so that Rilla felt rather foolish ."
"Had n't it been the height of absurdity for her to suppose that this splendid young officer had anything special to say to her , little Rilla Blythe of Glen St. Mary ?"
"Likely she had n't understood him after all -- he had only meant that he did n't want a mob of folks around making a fuss over him and trying to lionize him , as they had probably done over-harbour ."
"Yes , of course , that was all he meant -- and she , little idiot , had gone and vainly imagined that he did n't want anybody but her ."
"And he would think she had manoeuvred everybody away so that they could be alone together , and he would laugh to himself at her ."
"`` This is better luck than I hoped for , '' said Ken , leaning back in his chair and looking at her with very unconcealed admiration in his eloquent eyes ."
"`` I was sure someone would be hanging about and it was just you I wanted to see , Rilla-my-Rilla . ''"
Rilla 's dream castle flashed into the landscape again .
This was unmistakable enough certainly -- not much doubt as to his meaning here .
"`` There are n't -- so many of us -- to poke around as there used to be , '' she said softly ."
"`` No , that 's so , '' said Ken gently ."
"`` Jem and Walter and the girls away -- it makes a big blank , does n't it ?"
But -- '' he leaned forward until his dark curls almost brushed her hair -- `` does n't Fred Arnold try to fill the blank occasionally .
I 've been told so . ''
"At this moment , before Rilla could make any reply , Jims began to cry at the top of his voice in the room whose open window was just above them -- Jims , who hardly ever cried in the evening ."
"Moreover , he was crying , as Rilla knew from experience , with a vim and energy that betokened that he had been already whimpering softly unheard for some time and was thoroughly exasperated ."
When Jims started in crying like that he made a thorough job of it .
Rilla knew that there was no use to sit still and pretend to ignore him .
He would n't stop ; and conversation of any kind was out of the question when such shrieks and howls were floating over your head .
"Besides , she was afraid Kenneth would think she was utterly unfeeling if she sat still and let a baby cry like that ."
He was not likely acquainted with Morgan 's invaluable volume .
She got up .
"`` Jims has had a nightmare , I think ."
He sometimes has one and he is always badly frightened by it .
"`` Nicely ; she is getting quite mannerly , and begins to see the error of her wild ways . ''"
`` Do n't the boys encourage her in them ? ''
"`` Yes ; but I keep talking , and lately she has improved much ."
"You saw how prettily she shook hands with you , and how gentle she was with Bess ."
"Daisy 's example has its effect upon her , and I 'm quite sure that a few months will work wonders . ''"
"Here Mrs. Jo 's remarks were cut short by the appearance of Nan tearing round the corner at a break-neck pace , driving a mettlesome team of four boys , and followed by Daisy trundling Bess in a wheelbarrow ."
"Hat off , hair flying , whip cracking , and barrow bumping , up they came in a cloud of dust , looking as wild a set of little hoydens as one would wish to see ."
"`` So , these are the model children , are they ?"
"It 's lucky I did n't bring Mrs. Curtis out to see your school for the cultivation of morals and manners ; she would never have recovered from the shock of this spectacle , '' said Mr. Laurie , laughing at Mrs. Jo 's premature rejoicing over Nan 's improvement ."
`` Laugh away ; I 'll succeed yet .
"As you used to say at College , quoting some professor , ` Though the experiment has failed , the principle remains the same , ' '' said Mrs. Bhaer , joining in the merriment ."
"`` I 'm afraid Nan 's example is taking effect upon Daisy , instead of the other way ."
Look at my little princess !
"she has utterly forgotten her dignity , and is screaming like the rest ."
"Young ladies , what does this mean ? ''"
"and Mr. Laurie rescued his small daughter from impending destruction , for the four horses were champing their bits and curvetting madly all about her , as she sat brandishing a great whip in both hands ."
"`` We 're having a race , and I beat , '' shouted Nan ."
"`` I could have run faster , only I was afraid of spilling Bess , '' screamed Daisy ."
`` Hi !
go long ! ''
"cried the princess , giving such a flourish with her whip that the horses ran away , and were seen no more ."
`` My precious child !
come away from this ill-mannered crew before you are quite spoilt .
"Good-by , Jo !"
"Next time I come , I shall expect to find the boys making patchwork . ''"
`` It would n't hurt them a bit .
"I do n't give in , mind you ; for my experiments always fail a few times before they succeed ."
"Love to Amy and my blessed Marmee , '' called Mrs. Jo , as the carriage drove away ; and the last Mr. Laurie saw of her , she was consoling Daisy for her failure by a ride in the wheelbarrow , and looking as if she liked it ."
"Great was the excitement all the week about the repairs in the carriage-house , which went briskly on in spite of the incessant questions , advice , and meddling of the boys ."
"Old Gibbs was nearly driven wild with it all , but managed to do his work nevertheless ; and by Friday night the place was all in order roof mended , shelves up , walls whitewashed , a great window cut at the back , which let in a flood of sunshine , and gave them a fine view of the brook , the meadows , and the distant hills ; and over the great door , painted in red letters , was `` The Laurence Museum . ''"
"All Saturday morning the boys were planning how it should be furnished with their spoils , and when Mr. Laurie arrived , bringing an aquarium which Mrs. Amy said she was tired of , their rapture was great ."
"The afternoon was spent in arranging things , and when the running and lugging and hammering was over , the ladies were invited to behold the institution ."
"He was feeling stuffier and stuffier , and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose , but he pursued them with the vital question in vain ; the timid creatures ran from him , and even the Lancers , when he approached them up the Hump , turned swiftly into a side-walk , on the pretence that they saw him there ."
"-LSB- Illustration : A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them -RSB- Despairing of the fairies , he resolved to consult the birds , but now he remembered , as an odd thing , that all the birds on the weeping-beech had flown away when he alighted on it , and though this had not troubled him at the time , he saw its meaning now ."
Every living thing was shunning him .
Poor little Peter Pan !
"he sat down and cried , and even then he did not know that , for a bird , he was sitting on his wrong part ."
"It is a blessing that he did not know , for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly , and the moment you doubt whether you can fly , you cease for ever to be able to do it ."
"The reason birds can fly and we ca n't is simply that they have perfect faith , for to have faith is to have wings ."
"Now , except by flying , no one can reach the island in the Serpentine , for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there , and there are stakes round it , standing up in the water , on each of which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night ."
"It was to the island that Peter now flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw , and he alighted on it with relief , much heartened to find himself at last at home , as the birds call the island ."
"All of them were asleep , including the sentinels , except Solomon , who was wide awake on one side , and he listened quietly to Peter 's adventures , and then told him their true meaning ."
"` Look at your nightgown , if you do n't believe me , ' Solomon said ; and with staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown , and then at the sleeping birds ."
Not one of them wore anything .
` How many of your toes are thumbs ? '
"said Solomon a little cruelly , and Peter saw , to his consternation , that all his toes were fingers ."
The shock was so great that it drove away his cold .
"` Ruffle your feathers , ' said that grim old Solomon , and Peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers , but he had none ."
"Then he rose up , quaking , and for the first time since he stood on the window ledge , he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Put his strange case before old Solomon Caw -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- ' I think I shall go back to mother , ' he said , timidly ."
"` Good-bye , ' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look ."
But Peter hesitated .
` Why do n't you go ? '
the old one asked politely . '
"I suppose , ' said Peter huskily , ' I suppose I can still fly ? '"
You see he had lost faith .
` Poor little half-and-half ! '
"said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , ` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . '
` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? '
Peter asked tragically .
` How could you get across ? '
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
Sometimes he fell and cut himself ; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion ; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably .
"In the meantime , we could never make out where he got the drink ."
That was the ship 's mystery .
"Watch him as we pleased , we could do nothing to solve it ; and when we asked him to his face , he would only laugh if he were drunk , and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water ."
"He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men , but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright , so nobody was much surprised , nor very sorry , when one dark night , with a head sea , he disappeared entirely and was seen no more ."
`` Overboard ! ''
said the captain .
"`` Well , gentlemen , that saves the trouble of putting him in irons . ''"
"But there we were , without a mate ; and it was necessary , of course , to advance one of the men ."
"The boatswain , Job Anderson , was the likeliest man aboard , and though he kept his old title , he served in a way as mate ."
"Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea , and his knowledge made him very useful , for he often took a watch himself in easy weather ."
"And the coxswain , Israel Hands , was a careful , wily , old , experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything ."
"He was a great confidant of Long John Silver , and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship 's cook , Barbecue , as the men called him ."
"Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck , to have both hands as free as possible ."
"It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead , and propped against it , yielding to every movement of the ship , get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore ."
Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck .
"He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces -- Long John 's earrings , they were called ; and he would hand himself from one place to another , now using the crutch , now trailing it alongside by the lanyard , as quickly as another man could walk ."
Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced .
"`` He 's no common man , Barbecue , '' said the coxswain to me ."
`` He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded ; and brave -- a lion 's nothing alongside of Long John !
I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together -- him unarmed . ''
All the crew respected and even obeyed him .
He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service .
"To me he was unweariedly kind , and always glad to see me in the galley , which he kept as clean as a new pin , the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner ."
"`` Come away , Hawkins , '' he would say ; `` come and have a yarn with John ."
"Nobody more welcome than yourself , my son ."
Sit you down and hear the news .
"Here 's Cap'n Flint -- I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint , after the famous buccaneer -- here 's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v ` yage ."
"Was n't you , cap'n ? ''"
"And the parrot would say , with great rapidity , `` Pieces of eight !"
Pieces of eight !
Pieces of eight ! ''
So he bade them farewell and set out .
"For three days he wandered by the most out-of-the-way paths , but no signs of a tower were to be seen anywhere ."
"On the fourth morning it was just the same , and , filled with despair , he flung himself on the ground under a tree and hid his face in his hands ."
"In a little while he heard a rustling over his head , and looking up , he saw a turtle dove watching him with her bright eyes ."
` Oh dove ! '
"cried the boy , addressing the bird in her own language , ` Oh dove !"
"tell me , I pray you , where is the castle of Come-and-never-go ? '"
"` Poor child , ' answered the dove , ` who has sent you on such a useless quest ? '"
"` My good or evil fortune , ' replied the boy , ' I know not which . '"
"` To get there , ' said the dove , ` you must follow the wind , which to-day is blowing towards the castle . '"
"The boy thanked her , and followed the wind , fearing all the time that it might change its direction and lead him astray ."
But the wind seemed to feel pity for him and blew steadily on .
"With each step the country became more and more dreary , but at nightfall the child could see behind the dark and bare rocks something darker still ."
"This was the tower in which dwelt the witch ; and seizing the knocker he gave three loud knocks , which were echoed in the hollows of the rocks around ."
"The door opened slowly , and there appeared on the threshold an old woman holding up a candle to her face , which was so hideous that the boy involuntarily stepped backwards , almost as frightened by the troop of lizards , beetles and such creatures that surrounded her , as by the woman herself ."
` Who are you who dare to knock at my door and wake me ? '
cried she .
"` Be quick and tell me what you want , or it will be the worse for you . '"
"` Madam , ' answered the child , ' I believe that you alone know the way to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and I pray you to show it to me . '"
"` Very good , ' replied the witch , with something that she meant for a smile , ` but to-day it is late ."
To-morrow you shall go .
"Now enter , and you shall sleep with my lizards . ' '"
"I can not stay , ' said he . '"
"I must go back at once , so as to reach the road from which I started before day dawns . '"
"` If I tell you , will you promise me that you will bring me this jar full of the many-coloured water from the spring in the court-yard of the castle ? '"
asked she .
` If you fail to keep your word I will change you into a lizard for ever . ' '
"I promise , ' answered the boy ."
"Then the old woman called to a very thin dog , and said to him : ` Conduct this pig of a child to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and take care that you warn my friend of his arrival . '"
"And the dog arose and shook itself , and set out ."
"At the end of two hours they stopped in front of a large castle , big and black and gloomy , whose doors stood wide open , although neither sound nor light gave sign of any presence within ."
"The dog , however , seemed to know what to expect , and , after a wild howl , went on ; but the boy , who was uncertain whether this was the quarter of an hour when the giant was asleep , hesitated to follow him , and paused for a moment under a wild olive that grew near by , the only tree which he had beheld since he had parted from the dove ."
"Dick told him his name , and presented Lord Foxham 's signet , which the duke immediately recognised ."
"`` Ye come too soon , '' he said ; `` but why should I complain ?"
"Ye are like me , that was here at watch two hours before the day ."
"But this is the first sally of mine arms ; upon this adventure , Master Shelton , shall I make or mar the quality of my renown ."
"There lie mine enemies , under two old , skilled captains -- Risingham and Brackley -- well posted for strength , I do believe , but yet upon two sides without retreat , enclosed betwixt the sea , the harbour , and the river ."
"Methinks , Shelton , here were a great blow to be stricken , an we could strike it silently and suddenly . ''"
"`` I do think so , indeed , '' cried Dick , warming ."
`` Have ye my Lord Foxham 's notes ? ''
inquired the duke .
"And then , Dick , having explained how he was without them for the moment , made himself bold to offer information every jot as good , of his own knowledge ."
"`` And for mine own part , my lord duke , '' he added , `` an ye had men enough , I would fall on even at this present ."
"For , look ye , at the peep of day the watches of the night are over ; but by day they keep neither watch nor ward -- only scour the outskirts with horsemen ."
"Now , then , when the night watch is already unarmed , and the rest are at their morning cup -- now were the time to break them . ''"
`` How many do ye count ? ''
asked Gloucester .
"`` They number not two thousand , '' Dick replied ."
"`` I have seven hundred in the woods behind us , '' said the duke ; `` seven hundred follow from Kettley , and will be here anon ; behind these , and further , are four hundred more ; and my Lord Foxham hath five hundred half a day from here , at Holywood ."
"Shall we attend their coming , or fall on ? ''"
"`` My lord , '' said Dick , `` when ye hanged these five poor rogues ye did decide the question ."
"Churls although they were , in these uneasy , times they will be lacked and looked for , and the alarm be given ."
"Therefore , my lord , if ye do count upon the advantage of a surprise , ye have not , in my poor opinion , one whole hour in front of you . ''"
"`` I do think so indeed , '' returned Crookback ."
"`` Well , before an hour , ye shall be in the thick o n't , winning spurs ."
"A swift man to Holywood , carrying Lord Foxham 's signet ; another along the road to speed my laggards !"
"Nay , Shelton , by the rood , it may be done ! ''"
Therewith he once more set his trumpet to his lips and blew .
This time he was not long kept waiting .
In a moment the open space about the cross was filled with horse and foot .
"Richard of Gloucester took his place upon the steps , and despatched messenger after messenger to hasten the concentration of the seven hundred men that lay hidden in the immediate neighbourhood among the woods ; and before a quarter of an hour had passed , all his dispositions being taken , he put himself at their head , and began to move down the hill towards Shoreby ."
His plan was simple .
"He was to seize a quarter of the town of Shoreby lying on the right hand of the high road , and make his position good there in the narrow lanes until his reinforcements followed ."
"If Lord Risingham chose to retreat , Richard would follow upon his rear , and take him between two fires ; or , if he preferred to hold the town , he would be shut in a trap , there to be gradually overwhelmed by force of numbers ."
"When the dusk came , Ernest and Maxwell had to catch the last train for town , and the other guests went home , with the exception of Bertha , who was to stay all night ."
"Just as soon as her resignation could be effected , she was to join her brother ."
"`` Meanwhile , I 'll see about getting a house to put you in , '' said Max ."
"`` No more boarding out for me , Ernest ."
You may consider me as a family man henceforth . ''
Frances and Alma talked it all over before they went to sleep that night .
"`` Just think , '' said Frances , `` if we had n't asked her here today she might never have found her brother !"
"It 's all Mother 's doing , bless her !"
"Things do happen like a storybook sometimes , do n't they , Al ?"

A Correspondence and A Climax At sunset Sidney hurried to her room to take off the soiled and faded cotton dress she had worn while milking .
She had milked eight cows and pumped water for the milk-cans afterward in the fag-end of a hot summer day .
"She did that every night , but tonight she had hurried more than usual because she wanted to get her letter written before the early farm bedtime ."
She had been thinking it out while she milked the cows in the stuffy little pen behind the barn .
This monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life .
"Existence would have been , so Sidney thought , a dreary , unbearable blank without it ."
She cast aside her milking-dress with a thrill of distaste that tingled to her rosy fingertips .
As she slipped into her blue-print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below .
Sidney ran out to the dark little entry and leaned over the stair railing .
"Below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing , crying , quarrelling children , and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl 's disgusted nostrils ."
Aunt Jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and a year-old baby clinging to the other .
She was a big shapeless woman with a round good-natured face -- cheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was Aunt Jane at all times and occasions .
"`` I want to run over and see how Mrs. Brixby is this evening , Siddy , and you must take care of the baby till I get back . ''"
Sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby .
It never would have occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it .
"She had all her aunt 's sweetness of disposition , if she resembled her in nothing else ."
"She had not grumbled because she had to rise at four that morning , get breakfast , milk the cows , bake bread , prepare seven children for school , get dinner , preserve twenty quarts of strawberries , get tea , and milk the cows again ."
"All her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went , but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly ."
But she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter .
"She carried the baby to her room , spread a quilt on the floor for him to sit on , and gave him a box of empty spools to play with ."
"Fortunately he was a phlegmatic infant , fond of staying in one place , and not given to roaming about in search of adventures ; but Sidney knew she would have to keep an eye on him , and it would be distracting to literary effort ."
She got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow .
Her cheek was swollen and her face ached .
"The schoolroom was cold and smoky , for the fire refused to burn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups ."
Anne sent them to their seats with a sharper tone than she had ever used before .
Anthony Pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger and she saw him whisper something to his seat-mate and then glance at her with a grin .
"Never , so it seemed to Anne , had there been so many squeaky pencils as there were that morning ; and when Barbara Shaw came up to the desk with a sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results ."
"The coal rolled to every part of the room , her slate was broken into fragments , and when she picked herself up , her face , stained with coal dust , sent the boys into roars of laughter ."
Anne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing .
"`` Really , Barbara , '' she said icily , `` if you can not move without falling over something you 'd better remain in your seat ."
It is positively disgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward . ''
"Poor Barbara stumbled back to her desk , her tears combining with the coal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque ."
"Never before had her beloved , sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion , and Barbara was heartbroken ."
"Anne herself felt a prick of conscience but it only served to increase her mental irritation , and the second reader class remember that lesson yet , as well as the unmerciful infliction of arithmetic that followed ."
Just as Anne was snapping the sums out St. Clair Donnell arrived breathlessly .
"`` You are half an hour late , St. Clair , '' Anne reminded him frigidly ."
`` Why is this ? ''
"`` Please , miss , I had to help ma make a pudding for dinner 'cause we 're expecting company and Clarice Almira 's sick , '' was St. Clair 's answer , given in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of great mirth among his mates ."
"`` Take your seat and work out the six problems on page eighty-four of your arithmetic for punishment , '' said Anne ."
St. Clair looked rather amazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his slate .
Then he stealthily passed a small parcel to Joe Sloane across the aisle .
Anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about that parcel .
Old Mrs. Hiram Sloane had lately taken to making and selling `` nut cakes '' by way of adding to her scanty income .
The cakes were specially tempting to small boys and for several weeks Anne had had not a little trouble in regard to them .
"On their way to school the boys would invest their spare cash at Mrs. Hiram 's , bring the cakes along with them to school , and , if possible , eat them and treat their mates during school hours ."
"Anne had warned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be confiscated ; and yet here was St. Clair Donnell coolly passing a parcel of them , wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper Mrs. Hiram used , under her very eyes ."
"`` Joseph , '' said Anne quietly , `` bring that parcel here . ''"
"Joe , startled and abashed , obeyed ."
He was a fat urchin who always blushed and stuttered when he was frightened .
Never did anybody look more guilty than poor Joe at that moment .
"`` Throw it into the fire , '' said Anne ."
Joe looked very blank .
"`` P ... p ... p ... lease , m ... m ... miss , '' he began ."
"`` Do as I tell you , Joseph , without any words about it . ''"
It was Peter 's cockiness .
"This had got on Hook 's nerves ; it made his iron claw twitch , and at night it disturbed him like an insect ."
"While Peter lived , the tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come ."
"The question now was how to get down the trees , or how to get his dogs down ?"
"He ran his greedy eyes over them , searching for the thinnest ones ."
"They wriggled uncomfortably , for they knew he would not scruple -LSB- hesitate -RSB- to ram them down with poles ."
"In the meantime , what of the boys ?"
"We have seen them at the first clang of the weapons , turned as it were into stone figures , open-mouthed , all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter ; and we return to them as their mouths close , and their arms fall to their sides ."
"The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose , passed like a fierce gust of wind ; but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate ."
Which side had won ?
"The pirates , listening avidly at the mouths of the trees , heard the question put by every boy , and alas , they also heard Peter 's answer ."
"`` If the redskins have won , '' he said , `` they will beat the tom-tom ; it is always their sign of victory . ''"
"Now Smee had found the tom-tom , and was at that moment sitting on it ."
"`` You will never hear the tom-tom again , '' he muttered , but inaudibly of course , for strict silence had been enjoined -LSB- urged -RSB- ."
"To his amazement Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom , and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order ."
"Never , probably , had this simple man admired Hook so much ."
"Twice Smee beat upon the instrument , and then stopped to listen gleefully ."
"`` The tom-tom , '' the miscreants heard Peter cry ; `` an Indian victory ! ''"
"The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above , and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter ."
"This puzzled the pirates , but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees ."
They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands .
"Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders : one man to each tree , and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart ."
Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES ?
The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better .
The first to emerge from his tree was Curly .
"He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco , who flung him to Smee , who flung him to Starkey , who flung him to Bill Jukes , who flung him to Noodler , and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate ."
"All the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner ; and several of them were in the air at a time , like bales of goods flung from hand to hand ."
"A different treatment was accorded to Wendy , who came last ."
"With ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her , and , offering her his arm , escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged ."
"He did it with such an air , he was so frightfully DISTINGUE -LSB- imposingly distinguished -RSB- , that she was too fascinated to cry out ."
She was only a little girl .
"Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her , and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results ."
"You see , sir , here it is ."
"I get a rough answer , do I not ?"
"Well , if I speak back , pikes will be going in two shakes ; if I do n't , Silver will see there 's something under that , and the game 's up ."
"Now , we 've only one man to rely on . ''"
`` And who is that ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` Silver , sir , '' returned the captain ; `` he 's as anxious as you and I to smother things up ."
"This is a tiff ; he 'd soon talk 'em out of it if he had the chance , and what I propose to do is to give him the chance ."
Let 's allow the men an afternoon ashore .
"If they all go , why we 'll fight the ship ."
"If they none of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and God defend the right ."
"If some go , you mark my words , sir , Silver 'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as lambs . ''"
"It was so decided ; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men ; Hunter , Joyce , and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for , and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew ."
"`` My lads , '' said he , `` we 've had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts ."
"A turn ashore 'll hurt nobody -- the boats are still in the water ; you can take the gigs , and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon ."
I 'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown . ''
"I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed , for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage ."
The captain was too bright to be in the way .
"He whipped out of sight in a moment , leaving Silver to arrange the party , and I fancy it was as well he did so ."
"Had he been on deck , he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation ."
It was as plain as day .
"Silver was the captain , and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it ."
The honest hands -- and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board -- must have been very stupid fellows .
"Or rather , I suppose the truth was this , that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders -- only some more , some less ; and a few , being good fellows in the main , could neither be led nor driven any further ."
It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men .
"At last , however , the party was made up ."
"Six fellows were to stay on board , and the remaining thirteen , including Silver , began to embark ."
Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives .
"If six men were left by Silver , it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship ; and since only six were left , it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance ."
It occurred to me at once to go ashore .
"In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat , and almost at the same moment she shoved off ."
"No one took notice of me , only the bow oar saying , `` Is that you , Jim ?"
"`` Budge , you skulk ! ''"
cried Pew .
`` Dirk was a fool and a coward from the first -- you would n't mind him .
They must be close by ; they ca n't be far ; you have your hands on it .
"Scatter and look for them , dogs !"
"Oh , shiver my soul , '' he cried , `` if I had eyes ! ''"
"This appeal seemed to produce some effect , for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber , but half-heartedly , I thought , and with half an eye to their own danger all the time , while the rest stood irresolute on the road ."
"`` You have your hands on thousands , you fools , and you hang a leg !"
"You 'd be as rich as kings if you could find it , and you know it 's here , and you stand there skulking ."
"There was n't one of you dared face Bill , and I did it -- a blind man !"
And I 'm to lose my chance for you !
"I 'm to be a poor , crawling beggar , sponging for rum , when I might be rolling in a coach !"
If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still . ''
"`` Hang it , Pew , we 've got the doubloons ! ''"
grumbled one .
"`` They might have hid the blessed thing , '' said another ."
"`` Take the Georges , Pew , and do n't stand here squalling . ''"
"Squalling was the word for it ; Pew 's anger rose so high at these objections till at last , his passion completely taking the upper hand , he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one ."
"These , in their turn , cursed back at the blind miscreant , threatened him in horrid terms , and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp ."
"This quarrel was the saving of us , for while it was still raging , another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet -- the tramp of horses galloping ."
"Almost at the same time a pistol-shot , flash and report , came from the hedge side ."
"And that was plainly the last signal of danger , for the buccaneers turned at once and ran , separating in every direction , one seaward along the cove , one slant across the hill , and so on , so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew ."
"Him they had deserted , whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not ; but there he remained behind , tapping up and down the road in a frenzy , and groping and calling for his comrades ."
"Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me , towards the hamlet , crying , `` Johnny , Black Dog , Dirk , '' and other names , `` you wo n't leave old Pew , mates -- not old Pew ! ''"
"Just then the noise of horses topped the rise , and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope ."
"At this Pew saw his error , turned with a scream , and ran straight for the ditch , into which he rolled ."
"But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash , now utterly bewildered , right under the nearest of the coming horses ."
"The rider tried to save him , but in vain ."
Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night ; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by .
"He fell on his side , then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more ."
I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders .
"They were pulling up , at any rate , horrified at the accident ; and I soon saw what they were ."
"Alan wrote it , putting all thought of Lynde Oliver sternly out of his mind for the time being ."
He had no notion of falling in love with her .
He knew nothing of love and imagined that it counted for nothing in his life .
"He admitted that his curiosity was aflame about the girl , but it never occurred to him that she meant or could mean anything to him but an attractive enigma which once solved would lose its attraction ."
"The young women he knew in Rexton , whose simple , pleasant friendship he valued , had the placid , domestic charm of their own sweet-breathed , windless orchards ."
"Lynde Oliver had the fascination of the lake shore -- wild , remote , untamed -- the lure of the wilderness and the primitive ."
"There was nothing more personal in his thought of her , and yet when he recalled Isabel King 's sneer he felt an almost personal resentment ."
* * * * * During the following fortnight Alan made many trips to the shore -- and he always went by the branch road to the Four Winds point .
He did not attempt to conceal from himself that he hoped to meet Lynde Oliver again .
In this he was unsuccessful .
Sometimes he saw her at a distance along the shore but she always disappeared as soon as seen .
"Occasionally as he crossed the point he saw her working in her garden but he never went very near the house , feeling that he had no right to spy on it or her in any way ."
He soon became convinced that she avoided him purposely and the conviction piqued him .
He felt an odd masterful desire to meet her face to face and make her look at him .
Sometimes he called himself a fool and vowed he would go no more to the Four Winds shore .
Yet he inevitably went .
He did not find in the shore the comfort and inspiration he had formerly found .
"Something had come between his soul and the soul of the wilderness -- something he did not recognize or formulate -- a nameless , haunting longing that shaped itself about the memory of a cold sweet face and starry , indifferent eyes , grey as the lake at dawn ."
"Of Captain Anthony he never got even a glimpse , but he saw the old cousin several times , going and coming about the yard and its environs ."
"Finally one day he met her , coming up a path which led to a spring down in a firry hollow ."
She was carrying two heavy pails of water and Alan asked permission to help her .
"He half expected a repulse , for the tall , grim old woman had a rather stern and forbidding look , but after gazing at him a moment in a somewhat scrutinizing manner she said briefly , `` You may , if you like . ''"
"Alan took the pails and followed her , the path not being wide enough for two ."
"She strode on before him at a rapid , vigorous pace until they came out into the yard by the house ."
Alan felt his heart beating foolishly .
Would he see Lynde Oliver ?
"Would -- `` You may carry the water there , '' the old woman said , pointing to a little outhouse near the pines ."
`` I 'm washing -- the spring water is softer than the well water .
Thank you '' -- as Alan set the pails down on a bench -- `` I 'm not so young as I was and bringing the water so far tires me .
Lynde always brings it for me when she 's home . ''
"She stood before him in the narrow doorway , blocking his exit , and looked at him with keen , deep-set dark eyes ."
"In spite of her withered aspect and wrinkled face , she was not an uncomely old woman and there was about her a dignity of carriage and manner that pleased Alan ."
"Many times a shining stone at the bottom of the stream was taken for the slipper itself , and every evening saw a band of dripping downcast men returning homewards ."
"But one youth always lingered longer than the rest , and night would still see him engaged in the search , though his clothes stuck to his skin and his teeth chattered ."
"One day , when the king was lying on his bed racked with pain , he heard the noise of a scuffle going on in his antechamber , and rang a golden bell that stood by his side to summon one of his servants ."
"` Sire , ' answered the attendant , when the king inquired what was the matter , ` the noise you heard was caused by a young man from the town , who has had the impudence to come here to ask if he may measure your majesty 's foot , so as to make you another slipper in place of the lost one . '"
` And what have you done to the youth ? '
said the king .
"` The servants pushed him out of the palace , and , added a few blows to teach him not to be insolent , ' replied the man ."
"` Then they did very ill , ' answered the king , with a frown ."
"` He came here from kindness , and there was no reason to maltreat him . '"
"` Oh , my lord , he had the audacity to wish to touch your majesty 's sacred person -- he , a good-for-nothing boy , a mere shoemaker 's apprentice , perhaps !"
And even if he could make shoes to perfection they would be no use without the soothing balsam . '
"The king remained silent for a few moments , then he said : ` Never mind ."
Go and fetch the youth and bring him to me .
I would gladly try any remedy that may relieve my pain . '
"So , soon afterwards , the youth , who had not gone far from the palace , was caught and ushered into the king 's presence ."
"He was tall and handsome and , though he professed to make shoes , his manners were good and modest , and he bowed low as he begged the king not only to allow him to take the measure of his foot , but also to suffer him to place a healing plaster over the wound ."
"Balancin was pleased with the young man 's voice and appearance , and thought that he looked as if he knew what he was doing ."
"So he stretched out his bad foot which the youth examined with great attention , and then gently laid on the plaster ."
"Very shortly the ointment began to soothe the sharp pain , and the king , whose confidence increased every moment , begged the young man to tell him his name . '"
"I have no parents ; they died when I was six , sire , ' replied the youth , modestly ."
"` Everyone in the town calls me Gilguerillo , because , when I was little , I went singing through the world in spite of my misfortunes ."
Luckily for me I was born to be happy . '
` And you really think you can cure me ? '
asked the king .
"` Completely , my lord , ' answered Gilguerillo ."
` And how long do you think it will take ? '
"` It is not an easy task ; but I will try to finish it in a fortnight , ' replied the youth ."
A fortnight seemed to the king a long time to make one slipper .
But he only said : ` Do you need anything to help you ? '
"` Only a good horse , if your majesty will be kind enough to give me one , ' answered Gilguerillo ."
"And the reply was so unexpected that the courtiers could hardly restrain their smiles , while the king stared silently ."
"` You shall have the horse , ' he said at last , ` and I shall expect you back in a fortnight ."
Peter flung out his arms .
"There were no children there , and it was night time ; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland , and who were therefore nearer to him than you think : boys and girls in their nighties , and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees ."
`` Do you believe ? ''
he cried .
Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate .
"She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative , and then again she was n't sure ."
`` What do you think ? ''
she asked Peter .
"`` If you believe , '' he shouted to them , `` clap your hands ; do n't let Tink die . ''"
Many clapped .
Some did n't .
A few beasts hissed .
The clapping stopped suddenly ; as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening ; but already Tink was saved .
"First her voice grew strong , then she popped out of bed , then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever ."
"She never thought of thanking those who believed , but she would have like to get at the ones who had hissed ."
`` And now to rescue Wendy ! ''
"The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree , begirt -LSB- belted -RSB- with weapons and wearing little else , to set out upon his perilous quest ."
It was not such a night as he would have chosen .
"He had hoped to fly , keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes ; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees , thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir ."
He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach .
"There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion , at which happily he was an adept -LSB- expert -RSB- ."
"But in what direction , for he could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship ?"
"A light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks ; and a deathly silence pervaded the island , as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage ."
"He had taught the children something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell , and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it ."
"Slightly , if he had an opportunity , would blaze -LSB- cut a mark in -RSB- the trees , for instance , Curly would drop seeds , and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place ."
"The morning was needed to search for such guidance , and he could not wait ."
"The upper world had called him , but would give no help ."
"The crocodile passed him , but not another living thing , not a sound , not a movement ; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree , or stalking him from behind ."
He swore this terrible oath : `` Hook or me this time . ''
"Now he crawled forward like a snake , and again erect , he darted across a space on which the moonlight played , one finger on his lip and his dagger at the ready ."
He was frightfully happy .
"Chapter 14 THE PIRATE SHIP One green light squinting over Kidd 's Creek , which is near the mouth of the pirate river , marked where the brig , the JOLLY ROGER , lay , low in the water ; a rakish-looking -LSB- speedy-looking -RSB- craft foul to the hull , every beam in her detestable , like ground strewn with mangled feathers ."
"The front door of Four Winds opened directly into a wide , low-ceilinged living room , furnished with simplicity and good taste ."
"Leaving the two men there , Lynde and the old cousin vanished , and Alan found himself talking freely with the Captain who could , as it appeared , talk well on many subjects far removed from Four Winds ."
"He was evidently a clever , self-educated man , somewhat opinionated and given to sarcasm ; he never made any references to his own past life or experiences , but Alan discovered him to be surprisingly well read in politics and science ."
"Sometimes in the pauses of the conversation Alan found the older man looking at him in a furtive way he did not like , but the Captain was such an improvement on what he had been led to expect that he was not inclined to be over critical ."
"At least , this was what he honestly thought ."
He did not suspect that it was because this man was Lynde 's father that he wished to think as well as possible of him .
Presently Lynde came in .
"She had changed her outdoor dress , stained with moss and soil in her fall , for a soft clinging garment of some pale yellow material , and her long , thick braid of hair hung over her shoulder ."
She sat mutely down in a dim corner and took no part in the conversation except to answer briefly the remarks which Alan addressed to her .
Emily came in and lighted the lamp on the table .
"She was as grim and unsmiling as ever , yet she cast a look of satisfaction on Alan as she passed out ."
"One dog lay down at Lynde 's feet , the other sat on his haunches by her side and laid his head on her lap ."
"Rexton and its quiet round of parish duties seemed thousands of miles away from Alan , and he wondered a little if this were not all a dream ."
When he went away the Captain invited him back .
"`` If you like to come , that is , '' he said brusquely , `` and always as the man , not the priest , remember ."
I do n't want you by and by to be slyly slipping in the thin end of any professional wedges .
You 'll waste your time if you do .
"Come as man to man and you 'll be welcome , for I like you -- and it 's few men I like ."
But do n't try to talk religion to me . ''
"`` I never talk religion , '' said Alan emphatically ."
`` I try to live it .
"I 'll not come to your house as a self-appointed missionary , sir , but I shall certainly act and speak at all times as my conscience and my reverence for my vocation demands ."
"If I respect your beliefs , whatever they may be , I shall expect you to respect mine , Captain Oliver . ''"
"`` Oh , I wo n't insult your God , '' said the Captain with a faint sneer ."
Alan went home in a tumult of contending feelings .
"He did not altogether like Captain Anthony -- that was very clear to him , and yet there was something about the man that attracted him ."
"Intellectually he was a worthy foeman , and Alan had often longed for such since coming to Rexton ."
"He missed the keen , stimulating debates of his college days and , now there seemed a chance of renewing them , he was eager to grasp it ."
And Lynde -- how beautiful she was !
What though she shared -- as was not unlikely -- in her father 's lack of belief ?
She could not be essentially irreligious -- that were impossible in a true woman .
Might not this be his opportunity to help her -- to lead her into dearer light ?
Here they would take out the bits of bread they had saved from their breakfasts and crumble them for the birds .
"In return , the birds taught them many things : how to get up early in the morning , how to sing , and how to talk their language , which very few people know ."
"But though the little orphans did their best to avoid quarrelling with their foster-brothers , it was very difficult always to keep the peace ."
"Matters got worse and worse till , one morning , the eldest boy said to the twins : ` It is all very well for you to pretend that you have such good manners , and are so much better than we , but we have at least a father and mother , while you have only got the river , like the toads and the frogs . '"
The poor children did not answer the insult ; but it made them very unhappy .
"And they told each other in whispers that they could not stay there any longer , but must go into the world and seek their fortunes ."
So next day they arose as early as the birds and stole downstairs without anybody hearing them .
"One window was open , and they crept softly out and ran to the side of the river ."
"Then , feeling as if they had found a friend , they walked along its banks , hoping that by-and-by they should meet some one to take care of them ."
"The whole of that day they went steadily on without seeing a living creature , till , in the evening , weary and footsore , they saw before them a small hut ."
"This raised their spirits for a moment ; but the door was shut , and the hut seemed empty , and so great was their disappointment that they almost cried ."
"However , the boy fought down his tears , and said cheerfully : ` Well , at any rate here is a bench where we can sit down , and when we are rested we will think what is best to do next . '"
"Then they sat down , and for some time they were too tired even to notice anything ; but by-and-by they saw that under the tiles of the roof a number of swallows were sitting , chattering merrily to each other ."
"Of course the swallows had no idea that the children understood their language , or they would not have talked so freely ; but , as it was , they said whatever came into their heads ."
"` Good evening , my fine city madam , ' remarked a swallow , whose manners were rather rough and countryfied to another who looked particularly distinguished ."
"` Happy , indeed , are the eyes that behold you !"
"Only think of your having returned to your long-forgotten country friends , after you have lived for years in a palace ! ' '"
"I have inherited this nest from my parents , ' replied the other , ` and as they left it to me I certainly shall make it my home ."
"But , ' she added politely , ' I hope that you and all your family are well ? '"
"` Very well indeed , I am glad to say ."
"But my poor daughter had , a short time ago , such bad inflammation in her eyes that she would have gone blind had I not been able to find the magic herb , which cured her at once . '"
` And how is the nightingale singing ?
Does the lark soar as high as ever ?
And does the linnet dress herself as smartly ? '
But here the country swallow drew herself up . '
"I never talk gossip , ' she said severely ."
"` Our people , who were once so innocent and well-behaved , have been corrupted by the bad examples of men ."
It is a thousand pities . '
` What !
"innocence and good behaviour are not to be met with among birds , nor in the country !"
"My dear friend , what are you saying ? '"
` The truth and nothing more .
Sidney liked the letter and answered it .
Since then they had written to each other regularly .
"There was nothing sentimental , hinted at or implied , in the correspondence ."
"Whatever the faults of Sidney 's romantic visions were , they did not tend to precocious flirtation ."
"The Plainfield boys , attracted by her beauty and repelled by her indifference and aloofness , could have told that ."
"She never expected to meet John Lincoln , nor did she wish to do so ."
In the correspondence itself she found her pleasure .
"John Lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains , so alien and remote from snug , humdrum Plainfield life that Sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the Bar N ."
"As for Sidney 's own letter , this is the way it read as she wrote it : `` The Evergreens , '' Plainfield ."
Dear Mr. Lincoln : The very best letter I can write in the half-hour before the carriage will be at the door to take me to Mrs. Braddon 's dance shall be yours tonight .
"I am sitting here in the library arrayed in my smartest , newest , whitest , silkiest gown , with a string of pearls which Uncle James gave me today about my throat -- the dear , glistening , sheeny things !"
And I am looking forward to the `` dances and delight '' of the evening with keen anticipation .
You asked me in your last letter if I did not sometimes grow weary of my endless round of dances and dinners and social functions .
"No , no , never !"
"I enjoy every one of them , every minute of them ."
"I love life and its bloom and brilliancy ; I love meeting new people ; I love the ripple of music , the hum of laughter and conversation ."
Every morning when I awaken the new day seems to me to be a good fairy who will bring me some beautiful gift of joy .
The gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey mare Lady .
The thrill of it is in my veins yet .
"I distanced the others who rode with me and led the homeward canter alone , rocking along a dark , gleaming road , shadowy with tall firs and pines , whose balsam made all the air resinous around me ."
"Before me was a long valley filled with purple dusk , and beyond it meadows of sunset and great lakes of saffron and rose where a soul might lose itself in colour ."
"On my right was the harbour , silvered over with a rising moon ."
"Oh , it was all glorious -- the clear air with its salt-sea tang , the aroma of the pines , the laughter of my friends behind me , the spring and rhythm of Lady 's grey satin body beneath me !"
"I wanted to ride on so forever , straight into the heart of the sunset ."
Then home and to dinner .
"We have a houseful of guests at present -- one of them an old statesman with a massive silver head , and eyes that have looked into people 's thoughts so long that you have an uncanny feeling that they can see right through your soul and read motives you dare not avow even to yourself ."
"I was terribly in awe of him at first , but when I got acquainted with him I found him charming ."
He is not above talking delightful nonsense even to a girl .
"I sat by him at dinner , and he talked to me -- not nonsense , either , this time ."
He told me of his political contests and diplomatic battles ; he was wise and witty and whimsical .
"I felt as if I were drinking some rare , stimulating mental wine ."
What a privilege it is to meet such men and take a peep through their wise eyes at the fascinating game of empire-building !
"The Rattlesnake, for it was he, raised his head to look at the bird. The young Blue Jay saw that his eyes were very bright. He looked right into them, and could see little pictures of himself upon their shining surfaces. He stood still to look, and the Rattlesnake came nearer. Then the young Blue Jay tried to see his tail, but he couldn't look away from the Rattlesnake's eyes, though he tried ever so hard."
"The Rattlesnake now coiled up his body, flattened out his head, and showed his teeth, while all the time his queer forked tongue ran in and out of his mouth. Then the young Blue Jay tried to move and found that he couldn't. All he could do was to stand there and watch those glowing eyes and listen to the song which the Rattlesnake began to sing:"
"""Through grass and fern,   With many a turn,     My shining body I draw."
"In woodland shade   My home is made,     For this is the Forest Law."
"""Whoever tries   To look in my eyes     Comes near to my poisoned jaw;   And birds o'erbold   I charm and hold,     For this is the Forest Law."""
"The Rattlesnake drew nearer and nearer, and the young Blue Jay was shaking with fright, when there was a rustle of wings, and his father and mother flew down and around the Rattlesnake, screaming loudly to all the other Jays, and making the Snake turn away from the helpless little bird he had been about to strike. It was a long time before the forest was quiet again, and when it was, the Blue Jay family were safely in their nest, and the Rattlesnake had gone home without his supper."
"After the young Blue Jay got over his fright, he began to complain because he had not seen the Rattlesnake's tail. Then, indeed, his patient mother gave him such a scolding as he had never had in all his life, and his father said that he deserved a sound pecking for his foolishness."
"When the young Blue Jay showed that he was sorry for all the trouble that he had made, his parents let him have some supper and go to bed; but not until he had learned two sayings which he was always to remember. And these were the sayings: ""A really brave bird dares to be afraid of some things,"" and, ""If you go near enough to see the tail of a danger, you may be struck by its head."""
THE RED SQUIRRELS BEGIN HOUSEKEEPING
"The first thing that Mr. Red Squirrel did after coming to the forest and meeting the Gray Squirrel was to look for something to eat. It was not a good season for a stranger who had no hidden store of nuts and seeds to draw upon. The apples and corn were not ripe, and last year's seeds and acorns were nearly gone. What few remained here and there had lost their sweet and wholesome taste. Poor Mr. Red Squirrel began to wish that he had eaten breakfast before he ran away. He even went to the edge of the forest and looked over toward the farmhouse, where his open cage hung in the sunshine. He knew that there were nuts and a fresh bit of fruit inside of it, and his mouth watered at the thought of them, but he was a sensible young fellow, and he knew that if he went back to eat, the cage door would be snapped shut, and he would never again be free to scamper in the beautiful trees."
"""I will starve first!"" he said to himself, and he was so much in earnest that he spoke quite loudly."
"The words were hardly out of his mouth when ""Pft!"" a fat acorn came down at his feet. He caught it up with his forepaws before looking around. It was smooth and glossy, not at all as though it had passed a long winter on an oak branch. He took a good nibble at it and then looked up to see if there were more on the tree above him. You can think how surprised he was to find himself sitting beneath a maple, for in all the years since the world began no maple has ever borne acorns."
"""There are no more to come,"" he said. ""I must take small bites and make it last as long as I can."" And he turned it around and around, clutching it tightly with his long, crooked claws, so that not the tiniest bit could be lost. At last it was all eaten, not a crumb was left, and then ""Pft!"" down came a walnut. This hit him squarely on the back, but he was too hungry to mind, and he ate it all, just stopping long enough to say:"
"""If this maple bears such fruit as acorns and walnuts, I should like to live in a maple grove."""
"Next came a hazelnut, then a butternut, and last of all a fat kernel of yellow corn. He knew now that some friend was hidden in the branches above, so he tucked the corn in one of his cheek-pockets, and scampered up the maple trunk to find out who it was. He saw a whisking reddish-brown tail, and knew that some other Red Squirrel was there. But whoever it was did not mean to be caught, and such a chase as he had!"
"Just as he thought he had overtaken his unknown friend, he could see nothing more of her, and he was almost vexed to think how careless he must have been to miss her. He ran up and down the tree on which he last saw her, and found a little hollow in one of its large branches. He looked in, and there she was, the same dainty creature whom he had so often watched from his cage. He could see that she was breathless from running so fast, yet she pretended to be surprised at seeing him."
"Perhaps she now thought that she had been too bold in giving him food, and so wanted him to think that it had been somebody else."
"""Good morning!"" said he. ""Thank you very much for your kindness."""
"""What do you mean?"" said she."
"""As though you didn't know!"" he answered. ""I never heard of a maple tree that bore acorns, nuts, and corn, and that in the springtime."""
"""Oh, well,"" said she, tossing her pretty head, ""you have lived in a cage and may not know what our forest trees can do."""
"That was a rather saucy thing to say, but Mr. Red Squirrel knew her kind heart and that she said it only in mischief. ""How do you know I have lived in a cage?"" he asked."
"""I I thought you looked like the Squirrel at the farmhouse,"" she said; and then forgetting herself, she added, ""You did look so surprised when that walnut hit you."""
"""Where were you then?"" he asked quickly."
"""Oh! I was on a branch above you,"" she answered, seeing that he now knew all about it. ""You looked so hungry, and I had plenty of food stored away. You may have some whenever you wish. It must have been dreadful in that cage."""
"Now Mr. Red Squirrel had loved his little friend ever since the first time he saw her on the rail fence, but he had never thought she would care for him a tired, discouraged fellow, who had passed such a sorrowful life in prison. Yet when he heard her pitying words, and saw the light in her tender eyes, he wondered if he could win her for his wife."
"""I shall never be able to do anything for you,"" said he. ""You are young and beautiful and know the forest ways. I am a stranger and saddened by my hard life. I wish I could help you."""
"""The Blue Jays! The Blue Jays!"" she cried, starting up. ""They have found my hidden acorns and are eating them."""
"And sure enough, a pair of those handsome robbers were pulling acorn after acorn out of a tree-hollow near by, and eating them as fast as they could. You should have seen Mr. Red Squirrel then! He leaped from branch to branch until he reached the Blue Jays; then he stood by the hole where the acorns were stored, and scolded them."
"""Chickaree-chickaree-quilch-quilch-chickaree-chickaree!"" he said; and that in the Red Squirrel language is a very severe scolding. He jumped about with his head down and his tail jerking, while his eyes gleamed like coals of fire. The Blue Jays made a great fuss and called ""Jay!"
"Jay!"" at him, and made fun of him for being a stranger, but they left at last, and Mr. Red Squirrel turned to his friend."
"When Mr. Red Squirrel first came to the forest, he knew nothing of the way in which they do, and he afterward said that learning forest manners was even harder than running away from his old home. You see, Mr. Red Squirrel was born in the forest, but was carried away from there when he was only a baby. From that time until he was grown, he had never set claw upon a tree, and all he could see of the world he had seen by peeping through the bars of a cage. His cousins in the forest learned to frisk along the fence-tops and to jump from one swaying branch to another, but when this poor little fellow longed for a scamper he could only run around and around in a wire wheel that hummed as it turned, and this made him very dizzy."
"He used to wonder if there were nothing better in life, for he had been taken from his woodland home when he was too young to remember about it."
"One day he saw another Squirrel outside, a dainty little one who looked as though she had never a sad thought. That made him care more than ever to be free, and when he curled down in his cotton nest that night he dreamed about her, and that they were eating acorns together in a tall oak tree."
"The next day Mr. Red Squirrel pretended to be sick. He would not run in the wheel or taste the food in his cage. When his master came to look at him, he moaned pitifully and would not move one leg. His master thought that the leg was broken, and took limp little Mr. Red Squirrel in his hand to the window to see what was the matter. The window was up, and when he saw his chance, Mr. Red Squirrel leaped into the open air and was away to the forest. His poor legs were weak from living in such a small cage, but how he ran! His heart thumped wildly under the soft fur of his chest, and his breath came in quick gasps, and still he ran, leaping, scrambling, and sometimes falling, but always nearer the great green trees of his birthplace."
"At last he was safe and sat trembling on the lowest branch of a beech-tree. The forest was a new world to him and he asked many questions of a fat, old Gray Squirrel. The Gray Squirrel was one of those people who know a great deal and think that they know a great, great deal, and want others to think so too. He was so very knowing and important that, although he answered all of Mr. Red Squirrel's questions, he really did not tell him any of the things which he most wanted to know, and this is the way in which they talked:"
"""What is the name of this place?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""This? Why this is the forest, of course,"" answered the Gray Squirrel."
"""We have no other name for it. It is possible that there are other forests in the world, but they cannot be so fine as this, so we call ours 'the forest.'"""
"""Are there pleasant neighbors here?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""Very good, very good. My wife and I do not call on many of them, but still they are good enough people, I think."""
"""Then why don't you call?"""
"""Why? Why? Because they are not in our set. It would never do."" And the Gray Squirrel sat up very straight indeed."
"""Who is that gliding fellow on the ground below?"" asked the newcomer."
"""Is he one of your friends?"""
"""That? That is the Rattlesnake. We never speak to each other. There has always been trouble between our families."""
"""Who lives in that hollow tree yonder?"""
"""Sh, sh! That is where the Great Horned Owl has his home. He is asleep now and must not be awakened, for Squirrels and Owls cannot be friendly."""
"""Why not?"""
"""Because. It has always been so."""
"""And who is that bird just laying an egg in her nest above us?"""
"""Speak softly, please. That is the Cowbird, and it is not her nest. You will get into trouble if you talk such things aloud. She can't help it."
"She has to lay her eggs in other birds' nests, but they don't like it."""
"Mr. Red Squirrel tried very hard to find out the reason for this, but there are always some things for which no reason can be given; and there are many questions which can never be answered, even if one were to ask, ""Why? why? why?"" all day long. So Mr. Red Squirrel, being a wise little fellow, stopped asking, and thought by using his eyes and ears he would in time learn all that he needed to know. He had good eyes and keen ears, and he learned very fast without making many mistakes. He had a very happy life among the forest people, and perhaps that was one reason. He learned not to say things which made his friends feel badly, and he did not ask needless questions. And after all, you know, it would have been very foolish to ask questions which nobody could answer, and worse than foolish to ask about matters which he could find out for himself."
"It is in the forest as in the world outside. We can know that many things are, but we never know why they are."
WHY MR GREAT HORNED OWL HATCHED THE EGGS
"If the Rattlesnake is the king of the forest in the daytime, the Great Horned Owl is the king at night. Indeed, he is much the more powerful of the two, for he is king of air and earth alike and can go wherever he wishes, while the snake can only rule over those who live near the ground or who are so careless as to come to him there."
"There was but one pair of Great Horned Owls in the forest, and they lived in the deepest shade, having their great clumsy nest in the hollow of a tall tree. You might have walked past it a hundred times and never have guessed that any Owls lived there, if you did not notice the round pellets of bone and hair on the grass. They are such hungry fellows that they swallow their food with the bones in it. Then their tough little stomachs go to work, rolling all the pieces of bone and hair into balls and sending them back to be cast out of the Owls' mouths to the ground."
"The Great Horned Owl was a very large bird. His whole body was covered with brown, dull yellow, and white feathers. Even his feet and legs were covered, and all that you could see besides were his black claws and his black hooked bill. Yes, at night you could see his eyes, too, and they were wonderful great eyes that could see in the dark, but they were shut in the daytime when he was resting. His wife, who was the queen of the forest at night, looked exactly like him, only she was larger than he. And that is the way among Owls, the wife is always larger than her husband."
"Every night when the sun had gone down, the Great Horned Owl and his wife would come out of their hollow tree and sit blinking on a branch near by, waiting until it got dark enough for them to see quite plainly."
"As the light faded, the little black spots in their eyes would grow bigger and bigger, and then off they would go on their great soft, noiseless wings, hunting in the grass and among the branches for the supper which they called breakfast."
"Mrs. Owl could not be gone very long at a time, for there were two large round white eggs in the nest which must not get cold. Her husband was on the wing most of the night, and he often flew home with some tender morsel for her. He was really a kind-hearted fellow, although you could never have made the small birds think so. Sometimes his wife would sigh and tell how tired she was of sitting still, and how glad she would be when the eggs were hatched and she could go more with him. When she began to speak of that, the Great Horned Owl would get ready for another flight and go off saying: ""It is too bad. I am so sorry for you. But then, one would never have young Owlets if one didn't stick to the nest."" He was always proud of his children, and he thought himself a very good husband. Perhaps he was; still he had never taken his place on the nest while his wife went hunting."
"For some time they had fair wind and fine weather, but after that they lay wind-bound under a rocky island. So the sailors went ashore and strolled about to spend the time, and there they found a huge egg, almost as big as a little house. So they began to knock it about with large stones, but, after all, they couldn't crack the shell. Then the lad came up with his sword to see what all the noise was about, and when he saw the egg, he thought it a trifle to crack it; so he gave it one blow and the egg split, and out came a chicken as big as an elephant."
"""Now we have done wrong,"" said the lad; ""this can cost us all our lives;"" and then he asked his sailors if they were men enough to sail to Arabia in four-and-twenty hours if they got a fine breeze. Yes!"
"they were good to do that, they said, so they set sail with a fine breeze, and got to Arabia in three-and-twenty hours. As soon as they landed, the lad ordered all the sailors to go and bury themselves up to the eyes in a sandhill, so that they could barely see the ships."
The lad and the captains climbed a high crag and sate down under a fir.
"In a little while came a great bird flying with an island in its claws, and let it fall down on the fleet, and sunk every ship. After it had done that, it flew up to the sandhill and flapped its wings, so that the wind nearly took off the heads of the sailors, and it flew past the fir with such force that it turned the lad right about, but he was ready with his sword, and gave the bird one blow and brought it down dead."
"After that he went to the town, where every one was glad because the King had got his daughter back; but now the King had hidden her away somewhere himself, and promised her hand as a reward to any one who could find her, and this though she was betrothed before. Now as the lad went along he met a man who had white bear-skins for sale, so he bought one of the hides and put it on; and one of the captains was to take an iron chain and lead him about, and so he went into the town and began to play pranks. At last the news came to the King's ears, that there never had been such fun in the town before, for here was a white bear that danced and cut capers just as it was bid. So a messenger came to say the bear must come to the castle at once, for the King wanted to see its tricks. So when it got to the castle every one was afraid, for such a beast they had never seen before; but the captain said there was no danger unless they laughed at it. They mustn't do that, else it would tear them to pieces. When the King heard that, he warned all the court not to laugh. But while the fun was going on, in came one of the King's maids, and began to laugh and make game of the bear, and the bear flew at her and tore her, so that there was scarce a rag of her left. Then all the court began to bewail, and the captain most of all."
"""Stuff and nonsense,"" said the King; ""she's only a maid, besides it's more my affair than yours."""
"When the show was over, it was late at night. ""It's no good your going away, when it's so late,"" said the King. ""The bear had best sleep here."""
"""Perhaps it might sleep in the ingle by the kitchen fire,"" said the captain."
"""Nay,"" said the King, ""it shall sleep up here, and it shall have pillows and cushions to sleep on."" So a whole heap of pillows and cushions was brought, and the captain had a bed in a side room."
"But at midnight the King came with a lamp in his hand and a big bunch of keys, and carried off the white bear. He passed along gallery after gallery through doors and rooms, up-stairs and down-stairs, till at last he came to a pier which ran out into the sea. Then the King began to pull and haul at posts and pins, this one up and that one down, till at last a little house floated up to the water's edge."
"There he kept his daughter, for she was so dear to him that he had hid her, so that no one could find her out. He left the white bear outside while he went in and told her how it had danced and played its pranks."
"She said she was afraid, and dared not look at it; but he talked her over, saying there was no danger if she only wouldn't laugh. So they brought the bear in, and locked the door, and it danced and played its tricks; but just when the fun was at its height, the Princess's maid began to laugh. Then the lad flew at her and tore her to bits, and the Princess began to cry and sob."
"""Stuff and nonsense,"" cried the King; ""all this fuss about a maid!"
"I'll get you just as good a one again. But now I think the bear had best stay here till morning, for I don't care to have to go and lead it along all those galleries and stairs at this time of night."""
"""Well!"" said the Princess, ""if it sleeps here, I'm sure I won't."""
"But just then the bear curled himself up and lay down by the stove; and it was settled at last that the Princess should sleep there too, with a light burning. But as soon as the King had well gone, the white bear came and begged her to undo his collar. The Princess was so scared she almost swooned away; but she felt about till she found the collar, and she had scarce undone it before the bear pulled his head off. Then she knew him again, and was so glad there was no end to her joy, and she wanted to tell her father at once that her deliverer was come. But the lad would not hear of it; he would earn her once more, he said. So in the morning when they heard the King rattling at the posts outside, the lad drew on the hide and lay down by the stove."
"""Well, has it lain still?"" the king asked."
"""I should think so,"" said the Princess; ""it hasn't so much as turned or stretched itself once."""
"When they got up to the castle again, the captain took the bear and led it away, and then the lad threw off the hide, and went to a tailor and ordered clothes fit for a prince; and when they were fitted on he went to the King, and said he wanted to find the Princess."
"""You're not the first who has wished the same thing,"" said the King, ""but they have all lost their lives; for if any one who tries can't find her in four-and-twenty hours his life is forfeited."""
"Yes; the lad knew all that. Still he wished to try, and if he couldn't find her, 'twas his look-out. Now in the castle there was a band that played sweet tunes, and there were fair maids to dance with, and so the lad danced away."
"When twelve hours were gone, the King said:"
"""I pity you with all my heart. You're so poor a hand at seeking; you will surely lose your life."""
"""Stuff!"" said the lad; ""while there's life there's hope! So long as there's breath in the body there's no fear; we have lots of time!"" and so he went on dancing till there was only one hour left."
Then he said he would begin to search.
"""It's no use now,"" said the King; ""time's up."""
"""Light your lamp; out with your big bunch of keys,"" said the lad, ""and follow me whither I wish to go. There is still a whole hour left."""
"So the lad went the same way which the King had led him the night before, and he bade the King unlock door after door till they came down to the pier which ran out into the sea."
"""It's all no use, I tell you,"" said the King; ""time's up, and this will only lead you right out into the sea."""
"""Still five minutes more,"" said the lad, as he pulled and pushed at the posts and pins, and the house floated up."
"""Ugh, ugh!"" he said as soon as he got his noses inside the door. ""I smell Christian blood and bone in my house."""
"""Yes, just think! A raven came flying past here with a thigh-bone, which he dropped down the chimney,"" said the Princess. ""I threw it out, but the raven brought it back again. At last I got rid of it and made haste to clean the room, but I suppose the smell is not quite gone,"" she said."
"""No, I can smell it well,"" said the troll; but he was tired and put his heads in the Princess's lap, and she went on scratching them till they all fell a-snoring. Then she called the hens, and the soldier came and cut off all the six heads as if they were set on cabbage stalks."
"She was no less glad than her elder sister, as you may imagine, and danced and sang; but in the midst of their joy they remembered their youngest sister. They went with the soldier across a large courtyard, and, after walking through many, many rooms, he came to the hall of gold where the third sister was."
"She sat at a golden spinning-wheel spinning gold yarn, and the room from ceiling to floor glistened and glittered till it hurt one's eyes."
"""Heaven preserve both you and me, what do you want here?"" said the Princess. ""Go, go, else the troll will kill us both."""
"""Just as well two as one,"" answered the soldier. The Princess cried and wept; but it was all of no use, he must and would remain. Since there was no help for it he would have to try if he could use the troll's sword on the table in the front hall. But he was only just able to move it; it was still larger and heavier than the other two swords."
"He then had to take the horn down from the wall and take three draughts from it, but was only just able to stir the sword. When he had taken three more draughts he could lift it, and when he had taken another three he swung it as easily as if it had been a feather."
"The Princess then settled with the soldier to do the same as her sisters had done. As soon as the troll was well asleep she would call the hens, and he must then make haste and come in and put an end to the troll."
"All of a sudden they heard such a thundering, rambling noise, as if the walls and roof were tumbling in."
"""Ugh! Ugh! I smell Christian blood and bone in my house,"" said the troll, sniffing with all his nine noses."
"""Yes, you never saw the like! Just now a raven flew past here and dropped a human bone down the chimney. I threw it out, but the raven brought it back, and this went on for some time,"" said the Princess; but she got it buried at last, she said, and she had both swept and cleaned the place, but she supposed it still smelt."
"""Yes, I can smell it well,"" said the troll."
"""Come here and lie down in my lap and I will scratch your heads,"" said the Princess. ""The smell will be all gone when you awake."""
"He did so, and when he was snoring at his best she put stools and cushions under the heads so that she could get away to call the hens."
"The soldier then came in in his stockinged feet and struck at the troll, so that eight of the heads fell off at one blow. But the sword was too short and did not reach far enough; the ninth head woke up and began to roar."
"""Ugh! Ugh! I smell a Christian."""
"""Yes, here he is,"" answered the soldier, and before the troll could get up and seize hold of him the soldier struck him another blow and the last head rolled along the floor."
You can well imagine how glad the Princesses became now that they no longer had to sit and scratch the trolls' heads; they did not know how they could do enough for him who had saved them. The youngest Princess took off her gold ring and knotted it in his hair. They then took with them as much gold and silver as they thought they could carry and set off on their way home.
"As soon as they tugged at the rope the captain and the lieutenant pulled up the Princesses, the one after the other. But when they were safely up, the soldier thought it was foolish of him not to have gone up before the Princesses, for he had not very much belief in his comrades. He thought he would first try them, so he put a heavy lump of gold in the basket and got out of the way. When the basket was half-way up they cut the rope and the lump of gold fell to the bottom with such a crash that the pieces flew about his ears."
"""Now we are rid of him,"" they said, and threatened the Princesses with their life if they did not say that it was they who had saved them from the trolls. They were forced to agree to this, much against their will, and especially the youngest Princess; but life was precious, and so the two who were strongest had their way."
"When the captain and lieutenant got home with the Princesses you may be sure there were great rejoicings at the palace. The King was so glad he didn't know which leg to stand on; he brought out his best wine from his cupboard and wished the two officers welcome. If they had never been honoured before they were honoured now in full measure, and no mistake. They walked and strutted about the whole of the day, as if they were the cocks of the walk, since they were now going to have the King for father-in-law. For it was understood they should each have whichever of the Princesses they liked and half the kingdom between them. They both wanted the youngest Princess, but for all they prayed and threatened her it was of no use; she would not hear or listen to either."
They then asked the King if they might have twelve men to watch over her; she was so sad and melancholy since she had been in the mountain that they were afraid she might do something to herself.
"Yes, that they might have, and the King himself told the watch they must look well after her and follow her wherever she went and stood."
"They then began to prepare for the wedding of the two eldest sisters; it should be such a wedding as never was heard or spoken of before, and there was no end to the brewing and the baking and the slaughtering."
"In the meantime the soldier walked and strolled about down in the other world. He thought it was hard that he should see neither people nor daylight any more; but he would have to do something, he thought, and so for many days he went about from room to room and opened all the drawers and cupboards and searched about on the shelves and looked at all the fine things that were there. At last he came to a drawer in a table, in which there lay a golden key; he tried this key to all the locks he could find, but there was none it fitted till he came to a little cupboard over the bed, and in that he found an old rusty whistle. ""I wonder if there is any sound in it,"" he thought, and put it to his mouth. No sooner had he whistled than he heard a whizzing and a whirring from all quarters, and such a large flock of birds swept down, that they blackened all the field in which they settled."
"""What does our master want to-day?"" they asked."
"If he were their master, the soldier said, he would like to know if they could tell him how to get up to the earth again. No, none of them knew anything about that; ""But our mother has not yet arrived,"" they said; ""if she can't help you, no one can."""
"So he whistled once more, and shortly heard something flapping its wings far away, and then it began to blow so hard that he was carried away between the houses like a wisp of hay across the courtyard, and if he had not caught hold of the fence he would no doubt have been blown away altogether."
A big eagle bigger than you can imagine then swooped down in front of him.
"Then Balna said to her sisters, ""Do you not see that girl watching us?"
"Let us drive her away, or hide the pomeloes, else she will go and tell her mother all about it, and that will be very bad for us."""
"But the other sisters said, ""Oh no, do not be unkind, Balna. The girl would never be so cruel as to tell her mother. Let us rather invite her to come and have some of the fruit."" And calling her to them, they gave her one of the pomeloes."
"No sooner had she eaten it, however, than the Prudhan's daughter went home and said to her mother, ""I do not wonder the seven Princesses will not eat the dinner you prepare for them, for by their mother's grave there grows a beautiful pomelo tree, and they go there every day and eat the pomeloes. I ate one, and it was the nicest I have ever tasted."""
"The cruel Ranee was much vexed at hearing this, and all next day she stayed in her room, and told the Raja that she had a very bad headache. The Raja was deeply grieved, and said to his wife, ""What can I do for you?"" She answered, ""There is only one thing that will make my headache well. By your dead wife's tomb there grows a fine pomelo tree; you must bring that here, and boil it, root and branch, and put a little of the water in which it has been boiled, on my forehead, and that will cure my headache."" So the Raja sent his servants, and had the beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots, and did as the Ranee desired; and when some of the water, in which it had been boiled, was put on her forehead, she said her headache was gone and she felt quite well."
"Next day, when the seven Princesses went as usual to the grave of their mother, the pomelo tree had disappeared. Then they all began to cry very bitterly."
"Now there was by the Ranee's tomb a small tank, and as they were crying they saw that the tank was filled with a rich cream-like substance, which quickly hardened into a thick white cake. At seeing this all the Princesses were very glad, and they ate some of the cake, and liked it; and next day the same thing happened, and so it went on for many days. Every morning the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and found the little tank filled with the nourishing cream-like cake. Then the cruel step-mother said to her daughter: ""I cannot tell how it is, I have had the pomelo tree which used to grow by the Ranee's grave destroyed, and yet the Princesses grow no thinner, nor look more sad, though they never eat the dinner I give them. I cannot tell how it is!"""
"And her daughter said, ""I will watch."""
"Next day, while the Princesses were eating the cream cake, who should come by but their step-mother's daughter. Balna saw her first, and said, ""See, sisters, there comes that girl again. Let us sit round the edge of the tank and not allow her to see it, for if we give her some of our cake, she will go and tell her mother; and that will be very unfortunate for us."""
"The other sisters, however, thought Balna unnecessarily suspicious, and instead of following her advice, they gave the Prudhan's daughter some of the cake, and she went home and told her mother all about it."
"The Ranee, on hearing how well the Princesses fared, was exceedingly angry, and sent her servants to pull down the dead Ranee's tomb, and fill the little tank with the ruins. And not content with this, she next day pretended to be very, very ill in fact, at the point of death and when the Raja was much grieved, and asked her whether it was in his power to procure her any remedy, she said to him: ""Only one thing can save my life, but I know you will not do it."" He replied, ""Yes, whatever it is, I will do it."" She then said, ""To save my life, you must kill the seven daughters of your first wife, and put some of their blood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands, and their death will be my life."" At these words the Raja was very sorrowful; but because he feared to break his word, he went out with a heavy heart to find his daughters."
He found them crying by the ruins of their mother's grave.
"Then, feeling he could not kill them, the Raja spoke kindly to them, and told them to come out into the jungle with him; and there he made a fire and cooked some rice, and gave it to them. But in the afternoon, it being very hot, the seven Princesses all fell asleep, and when he saw they were fast asleep, the Raja, their father, stole away and left them (for he feared his wife), saying to himself: ""It is better my poor daughters should die here, than be killed by their step-mother."""
"He then shot a deer, and returning home, put some of its blood on the forehead and hands of the Ranee, and she thought then that he had really killed the Princesses, and said she felt quite well."
"Meantime the seven Princesses awoke, and when they found themselves all alone in the thick jungle they were much frightened, and began to call out as loud as they could, in hopes of making their father hear; but he was by that time far away, and would not have been able to hear them even had their voices been as loud as thunder."
"It so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighbouring Raja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle, and as they were returning home, after the day's sport was over, the youngest Prince said to his brothers: ""Stop, I think I hear some one crying and calling out. Do you not hear voices? Let us go in the direction of the sound, and find out what it is."""
So the seven Princes rode through the wood until they came to the place where the seven Princesses sat crying and wringing their hands.
"At the sight of them the young Princes were very much astonished, and still more so on learning their story; and they settled that each should take one of these poor forlorn ladies home with him, and marry her."
"So the first and eldest Prince took the eldest Princess home with him, and married her."
And the second took the second;
And the third took the third;
And the fourth took the fourth;
And the fifth took the fifth;
And the sixth took the sixth;
"And the seventh, and the handsomest of all, took the beautiful Balna."
"And when they got to their own land, there was great rejoicing throughout the kingdom, at the marriage of the seven young Princes to seven such beautiful Princesses."
"About a year after this Balna had a little son, and his uncles and aunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathers and seven mothers. None of the other Princes and Princesses had any children, so the son of the seventh Prince and Balna was acknowledged their heir by all the rest."
"They had thus lived very happily for some time, when one fine day the seventh Prince (Balna's husband) said he would go out hunting, and away he went; and they waited long for him, but he never came back."
"Then his six brothers said they would go and see what had become of him; and they went away, but they also did not return."
"And the seven Princesses grieved very much, for they feared that their kind husbands must have been killed."
"One day, not long after this had happened, as Balna was rocking her baby's cradle, and whilst her sisters were working in the room below, there came to the palace door a man in a long black dress, who said that he was a Fakir, and came to beg. The servants said to him, ""You cannot go into the palace the Raja's sons have all gone away; we think they must be dead, and their widows cannot be interrupted by your begging."" But he said, ""I am a holy man, you must let me in."""
"Then the stupid servants let him walk through the palace, but they did not know that this was no Fakir, but a wicked Magician named Punchkin."
"George Whitefield the eloquent, who often addressed audiences (even in those days, when advertising was still in its infancy and the advance agent was unheard of) of from five thousand to forty thousand people, founded an orphan asylum. One audience consisted of sixty thousand people. The money from this work all went to help and sustain the orphan asylum. While reading of him we are reminded of our own Dr. Talmage, who is said to be the wealthiest apostle on the road."
"The trustees of Georgia limited the size of a man's farm, did not allow women to inherit land, and forbade the importation of rum or of slaves."
"Several of these rules were afterwards altered, so that as late as 1893 at least a gentleman from Washington, D.C., well known for his truth and honesty, saw rum inside the State twice, though Bourbon whiskey was preferred. Slaves also were found inside the State, and the negro is seen there even now; but the popularity of a negro baby is nothing now to what it was at the time when this class of goods went up to the top notch."
Need I add that after a while the people became dissatisfied with these rules and finally the whole matter was ceded to the crown? From this time on Georgia remained a royal province up to the Revolution. Since that very little has been said about ceding it to the crown.
"North Carolina also remained an English colony up to the same period, and, though one of the original thirteen Colonies, is still far more sparsely settled than some of the Western States."
"Virginia Dare was the first white child born in America. She selected Roanoke, now in North Carolina, in August, 1587, as her birthplace. She was a grand-daughter of the Governor, John White. Her fate, like that of the rest of the colony, is unknown to this day."
"The author begs leave to express his thanks here for the valuable      aid furnished him by the following works, viz.: ""The Horse and his      Diseases,"" by Mr. Astor; ""Life and Times of John Oglethorpe,"" by      Elias G. Merritt; ""How to Make the Garden Pay,"" by Peter Henderson;      ""Over the Purple Hills,"" by Mrs. Churchill, of Denver, Colorado,      and ""He Played on the Harp of a Thousand Strings, and the Spirits      of Just Men Made Perfect,"" by S. P. Avery."
CHAPTER XI.
INTERCOLONIAL AND INDIAN WARS.
"Intercolonial and Indian wars furnished excitement now from 1689 into the early part of the eighteenth century. War broke out in Europe between the French and English, and the Colonies had to take sides, as did also the Indians."
"Canadians and Indians would come down into York State or New England, burn a town, tomahawk quite a number of people, then go back on snow-shoes, having entered the town on rubbers, like a decayed show with no printing."
"There was an attack on Haverhill in March, 1697, and a Mr. Dustin was at work in the field. He ran to his house and got his seven children ahead of him, while with his gun he protected their rear till he got them away safely. Mrs. Dustin, however, who ran back into the house to remove a pie from the oven as she feared it was burning, was captured, and, with a boy of the neighborhood, taken to an island in the Merrimac, where the Indians camped. At night she woke the boy, told him how to hit an Indian with a tomahawk so that ""the subsequent proceedings would interest him no more,"" and that evening the two stole forth while the ten Indians slept, knocked in their thinks, scalped them to prove their story, and passed on to safety. Mrs. Dustin kept those scalps for many years, showing them to her friends to amuse them."
"King William's War lasted eight years. Queen Anne's War lasted from 1702 to 1713. The brunt of this war fell on New England. Our forefathers had to live in block-houses, with barbed-wire fences around them, and carry their guns with them all the time. From planting the Indian with a shotgun, they soon got to planting their corn with the same agricultural instrument in the stony soil."
"The French and Spanish tried to take Charleston in 1706, but were repulsed with great loss, consisting principally of time which they might have employed in raising frogs' legs and tantalizing a bull at so much per tant."
"This war lasted eleven years, including stops, and was ended by the treaty of Utrecht (pronounced you-trecked)."
"After this, what was called the Spanish War continued between England and Spain for some time. An attempt to capture Georgia was made, and a garrison established itself there, with good prospects of taking in the State under Spanish rule, but our able friend Oglethorpe, the Henry W."
"Grady of his time, managed to accidentally mislay a letter which fell into the enemy's hands, the contents of which showed that enormous reinforcements were expected at any moment. This was swallowed comfortably by the commander, who blew up his impregnable works, changed the address of his Atlanta Constitution, and sailed for home."
"Oglethorpe wore a wig, but was otherwise one of our greatest minds. It is said that anybody at a distance of two miles on a clear day could readily distinguish that it was a wig, and yet he died believing that no one had ever probed his great mystery and that his wig would rise with him at the playing of the last trump."
"King George's War, which extended over four years, succeeded, but did not amount to anything except the capture of Cape Breton by English and Colonial troops. Cape Breton was called the Gibraltar of America; but a Yankee farmer who has raised flax on an upright farm for twenty years does not mind scaling a couple of Gibraltars before breakfast; so, without any West Point knowledge regarding engineering, they walked up the hill, and those who were alive when they got to the top took it. It was no Balaklava business and no dumb animal show, but simply revealed the fact that brave men fighting for their eight-dollar homes and a mass of children are disagreeable people to meet on the battle-field."
"The French and Indian War lasted nine years, viz., from 1754 to 1763."
"From Quebec to New Orleans the French owned the land, and mixed up a good deal socially with the Indians, so that the slender settlement along the coast had arrayed against it this vast line of northern and western forts, and the Indians, who were mostly friendly with the French, united with them in several instances and showed them some new styles of barbarism which up to that time they had never known about."
The half-breed is always half French and half Indian.
"The English owned all lands lying on one side of the Ohio, the French on the other, which led a great chief to make a P. P. C. call on Governor Dinwiddie, and during the conversation to inquire with some naïveté where the Indian came in. No answer was ever received."
"We pause here to ask the question, Why did the pale-face usurp the lands of the Indians without remuneration? It was because the Indian was not orthodox. He may have been lazy from a Puritanical stand-point, and he may also have hunted on the twenty-seventh Sunday after Easter; but still was it not right that he should have received a dollar or two per county for the United States? No one would have felt it, and possibly it might have saved the lives of innocent people."
"Verbum sap., however, comes in here with peculiar appropriateness, and the massive-browed historian passes on."
"The French had three forts along in the Middle States, as they are now called, and Western Pennsylvania; and George Washington, of whom more will be said in the twelfth chapter, was sent to ask the French to remove these forts. He started at once."
"The commanders were some of them arrogant, but the general, St. Pierre, treated him with great respect, refusing, however, to yield the ground discovered by La Salle and Marquette. The author had the pleasure of being arrested in Paris in 1889, and he feels of a truth, as he often does, that there can be no more polite people in the world than the French. Arrested under all circumstances and in many lands, the author can place his hand on his heart and say that he would go hundreds of miles to be arrested by a John Darm."
"Washington returned four hundred miles through every kind of danger, including a lunch at Altoona, where he stopped twenty minutes."
"The first year of the war had taught both sides a few truths, and especially that the war did not in any essential features resemble a straw-ride to camp-meeting and return. The South had also discovered that the Yankee peddlers could not be captured with fly-paper, and that although war was not their regular job they were willing to learn how it was done."
"In 1862 the national army numbered five hundred thousand men, and the Confederate army three hundred and fifty thousand. Three objects were decided upon by the Federal government for the Union army and navy to accomplish, viz., 1, the opening of the Mississippi; 2, the blockade of Southern ports; and 3, the capture of Richmond, the capital of the Southern Confederacy."
"The capture of Forts Henry and Donelson was undertaken by General Grant, aided by Commodore Foote, and on February 6 a bombardment was opened with great success, reducing Fort Henry in one hour. The garrison got away because the land-forces had no idea the fort would yield so soon, and therefore could not get up there in time to cut off the retreat."
"Fort Donelson was next attacked, the garrison having been reinforced by the men from Fort Henry. The fight lasted four days, and on February 16 the fort, with fifteen thousand men, surrendered."
"Nashville was now easily occupied by Buell, and Columbus and Bowling Green were taken. The Confederates fell back to Corinth, where General Beauregard (Peter G. T.) and Albert Sidney Johnston massed their forces."
"General Grant now captured the Memphis and Charleston Railroad; but the Confederates decided to capture him before Buell, who had been ordered to reinforce him, should effect a junction with him. April 6 and 7, therefore, the battle of Shiloh occurred. Whether the Union troops were surprised or not at this battle, we cannot here pause to discuss."
"Suffice it to say that one of the Federal officers admitted to the author in 1879, while under the influence of koumys, that, though not strictly surprised, he believed he violated no confidence in saying that they were somewhat astonished."
"It was Sunday morning, and the Northern hordes were just considering whether they would take a bite of beans and go to church or remain in camp and get their laundry-work counted for Monday, when the Confederacy and some other men burst upon them with a fierce, rude yell. In a few moments the Federal troops had decided that there had sprung up a strong personal enmity on the part of the South, and that ill feeling had been engendered in some way."
"All that beautiful Sabbath-day they fought, the Federals yielding ground slowly and reluctantly till the bank of the river was reached and Grant's artillery commanded the position. Here a stand was made until Buell came up, and shortly afterwards the Confederates fell back; but they had captured the Yankee camp entire, and many a boy in blue lost the nice warm woollen pulse-warmers crocheted for him by his soul's idol. It is said that over thirty-five hundred needle-books and three thousand men were captured by the Confederates, also thirty flags and immense quantities of stores; but the Confederate commander, General A."
"S. Johnston, was killed. The following morning the tide had turned, and General P. G. T. Beauregard retreated unmolested to Corinth."
"General Halleck now took command, and, as the Confederates went away from there, he occupied Corinth, though still retaining his rooms at the Arlington Hotel in Washington."
"The Confederates who retreated from Columbus fell back to Island No. 10 in the Mississippi River, where Commodore Foote bombarded them for three weeks, thus purifying the air and making the enemy feel much better than at any previous time during the campaign. General Pope crossed the Mississippi, capturing the batteries in the rear of the island, and turning them on the enemy, who surrendered April 7, the day of the battle of Shiloh."
"May 10, the Union gun-boats moved down the river. Fort Pillow was abandoned by the Southern forces, and the Confederate flotilla was destroyed in front of Memphis. Kentucky and Tennessee were at last the property of the fierce hordes from the great coarse North."
"General Bragg was now at Chattanooga, Price at Iuka, and Van Dorn at Holly Springs. All these generals had guns, and were at enmity with the United States of America. They very much desired to break the Union line of investment extending from Memphis almost to Chattanooga."
"Bragg started out for the Ohio River, intending to cross it and capture the Middle States; but Buell heard of it and got there twenty-four hours ahead, wherefore Bragg abandoned his plans, as it flashed over him like a clap of thunder from a clear sky that he had no place to put the Middle States if he had them. He therefore escaped in the darkness, his wagon-trains sort of drawling over forty miles of road and ""hit a-rainin'."""
"September 19, General Price, who, with Van Dorn, had considered it a good time to attack Grant, who had sent many troops north to prevent Bragg's capture of North America, decided to retreat, and, General Rosecrans failing to cut him off, escaped, and was thus enabled to fight on other occasions."
"The two Confederate generals now decided to attack the Union forces at Corinth, which they did. They fought beautifully, especially the Texan and Missouri troops, who did some heroic work, but they were defeated and driven forty miles with heavy loss."
"October 30, General Buell was succeeded by General Rosecrans."
"The battle of Murfreesboro occurred December 31 and January 2. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the whole conflict, and must have made the men who brought on the war by act of Congress feel first-rate. About one-fourth of those engaged were killed."
"An attack on Vicksburg, in which Grant and Sherman were to co-operate, the former moving along the Mississippi Central Railroad and Sherman descending the river from Memphis, was disastrous, and the capture of Arkansas Post, January 11, 1863, closed the campaign of 1862 on the Father of Waters."
"General Price was driven out of Missouri by General Curtis, and had to stay in Arkansas quite a while, though he preferred a dryer climate."
"General Van Dorn now took command of these forces, numbering twenty thousand men, and at Pea Ridge, March 7 and 8, 1863, he was defeated to a remarkable degree. During his retreat he could hardly restrain his impatience."
"Some four or five thousand Indians joined the Confederates in this battle, but were so astonished at the cannon, and so shocked by the large decayed balls, as they called the shells, which came hurtling through the air, now and then hurting an Indian severely, that they went home before the exercises were more than half through. They were down on the programme for some fantastic and interesting tortures of Union prisoners, but when they got home to the reservation and had picked the briers out of themselves they said that war was about as barbarous a thing as they were ever to, and they went to bed early, leaving a call for 9.30 A.M. on the following day."
The red brother's style of warfare has an air about it that is unpopular now. A common stone stab-knife is a feeble thing to use against people who shoot a distance of eight miles with a gun that carries a forty-gallon caldron full of red-hot iron.
CHAPTER XXVI.
SOME MORE FRATRICIDAL STRIFE.
"The effort to open the Mississippi from the north was seconded by an expedition from the south, in which Captain David G. Farragut, commanding a fleet of forty vessels, co-operated with General Benjamin F. Butler, with the capture of New Orleans as the object."
"Mortar-boats covered with green branches for the purpose of fooling the enemy, as no one could tell at any distance at all whether these were or were not olive-branches, steamed up the river and bombarded Forts Jackson and St. Philip till the stunned catfish rose to the surface of the water to inquire, ""Why all this?"" and turned their pallid stomachs toward the soft Southern zenith. Sixteen thousand eight hundred shells were thrown into the two forts, but that did not capture New Orleans."
"Farragut now decided to run his fleet past the defences, and, desperate as the chances were, he started on April 24. A big cable stretched across the river suggested the idea that there was a hostile feeling among the New Orleans people. Five rafts and armed steamers met him, and the iron-plated ram Manassas extended to him a cordial welcome to a wide wet grave with a southern exposure."
"Farragut cut through the cable about three o'clock in the morning, practically destroyed the Confederate fleet, and steamed up to the city, which was at his mercy."
"""Beware,"" continued the prince, ""lest you do that which afterwards you would give your life not to have done."""
"By the time the prince had concluded this story it was nearly morning, and he went away, after rewarding the man."
The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law.
"He disguised himself as a jogi, and sitting down by a tree near the palace, pretended to be absorbed in worship. News of the man and of his wonderful piety reached the ears of the king. He felt interested in him, as his wife was very ill; and he had sought for hakims to cure her, but in vain. He thought that, perhaps, this holy man could do something for her. So he sent to him. But the jogi refused to tread the halls of a king, saying that his dwelling was the open air, and that if his Majesty wished to see him he must come himself and bring his wife to the place. Then the king took his wife and brought her to the jogi. The holy man bade her prostrate herself before him, and when she had remained in this position for about three hours, he told her to rise and go, for she was cured."
"In the evening there was great consternation in the palace, because the queen had lost her pearl rosary, and nobody knew anything about it. At length some one went to the jogi, and found it on the ground by the place where the queen had prostrated herself. When the king heard this he was very angry, and ordered the jogi to be executed. This stern order, however, was not carried out, as the prince bribed the men and escaped from the country. But he knew that the second bit of advice was true."
"Clad in his own clothes, the prince was walking along one day when he saw a potter crying and laughing alternately with his wife and children. ""O fool,"" said he, ""what is the matter? If you laugh, why do you weep? If you weep, why do you laugh?"""
"""Do not bother me,"" said the potter. ""What does it matter to you?"""
"""Pardon me,"" said the prince, ""but I should like to know the reason."""
"""The reason is this, then,"" said the potter. ""The king of this country has a daughter whom he is obliged to marry every day, because all her husbands die the first night of their stay with her. Nearly all the young men of the place have thus perished, and our son will be called on soon. We laugh at the absurdity of the thing a potter's son marrying a princess, and we cry at the terrible consequence of the marriage. What can we do?"""
"""Truly a matter for laughing and weeping. But weep no more,"" said the prince. ""I will exchange places with your son, and will be married to the princess instead of him. Only give me suitable garments, and prepare me for the occasion."""
"So the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments, and the prince went to the palace. At night he was conducted to the apartment of the princess. ""Dread hour!"" thought he; ""am I to die like the scores of young men before me?"" He clenched his sword with firm grip, and lay down on his bed, intending to keep awake all the night and see what would happen. In the middle of the night he saw two Shahmars come out from the nostrils of the princess. They stole over towards him, intending to kill him, like the others who had been before him: but he was ready for them. He laid hold of his sword, and when the snakes reached his bed he struck at them and killed them. In the morning the king came as usual to inquire, and was surprised to hear his daughter and the prince talking gaily together. ""Surely,"" said he, ""this man must be her husband, as he only can live with her."""
"""Where do you come from? Who are you?"" asked the king, entering the room."
"""O king!"" replied the prince, ""I am the son of a king who rules over such-and-such a country."""
"When he heard this the king was very glad, and bade the prince to abide in his palace, and appointed him his successor to the throne."
"The prince remained at the palace for more than a year, and then asked permission to visit his own country, which was granted. The king gave him elephants, horses, jewels, and abundance of money for the expenses of the way and as presents for his father, and the prince started."
"On the way he had to pass through the country belonging to his brother-in-law, whom we have already mentioned. Report of his arrival reached the ears of the king, who came with rope-tied hands and haltered neck to do him homage. He most humbly begged him to stay at his palace, and to accept what little hospitality could be provided."
"Some of the sufferings of the Pilgrims at the time are depicted on the preceding pages by the artist, also a few they escaped."
"Looking over the lives of our forefathers who came from England, I am not surprised that, with all the English people who have recently come to this country, I have never seen a forefather."
[Footnote 2: See Dr. Dunn's Family Physician and Horse Doctor.]
CHAPTER V.
DRAWBACKS OF BEING A COLONIST.
"It was at this period in the history of our country that the colonists found themselves not only banished from all civilization, but compelled to fight an armed foe whose trade was war and whose music was the dying wail of a tortured enemy. Unhampered by the exhausting efforts of industry, the Indian, trained by centuries of war upon adjoining tribes, felt himself foot-loose and free to shoot the unprotected forefather from behind the very stump fence his victim had worked so hard to erect."
"King Philip, a demonetized sovereign, organized his red troops, and, carrying no haversacks, knapsacks, or artillery, fell upon the colonists and killed them, only to reappear at some remote point while the dead and wounded who fell at the first point were being buried or cared for by rude physicians."
"What an era in the history of a country! Gentlewomen whose homes had been in the peaceful hamlets of England lived and died in the face of a cruel foe, yet prepared the cloth and clothing for their families, fed them, and taught them to look to God in all times of trouble, to be prayerful in their daily lives, yet vigilant and ready to deal death to the general enemy. They were the mothers whose sons and grandsons laid the huge foundations of a great nation and cemented them with their blood."
At this time there was a line of battle three hundred miles in length.
"On one side the white man went armed to the field or the prayer-meeting, shooting an Indian on sight as he would a panther; on the other, a foe whose wife did the chores and hoed the scattering crops while he made war and extermination his joy by night and his prayer and life-long purpose by day."
"Finally, however, the victory came sluggishly to the brave and deserving. One thousand Indians were killed at one pop, and their wigwams were burned. All their furniture and curios were burned in their wigwams, and some of their valuable dogs were holocausted. King Philip was shot by a follower as he was looking under the throne for something, and peace was for the time declared."
"About 1684 the Colony of Massachusetts, which had dared to open up a trade with the West Indies, using its own vessels for that purpose, was hauled over the coals by the mother-country for violation of the Navigation Act, and an officer sent over to enforce the latter. The colonists defied him, and when he was speaking to them publicly in a tone of reprimand, he got an ovation in the way of eggs and codfish, both of which had been set aside for that purpose when the country was new, and therefore had an air of antiquity which cannot be successfully imitated."
"As a result, the Colony was made a royal appendage, and Sir Edmund Andros, a political hack under James II., was made Governor of New England. He reigned under great difficulties for three years, and then suddenly found himself in jail. The jail was so arranged that he could not get out, and so the Puritans now quietly resumed their old form of government."
"This continued also for three years, when Sir William Phipps became Governor under the crown, with one hundred and twenty pounds per annum and house-rent."
"""Let the gentle finger of time undo, so far as may be, the devastation wrought by the war, and let succeeding generations seek through natural methods to reunite the business and the traffic that were interrupted by the war. Let the South guarantee to the Northern investor security to himself and his investment, and he will not ask for the love which we read of in speeches but do not expect and do not find in the South."
"""Two warring parents on the verge of divorce have been saved the disgrace of separation and agreed to maintain their household for the sake of their children. Their love has been questioned by the world, and their relations strained. Is it not bad taste for them to pose in public and make a cheap Romeo and Juliet tableau of themselves?"
"""Let time and merciful silence obliterate the scars of war, and succeeding generations, fostered by the smiles of national prosperity, soften the bitterness of the past and mellow the memory of a mighty struggle in which each contending host called upon Almighty God to sustain the cause which it honestly believed to be just."""
"Let us be contented during this generation with the assurance that geographically the Union has been preserved, and that each contending warrior has once more taken up the peaceful struggle for bettering and beautifying the home so bravely fought for."
CHAPTER XXX.
RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT PAIN ADMINISTRATIONS OF JOHNSON AND GRANT.
"It was feared that the return of a million Federal soldiers to their homes after the four years of war would make serious trouble in the North, but they were very shortly adjusted to their new lives and attending to the duties which peace imposed upon them."
"The war of the Rebellion was disastrous to nearly every branch of trade, but those who remained at home to write the war-songs of the North did well. Some of these efforts were worthy, and, buoyed up by a general feeling of robust patriotism, they floated on to success; but few have stood the test of years and monotonous peace. The author of ""Mother, I am hollow to the ground"" is just depositing his profits from its sale in the picture given on next page. The second one, wearing the cape-overcoat tragedy air, wrote ""Who will be my laundress now?"""
"Andrew Johnson succeeded to Mr. Lincoln's seat, having acted before as his vice."
"A great review of the army, lasting twelve hours, was arranged to take place in Washington, consisting of the armies of Grant and Sherman. It was reviewed by the President and Cabinet; it extended over thirty miles twenty men deep, and constituted about one-fifth of the Northern army at the time peace was declared."
"President Johnson recognized the State governments existing in Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana, but instituted provisional governments for the other States of the defeated Confederacy, as it seemed impossible otherwise to bring order out of the chaos which war and financial distress had brought about. He authorized the assembly also of loyal conventions to elect State and other officers, and pardoned by proclamation everybody, with the exception of a certain class of the late insurgents whom he pardoned personally."
"On Christmas Day, 1868, a Universal Amnesty was declared. The Thirteenth Amendment, abolishing slavery, became a part of the Constitution, December 18, 1865, and the former masters found themselves still morally responsible for these colored people, without the right to control them or even the money with which to employ them."
"The annual interest on the national debt at this time amounted to one hundred and fifty million dollars. Yet the Treasury paid this, together with the expenses of government, and reduced the debt seventy-one million dollars before the volunteer army had been fully discharged in 1866."
Comment on such recuperative power as that is unnecessary; for the generation that fights a four-years war costing over two billions of dollars generally leaves the debt for another generation or another century to pay.
"Congress met finally, ignored the President's rollicking welcome to the seceded States, and over his veto proceeded to pass various laws regarding their admission, such as the Civil Rights and Freedman's Bureau Bills."
"Tennessee returned promptly to the Union under the Constitutional Amendments, but the others did not till the nightmare of Reconstruction had been added to the horrors of war. In 1868, after much time worse than wasted in carpet-bag government and a mob reign in the South which imperilled her welfare for many years after it was over, by frightening investors and settlers long after peace had been restored, representatives began to come into Congress under the laws."
During this same year the hostilities between Congress and the President culminated in an effort to impeach the latter. He escaped by one vote.
"It is very likely that the assassination of Lincoln was the most unfortunate thing that happened to the Southern States. While he was not a warrior, he was a statesman, and no gentler hand or more willing brain could have entered with enthusiasm into the adjustment of chaotic conditions, than his."
"The Fourteenth Amendment, a bright little bon mot, became a law June 28, 1868, and was written in the minutes of Congress, so that people could go there and refresh their memories regarding it. It guaranteed civil rights to all, regardless of race, color, odor, wildness or wooliness whatsoever, and allows all noses to be counted in Congressional representations, no matter what angle they may be at or what the color may be."
"Some American citizens murmur at taxation without representation, but the negro murmurs at representation without remuneration."
The Fenian excitement of 1866 died out without much loss of life.
"In October, 1867, Alaska was purchased from Russia for seven million two hundred thousand dollars. The ice-crop since then would more than pay for the place, and it has also a water-power and cranberry marsh on it."
"The rule of the Imperialists in France prompted the appointment of Maximilian, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico, supported by the French army. The Americans, still sore and in debt at the heels of their own war, pitied the helpless Mexicans, and, acting on the principles enunciated in the Monroe Doctrine, demanded the recall of Maximilian, who, deserted finally by his foreign abettors, was defeated and as a prisoner shot by the Mexicans, June 19, 1867."
"The Atlantic cable was laid from Valentia Bay in Ireland to Heart's Content, Newfoundland, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four miles, and the line from New York to the latter place built in 1856, a distance of one thousand miles, making in all, as keen mathematicians will see, two thousand eight hundred and sixty-four miles."
A very agreeable commercial treaty with China was arranged in 1868.
"Grant and Colfax, Republicans, succeeded Andrew Johnson in the next election, Horatio Seymour, of New York, and Frank P. Blair, of Missouri, being the Democratic nominees. Virginia and Mississippi had not been fully reconstructed, and so were not yet permitted to vote."
"They have squared the matter up since, however, by voting with great enthusiasm."
"In 1869 the Pacific Railroad was completed, whereby the trip from the Atlantic to the Pacific three thousand and three hundred miles might be made in a week. It also attracted the Asiatic trade, and tea, silk, spices, and leprosy found a new market in the land of the free and the home of the brave."
"Still flushed with its success in humorous legislation, Congress, on the 30th of March, 1870, passed the Fifteenth Amendment, giving to the colored men the right to vote. It then became a part of the Constitution, and people who have seen it there speak very highly of it."
"Prosperity now attracted no attention whatever. Gold, worth nearly three dollars at the close of the war, fell to a dollar and ten cents, and the debt during the first two years of this administration was reduced two hundred million dollars."
"Genuine peace reigned in the entire Republic, and o'er the scarred and shell-torn fields of the South there waved, in place of hostile banners, once more the cotton and the corn. The red foliage of the gum-tree with the white in the snowy white cotton-fields and the blue-grass of Kentucky (blue-grass is not, strictly speaking, blue enough to figure in the national colors, but the author has taken out a poetic license which does not expire for over a year yet, and he therefore under its permission is allowed a certain amount of idiocy) showed that the fields had never forgotten their loyalty to the national colors. Peace under greatly changed conditions resumed her vocations, and, in the language of the poet,"

"Besides the windows, the till and the shelves had been cleared, and"
empty drawers and boxes had been thrown on to the floor. We went down
into the cellar. All the cases had been opened and the stone floor was
littered with empty and broken bottles. The girl began to sob again when
she saw the ruin that had been inflicted:
"""All gone, all gone--ve poor now."""
"""Why don't you complain to the Town Major?"" one of us suggested."
"""Complain?--vat's de use complain?--de Town Major, he nice man, he kind"

"We ascended the cellar stairs. The mother was in the main room, wiping"
"her eyes. We said good-bye to her and her daughter, feeling ashamed of"
"our uniforms, and walked out into the street."
A mass of French cavalry were galloping past. It was growing dark. The
cannonade had become deafening. Over the town a few miles off there was
a crimson glare in the sky.
Travers nodded.
"""I heard you talking, but I wanted to make sure. It has all been my"
fault--every bit of it. It's decent of you not to make me feel it
"more. You are not to blame--her. You know I tempted her, I made her"
"help me. She isn't responsible. At any rate, she made a clean breast"
of it--that's something to her credit. I didn't want to--I never meant
to. I am not the sort that repents. But this last week you have been
"so decent, and Lois such a plucky little soul--she ought to hate"
"me--and perhaps she does--but she has done her best. Nicholson, are"
you listening? Can you hear what I say? It's so damned hard for me to
"talk."""
"""I can hear,"" Nicholson said kindly. ""Don't worry about what can't be"
"helped."" In spite of everything, he pitied the man, and his tone"
showed it.
"Travers lifted himself higher, clinging to the other's shoulder. His"
"voice began to come in rough, uneven jerks."
"""But it can be helped--it must be helped! Don't you see--I came"
between you and Lois purposely. From the first moment you spoke of her
I knew that you loved her--and I wanted her. I never gave your
message. I didn't dare. You are the sort of man a woman cares for--a
"woman like Lois. I couldn't risk it. But now--well, I'm done, and"
"afterward she will be free--"""
Nicholson drew back stiffly.
"""You are talking nonsense,"" he said, in a colder tone. ""No one wants"
"you to die--and in any case, you know very well we have no chance of"
"getting through this alive."""
The Uzi. The goddam Uzi. Why hadn't they brought it?
"It was still back in Kensington, where they'd stashed it in the false"
bottom of a new suitcase. But if the _Mino-gumi_ had been searching
"only for a computer, maybe they'd missed it. So Tanzan Mino's hoods"
could still be in for a surprise. Just make an excuse to go back.
"Vera was aware an Uzi had been part of their deal for the limo, but"
"maybe that fact had momentarily slipped her mind, what with all the"
important things she had to think about. Or maybe she'd assumed Alex
"had kept it, or maybe she thought it was still in the car. Whatever she"
"thought, things were moving too fast now."
"""I get the picture,"" he said, rising from his chair. With a"
"carefully feigned nonchalance, he strolled over to the table. ""Guess"
"it's time we got our toothbrushes."""
"""You won't have to bother, Mr. Vance,"" Vera continued. ""Your suitcases"
were sent to the plane an hour ago. We found them conveniently packed.
"Don't worry. Everything has already been taken care of."""
"Okay, scratch the Uzi. Looks like it's now or never. Settle it here."
"He shot a glance at Eva, then at Ken, trying to signal them. They"
"caught it, and they knew. She began strolling in the direction of Vera,"
"who was now standing in the doorway, as though readying to depart."
"""We appreciate the snappy service,"" Vance said. He looked down at the"
"computer, then bent over. When he came up, it was in his right hand,"
"sailing in an arc. He brought it around with all his might, aimed for"
"the nearest Japanese _kobun_. He was on target, catching the man"
"There young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though"
"everything depended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water"
can. Young Charles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little
red-faced boy he had come into the house to look after the fires. Old
"Mr. Neave lowered himself into the cane lounge by the window, stretched"
"out his legs, and made his little evening joke, “Dress him up,"
"Charles!” And Charles, breathing intensely and frowning, bent forward"
to take the pin out of his tie.
"H’m, h’m! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very"
pleasant—a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis
court below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would
begin their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to hear
"Marion’s voice ring out, “Good for you, partner.... Oh, _played_,"
"partner.... Oh, _very_ nice indeed.” Then Charlotte calling from the"
"veranda, “Where is Harold?” And Ethel, “He’s certainly not here,"
"mother.” And Charlotte’s vague, “He said—”"
"Old Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he"
"took the comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard"
"over. Charles gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and"
spectacle case.
"“That will do, my lad.” The door shut, he sank back, he was alone...."
And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights
"that led to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were"
"like a spider’s—thin, withered."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.”"
"But if that were true, why didn’t Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why"
"not a day over forty?"""
"""I have given up wondering where the real Dawson ends and where the"
disguises begin. The man I met up north wasn't the least bit like the
"one down here."""
"""A deal younger, I expect,"" said the chief assistant, grinning. ""He"
shifts about between thirty and sixty. The old man is no end of a
"cure, and tries to take us in the same as he does you. There's an"
"inspector at the Yard who was at school with him down Hampshire way,"
"and ought to know what he is really like, but even he has given Dawson"
up. He says that the old man does not know his own self in the
"looking-glass; and as for Mrs. Dawson, I expect she has to take any"
"one who comes along claiming to be her husband, for she can't,"
"possibly tell t'other from which."""
"""One might make a good story out of that,"" I observed to Cary."
"""I don't understand,"" said he. ""Mr. Dawson told me once that I knew"
"the real Dawson, but that few other people did."""
"""If he told you that,"" calmly observed the assistant, ""you may bet"
"your last shirt he was humbugging you. He couldn't tell the truth, not"
"if he tried ever so."""
"""What is he at now?"" I asked."
"""I don't know, sir. And if he told me, I shouldn't believe him. I"
don't take no account of a word that man says. But he's the most

"history of the Low Countries, some have a special and general scientific"
interest. Among these is the research of M. Alphonse Wauters on _Les
"libertés communales_ (Bruxelles, 1878). Barante's _Histoire des Ducs de"
Bourgogne_ (4th ed. 1838-40) contains much interesting matter on the
"Burgundian period. The assiduous research of M. Lefèvre Pontalis, _Jean"
"de Witt, Grand Pensionnaire de Hollande_ (2 tom. 1884; Eng. trans. 2"
"vols.), throws a full light on one of the most critical periods of Dutch"
history.
"Dutch works on the history of the Low Countries in general, and the"
"United Provinces in particular, are many and voluminous; indeed, no"
history has been more amply written. The good general history of the
"Netherlands by N.G. van Kampen, which appeared in German in the series"
"of Heeren and Uckert (1831-33), is only partially superseded by the"
"_Geschichte der Niederlande_ of Wenzelburger (Bd. i, 1879; ii, 1886),"
which is not completed. But the most readable general history of the
"Netherlands yet produced is that of P.J. Blok, _Geschiedenis van het"
"Nederlandsche Volk_ (1892, etc.), of which there is a competent but"
"unfortunately abridged English translation (Putnams, vol. i, 1898)."
"Standard modern Dutch works are those of J.A. Vijnne, _Geschiedenis van"
"het Vaderland_, and J. van Lennep, _De Geschiedenis van Nederland_. For"
Belgian history in particular the authorities are similarly numerous.
"The _Manuel de l'histoire de Belgique_, by J. David (Louvain, 1847),"
"will be found a good handbook of authorities, episodes, and chronology,"
though without any sociological element. The _Histoire de Belgique_ of
"Th. Juste (Bruxelles, 1895, 3 tom. 4to) is comprehensive, but disfigured"
by insupportable illustrations.
§ 1. _The Rise of the Netherlands_
The case of Holland is one of those which at first sight seem to flout
as little to your mind as to mine.  We can flatter and fool and make
mock with the best; but when it comes to marriage!  Faugh! one’s soul
sickens at the thought.  What man in his senses would trust his
happiness or his honour in the hands of that tawdry crew?  Gilt and
"tinsel do very well to play with; but when one desires to purchase, one"
"asks for gold."""
Grey’s heart seemed to stand still within him.  He felt growing numb and
"cold.  As they passed beneath the gateway, and the lamp shone upon his"
"face, Lord Sandford saw that it was white as death, and a strange gleam"
came into his own eyes.
"""Come, my friend, you do not answer.  What think you of the wife that I"
have chosen?  What think you of the Lady Geraldine Adair?  Is she not a
matchless creature?  Who would have believed such a sport could come
"from such a tree?"""
Grey commanded himself by a great effort.
"""Is the Lady Geraldine Adair, then, your affianced wife?"""
"""That, or next door to it.  My suit is approved of her parents.  We"
shall be betrothed ere long.  I thought you might be learning as much
from her own lips to-night.  Did I not hear my name pass between you
"twain?"""
"""She did ask some question anent you,"" answered Grey, who had no desire"
"to fence or parry—he felt too stunned and bewildered; ""but she spoke not"
"of any troth-plight.  Why should she?"""
"""True, why should she?  She is not one of your empty-headed chatterers."
She wears not her heart upon her sleeve.  And your acquaintance is of
of an American vessel some time previously.
"DE SOTO, CAPTAIN BENITO."
A Portuguese.
A most notorious pirate in and about 1830.
"In 1827 he shipped at Buenos Ayres as mate in a slaver, named the"
"_Defenser de Pedro_, and plotted to seize the ship off the African coast."
"The pirates took the cargo of slaves to the West Indies, where they sold"
"them. De Soto plundered many vessels in the Caribbean Sea, then sailed to"
"the South Atlantic, naming his ship the _Black Joke_. The fear of the"
_Black Joke_ became so great amongst the East Indiamen homeward bound that
they used to make up convoys at St. Helena before heading north.
"In 1832 de Soto attacked the _Morning Star_, an East Indiaman, and took"
"her, when he plundered the ship and murdered the captain. After taking"
"several more ships, de Soto lost his own on the rocky coast of Spain, near"
"Cadiz. His crew, although pretending to be honest shipwrecked sailors,"
"were arrested, but de Soto managed to escape to Gibraltar. Here he was"
recognized by a soldier who had seen de Soto when he took the _Morning
"Star_, in which he had been a passenger. The pirate was arrested, and"
"tried before Sir George Don, the Governor of Gibraltar, and sentenced to"
death. He was sent to Cadiz to be hanged with the rest of his crew. The
"gallows was erected at the water's edge, and de Soto, with his coffin, was"
"conveyed there in a cart. He died bravely, arranging the noose around his"
"own neck, stepping up into his coffin to do so; then, crying out, ""Adios"
"todos,"" he threw himself off the cart."
"This man must not be confused with one Bernado de Soto, who was tried for"
cold fury:
"""You better stop that laughin', Jack Rance, or I'll send you to finish"
"it in some place where things ain't so funny."""
Something in the Girl's altered tone so struck the Sheriff that he
"obeyed her. He said nothing, but on his lips were the words, ""By Heaven,"
"the Girl means it!"" and his eyes showed a smouldering admiration."
"""He doesn't hear you,--he's out of it. But me--me--I hear you--I ain't"
"out of it,"" the Girl went on in compelling tones. ""You're a gambler; he"
"was, too; well, so am I."" She crossed deliberately to the bureau, and"
"laid her pistol away in the drawer, Rance meanwhile eyeing her with"
"puzzled interest. Returning, she went on, incisively as a whip lash:"
"""I live on chance money, drink money, card money, saloon money. We're"
"gamblers,--we're all gamblers!"" She paused, an odd expression coming"
"over her face,--an expression that baffled Rance's power to read."
"Presently she resumed: ""Now, you asked me to-night if my answer was"
"final,--well, here's your chance. I'll play you the game,--straight"
"poker. It's two out o' three for me. Hatin' the sight o' you, it's the"
"nearest chance you'll ever get for me."""
"""Do you mean--"" began Rance, his hands resting on the table, his"
hawk-like glance burning into her very thoughts.
"""Yes, with a wife in Noo Orleans all right,"" she interrupted him"
"feverishly. ""If you're lucky,--you'll git 'im an' me. But if you"
"lose,--this man settin' between us is mine--mine to do with as I please,"
"an' you shut up an' lose like a gentleman."""
"""You must be crazy about him!"" The words seemed wrung from the Sheriff"
against his will.
friend?'
"'Like this, my lord?' I muttered stupidly."
"He nodded. 'Yes, like this,' he repeated. 'I have heard him called a"
"brave man. Coming of his stock, he should be; and when I saw him in"
"Tzerclas' camp he had the air of one. Now he starts at a shadow, is in"
"a trance half his time, and a tremor the other half. What ails him?'"
"I told him how he had been wounded, fighting bravely, and that since"
that he had not been himself.
"Count Hugo rubbed his chin gravely. 'It is a pity,' he said. 'We want"
all--every German arm and every German head. We want you. Man alive!'
"he continued, roused to anger, I suppose, by my dull face, 'do you"
know what is in front of you?'
"'No, my lord,' I said in apathy."
He opened his mouth as if to hurl a volley of words at me. But he
"thought better of it and shut his lips tight. 'Very well,' he said"
grimly. 'Wait three days and you will see.'
"But in truth, I had not to wait three days. Before sunset of the next"
"I began to see, and, downcast as I was, to prick up my ears in wonder."
"Beyond Romhild and between that town and Bamberg, the great road which"
"runs through the valley of the Pegnitz, was such a sight as I had"
never seen. For many miles together a column of dust marked its
"course, and under this went on endless marching. We were but a link in"
"a long chain, dragging slowly southwards. Now it was a herd of"
"oxen that passed along, moving tediously and painfully, driven by"
half-naked cattle-men and guarded by a troop of grimy horse. Now it
"hard work must be strong and healthy, and they should have strong and"
"healthy children....  Do I speak truly?"""
"""Yes,"" assented the listeners."
"""But all this will never happen,"" says Yashka, becoming rather"
"frightened at the prospect held out to him by the teacher.  ""She is"
"healthy, and I cannot have reached the child ...  She is a devil--a"
"hag!"" he shouts angrily.  ""I would ...  She will eat me away as rust"
"eats iron."""
"""I understand, Yakov, that you cannot help beating your wife,"" the"
"teacher's sad and thoughtful voice again breaks in.  ""You have many"
reasons for doing so ... It is your wife's character that causes you to
"beat her so incautiously ...  But your own dark and sad life ..."""
"""You are right!"" shouts Yakov.  ""We live in darkness, like the"
"chimney-sweep when he is in the chimney!"""
"""You are angry with your life, but your wife is patient; the closest"
"relation to you--your wife, and you make her suffer for this, simply"
"because you are stronger than she.  She is always with you, and cannot"
"get away.  Don't you see how absurd you are?"""
"""That is so....  Devil take it!  But what shall I do?  Am I not a man?"""
"""Just so!  You are a man....  I only wish to tell you that if you"
"cannot help beating her, then beat her carefully and always remember"
that you may injure her health or that of the child.  It is not good to
beat pregnant women ... on their belly or on their sides and chests....
"Beat her, say, on the neck ... or else take a rope and beat her on some"
"soft place ..."""
mix the hats.... Ha-ha!” He laughed mock-tragically. “This night must
never be forgotten!”
"“It never will,” said Blotte; and laughing grimly he got striding again"
"in the red wig, as Fluffy Reubens and Doome burst into the room."
"“Here, Fluffy,” said Rippley, “quick, man! put on this yellow wig, and"
"comb it well over your eyes. There isn’t a moment to be lost; Doome,"
here’s a black moustache and a greyish wig--this is the way to stick it
on--see? Splendid! Makes you look like a broken-down Italian tenor.”
He searched about in the cabinet and found a stubbly black wig which he
"pulled over his own hair, and was at once a son of France:"
"“Look here, boys, I’m head-waiter, see! And when I bow, you bow: and"
"when I rub my hands, you rub your hands; and don’t forget the foreign"
"accent--try to talk English as you used to talk French.... Doome, you"
"stand at the landing below, and see that old Dukes don’t stir a step"
"from the door--and bawl up the names from him. And you, Fluffy, play"
the general ass. I’ll stick to the door here.... Are we all right
"now?... No, Blotte’s not enough disguised. Here, Doome, fasten this"
"fierce moustache on his lip, whilst I shut up.... O lor! here they"
come!”
Rippley had scarcely hurried into his coat when there entered and
halted in the great doorway a hesitating figure in the white satin
"dress of a courtier of Charles the First, lace frills at his weak"
"knees, white stockings, white shoes, and holding a plumed hat in his"
hand.
"His eyeglass dropped out of his eye, and he stood there stuttering and"
aghast.
Dawson spoke with less than his usual cheery confidence. I fancy that
the thinness and whiteness of his face were not wholly due to
disguise. He had not been to bed since he had been called up in the
"middle watch of the night before last, and the man was worn out."
"""If you take my poor advice, Dawson,"" I said, ""you will cut off now"
and get some sleep. Even your brain cannot work continuously without
"rest. The country needs you at your best, and needs you very badly"
"indeed."""
"His dull, weary eyes lighted as if under the stimulus of champagne,"
and he turned upon me a look which was almost affectionate. I really
"began to believe that Dawson likes me, that he sees in me a kindred"
spirit as patriotically unscrupulous as himself.
"He jumped up and gripped my hand. ""You are right. I will put in a few"
hours' sleep and then to work once more. This time I am up against a
"man who is nearly as smart as I am myself, and I can't afford to carry"
"any handicap."""
"I led him to the door and put him out, and then turned to Cary with a"
"laugh. ""And I, too, will follow Dawson's example. It is past one, and"
"my head is buzzing with queer ideas. Perhaps, after all, the Germans"
"have more imagination than we usually credit them with. I wonder--"""
But I did not tell to Cary what I wondered.

"'I do not know,' my lady answered, and told him shortly of our flight,"
and how we had lain two days and a night in the osier-bed.
"'It was a good thought,' he said. 'But I fear that you are half"
"famished.' And he called for food and wine, and served my lady with"
"his own hands, while he saw that we did not go without. 'Campaigner's"
"fare,' he said. 'But you come of a fighting stock, Countess, and can"
put up with it.'
"'Shame on me if I could not,' she answered."
"There was a quaver in her voice, which showed how the rencontre moved"
"her, how full her heart was of unspoken gratitude."
"'When you have finished, we will get to horse,' he said. 'I must take"
"you with me to Nuremberg, for I am not strong enough to detach a"
"party. But this evening we will make a long halt at Hesel, and secure"
you a good night's rest.'
"'I am sorry to be so burdensome,' my lady said timidly."
"He shrugged his shoulders without compliment, but I did not hear what"
he answered. For I could bear no more. Marie seemed so forgotten in
"this crowd, so much a thing of the past, that my gorge rose. No word"
"of her, no thought of her, no talk of a search party! I pictured her"
"forlorn, helpless little figure, her pale, uncomplaining face--I and"
no one else; and I had to go away into the bushes to hide myself. She
"was forgotten already. She had done all for them, I said to myself,"
and they forgot her.
"Then, in the thicket screened from the party, I had a thought--to go"
"back and look for her, myself. Now my lady was safe, there was nothing"
"No one spoke, and I looked from one to another. The men had returned"
"from the search, and stood in a dark group round the body, which they"
"had drawn to the side of the road. It wanted an hour of daylight yet,"
"and I could not see their faces, but I read in their silence the"
answer that no one liked to put into words.
"'Be a man!' Steve muttered, after a long pause. 'God help the girl."
But God help us too if we are found here!'
"Still my lady did not speak, and I knew her brave heart too well to"
"doubt her, though she had been the first to talk of going. 'Get to"
"horse,' I said roughly."
"'No, no,' my lady cried at last. 'We will all stay, Martin.'"
"'Ay, all stay or all go!' Steve muttered."
"'Then all go!' I said, choking down the sobs that would rise. And I"
turned first from the place.
I will not try to state what that cost me. I saw my girl's face
"everywhere--everywhere in the darkness, and the eyes reproached me."
"That she of all should suffer, who had never fainted, never faltered,"
whose patience and courage had been the women's stay from the
"first--that she should suffer! I thought of the tender, weak body, and"
"of all the things that might happen to her, and I seemed, as I went"
"away from her, the vilest thing that lived."
But reason was against me. If I stayed there and waited on the road
"by the old crone's body until morning, what could I do? Whither could"
I turn? Marie was gone and already might be half a dozen miles away.
"So the bonds of custom and duty held me. Dazed and bewildered, I"
a nice room. It ain’t often vacant. I had some most elegant people in
"it last summer—no trouble at all, and paid in advance to the minute."
The water’s at the end of the hall. Sprowls and Mooney kept it three

"here, and you see there is plenty of closet room. It’s a room everybody"
likes. It never stays idle long.”
“Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?” asked the young man.
“They comes and goes. A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with
"the theatres. Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district. Actor people"

"said, and would take possession at once. He counted out the money. The"
"room had been made ready, she said, even to towels and water. As the"
"housekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth time, the question"
that he carried at the end of his tongue.
“A young girl—Miss Vashner—Miss Eloise Vashner—do you remember such a
"one among your lodgers? She would be singing on the stage, most likely."
"A fair girl, of medium height and slender, with reddish, gold hair and"
a dark mole near her left eyebrow.”
"“No, I don’t remember the name. Them stage people has names they change"
"as often as their rooms. They comes and they goes. No, I don’t call"
that one to mind.”
No. Always no. Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the

Johnson bent low over her hand and kissed it. The Girl's straightforward
answer had filled his heart to overflowing with joy.
"""You know what that means, don't you?"" a moment later he asked."
Sudden joy leapt to her blue eyes.
"""Oh, yes,"" she told him with a world of understanding in her voice."
"There was a silence; then she went on reminiscently: ""There's a little"

the light burnin' before the Virgin an' see the saints standin' round
with glassy eyes an' faded satin slippers. An' I often tho't what they'd
"think if I was to walk right in to be made--well, some man's wife. It"
makes your blood like pin-points thinkin' about it. There's somethin'
"kind o' holy about love, ain't they?"""
"Johnson nodded. He had never regarded love in that light before, much"
"less known it. For many moments he stood motionless, a new problem of"
right and wrong throbbing in his bosom.
"At last, it being settled that Johnson was to pass the night in the"
"Girl's cabin, she went over to the bed and, once more, began to make it"
"ready for his occupancy. Meanwhile, Johnson, seated in the barrel rocker"
"before the fire, watched her with a new interest. The Girl had not gone"
"very far with her duties, however, when she suddenly came over to him,"
plumping herself down on the floor at his feet.
"""Say, did you ever ask any other woman to marry you?"" she asked as she"

"world you desire to see, you will meet with every success at the Kursaal"

Such was Mrs. Winstanley’s passing thought one day. She was there with
"Sophia and Evan Wilmington. It was always a great pleasure, she used"
"to say, to have young people about her; and very naturally, since young"
people can be particularly useful in strange places to a middle-aged
"lady. The brother and sister fetched and carried for her all day long,"
"which was very nice and suitable, and Mrs. Winstanley was in her"
"most affable mood. On the day in question, however, she saw, to her"
"astonishment and annoyance, Canon Chisely and Yvonne making their way"
towards her through the crowded lines of tables.
"“Good gracious, Everard!” she said as they came up. “How did you find"
your way here? I thought you were going to Switzerland.”
"“So we are,” replied the Canon. “We have broken our journey. And as for"
"getting here, we took the boat from Dover and then walked.”"
"“The frivolity of the place is infecting you already, Canon,” cried"
"Sophia, with a laugh. “I hope you are going to stay a long time.”"
"“Oh, not too long,” said Yvonne. “It wouldn’t be fair to the Canon, who"
needs some mountain air. This is just a little treat all for me.”
She glanced at him affectionately as she spoke. It was good of him to
tarry for her sake in this Vanity Fair of a place.
"“We were going by Calais, as you know,” said the Canon, explanatively"
to Mrs. Winstanley. “We only changed our minds a day or two ago--we
thought it would be a little surprise for you.”
But after a little it came to him that the yellow gleam did not seem
"any closer; in fact, it grew fainter; he knew then, with a moment's"
"panic, that the tide and wind were too strong for him. He cursed his"
"frail strength, with a smarting in his eyes that did not come from the"
salt water.
There was only one thing he could do. Turn his back on the friendly
light and strike out in the direction of the beach. It would be
"further, but the cross currents of the tide would not impede his"
progress so much.
"For a long time he fought ahead stubbornly, changing his strokes, even"
"swimming on his back. But his breath came with increasing difficulty, a"
sharp pain stabbed at his side. He labored on. The pain grew sharper
and caught at him like a horrible vise. Once he yielded to it and sank
"down, down into the black water. But it passed and, as he rose, he"
"struck out again, blindly, now, for he had lost all sense of direction."
"""Oh, God! Oh, God!"" he shouted in his heart. His Aunt Achsa's God,"
whose All-embracing Love he had questioned because that God had made
"him crooked, must help him now! ""I _got_ to get help!"" God _must_ hear"
him.
A great exhaustion seized him. He sank again with a quivering breath.
But now his feet touched sand. With new strength he plunged ahead.
Again he was in deep water but he swam with eager strokes. The dreadful
pain stabbed but he did not heed. Now he saw moving lights. He was near
the beach! With a heartbreaking effort he fought the strength of the
"water, finally gaining the shallow depths. He heard voices nearby in"
the darkness.

in any English church.
"Etienne faced his death like the son of an ancient race, and a good"
"Catholic. He could not have a confessor, but he said his prayers,"
"committed his soul to God and the Virgin, and faced the black muzzles"
not greatly abashed.
"As for El Sarria, death was his _métier_, his familiar friend. He had"
"lived with him for years, as a man with a wife, rising up and lying"
"down, eating and breathing in his company. ""The fortune of war,"" as"
Cabrera said. El Sarria was ready. Dolóres and her babe were safe. He
asked no more.
And not less readily fell into line Rollo Blair. A little apart he stood
as they made ready to march out of the presence of the Carlist general.
"John Mortimer was already on his way, carefully and conscientiously"
"ordering his going, that he might not in these last things disgrace his"
nation and his upbringing. Etienne and Ramon were following him. Still
"the young Scot lingered. Cabrera, nervously fingering his accoutrement"
"and signing papers at a folding table, found time to eye him with"
curiosity.
"""Did he mean to make a last plea for mercy?"" he thought."
Cabrera smiled contemptuously. A friend of Nogueras might know Ramon
Cabrera of Tortosa better. But Rollo had no such thought. He had in his
"fingers Etienne's last slip of Alcoy paper, in which the cigarette of"
"Spain, unfailing comforter, is wrapped. To fill it he had crumbled his"
last leaf of tobacco. Now it was rolled accurately and with lingering
"particularity, because it was to be the last. It lay in his palm featly"
"made, a cigarette worthy to be smoked by Don Carlos himself."

I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in
"front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their"
hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's
crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government
to run ships. I felt free all over--and happy. Now was my chance to

It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and
"behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out"
"of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white"
"doors--on and on and on. _Gee_, I thought excitedly, this is _one big"
ship_!
"Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of"
stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing
that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in _The Boy
"Rocketeers_, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing."
"So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned"
"left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading"
inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix
going _purr-purr-purrty-purr_ in the comforting way big machinery has
"when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the"
way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were
portholes on the hull.

"Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. ""Notice! Passengers"
"not permitted past this point!"" A big sign in red."
I peeked around the corner. I knew it--the next deck was the hull. I
"could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the"
velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed
existed in the Universe.
"There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this"
"distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely."
If I just took one quick look....
But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.
"Then I saw the big red sign again. ""Passengers not permitted--"""
Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth
"Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And"
didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to
get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the
"careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to"
men.
"""Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You"
"can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth"
"Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this"

"went to find Ned and got lost himself, and we go out to answer a call"
for help and get mixed up with a lot of half-breeds. I guess we’ll have
to take a company of state troops with us next time we go camping.”
"“Well, let’s be moving,” urged Frank. “Those fellows’ heads will be just"
sore enough when they quit rolling to shoot at anything in sight. They’d
string us up if they caught us now.”
"In accordance with this reasoning, the boys turned south in the thicket"
"then shifted to the east, then whirled back in a northerly direction. At"
one time they heard the shouts of the half-breeds on the slope far away
to the south.
"“They think we kept right on south,” laughed Jack. “Now,” he went on,"
"“we’ll walk north a long ways, climb the slope to the snow line, and"
come out on the camp from above. How’s that strike you boys?”
"“It listens good to me,” Frank answered. “Do you suppose Ned is back"
there yet?” he continued.
"“It struck me,” Jack replied, “that the half-breeds we encountered were"
out looking for Ned or Jimmie.”
"“You’ll have to guess again,” Harry put in. “The ginks we encountered"
were stationed there to catch any Boy Scout who came in answer to that
signal. That’s some more of the work of that crooked messenger.”

This teacher had once taught at an institution in one of the towns on
"the Volga, but in consequence of some story was dismissed.  After this"
"he was a clerk in a tannery, but again had to leave.  Then he became a"
"librarian in some private library, subsequently following other"
"professions.  Finally, after passing examinations in law he became a"
"lawyer, but drink reduced him to the Captain's dosshouse.  He was tall,"
"round-shouldered, with a long sharp nose and bald head.  In his bony"
"and yellow face, on which grew a wedge-shaped beard, shone large,"
"restless eyes, deeply sunk in their sockets, and the corners of his"
"mouth drooped sadly down.  He earned his bread, or rather his drink, by"
reporting for the local papers.  He sometimes earned as much as fifteen
roubles.  These he gave to the Captain and said:
"""It is enough.  I am going back into the bosom of culture. Another"
"week's hard work and I shall dress respectably, and then Addio, mio"

"""Very exemplary!  As I heartily sympathise with your decision, Philip,"
"I shall not give you another glass all this week,"" the Captain warned"
him sternly.
"""I shall be thankful! .... You will not give me one drop?"""
The Captain heard in his voice a beseeching note to which he turned a
deaf ear.
"""Even though you roar, I shall not give it you!"""
"""As you like, then,"" sighed the teacher, and went away to continue his"
"reporting.  But after a day or two he would return tired and thirsty,"
and would look at the Captain with a beseeching glance out of the
"corners of his eyes, hoping that his friend's heart would soften."
"""Yes. He is coming up soon for instructions. It's his last chance, as"
it is mine. He sees that he must be held responsible for the wire
"cutting in the _Antinous_, and to some slight extent also in the"

"""I often have to shave it,"" said Dawson, ""but I always grow it again"
between whiles. One can take it off quicker than one can put it on
again. False hair is the devil; I have never used it yet and never
will. So whenever I have a spell of leisure I grow a moustache against
"emergencies--like this one."""

"RINGROSE, BASIL. Buccaneer, pirate, and author."
Sailed in 1679 to the West Indies. A year later Ringrose had joined the
"buccaneers at their rendezvous in the Gulf of Darien, where they were"
preparing for a bold enterprise on the Spanish Main. They landed and
"marched to the town of Santa Maria, which they plundered and burnt."
Thence they travelled in canoes down the river to the Bay of Panama. After
"attacking the Spanish fleet and laying siege to the city, the buccaneers"
"cruised up and down the West Coast of South America for eighteen months,"
sacking towns and attacking Spanish ships. All this while Ringrose kept a
"very full and graphic journal, in which he recorded not only their"
"exploits, but also their hardships and quarrels, and gave descriptions as"
"well of the various natives and their customs, and drew charts and"
sketches.
"In 1681 Ringrose was still with Captain Sharp, and sailed through the"
"Straits of Magellan, and on January 30th of the same year anchored off"
"Antigua. Here he got a passage in a ship to England, landing safely at"
Dartmouth on March 26th.
"A year later he published an account of his voyage, as a second volume to"
"Esquemeling's, ""Bucaniers of America."" In 1684 he went to sea again in the"
"_Cygnet_ (Captain Swan), to traffic with the Spanish colonies. But the"
"Spaniards refused to trade with them. In October, 1684, they met the"
"famous Captain Edward Davis at that favourite haunt of the buccaneers, the"
Isle of Plate. The two captains agreed to join forces and to go together

It was extraordinarily easy for me to obtain employment in the heart

one of yourselves. I took the broad open path of full acceptance of
your conditions. I first obtained employment in a marine engineering

"meetings--I, a member of one of the oldest families in Trieste. Though"
"a Catholic, I bent my knee in the English Church, and this was not"

strange sect which consigns to the lowest Hell both Catholics and

"them, her head high."
"Sidney had a moment's longing to run after her and coax her to come,"
"but Pola's light giggle checked her. ""Isn't she a riot? I'd have _died_"
"if she'd come with us!"""
"""Oh, Pola--she'll hear you!"" pleaded Sidney."
She hated herself because she did not tell Pola at once how bravely
"Mart shouldered her responsibilities, about gran'ma, who looked to Mart"
for everything. Instead she simply walked along with Pola and let Pola
"giggle. Pola, sensing Sidney's feelings, slipped her arm through hers"
and gave it an affectionate little squeeze.
"""You're such a funny child,"" she said softly. ""You'd be nice to"
"anything. I can't, of course, for I go around to so many places and"
"mother's warned me often about strangers. Anyway, it's lots nicer for"
"just us two to be together, isn't it?"""
But in spite of Pola's soft flattery and countless lumps of sugar the
"tea tasted bitter to Sidney and the Green Lantern, with its futurist"
"awnings, its bizarre hangings and cushions, had no allure. The thought"
came suddenly to Sidney that it had been a whole week since she had
even seen Mart; in that time she had scarcely exchanged more than a
half dozen words with Lavender.
To the tune of Pola's ceaseless chatter Sidney's thoughts kept darting
back to that uncomfortable fact. Pola always talked of things she had
"done at home, abroad, at school, of her boy friends whom she called"
"""men."" She liked to hint of countless ""affairs"" which simply must not"

"""You'll have time enough after lunch,"" Slyne suggested, and drew the"
noble marquis toward the window.
"""The Marquis of Ingoldsby!"" muttered Captain Dove. ""A run in Slyne's"
"car! And--_Lady Josceline Justice!_"" He dug his knuckles forcibly into"
"his blinking eyes, and, ""I seem to be wide enough awake,"" said he in a"
stage aside as several waiters arrived on the scene.
While they were setting the table Sallie tried to collect her thoughts.
"Slyne had told her nothing till then, but that he had found out who her"
"folk were. And she had come away from the _Olive Branch_ blindly, only a"
little less distrustful of him than of Captain Dove's cruel intentions
"toward her if she had remained on board. Even now, she scarcely dared to"
believe--
In response to a sign from Slyne she took her place at the flower-decked
table. The Marquis of Ingoldsby immediately settled himself at her side;
"he also was obviously a young man who knew what he wanted, and meant to"
"have that at all hazards and, while the others were seating themselves,"
he ogled her killingly.
"Slyne had sat down at her other hand, leaving Mr. Jobling and Captain"
Dove to keep one another company behind the great silver centre-piece
"which adorned the circular table. The marquis, leaning on one elbow, had"
"turned his back on Mr. Jobling, and Slyne turned his on Captain Dove."
"""This is a little bit of all right!"" his lordship remarked to Sallie,"
"with a confidential grin. ""Only--I wish--How is it that we haven't met"
"before, Lady Josephine? But never mind that. Let's be pals now. Shall"
"we, eh?"""
"""Splendid!"" cry the people, approving the orator's deduction, and Tyapa"
"bellows all the time, scratching his breast.  He always bellows like"
"this as he drinks his first glass of vodki, when he has a drunken"
headache.  The Captain beams with joy.  They next read the
"correspondence.  This is, for the Captain, ""an abundance of drinks,"" as"
he himself calls it.  He always notices how the merchants make this
"life abominable, and how cleverly they spoil everything.  His speeches"
thunder at and annihilate merchants. His audience listens to him with
"the greatest pleasure, because he swears atrociously.  ""If I wrote for"
"the papers,"" he shouts, ""I would show up the merchant in his true"
"colours ...  I would show that he is a beast, playing for a time the"
"role of a man. I understand him!  He is a rough boor, does not know the"
"meaning of the words 'good taste,' has no notion of patriotism, and his"
"knowledge is not worth five kopecks."""

"brought down by them ..."""

continually struggled with and kept under the very tender heart--would
allow no one to slander Trehayne.
"Cary was watching me eagerly, waiting for me to read the letter."
"Dawson's head was resting on one hand, and his face was turned away,"
"so that I could not see it. He could not wholly conceal his emotion,"
but he would not let us see more of it than he could help. He did not
move once during my reading.

The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had
to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he
threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something
nasty about the length of his hair; and _imagine_!--he not only
"resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he"
sassed the judge in open court!
"""Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female"
"attorneys. Told _her_ that where _I_ came from, a man spoke his piece"
"when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side."""
"""What happened?"" I asked breathlessly."
"""Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took"
"my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the"
"rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated."" His eyes grew dark for"
"a moment. He chuckled again. ""But I wasn't going to serve all those"
"fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,"
"they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken"
mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.
"My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking"
"for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away."""
*       *       *       *       *
"For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill."
"""Y-you mean,"" I choked, ""th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?"
"And I'm with you while you're doing it?"""
He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.
"""What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what"
"business do _you_ have this close to the hull?"""
"What a coincidence: another barn on my road, just as in the days of the"
golden horn! It offers me plenty of straw and shelter for the night; but
"where is the girl who gave me the letter? How warm her breath was, coming"
"between lips a little parted! She will come again, of course; let us wait,"
"we have plenty of time, another twenty years--oh, yes, she will come...."
I must be on my guard against such traps. I have entered upon the
honorable years; I am weak and quite capable of believing that a barn is a
"gift from above: thou well-deserving old man, here is a barn for thee!"
"No, thank you, I'm only just in my seventies."
And so in my errand of the head I pass by the barn.
Toward morning I find shelter under a projecting crag. It is fitting that
"I should live under crags hereafter, and I lie down in a huddle, small and"
"invisible. Anything else you please, as long as you don't flaunt your"
selfishness and your rags!
"I am comfortable now, lying with my head on another person's knapsack full"
of used clothes; I am doing this solely because it is just the right size.
But sleep will not come; there are only thoughts and dreams and lines of
"poetry and sentimentality. The sack smells human, and I fling it away,"
laying my head on my arm. My arm smells of wood--not even wood.
But the slip of paper with the address--have I got the address? And I
scratch a match to read it through and know it by heart tomorrow. Just a
"line in pencil, nothing; but perhaps there is a softness in the letters, a"
womanliness--I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
"""I can not trust you,"" he said again, ""nor can I turn back. But there"
is one thing from the past which can not be changed. I love you. It
seems that must remain through all my life. And because of that love I
"must save you from the death that awaits your countrymen."" He smiled"
"in faint self-contempt. ""It is not for your sake that I shall save"
"you; it is because I am too great a coward, and can not face the"
"thought that anything so horrible should come near you."" He turned to"
two native soldiers behind him and gave an order. When he faced
Beatrice again he saw that she held a revolver in her hand.
"""You do not understand,"" she said. ""You say you mean to save me, but"
"that is not in your power. It is in your power to save us all, but not"
"one alone. I know what my people have resolved to do. There are weak,"
"frightened women among them, but not one of them will fall into your"
"hands alive. Whatever happens, I shall share their fate."""
"Though her tone was quiet and free from all bravado, he knew that she"
"was not boasting. He knew, too, that she was desperate."
"""You can not force me to kill you,"" he said sternly."
"""I think it possible,"" she answered. She was breathing quickly, and"
"her eyes were bright with a reckless, feverish excitement. But the"
hand that held the revolver pointed at the men behind him was
steady--steadier than his own.
Nehal Singh motioned back the two natives who had advanced at his
order.
"""You play a dangerous game,"" he said, ""and, as before, your strength"
lies in my weakness--in my folly. But this time you can not win. My
"""Nehal--turn back! Turn back!"""
He did not understand her. He thought she was still pleading with him.
"""I can not--God have pity on us both!"""
Then she too set her lips. She could not betray the last hope of that
heroic handful of men and women behind her. He must go to his
"death--and she to hers. She fired,--whether with success or not, she"
never knew. In that same instant another sound broke upon their
"ears--the sound of distant firing, the rattle of drums and the high"
clear call of a trumpet. Nehal Singh swung around. She caught a
"glimpse of his face through the smoke, and she saw something written"
there which she could not understand. She only knew that his features
"seemed to bear a new familiarity, as though a mask had been torn from"
"them, revealing the face of another man, of a man whom she had seen"
"before, when and where she could not tell. She had no time to analyze"
her emotions nor the sense of violent shock which passed over her. She
"heard Nehal Singh giving sharp, rapid orders in Hindustani. The room"
emptied. She saw him follow the retreating natives. At the door he
turned and looked back at her. At no time had his love for her
revealed itself more clearly than in that last glance.
"""The English regiment has come to help you,"" he said. ""Fate has"
"intervened between us this time. May we never meet again!"""
"He passed out through the shattered doorway, but she stood where he"
"had left her, motionless, almost unconscious. It was thus Nicholson"
"and the Colonel found her when, a moment later, they entered the room"
by the verandah. Colonel Carmichael's passionate reproaches died away
as he saw her face.
"""The Magic Apples"" (_Norske Eventyr og Sagn_, optegnet av Sophus"
"Bugge og Rikard Berge, Christiania, 1909, p. 61) is probably a"
somewhat original version of one of the cycles of tales in which
"people acquire asses' ears, long noses, humped backs and other"
"adornments, through eating some enchanted fruit. The British Isles"
"are believed to be the home-land of this tale, and it is thought"
to have emigrated to Scandinavia by way of France and Germany.

SELF DID IT
"Once upon a time there was a mill, in which it was impossible to grind"
"flour, because such strange things kept happening there. But there was a"
"poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening, and she"
asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during
"the night. ""For heaven's sake,"" said the mill-owner, ""that is quite"
"impossible! There are ghosts enough in the mill as it is."" But the woman"
said that she must grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour
"in the house with which to make mush, and there was nothing for her"
children to eat. So at last he allowed her to go to the mill at night
"and grind some flour. When she came, she lit a fire under a big"
"tar-barrel that was standing there; got the mill going, sat down by the"
"fire, and began to knit. After a time a girl came in and nodded to her."
"""Good evening!"" said she to the woman. ""Good evening!"" said the woman;"
"kept her seat, and went on knitting. But then the girl who had come in"
began to pull apart the fire on the hearth. The woman built it up again.
I answered in a low tone that I thought she must.
'No!' my lady cried harshly--she could be cruel sometimes--'not with
"us. She does not belong to our party. Let her stay with her paymaster,"
and to-morrow he will doubtless reward her.'
What reward she was likely to get Fraulein Max knew well. She flung
"herself at my lady's feet in an agony of fear, and clutching her"
"skirts, cried abjectly for mercy; she would carry, she would help, she"
"would do anything, if she might go! Knowing that we dared not leave"
her since she would be certain to release the general as soon as our
"backs were turned, I was glad when Marie, whose heart was touched,"
joined her prayers to the culprit's and won a reluctant consent.
It has taken long to tell these things. They passed very quickly. I
suppose not more than a quarter of an hour elapsed between our first
"appearance and this juncture, which saw us all standing in the"
"lamplight, laden and ready to be gone; while the general glowered at"
"us in sullen rage, and my lady, with a new thought in her mind, looked"
round in dismay.
"She drew me aside. 'Martin,' she said, 'his orderly is waiting in the"
road with his horse. The moment we are gone he will shout to him.'
"'We have provided for that,' I answered, nodding. Then assuring myself"
"by a last look round that all were ready, I gave the word. 'Now,"
Steve!' I said sharply.
In a twinkling he flung over the general's head a small sack doubled
inwards. We heard a stifled oath and a cry of rage. The bars of the
"strong chair creaked as our prisoner struggled, and for a moment it"
"There was a train back to Cagliari that night, said the conductor, at"
which the fat man nearly burst out of his clothing like a bursting
seed-pod. He bounced on his seat. What good was that? What good was a
"train back to Cagliari, when their home was in Snelli! Making matters"
worse--
"So they bounced and jerked and argued at one another, to their hearts'"
"content. Then the conductor retired, smiling subtly, in a way they have."
"Our fat friend looked at us with hot, angry, ashamed, grieved eyes and"
"said it was a shame. Yes, we chimed, it _was_ a shame. Whereupon a"
self-important miss who said she came from some Collegio at Cagliari
advanced and asked a number of impertinent questions in a tone of pert
"sympathy. After which our fat friend, left alone, covered his clouded"
"face with his hand, turned his back on the world, and gloomed."
"It had all been so dramatic that in spite of ourselves we laughed, even"
while the q-b shed a few tears.
*       *       *       *       *
"Well, the journey lasted hours. We came to a station, and the conductor"
said we must get out: these coaches went no further. Only two coaches
"would proceed to Mandas. So we climbed out with our traps, and our fat"
"friend with his saddle-bag, the picture of misery."
The one coach into which we clambered was rather crowded. The only other
coach was most of it first-class. And the rest of the train was freight.
We were two insignificant passenger wagons at the end of a long string
of freight-vans and trucks.
"There was an empty seat, so we sat on it: only to realize after about"
"five minutes, that a thin old woman with two children--her"
"third, also in French, and bearing no signature, made an appointment to"
meet her in the English tea-shop in the Rue Royale on the following day
at five o'clock.
"That note, written upon plain paper of business appearance, had"
"apparently been left by hand.  Who, I wondered, was the person who had"
"made that appointment?  To me the writing seemed disguised, and"
"probably, owing to the thickness of the up-strokes, had been penned by a"
"male hand.  There was a mistake in the orthography, too, the word"
"""plaisir"" being written ""plasir.""  This showed plainly that no Frenchman"
had written it.
"I placed the letter in my pocket, and, encouraged by it, continued my"
investigations.
In the tiny letter-rack was a note which the unfortunate girl had
written immediately before being struck down.  It was addressed to
"""Baronne Maillac, Chateau des Grands Sablons, Seine et Marne.""  The"
little escritoire contained four small drawers; the contents of each I
"carefully scrutinised.  They were, however, mostly private letters of a"
social character--some from persons whom I knew well in Society.
"Suddenly, from the bottom of one of the smaller drawers, I drew forth"
several sheets of plain octavo paper of a pale yellow shade.  There
"were, perhaps, half-a-dozen sheets, carefully wrapped in a sheet of"
"plain blue foolscap.  I opened them, and, holding one up to the light,"
examined the water-mark.
Next instant the truth was plain.  That paper was the official paper
used in French Government offices for written reports.  How came it in
"her possession, if the accusation against her were untrue?"
"I held it in my hand, glaring at it in bewilderment.  Sheet by sheet I"
At Bruges they were told that the train would not leave for Ghent
and Brussels for another two hours--some mobilization delay; so Hawk
proposed they should go and see the Memlings and then have some
dinner.
"""Don't you think they're perfectly wonderful?""--_àpropos_ of the"
pictures in the Hospital of St. Jean.
"_Vivie_: ""It depends on what you mean by 'wonderful.' If you admire"
the fidelity of the reproduction in colour and texture of the
"Flemish costumes of the fifteenth century, I agree with you. It is"
also interesting to see the revelations of their domestic
"architecture and furniture of that time, and the types of domestic"
"dog, cow and horse. But if you admire them as being true pictures of"
"life in Palestine in the time of Christ, or in the Rhineland of the"
"fifth century, then I think they--like most Old Masters--are"
perfectly rotten. And have you ever remarked another thing about all
"paintings prior to the seventeenth century: how _plain_, how _ugly_"
all the people are? You never see a single good-looking man or
woman. Do let's go and have that dinner you spoke of. I've got a
"prison appetite."""
At Ghent another delay and a few uneasy rumours. The Court was said
to be removing from Brussels and establishing itself at Antwerp. The
train at last drew into the main station at Brussels half an hour
after midnight. Vivie's mother was nowhere to be seen. She had
evidently gone back to the Villa Beau-séjour while she could. It was
too late for any tram in the direction of Tervueren. There were no
taxis owing to the drivers being called up. Leaving most of her
luggage at the cloak-room--it took her about three-quarters of an
"I manage to reach the trading center at midday, when everyone is up and"
"about, and the post office open. They give me a large sheet of wrapping"
paper and string and sealing wax; I wrap the parcel and seal it and write
on the outside. There!
"Oh--I forgot the slip of paper with the address--to put it inside, I mean."
"Stupid! But otherwise I have done what I should. As I continue on my way,"
I feel strangely void and deserted; no doubt because the knapsack was
"quite heavy after all, and now I am well rid of it. ""The last pleasure!"" I"
"think suddenly. And as I walk on I think irrelevantly: ""The last country,"
"the last island, the last pleasure...."""
XXXI
What now?
"I didn't know at first. The winter stood before me, my summer behind"
"me--no task, no yearning, no ambition. As it made no difference where I"
"stayed, I remembered a town I knew, and thought I might as well go"
"there--why not? A man cannot forever sit by the sea, and it is not"
necessary to misunderstand him if he decides to leave it. So he leaves
his solitude--others have done so before him--and a mild curiosity drives
him to see the ships and the horses and the tiny frostbitten gardens of a
"certain town. When he arrives there, he begins to wonder in his idleness"
"if he does not know someone in this town, in this terrifyingly large town."
"The moonlight is bright now, and it amuses him to give himself a certain"
"address to visit evening after evening, and to take up his post there as"
"though something depended on it. He is not expected anywhere else, so he"
"experience!--most amusing, I assure you! and quite unique! Why--"" and"
"suddenly stopping short, she turned smartly round and gesticulated with"
"one hand ... ""I have interviewed all the favorite actors and actresses"
in London! The biggest brewers in Great Britain have received me at
"their country mansions, and have given me all the particulars of their"
lives from earliest childhood! The author of 'Hugger Mugger's Curse'
took the greatest pains to explain to me how he first collected the
"materials for his design. The author of that most popular story,"
"'Darling's Twins,' gave me a description of all the houses he has ever"
"lived in,--he even told me where he purchased his writing-paper, pens,"
and ink! And to think that a POET should be too grand to be
"interrogated! Oh, the idea is really very funny! ... quite too funny"
"for anything! ""She gave a short laugh,--then relapsing into severity,"
"she added ... ""You will, I hope, tell Mr. Alwyn I called?"""
"Villiers bowed. ""Assuredly!"""
"""Thank you! Because it is possible he may have different opinions to"
"yours,--in that case, if he writes me a line, fixing an appointment, I"
"shall be very pleased to call again. I will leave my card,--and if Mr."
"Alwyn is a sensible man, he will certainly hold broader ideas on the"
subject of 'interviewing' than YOU appear to entertain. You are QUITE
"sure I cannot see him?"""
"""Quite!""--There was no mistake about the firm emphasis of this reply."
"""Oh, very well!""--here she opened the door, rattling the handle with"
"rather an unnecessary violence,--""I'm sorry to have taken up any of"
"your time, Mr. Villiers. Good-morning!"""
"""Good-morning!"" ... returned Villiers calmly, touching the bell that"
his servant might be in readiness to show her out. But the baffled
"""I did not send for one--I sent for you,"" was her response."
"""But we must call a doctor at once,"" I urged.  ""If you have suspicion of"
"foul play we should surely know if there is any wound, or any injury to"
"account for death."""
"""I did not consider it necessary.  No doctor can return her to me,"" she"
"wailed.  ""I sent for you because I believed that you would render me"
"assistance in this terrible affair."""
"""Most certainly I will,"" I replied.  ""But in our own interests we must"
"send for a medical man, and if it is found to be actually a case of foul"
"play, for the police.  I'll send a line to Doctor Deane, an Englishman"
"whom I know, who is generally called in to see anybody at the Embassy"
"who chances to be ill.  He is a good fellow, and his discretion may be"
"relied upon."""
"So saying, I scribbled a line on the back of a card, and told the man to"
"take a cab down to the Rue du Havre, where the doctor occupied rooms"
over a hosier's shop a stone's throw from the bustling Gare St. Lazare.
A very curious mystery was evidently connected with this startling
"discovery, and I was anxious that my friend, Dick Deane, one of my old"
"chums of Rugby days, should assist me in clearing it up."
"The Countess de Foville, whose calmness had been so remarkable while"
"speaking with me before we entered the death-chamber, had now given way"
"to a flood of emotion.  She sank back into her chair, and, burying her"
"face in her hands, cried bitterly."
"I tried to obtain some further information from her, but all that"
escaped her was:
"delighted to meet such redoubtable warriors, and hoped that now they"
"would come with me and help me, as my business was to fight Germans,"
"airships and all. This was strictly true, for, but for German"
"influence, there would have been no need to wage war on the Raiders"
who had only been induced to become our enemies by lying German
propaganda.
Idu said they would be only too glad to go with the Sahib and to help
him fight the enemies of the British Raj. He also told me that he had
already saved my life once that evening.
"""How was that?"" I asked, my spirits rising as I gazed through the"
darkness at my first three recruits.
"""Well, Sahib,"" returned Idu, ""when the airship, which you say is"
"no airship, stopped, in a little while we saw the figure of a man,"
"carrying a lantern moving towards us, and Halil here,"" laying his"
"hand on the shoulder of one of his pals, ""lifted his rifle and was"
"about to shoot. But I said, 'Nay. See, it is but one man. Let us wait"
and see who he is.' And then the lantern went out and there was no
"longer a target."""
"""You did well, Idu,"" I said solemnly. ""You have most certainly saved"
"my life, and as you seem to be as intelligent as you are brave, I"
shall appoint you to my personal staff. I am the officer who has
"been sent out to take command of the forces along the Sarhad, and in"
Seistan. But at the present moment my chief concern is to find the
"right road to Saindak. Can you show it to me?"""
"Idu laughed. ""I could lead you there blindfold, Sahib."""
"I felt the difficulties of the road were now over, and, piloted by"
"when supper was over, and she would not break faith with him even if it"
"were at the peril of her life. The next moment she went out, as did the"
red light in the Girl's lantern hanging on a peg of the outer door.
"""Oh, please, please,"" said the Girl, half-protestingly, half-willingly."
But the man was no longer to be denied; he kept on urging:
"""One kiss, only one."""
"Here was an appeal which could no longer be resisted, and though"
"half-frightened by the tone of his voice and the look in his eye, the"
Girl let herself be taken into his arms as she murmured:
"""'Tain't no use, I lay down my hands to you."""
"And so it was that, unconscious of the great havoc that was being"
"wrought by the storm, unconscious of the danger that momentarily"
"threatened their lives, they remained locked in each other's arms. The"
Girl made no attempt to silence him now or withdraw her hands from his.
Why should she? Had he not come to Cloudy Mountain to woo her? Was she
not awaiting his coming? To her it seemed but natural that the
"conventions should be as nothing in the face of love. His voice, low and"
"musical, charged with passion, thrilled through her."
"""I love you,"" said the man, with a note of possession that frightened"
"her while it filled her with strange, sweet joy. For months she had"
dreamed of him and loved him; no wonder that she looked upon him as her
hero and yielded herself entirely to her fate.
She lifted her eyes and he saw the love in them. She freed her hands
"from his grasp, and then gave them back to him in a little gesture of"
"kidnapping----"""
Gatepath looked around anxiously. The men were alone in a recess of the
"club smoking-room. ""Yes,"" he whispered eagerly. ""Yes, go on."""
"""I shall not do anything of the sort. You are a nice sort of family"
"solicitor, Gatepath. Apart from the personal danger of playing tricks,"
"can't you see that your interest lies with the bouncing heir, not with"
"the snuffy old family? Don't be an ass. Bring him home, give the House"
"of Lords the sensation of their placid lives, and let the good old"
British public enjoy a week of laughter. How they will bellow with joy.
"And the newspapers! I can see, Gatepath, that your agreeable young heir"
"is going to be the Success of the Season."""
"""You are not very helpful,"" groaned Gatepath. ""There must be a"
solution; there must be some way of shielding the Family from this
"frightful humiliation."""
"The interview with the Chief was a complete failure, and Gatepath parted"
from his old friend both hurt and angry. He had not expected ribald
"laughter in so grave a social crisis. The Chief must be a Radical, a"
"Socialist, even a Bolshevik, one empty of all decent political"
principles.
It was on his way home that Gatepath bethought him of Madame Gilbert.
"She, that beautiful, loyal-hearted woman, would not laugh. He remembered"
the glitter of unshed tears in the violet eyes when she had bade him
farewell. It was his tactless hand upon the open wound of Caporetto
"which had aroused those tears. He remembered also that Madame was free,"
"and that she had been trained to do the ruthless, unscrupulous work of"
"the Secret Service. She did not look either ruthless or unscrupulous,"
and it was in a strictly professional sense that Gatepath connected her
that mattered.
"""I can not,"" she said."
"""Beatrice, do not deceive yourself. Though my life is nothing to"
me--though I would give it a dozen times to save you--I can not do
"otherwise than go on. I may be weak, but I shall be stronger than my"
"weakness. My word is given!"""
He spoke with the tempestuous energy of despair. The minutes were
"passing with terrible swiftness, and any moment the sea behind him"
might burst its dam and sweep her and him to destruction. Already in
the distance he heard the dull clamour of voices raised in angry
remonstrance at the delay. Only those immediately about him were held
in awed silence by the power of his personality. Again Beatrice shook
her head. She stood in the doorway which opened out into the garden
where the besieged had taken refuge. There was no other way. He
advanced toward her. Instantly she raised her revolver and pointed it
at the first man behind him.
"""If I fire,"" she said, ""not even you will be able to hold them back."""
It seemed to her that she stood like a frail wall between two
"overwhelming forces--on the one side, Nehal with his thousands; on the"
"other, Nicholson--alone, truly, but armed with a set and pitiless"
"resolve. A single sentence, which had fallen upon her ears months"
"before, rose now out of an ocean of half-forgotten memories:"
"""Nicholson is the best shot in India,"" some one had said: ""he never"
"misses."" And still Nehal advanced. His jaws were locked, his eyes had"
a red fire in them. She knew then that the hour of hesitation was
"over, and that in that desperate struggle she had indeed lost."
Uncontrollable words of warning rushed to her lips.
"""We can do nothing but await the critical moment,"" said the Captain,"
"walking about among them.  ""When they turn us out we shall seek a new"
"place for ourselves, but at present there is no use spoiling our life"
by thinking of it ...  In times of crisis one becomes energetic ... and
if life were fuller of them and every moment of it so arranged that we
were compelled to tremble for our lives all the time ...  By God! life
"would be livelier and even fuller of interest and energy than it is!"""
"""That means that people would all go about cutting one another's"
"throats,"" explained Abyedok, smilingly."
"""Well, what about it?"" asked the Captain, angrily.  He did not like to"
hear his thoughts illustrated.
"""Oh!  Nothing!  When a person wants to get anywhere quickly he whips up"
"the horses, but of course it needs fire to make engines go ..."""
"""Well, let everything go to the Devil as quickly as possible. I'm sure"
I should be pleased if the earth suddenly opened up or was burned or
destroyed somehow .. only I were left to the last in order to see the
"others consumed ..."""
"""Ferocious creature!"" smiled Abyedok."
"""Well, what of that?  I ... I was once a man .. now I am an outcast ..."
that means I have no obligations. It means that I am free to spit on
everyone.  The nature of my present life means the rejection of my past
... giving up all relations towards men who are well fed and well
"dressed, and who look upon me with contempt because I am inferior to"
them in the matter of feeding or dressing. I must develop something new
"within myself, do you understand?  Something that will make Judas"
"Almost unconsciously Rollo put it to his lips. It was a cold morning,"
and it is small wonder that his hand shook a little. He was just
"twenty-three, and his main regret was that he had not kissed little"
"Concha Cabezos--with her will, or against it--all would have been one"
now. Meantime he looked about him for a light. The general noticed his
"hesitation, rose from the table, and with a low bow offered his own, as"
one gentleman to another. Rollo thanked him. The two men approached as
"if to embrace. Each drew a puff of his cigarette, till the points glowed"
"red. Rollo, retreating a little, swept a proud acknowledgment of thanks"
with his _sombrero_. Cabrera bowed with his hand on his heart. The young
"Scot clicked his heels together as if on parade, and strode out with"
head erect and squared shoulders in the rear of his companions.
"""By God's bread, a man!"" said Cabrera, as he resumed his writing, ""'tis"
"a thousand pities I must shoot him!"""
"They stood all four of them in the garden of the mill-house, underneath"
the fig trees in whose shade El Sarria had once hidden himself to watch
the midnight operations of Don Tomas.
"The sun was just rising. His beams red, low, and level shot across the"
"mill-wheel, turning the water of the unused overshot into a myriad"
pearls and diamonds as it splashed through a side culvert into the
"gorge beneath, in which the gloom of night lingered."
"The four men still stood in order. Mortimer and Etienne in the middle,"
with slim Rollo and the giant Ramon towering on either flank.
"""_Load with ball--at six paces--make ready!_"""
"The officer's commands rang out with a certain haste, for he could"
and was smitten in turn by the beak of Francesco's shield.
"Again Francesco rushed Raniero to the wall, leaped back and got in his"
"blow. Raniero's face was a red blur. He dropped his shield, put both"
"his hands to his sword and swung great blows at Francesco, with the"
huge rage of a desperate and tiring man. Francesco led him up and down
"the hall. Raniero's breath came in gasps, and his strength began to"
wane.
"Francesco bided his chance and seized it. He ran in, after Raniero had"
"missed him with one of his savage sweeping blows, and rushed him"
"against the wall. Then he struck and struck again, without uttering a"
"word, playing so fast upon Raniero that he had his man smothered,"
blundering and dazed. The end came with a blow that cut the crown of
"Raniero's helmet. He threw up his hands with a spasmodic gesture,"
"lurched forward, fell, rolled over on his back and lay still."
"For a moment Francesco stood over him, the point of his sword on"
Raniero's throat. He seemed to waver; then all the misery the
Frangipani had inflicted on Ilaria rushed over him as in a blinding
cloud.
"His sword went home. A strange cry passed through the hall, then all"
was still. The torch spluttered once more and went out. Francesco was
in the darkness beside the dead body of Raniero.--
Meanwhile the Pisans had succeeded in scaling the walls. The clamor of
"the fight grew less and less, as one by one the defenders of Astura"
were relentlessly struck down and hurled over the ramparts. The storm
"had increased in violence, the heavens were cataracts of fire.--"
In the blood-drenched court the duke and the Pisan admiral shook
"food than the mists of his own dreaming. However, it was different"
"when,--pausing before each word after the manner of a child,--she came"
"to a passage of the poet's, and read:"
"""'In that moment I say most truly that the spirit of life, which hath"
"its dwelling in the most secret chambers of the heart, began to tremble"
"so violently that the least pulse of my body shook herewith, and in the"
"trembling it said these words: ""Here is a deity stronger than I who,"
"coming shall rule over me.""'"""
"At that the Girl let the book fall and, going down on her knees and"
"taking both his hands in hers, she raised to him a look so full of"
adoring worship that he felt himself awed before it.
"""That 'ere Dante ain't so far off after all. I know jest how he feels."
"Oh, I ain't fit to read to you, to talk to you, to kiss you."""
"Nevertheless, he saw to it that she did."
"After this he told her about the Inferno, and she listened eagerly to"
"his description of the unfortunate characters, though she declared, when"
"he explained some of the crimes that they had committed, that they ""Got"
"only what was rightly comin' to them."""
The patient could hardly suppress his amusement. Dante was discarded and
instead they told each other how much love there was in that little
cabin on Cloudy Mountain.
The days that followed were all much like this one. Food was brought up
"from The Polka and, by degrees, the patient's strength came back. And it"
was but natural that he became so absorbed in his newly-found happiness
"that he gradually was losing all sense of danger. Late one night,"
"Jessica held the casket to Severance, with a little outward sweep of her"
"wrist. He took it and, folding his arms, looked at her steadily. A tide"
"of angry colour rose to her hair, then she turned her back upon him and"
looking out over the water tapped her foot on the rocks.
“Why do you not go?” she asked. “I hate you more than any one on earth.”
“No. You love me.”
"“I hate you! You are a brute! The coolest, the rudest, the most"
exasperating man on—on earth.”
"“That is the reason you love me. My dear Mrs. Pendleton,” he continued,"
"taking the ring from the casket and laying the latter on a rock, “a"
woman of brains and headstrong will—but unegoistic—likes a brutal and
"masterful man. An egoistical woman, whether she be fool or brilliant,"
"likes a slave. The reason is that egoism, not being a feminine quality"
"primarily, but borrowed from man, places its fair possessor outside of"
her sex’s limitations and supplies her with the satisfying simulacrum of
those stronger characteristics which she would otherwise look for in
man. You are not an egoist.”
He took her hand and removed her glove in spite of her resistance.
“Don’t struggle. You would only look ridiculous if any one should pass.
"Besides, it is useless. I am so much stronger. I do not know or care"
what really possessed you to indulge in such a freak as to engage
"yourself to four men at once,” he continued, slipping the ring on her"
"finger. “You had your joke, and I hope you enjoyed it. The dénouement"
"was highly dramatic. As I said, I desire no explanation, for I am never"
concerned with anything but results. And now—you are going to marry
me.”
PEACOCKS
Early the next day Pola appeared with Mr. Dugald in Sunset Lane in a
simple garb that must have satisfied even her exacting cousin. Her mood
was in accord with her attire as though she had left her sophistication
"behind with her silks and her rouge. She declared she felt as ""peppy as"
"they make them"" and ready to do anything anyone suggested. And Mr."
"Dugald, resigned to wasting two weeks to entertaining his young cousin,"
"of whom he was really very fond, promptly offered an astonishing"
assortment of suggestions from which he commanded the girls to choose.
"""Why, you wouldn't believe there were so many things to do!"" cried Pola"
"with real enthusiasm. ""Sidney, you'll have to decide."" And Sidney at"
once decided upon a tramp to Peaked Hill on the ocean side with an
early picnic supper.
"In the days that followed, Sidney's first admiration for Pola returned."
Though Pola would never again be the idol she was much more enjoyable
"as a chum. Her spirits, though an affectation, were infectious and gay;"
in her pretty clothes and with her pretty face she made Sidney think of
"a butterfly, a fragile, golden-winged, dainty flitting butterfly. She"
professed to enjoy everything they did--even to the picnics. She
tramped endlessly in her unsuitable shoes without a murmur of fatigue
and Sidney suspected that she really _did_ care a great deal for her
cousin Dugald's approval.
With Mr. Dugald they motored to Highland Light and to Chatham. They
toured the shops at Hyannis. They sailed with Captain Hawkes on the
_Mabel T_. They rose very early one morning and went to the Coast Guard
Station to watch the drill and then ate ham and eggs with Commander
stalk-like legs of his attackers from under them. One of the things
"went down, to twist weakly in a laborious attempt to rise again. But"
"the other, by sheer force of height and reach, began to bear Dex down."
"Savagely he laced out with his fists, battering the pulpy face that"
"was pressing down close to his. The big eyes blinked shut, but the"
four hose-like arms did not relax their clasp. Dex's hands sought
"fiercely for the thing's throat. But it had no throat: the head, set"
"directly on the thin shoulders, defied all throttling attempts."
*       *       *       *       *
"Then, just as Dex was feeling that the end had come, he felt the"
"creature wrench from him, and saw it slide in a tangle of arms and"
"legs over the smooth metal pavement. He got shakily to his feet, to"
see Brand standing over him and flailing out with his fists at an ever
tightening circle of towering figures.
"""Thanks,"" panted Dex. And he began again, tripping the twelve-foot"
"things in order to get them down within reach, battering at the great"
"pulpy heads, fighting blindly in that expressed craving to take as"
many of the creatures into hell with him as he could manage. Beside
"him fought Brand, steadily, coolly, grim of jaw and unblinking of eye."
Already the struggle had gone on far longer than they had dreamed it
might. For some reason the grotesque creatures delayed killing them.
"That they could do so any time they pleased, was certain: if the"
monsters could reach them with their shock-tubes through the double
"insulated hull of the space ship, they could certainly kill them out"
in the open.
Yet they made no move to do so. The deadly tubes were not used. The
circle of his own men. “Same gang who bought Schaeffer.”
"The jam boss nodded in a troubled way. “I’m afraid they’ve got us bad,"
"too. It’s goin’ to take one long time pickin’ that jam apart, but I"
can’t see anythin’ else to do. I spose I’d better start ’em at it right
"away, sir.”"
"“Not at all,” retorted Bob swiftly. “Do nothing of the kind. Let ’em"
"stay just where they are, Jerry!”"
At the sound of his imperative undertone Calker hustled up. There was a
"brief interchange of words between the trio, during which the faces of"
both lumberjacks brightened--amazingly. Then all three disappeared into
"the bushes a little way upstream, from which they did not emerge for a"
considerable time.
"When they finally appeared, Bainbridge held by his side a shapeless"
package of considerable size. Had not Peters and Calker walked so close
"beside him as he bent his way leisurely toward the crowd about the jam,"
it would probably have been noticed that this package was made up of a
"dozen or more sticks of giant powder fastened securely together, and"
depending from a sling of stout manila rope.
"The line of rivermen had turned, and were watching his approach with"
"interested curiosity, but Joyce and his gang could see nothing. Reaching"
"the men, Bob paused, struck a match, and carefully lighted the end of a"
"protruding fuse. As it sputtered up he gave a short, sharp word of"
"command, the line of men opened instantly to let him through, and a"
"second later he stood not a dozen paces from Joyce, deliberately"
swinging the deadly package round and round his head.
For a second there was a breathless hush. Then the red-haired man leaped
"steel-grey sea with wistful, far-away eyes."
At his instigation she veiled herself very closely. And he had brought
with him a hooded cloak for Ambrizette. No one took any particular
notice of the inconspicuous party which presently left the Hôtel de
"Paris in a hired car, as if for an excursion along the coast."
At a station fifty miles away they left the car and caught the
"night-mail for Paris. Slyne's baggage was on board it, in the care of a"
"sullen chauffeur, and there were also berths reserved for them all."
"""Did you see any more of Dubois?"" Sallie heard Slyne ask the man, who"
shook his head indifferently in reply.
The long night-journey passed without other incident than a dispute
"between Captain Dove and the sleeping-car attendant, which raged until"
Slyne threatened to have the train stopped at the next station and send
for the police. And the sun was shining brightly when they reached
Paris.
"Mr. Jobling went straight on to London, but Slyne took Sallie and"
"Captain Dove to a quiet but expensive hotel, where they remained for a"
"few days, which passed in a perfect whirl of novelty and excitement for"
"her. And when they in their turn crossed the Channel, she had for"
baggage at least a dozen new trunks containing the choicest spoils of
the Rue de la Paix. Slyne had pooh-poohed all her timid protests against
"his lavish expenditure on her account, and had also provided for Captain"
Dove and Ambrizette in their degree. He had evidently a fortune at his
"disposal, and was bent on showing her how generous he could be."
He was also unostentatiously displaying other good qualities which had
all gone to make those days pass very pleasantly for her. She could not
"I took down the address, but I was most ungracious to Eilert. Why couldn't"
he have kept the other knapsack--why this particular one?
Eilert replied that it was true the gentleman had offered him the other
"one, but he could see from the outside that it was not so good as this"
one. And I should remember that the money the missis had paid him hadn't
covered more than the bill for one of them. So it was only reasonable that
"he should take the fullest knapsack. As a matter of fact, he had behaved"
"very well, and that was the truth. Because when she gave him the larger"
"knapsack, and wrote the address, she had scolded, but he had kept quiet,"
"and said not another word. And anyway, nobody had better try it on"
"him--they'd better not, or he'd know the reason why!"
Eilert shook a long-armed fist at the sky.
"When he had eaten, drunk his coffee, and rested for a while, he was not so"
lively and talkative as on the previous day. He had been brooding and
"speculating ever since last summer, when the motor traffic started, and"
"did I think it would be a good idea for him to hire three grown men, too,"
and build a much bigger house than Olaus's?
"So he had caught it, too--the great, modern Norwegian disease!"
"The knapsack was back in her room again; yes, these were her clothes; I"
"recognized her blouses, her skirts and her shoes. I hardly looked at them,"
"of course; just unpacked them, folded them neatly, and put them back in"
the bag again; because no doubt Eilert had had them all out in a heap.
This was really my only reason for unpacking them.
finger-bowls.
The name of the other waitress was Tildy. Why do you suggest Matilda?
"Please listen this time—Tildy—Tildy. Tildy was dumpy, plain-faced, and"
too anxious to please to please. Repeat the last clause to yourself
"once or twice, and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite."
"The Voice at Bogle’s was invisible. It came from the kitchen, and did"
"not shine in the way of originality. It was a heathen Voice, and"
contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the
waitresses concerning food.
Will it tire you to be told again that Aileen was beautiful? Had she
donned a few hundred dollars’ worth of clothes and joined the Easter
"parade, and had you seen her, you would have hastened to say so"
yourself.
The customers at Bogle’s were her slaves. Six tables full she could
wait upon at once. They who were in a hurry restrained their impatience
"for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving, graceful figure."
They who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the
light of her smiles. Every man there—and they were mostly men—tried to
make his impression upon her.
Aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once.
"And every smile that she sent forth lodged, like pellets from a"
"scatter-gun, in as many hearts. And all this while she would be"
"performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans, pot roasts,"
"ham-and, sausage-and-the-wheats, and any quantity of things on the iron"
and in the pan and straight up and on the side. With all this feasting
and flirting and merry exchange of wit Bogle’s came mighty near being a
"salon, with Aileen for its Madame Récamier."
"gumming up their dope. Well, it's about time to plug in on E2. Here's"
"where the fireworks start!"" He closed the connections which transferred"
the central portion of the upper lookout screen to a small micrometer
screen at Breckenridge's desk and plugged it into the first
"check-station. Instantly a point of red light, surrounded by a vivid"
"orange circle, appeared upon the screen, low down and to the left of"
"center, and the timing galvanometer showed a wide positive deflection."
"""Hashed again!"" growled Breckenridge. ""I must be losing my grip,"
"I guess. I put everything I had on that sight, and missed it ten"
divisions. I think I'll turn in my badge--I've cocked our perfect curve
"already, before we got to the first check-station!"" His hands moved"
"toward the controls, to correct their course and acceleration."
"""As you were--hold everything! Lay off those controls!"" snapped the"
"computer. ""There's something screwy, just as I thought--and it isn't"
"you, either. I'm no pilot, of course, but I do know good compensation"
"when I see it, and if you weren't compensating that point I never saw it"
"done. Besides, with your skill and my figures I know darn well that we"
aren't off more than a tenth of one division. He's cuckoo! Don't call
"him--let him start it, and refer him to me."""
"""All x--I'll be only too glad to pass the buck. But I still think,"
"Steve, that you're playing with dynamite. Who ever heard of an"
"astronomer being wrong?"""
"""You'd be surprised,"" grinned the physicist, ""Since this fuss has"
"just started, nobody has tried to find out whether they were wrong"
"or not...."""
"""IPV _Arcturus_, attention!"" came from the speaker curtly."
"""Some of them,"" returned Villiers cautiously--""Not all. Not the Sunday"
"ones, for instance."""
"""Still, you can't possibly have helped seeing my descriptions of famous"
"people 'At Home,' you know! I write for ever so many journals. I"
"think""--and she became complacently reflective--""I think I may say with"
perfect truth that I have interviewed everybody who has ever done
"anything worth noting, from our biggest provision dealer to our latest"
sensational novelist! And all my articles are signed 'Tiger-Lily.' NOW
"do you remember? Oh, you MUST remember? ... I am so VERY well known!"""
There was a touch of genuine anxiety in her voice that was almost
"pathetic, but Villiers made no attempt to soothe her wounded vanity."
"""I have no recollection whatever of the name,"" he said bluntly--""But"
"that is easily accounted for, as I never read newspaper descriptions of"
"celebrities. So you are an 'interviewer' for the Press?"""
"""Exactly!"" and the lady leaned back more comfortably in the Louis"
"Quatorze fauteuil--""And of course I want to interview Mr. Alwyn. I"
"want..."" here drawing out a business looking note-book from her pocket"
she opened it and glanced at the different headings therein
"enumerated,--""I want to describe his personal appearance,--to know when"
"he was born, and where he was educated,--whether his father or mother"
"had literary tastes,--whether he had, or has, brothers or sisters, or"
"both,--whether he is married, or likely to be, and how much money he"
"has made by his book."" She paused and gave an upward glance at"
"Villiers, who returned it with a blank and stony stare."
"""Then,""--she resumed energetically--""I wish to know what are his"
methods of work;--WHERE he gets his ideas and HOW he elaborates
"them,--how many hours he writes at a time, and whether he is an early"
firing in the distance.
Clear days and clear nights followed each other. Sometimes a train would
"stop in front of the C.C.S., hissing and puffing, and throwing up a"
"great shaft of light. We would curse it, fearing that it would attract"
German raiders.
If only the fine weather would come to an end! Give us wind and rain so
that we could lie in bed without being oppressed by anxiety! But the sun
continued to shine and the stars to glitter.
"The disaster that had befallen the adjoining C.C.S., which had been"
"brilliantly lit up during the raid, had acted as a warning example to"
us. At nightfall the windows of the theatre were screened with blankets
and no lights were allowed to show in the wards or on the duckboards.
If only the trains would halt somewhere else at night-time!
One day a number of Flemish peasants began to collect hop-refuse in the
surrounding fields. They made three great heaps of it and set fire to
"them. In the evening the heaps were burning brightly, but no one took"
any notice.
The canteen was crowded. All the benches were occupied and men who were
unable to find seats stood around in groups. There was noisy
conversation and singing and shouting. Nearly everyone was drinking
beer. Those who sat at the tables were playing cards. The air was thick
with tobacco-smoke. Two or three candles were burning on every table.
"And all at once, without any warning, the thunder was loosened upon us."
"There was an ear-splitting roar and in a moment candles were swept away,"
"benches and tables overturned, and the whole crowd of men was down on"
"the floor, trembling and panic-stricken. Another detonation, and then"
"old, old babies inside. She holds up a lace parasol; he sucks the knob"
"of his cane, and the fat old bodies roll together as the cradle rocks,"
and the steaming horse leaves a trail of manure as it ambles down the
hill.
"Under a tree, Professor Leonard, in cap and gown, stands beside his"
"banner. He is here “for one day,” from the London, Paris and Brussels"
"Exhibition, to tell your fortune from your face. And he stands, smiling"
"encouragement, like a clumsy dentist. When the big men, romping and"
"swearing a moment before, hand across their sixpence, and stand before"
"him, they are suddenly serious, dumb, timid, almost blushing as the"
Professor’s quick hand notches the printed card. They are like little
"children caught playing in a forbidden garden by the owner, stepping"
from behind a tree.
The top of the hill is reached. How hot it is! How fine it is! The
"public-house is open, and the crowd presses in. The mother sits on the"
"pavement edge with her baby, and the father brings her out a glass of"
"dark, brownish stuff, and then savagely elbows his way in again. A reek"
"of beer floats from the public-house, and a loud clatter and rattle of"
voices.
"The wind has dropped, and the sun burns more fiercely than ever."
Outside the two swing-doors there is a thick mass of children like
flies at the mouth of a sweet-jar.
"And up, up the hill come the people, with ticklers and golliwogs, and"
"roses and feathers. Up, up they thrust into the light and heat,"
"shouting, laughing, squealing, as though they were being pushed by"
"something, far below, and by the sun, far ahead of them—drawn up into"
"the full, bright, dazzling radiance to... what?"
watches when they turned up the slope. They would have felt less
comfortable during the latter part of their journey if they had known
that they were passing within a few hundred yards of the headquarters of
the outlaws at the old mission.
After a time they came to what looked like a wrinkle in the face of the
"grand old mountain. They proceeded up this with no little caution, not"
knowing but enemies might be watching there. It was just such a place as
outlaws lurking for prey or cowering from officers would be apt to seek.
"The wrinkle, or gully, led almost to the snow line and finally ended in"
"a little dip which lay between two summits rising side by side, like"
jagged rows of teeth.
"“I’m half starved and half frozen!” Harry declared, as he rested for a"
"time in the depth of what had once been a mountain lake, but which had"
been drained by the gully. “If I ever get back in little old New York
"again, I’m going to get Dad to make me a gasoline buggy with a snout"
"nine feet long, and I’m going to push traffic aside on Broadway for the"
next thousand years.”
“How often have you said that?” laughed Jack.
"“Let’s see,” Frank put in, “this is the twelfth trip we boys have taken,"
"either in the interests of the Secret Service or on vacations, so this"
makes twelve times that Harry has promised never to leave New York again
once he gets back there.”
“That’s all right!” Harry grinned. “You fellows ain’t half so hungry as
I am or you wouldn’t feel so gay over it.”
"“Now, how far are we from camp?” asked Jack."
had marvellously recovered from his over-night's nervous break-down. A
"sound sleep, a visit from the barber, a bath and a liberal breakfast had"
all helped to alter him outwardly and inwardly for the better. He was
"once more the respectably prosperous, self-confident solicitor."
"""I believe you've been out all night,"" he observed in a jocular tone of"
"reproof, a waggish forefinger uplifted."
"""I've covered a couple of hundred miles in the car while you've been"
"asleep,"" answered Slyne, turning into his dressing-room. ""I've brought"
"the girl back with me--and the old man, her guardian. We're going to"
"have trouble with him unless we're very careful. So listen, and I'll"
"tell you how things stand."""
"Mr. Jobling composed his features into their most professional aspect,"
"but that gave place by degrees to a variety of other expressions, while"
"Slyne, busy changing his clothes, related all he himself knew as to"
Sallie's past history.
"""And now the old man thinks he is entitled to put a price on her,"" Slyne"
"concluded. ""She's promised to marry me, but he won't let her go till I"
"hand him a hundred thousand dollars."""
Mr. Jobling lay back limply in his chair. In all his career he had
"never, he asserted, heard a more scandalous suggestion."
"""Never mind about that,"" Slyne cut him short. ""The money's no object to"
me. But you can understand what a difficult fellow he is to deal with.
"And what I'm going to do, merely as a precaution against his playing us"
"false in the end, is to give him my note of hand for the amount he"
"demands, endorsed by you, and payable the day I marry his adopted"
"daughter."""
that bombing-stunt a few months ago. It was bloody awful too--the worst
thing I've ever been in. I was standing next to him when the first one
"exploded. He flopped down and lay flat on the ground, but I rushed away"
into the fields with a lot of others. When it was all over we went back
and heard the wounded crying out in a way that was dreadful to hear.
"This fellow was still lying on the ground by the duckboards, trembling"
"all over and paralysed with fear. We went to help the wounded, but he"
"was in such a state that he could not come with us, so we left him"
behind. There was an inquiry afterwards and _we_ got into a frightful
"row for running away. He got the M.M. for sticking to his post!"""

THE GERMAN PUSH
"""What madness there is in this arithmetic that counts men by the"
millions like grains of corn in a bushel.... A newspaper has just
written about an encounter with the enemy: 'Our losses were
"insignificant, one dead and five wounded.' It would be interesting"
to know for whom these losses are insignificant? For the one who
"was killed?... If he were to rise from his grave, would he think"
the loss 'insignificant'? If only he could think of everything from
"the very beginning, of his childhood, his family, his beloved wife,"
"and how he went to the war and how, seized by the most conflicting"
"thoughts and emotions, he felt afraid, and how it all ended in"
death and horror.... But they try to convince us that 'our losses
"are insignificant.' Think of it, godless writer! Go to your master"
the Devil with your clever arithmetic.... How this man revolts

"the shafts. They passed a long row of carriages, belonging to people who"
"had not feared to come and look on from a distance, and at last, knowing"
"the procession would go back another way, Medland bade his driver stop"
"under the trees, and lit a cigar."
"""And I wonder if it will all make any difference!"" said he, puffing"
delightedly. He had all an old political organiser's love for a big
"meeting, which does not exclude scepticism as to its value."
"""Oh, you gave it 'em finely,"" said the Treasurer."
"""I believe it'll frighten two or three anyhow,"" observed Norburn."
"""I _know_ we shall win to-morrow,"" cried Daisy, squeezing her father's"
arm.
"""Ah! here's a special Sunday evening paper--how we encourage"
"wickedness!"" said the Premier, seeing a newsvendor approaching. ""Let's"
"see what they say of us!"""
"""I've seen it all for myself,"" remarked Daisy, and she went on"
"chattering to the other two, who were ready to talk over every incident"
"of the meeting, as people who have been to meetings ever are. On they"
"went, reminding one another of the bald man in the third row who cheered"
"so lustily, of the fat woman who had somehow got into the front row and"
"fanned herself all the time, of rude things shouted about Messrs."
"Puttock and Coxon, and so forth. The Premier, listening with one ear,"
opened his paper; but the first thing he saw was not about his
"procession. He started and looked closer, then gave a sudden, covert"
"glance at his companions; they were busy in talk, and, with breathless"
"haste, he devoured the meagre details of Benham's wretched death. The"
"men-of-war as a petty officer. Until July, 1723, when 40 years of age,"
"Upton lived a perfectly honest life, but his wife dying, Upton found she"
had contracted various debts and that he was in danger of being arrested
"by the creditors. Leaving his four orphans, Upton hurried to Poole in"
"Dorsetshire, and was taken on as boatswain in the _John and Elizabeth_"
"(Captain Hooper), bound for Bonavista in Newfoundland. He seems to have"
"continued to sail as an honest seaman until November 14th, 1725, when"
"serving as boatswain in the _Perry_ galley, on a voyage between Barbadoes"
"and Bristol, the vessel was taken by a pirate, Cooper, in the _Night"
Rambler_. At his subsequent trial witnesses declared that Upton willingly
"joined the pirates, signed their articles, and was afterwards one of their"
most active and cruel men.
"Upton kept a journal, which was his only witness for his defence, in which"
he described how he was forced to sign the pirates' articles under threats
"of instant death. If his journal is to be believed, Upton escaped from the"
"pirates at the first opportunity, landing on the Mosquito coast. After"
"being arrested by the Spaniards as a spy, he was sent from one prison to"
"another in Central America, at last being put on board a galleon at Porto"
"Bello, to be sent to Spain. Escaping, he got aboard a New York sloop and"
"arrived at Jamaica in December, 1726. While at Port Royal he was pressed"
"on board H.M.S. _Nottingham_, serving in her for more than two years as"
"quartermaster, until one day he was accused of having been a pirate. Under"
"this charge he was brought a prisoner to England in 1729, tried in London,"
"and hanged, protesting his innocence to the last."

"""I will promise if you wish, madame, that no word shall pass my lips,"" I"
"said.  ""But as to assistance, I cannot promise until I am aware of the"
"nature of the service demanded of me."""
"""Of course,"" she exclaimed, with a faint attempt at a smile.  My words"
"had apparently reassured her, for she instantly became calmer, as though"
"relying upon me for help.  ""Then as you give me your promise upon your"
"honour to say nothing, you shall know the truth.  Come with me."""
"She led the way down the long corridor, and turning to the left suddenly"
"opened the door of a large and handsome bed-chamber, the wooden"
sun-blinds of which were closed to keep out the crimson glow of the
sunset.  The room was a fine one with big crystal mirrors and a shining
"toilette-service in silver, but upon the bed with its yellow silk"
"hangings lay a female form fully dressed, but white-faced and"
motionless.  In the dim half-light I could just distinguish the features
as those of Yolande.
"""What has occurred?""  I cried in a hoarse whisper, dashing towards the"
bedside and bending down to look upon the face that had once held me in
fascination.
"""We do not know,"" answered the trembling woman at my side.  ""It is all a"
"mystery."""
I stretched forth my hand and touched her cheek.  It was icy cold.
In those few moments my eyes had become accustomed to the dim light of
"the darkened room, and I detected the change that had taken place in the"
"girl's countenance.  Her eyes were closed, her lips blanched, her fair"
"hair, escaped from its pins, fell in a sheen of gold upon the lace-edged"
"them."""
Here a knock at the door interrupted the conversation. The servant
"entered, bringing a note gorgeously crested and coroneted in gold."
"Villiers, to whom it was addressed, opened and read it."
"""What shall we do about this?"" he asked, when his man had retired. ""It"
is an invitation from the Duchess de la Santoisie. She asks us to go
"and dine with her next week,--a party of twenty--reception afterward. I"
"think we'd better accept,--what do you say?"""
"Alwyn roused himself from his reverie. ""Anything to please you, my dear"
"boy!"" he answered cheerfully--""But I haven't the faintest idea who the"
"Duchess de la Santoisie is!"""
"""No? ... Well, she's an Englishwoman who has married a French Duke. He"
"is a delightful old fellow, the pink of courtesy, and the model of"
"perfect egotism. A true Parisian, and of course an atheist,--a very"
"polished atheist, too, with a most charming reliance on his own"
infallibility. His wife writes novels which have a SLIGHT leaning
"toward Zolaism,--she is an extremely witty woman sarcastic, and"
"cold-blooded enough to be a female Robespierre, yet, on the whole,"
amusing as a study of what curious nondescript forms the feminine
"nature can adopt unto itself, if it chooses. She has an immense respect"
"for GENIUS,--mind, I say genius advisedly, because she really is one of"
those rare few who cannot endure mediocrity. Everything at her house is
"the best of its kind, and the people she entertains are the best of"
theirs. Her welcome of you will be at any rate a sincerely admiring
"one,--and as I think, in spite of your desire for quiet, you will have"
"to show yourself somewhere, it may as well be there."""
"Alwyn looked dubious, and not at all resigned to the prospect of"
"that as a compliment.  But at my age--well, it is really cruel of you."""
"""Intelligence is more interesting to a diplomat than a pretty face,"" I"
"responded quickly.  ""And there is certainly no more intelligent woman in"
"all Paris than the Baronne de Chalencon."""
"She bowed stiffly, and her wrinkled face, which bore visible traces of"
"poudre orchidee and touches of the hare's-foot, puckered up into a"
simpering smile.
"""Well, and what else?"" she asked.  ""These speeches you have apparently"
"prepared for some pretty woman you expected to meet here to-night, but,"
"since she has not kept the appointment, you are practising them upon"
"me."""
"""No,"" I said, ""I really protest against that, Baronne.  A woman is never"
"too old for a man to pay her compliments."""
"We had strolled into a cool ante-room, and were sitting together upon"
"one of the many seats placed beneath clumps of palms and flowers, the"
only light being from a hundred tiny electric lamps hung overhead in the
trees.  The perfect arrangement of those ante-rooms of the Salle des
"Fetes on the nights of the official receptions is always noteworthy, and"
"after the heat, music, and babel of tongues in the grand salon it was"
"cool, quiet, and refreshing there."
"By holding her regular salon, where everybody who was anybody made it a"
"point to be seen, the Baronne had acquired in Paris a unique position."
Her fine house in the Avenue des Champs Elysees was the centre of a
"smart and fashionable set, and she herself made a point of being versed"
in all the latest gossip and scandal of the French capital.  She
"scandalised nobody, nor did she seek to throw mud at her enemies.  She"
"Commanded a Dutch vessel, the _Edward and Thomas_, that sailed from Boston"
"in 1674, and took several small English vessels along the coast of Maine."
"Tried for piracy at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and condemned to be hanged,"
but was afterwards pardoned.
"ROGERS, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"Commanded a ship, the _Forlorn_. Routed the Spaniards at Venta Cruz in"
1671. One of Morgan's captains in his attack on Panama.
"ROGERS, CAPTAIN WOODES."
"As the life of this famous navigator and privateer is, very justly,"
"treated fully in the ""Dictionary of National Biography"" it is unnecessary"
to mention more than a few incidents in his adventurous career. Woodes
"Rogers was not only a good navigator, for on many occasions he showed a"
remarkable gift for commanding mutinous crews in spite of having many
"officers on whom he could place little reliance. On leaving Cork in 1708,"
after an incompetent pilot had almost run his ship on two rocks off
"Kinsale called ""The Sovereigne's Bollacks,"" Rogers describes his crew"
"thus: ""A third were foreigners, while of Her Majestie's subjects many were"
"taylors, tinkers, pedlars, fiddlers, and hay-makers, with ten boys and one"
"negro."" It was with crews such as these that many of the boldest and most"
"remarkable early voyages were made, and they required a man of Woodes"
Rogers stamp to knock them into sailors. Rogers had a gift for inspiring
"friendship wherever he went. On arriving at the coast of Brazil, his boat"
was fired on when trying to land at Angre de Reys. This settlement had but
lately received several hostile visitors in the way of French pirates. But
before a week was passed Woodes Rogers had so won the hearts of the
"Portuguese Governor and the settlers that he and his ""musick"" were invited"
"the river played the whirlwind, with dust and clangor and the shriek"
of steel. Spears went down like trampled corn. The battle streamed
"down the bloody slope, for nothing could stand that furious charge."
"The river shut in the broken host, for the ford was narrow, not easy"
"of passage. From the north came the thundering ranks of horse, and on"
"the south the waters were calm and clear. The Provencals, streaming"
"like smoke blown from a fire by a boisterous wind, were hurled in rout"
"upon the water. They were hurled over the banks, slain in the"
"shallows, drowned in struggling to cross at the ford. Some few hundred"
"reached the southern bank, and scattered fast for the sanctuary of the"
woods.
In less than half an hour from the first charge the duke's men had won
the day. They gave no quarter; slew all who stood.
"The duke rode back up the hill, Francesco by his side, amid the cheers"
of his men.
"Southwest they rode towards the sea, their hundred lances aslant under"
the autumnal sky. They were as men challenging a kingdom with their
"swords, and they tossed their shields in the face of fate. The"
audacity of the venture set the hot blood spinning in their hearts.
To free Conradino from Anjou's clutches; to hurl damnation in the
mouth of the Provencals.
"As for Francesco, he was as a hound in leash. His sword thirsted in"
"its scabbard; he had tasted blood, and was hot for the conflict."
"On the fourth day they came upon the ruins of Ninfa, a town set upon a"
hill in a wooded valley. Vultures flapped heavenward as they rode into
"the gate; lean, red-eyed curs snarled and slinked about the streets."
LIKE A FALLING STAR
"Rollo judged aright. It was indeed no time for love-making, and, to do"
"the young man justice, he did not connect any idea so concrete with the"
impulsive kiss he had given to Concha.
She it was who had saved his life at Sarria. She was perilling her own
in order to accompany and assist his expedition. She had drawn up the
"ladder he had foolishly forgotten. Yet, in spite of the fact that he was"
"a young man and by no means averse from love, Rollo was so clean-minded"
"and so little given to think himself desirable in the eyes of women,"
that it never struck him that the presence of La Giralda and Concha
might be interpreted upon other and more personal principles than he had
modestly represented to himself.
"True, Rollo was vain as a peacock--but not of his love-conquests."
"Punctilious as any Spaniard upon the smallest point of honour, in a"
quarrel he was as ready as a Parisian _maître d'armes_ to pull out sword
or pistol. Nevertheless when a man boasted in his presence of the
"favours of a woman, he thought him a fool and a braggart--and was in"
general nowise backward in telling him so.
"Thus it happened that, though Concha had received no honester or better"
"intentioned kiss in her life, the giver of it went about his military"
"duties with a sense of having said his prayers, or generally, having"
performed some action raising himself in his own estimation.
"""God bless her,"" he said to himself, ""I will be a better man for her"
"sweet sake. And, by heavens, if I had had such a sister, I might have"
"been a better fellow long ere this! God bless her, I say!"""
"camp just where we were and wait for daylight, when we might regain"
the camel track.
"I knew he was right, but said I would make one final effort on foot"
"to find the track, and directed him to give me the hurricane lamp we"
carried on the car.
"Stumbling and slipping over the broken ground in the pitch darkness,"
"the lamp barely lighting up my immediate path, I had wandered some"
distance from the car when I heard voices. Instantly I thought of the
"Raiders who were over-running the district. It would be too galling,"
"too humiliating to be captured by them before the campaign, on which"
"I was building such high hopes, had even begun."
Noiselessly I put out the lamp and listened in the dense darkness.
"There was absolute silence for some minutes, and I stood stock still."
"Then voices sounded again, and I conjectured that there were not more"
"than two, or at the most three, speakers."
"I thought rapidly, and finally decided that there would not be many"
men in front of me. Had there been anything approaching an encampment
"of the Raiders in the neighbourhood, there would have been lights,"
camp fires and considerable noise. The voices I had heard probably
"belonged to men who had seen the lights of the car, and had come to"
find out what it was.
"I turned swiftly and made my way back to the car, where I had"
foolishly left my revolver. Recovering my weapon I warned Allan in a
"whisper of the voices I had heard, and told him to be ready to stand"
"by. Then I made my way back in the darkness, and when I had regained"
"the spot, called out loudly, in Hindustani, ""Who's there?"""

appeared to be magnified at least ten times. Clinching the fingers and
opening them again produced the feeling of their moving through a space of
several feet.']
"[Footnote 113: See _e.g._ Marie de Manacéïne, _Sleep_, p. 7.]"
"[Footnote 114: Horace Hutchinson, who in his _Dreams and their Meanings_"
"(1901), has independently suggested that 'this flying dream is caused by"
"some action of the breathing organs,' mentions the significant fact (p."
128) that the idea of filling the lungs as a help in levitation occurs in
the flying dreams of many persons.]
[Footnote 115: We have an analogous state of tactile anaesthesia in the
early stages of chloroform intoxication. Thus Elmer Jones found that this
"sense is, after hearing, the first to disappear. 'With the disappearance"
"of the tactile sense and hearing,' he remarks, 'the body has completely"
"lost its orientation. It appears to be nowhere, simply floating in space."
It is a most ecstatic feeling.']
[Footnote 116: Lafcadio Hearn describes the fall as coming at the
"beginning of the dream. Dr. Guthrie (_Clinical Journal_, June 7, 1899),"
"in his own case, describes the flying sensations as coming first and the"
"falling as coming afterwards, and apparently due to sudden failure of the"
power of flight; the first part of the dream is agreeable but after the
"fall the dreamer awakes shaken, shocked, and breathless.]"
[Footnote 117: The disagreeable nature of falling in dreams may probably
be connected with the absence of rhythm usually present in dreams of
flying. Most of the psychologists who have occupied themselves with rhythm
"have insisted on its pleasurable emotional tone, as leading to a state"
"bordering on ecstasy (see _e.g._ J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied"
willing to give their highest degrees to encourage it.
"83,654. (Mr. Macdonald). The witness did not think it was necessary to"
"have a non-Indian element in the service in order to stiffen it up, but"
he accepted the principle that there should be a certain small
proportion of non-Indians.
"83,655. The title of professor at a college or University should carry"
"with it dignity and honour, and ought not to be so freely used as at"
present. All he asked was that it should not be abolished at the expense
of such Indians as were doing as good work as their European colleagues.
"83,656. If the Calcutta university continued to develop its teaching"
"side, there would be no objection to recruiting University Professors"
from aided colleges. This would have certain advantages.
"83,657. (Mr. Fisher). The witness desired to secure for India Europeans"
who had European reputations in their different branches of study. If it
"was necessary to go outside India or England to procure good men, he"
would prefer to go to Germany. This was the practice in America where
they were annexing all the great intellects of Europe.
"83,658. The witness would like to see India entering the world movement"
in the advance and march of knowledge. It was of the highest importance
that there should be an intellectual atmosphere in India. It would be
of advantage if there were many Indians in the Educational Service. For
"they came more in contact with the people, and influenced their"
"intellectual activity. Besides, on retirement they would live in India"
and their life experience would be at their countrymen's service.
"83,659. There was very little in the complaint made in certain quarters"
that the work of the Professors in the colleges in India was hampered by
exclaimed aloud and covered their eyes for a moment to shut out the
hideous sight of them. Now they examined them closely.
Manlike they were: and yet like no human being conceivable to an Earth
mind. They were tremendously tall--twelve feet at least--but as thin
as so many animated poles. Their two legs were scarce four inches
"through, taper-less, boneless, like lengths of pipe; and like two"
flexible pipes they were joined to a slightly larger pipe of a torso
that could not have been more than a foot in diameter. There were four
"arms, a pair on each side of the cylindrical body, that weaved feebly"
about like lengths of rubber hose.
"Set directly on the pipe-like body, as a pumpkin might be balanced on"
"a pole, was a perfectly round cranium in which were glassy, staring"
"eyes, with dull pupils like those of a sick dog. The nose was but a"
"tab of flesh. The mouth was a minute, circular thing, soft and flabby"
"looking, which opened and shut regularly with the creature's"
"breathing. It resembled the snout-like mouth of a fish, of the sucker"
"variety; and fish-like, too, was the smooth and slimy skin that"
covered the beanpole body.
*       *       *       *       *
"Hundreds of the repulsive things, there were. And all of them shoved"
"and crowded, as a disorderly mob on Earth might do, to get close to"
the Earthmen's ship. Their big dull eyes peered in through the glass
"panels, and their hands--mere round blobs of gristle in the palms of"
which were set single sucker disks--pattered against the metal hull of
the shell.
"""God!"" said Brand with a shudder. ""Fancy these things feeling over"
"your body...."""
"""The Señor, the tall stranger, had a mission to the Lady Superior of the"
"Convent,"" she began. ""From Don Baltasar Varela it was, Prior of the"
great Carlist Monastery of Montblanch. He trusted his papers into her
"hands as a guarantee of his loyalty and good faith, and here they are!"""
Concha flashed them from her bosom and laid them in the general's hands.
"Usually Cabrera was blind to female charms, but upon this occasion his"
eye rested with pleasure on the quick and subtle grace of the Andaluse.
"""Then you are a nun?"" he queried, looking sharply at her figure and"
dress.
"""Ah, no,"" replied Concha, thinking with some hopefulness that she was to"
"have at least a hearing, ""I am not even a lay sister. The good Lady"
Superior had need of a housekeeper--one who should be free of the
convent and yet able to transact business without the walls. It is a
serious thing (as your honour knows) to provision even a hundred men who
can live rough and eat sparely--how much harder to please a
convent-school filled from end to end with the best blood in Spain! And
"good blood needs good feeding----"""
"""As I well knew when I was a butcher in Tortosa!"" quoth Cabrera,"
"smiling. ""There were a couple of ducal families within the range of my"
"custom, and they consumed more beef and mutton than a whole _barrio_ of"
"poor pottage-eaters!"""
To make Cabrera smile was more than half the battle.
"""You are sure they had nothing to do with the slayers of my mother?"" He"
"was fierce again in a moment, and pulled the left flange of his"
moustache into his mouth with a quick nervous movement of the fingers.
"""He is come to do evil to--to Rollo!"" she said to herself, with a slight"
hesitation even in thought when she came for the first time upon the
Christian name.
But there was no hesitation in the swift assurance with which she set
"the rifle-stock to her shoulder, and no mistake as the keen and"
practised eye glanced along the barrel.
"She fired, and with a groan of pain the man fell back outside the"
enclosure.
The sound of Concha's shot was the first tidings to the besieged that
"the gipsies had really arrived. Rollo, stealing lightfoot from post to"
"post, pistol in hand, the Sergeant erect behind the vine-trellis on the"
"balcony between the rearward doors, Etienne and John Mortimer a little"
"farther along on the same side of the château, all redoubled their"
vigilance at the sound. But for the space of an hour or more nothing
"farther was seen or heard north, south, east, or west of the beleaguered"
palace of La Granja.
The gipsies had not had the least idea that their intention was known.
They expected no obstacles till the discharge of Concha's piece put them
"on their guard, and set them to concerting other and more subtle modes"
of attack. It was too dark for those in the château to see whether the
wounded man lay where he had fallen or whether he had been removed by
his comrades.
Rollo hastened back to Concha and inquired in a low voice what it was
she had fired at. Whereupon she told him the story of the man climbing
the railings and how she had stayed his course so suddenly. Rollo made
"no remark, save that she had done entirely right. Then he inquired if"
"inevitable, the conviction of the uselessness of sorrow, the vanity and"
selfishness of grief.
There is no meeting again with the dead. Nowhere in the recurring
"centuries shall we meet again those whom we have loved, whom we love,"
"who seem to us to be parts of our very soul. That which survives of us,"
"the part which is incarnated again and again, until it be fit for"
"heaven, has nothing to do with love and hate."
Even if in the whirlpool of life our paths should cross again the paths
"of those whom we have loved, we are never told that we shall know them"
again and love them.
"A friend of mine has just lost his mother, and he is very much"
"distressed. He must have been very fond of her, for although he has a"
"wife and children, and is happy in his family, he is in great sorrow. He"
"proposes even to build a pagoda over her remains, a testimony of respect"
which in strict Buddhism is reserved to saints. He has been telling me
"about this, and how he is trying to get a sacred relic to put in the"
"pagoda, and I asked him if he never hoped again to meet the soul of his"
"mother on earth or in heaven, and he answered:"
"'No. It is very hard, but so are many things, and they have to be borne."
Far better it is to face the truth than to escape by a pleasant
falsehood. There is a Burmese proverb that tells us that all the world
is one vast burial-ground; there are dead men everywhere.'
"'One of our great men has said the same,' I answered."
He was not surprised.
"'As it is true,' he said, 'I suppose all great men would see it.'"
"drunk complete their service by swinging their hammocks, sprinkling them"
with cold water and fanning them as they lie in a stupor. Smoking is
"another social custom, but the cigars are mere hollow rolls of tobacco"
and the lighted end is held in the mouth. Among some of the tribes in
"Comagre the bodies of the caciques, or chief men, were preserved after"
death by surrounding them with a ring of fire built at a sufficient
distance to gradually dry the body until skin and bone alone remained.
The Indians with whom the visitor to Panama most frequently comes into
contact are those of the San Blas or Manzanillo country. These Indians
"hover curiously about the bounds of civilization, and approach without"
"actually crossing them. They are fishermen and sailors, and many of"
"their young men ship on the vessels touching at Colon, and, after"
"visiting the chief seaports of the United States, and even of France and"
"England, are swallowed up again in their tribe without affecting its"
customs to any appreciable degree. If in their wanderings they gain new
ideas or new desires they are not apparent. The man who silently offers
"you fish, fruits or vegetables from his cayuca on the beach at Colon may"
"have trod the docks at Havre or Liverpool, the levee at New Orleans or"
wandered along South Street in New York. Not a word of that can you coax
from him. Even in proffering his wares he does so with the fewest
"possible words, and an air of lofty indifference. Uncas of the"
Leather-Stocking Tales was no more silent and self-possessed a red-skin
than he.

"aroused within me a deep sympathy, which had, within an hour, developed"
into that great and tender love of old.  With men this return to the old
"love is of no infrequent occurrence, but with women it seldom happens."
Perhaps this is because man is more fickle and more easily influenced by
"woman's voice, woman's glances, and woman's tears."
The reader will probably accuse me of injustice and of fickleness of
"heart.  Well, I cannot deny it; indeed, I seek to deny nothing in this"
"narrative of strange facts and diplomatic wiles, but would only ask of"
those who read to withhold their verdict until they have ascertained the
"truth yet to be revealed, and have read to the conclusion, this strange"
chapter of the secret history of a nation.
"My friend the doctor was holding one hand, while I imprinted a last kiss"
"upon the other.  A lump was in my throat, my eyes were filled with"
"tears, my thoughts were all of the past, my anguish of heart"
"unspeakable.  That small chill hand with the cold, glittering ring--one"
that I had given her in Brussels long ago--seemed to be the only reality
in all that hideous phantasmagoria of events.
"""Do not despair,"" murmured the kind voice of my old friend, standing"
"opposite me on the other side of the bed.  ""You loved her once, but it"
"is all over--surely it is!"""
"""No, Dick!""  I answered brokenly.  ""I thought I did not love her.  I"
"have held her from me these three years--until now."""
"""Ah!"" he sighed, ""I understand.  Man always longs for the unattainable."""
"""Yes, always,"" I responded."
In that moment the memory of the day when we had parted arose gaunt and
"the present Premier of Italy, who says:"
"""The church appears better than it once was. I no longer see in Rome"
"what I used often to see in my young days, ladies driving about its"
streets with their coachmen and footmen in the liveries of their
respective cardinals. Has this improvement come about because the
church is really growing better? Nothing of the kind. It is because the
"strong arm of the law checks the villainy of the priests."" That is the"
testimony of the Prime Minister of Italy.

[Sidenote: Do American Roman Catholics Believe in the Relics?]
"A few weeks after my return from Italy, while driving one afternoon"
"with a friend of mine, a lawyer of high intelligence and wide"
"information, our conversation turned to the subject of the recent death"
"of Pope Leo XIII., and from that drifted to the alleged liquefaction"
"of the blood of St. Januarius, and from that to relics in general. I"
mentioned some of the facts above stated concerning the numerous pieces
of the true cross and the miracle-working bones and oils to be seen in
"Roman Catholic churches in Europe. ""But,"" he said, ""surely the Roman"
"Catholics in America do not believe in such mediæval superstitions."""
"I happened to have in hand a couple of copies of a daily newspaper,"
"published in one of our Southern towns, dated August 9, 1903, and"
"August 17, 1903, respectively, containing extracts from the letters of"
"a Roman Catholic bishop, the highest dignitary of his church in that"
"State; and, for answer to my friend's remark, I cited the following"
"passage from the bishop's letter of July 10th, written from Munich,"
concerning the abbey church of Scheyern:
"""The chapel of the Holy Cross is specially sacred, as within is"
"there was one new thing, essentially Stella, which he had not noticed"
before. Surely it had been put there since his last visit.
In her own bedroom had hung since her imprisonment a fine reproduction
"of Watt's “Hope,” and, child though she was, she had divined, in a"
"child's unformulative way, the simple yet poignant symbolism of the"
"blindfold figure seated on this orb of land and sea, with meek head"
"bowed over a broken lyre, and with ear strained to the vibration of"
"the one remaining string. She loved the picture, and with unconscious"
"intuition and without consultation with Wratislaw, who would have"
"been horrified at its domination of his Adam room, had ordained that a"
similar copy should be hung on the wall facing the pillow of her Great
High Belovedest's bed.
The application of the allegory to his present state of being was
startlingly obvious. Risca knitted a puzzled brow. The new thing was
"essentially Stella, yet why had she caused it to be put in his room this"
day of all disastrous days? Was it not rather his cousin Julia's doing?
But such delicate conveyance of sympathy was scarcely Julia's way.
A sudden dread stabbed him. Had Stella herself heard rumours of the
"tragedy? He summoned Herold, who had a prescriptive right to the"
adjoining room.
"“If any senseless fools have told her, I 'll murder them,” he cried."
“The creatures of the sunset told her--at least as much as it was good
"for her to know,” said Herold."
“Do you mean that she did it in pure ignorance?”
"“In the vulgar acceptance of the word, yes,” smiled Herold. “Do you"
think that the human brain is always aware of the working of the divine

"'memory of vanished planets with fainter powers of gravitation,' but he"
fails to state when the ancestors of man inhabited these problematical
planets.]
[Footnote 111: I retain this statement of my explanation in almost the
same words as first written down in 1895. I was not then aware that
several psychologists had offered very similar explanations. Scherner
"(_Das Leben des Traumes_, 1861) seems to have been the first to connect"
"the lungs with dreams of flying, though he put forward the explanation"
"in too fanciful a form and failed to realise that other factors, notably"
"a change in skin pressure, are also involved. Strümpell at a later date"
"recognised this explanation, as well as Wundt.]"
[Footnote 112: It is the same with chloroform. 'There are marked
"sensations in the vicinity of the heart,' says Elmer Jones ('The Waning"
"of Consciousness under Chloroform,' _Psychological Review_, January"
"1909). 'The musculature of that organ seems thoroughly stimulated, and"
the contractions become violent and accelerated. The palpitations are
as strong as would be experienced at the close of some violent bodily
"exertion.' It is significant, also, as bearing on the interpretation of"
"the dream of flying, that under chloroform 'all movements made appeared to"
been thrown together at random. Then he nodded sagely twice and passed
on his way.
The glen continued to narrow overhead. The sunshine was entirely shut
out. The jaws of the precipice closed in upon the wayfarer as if to
"crush him, but Sergeant Cardono advanced with the steady stride of a"
"mountaineer, and the aplomb of one who is entirely sure of his"
reception.
The mountain silence grew stiller all about. None had passed that way
(so it seemed) since the beginning of time. None would repass till time
should be no more.
"Suddenly through the utter quiet there rang out, repeated and"
"reduplicated, the loud report of a rifle. The hills gave back the"
challenge. A moment before the dingy bedrabbled snow at Cardono's feet
"had been puffed upwards in a white jet, yet he neither stopped for this"
"nor took the least notice. Loyal or disloyal, true or false, he was a"
brave man this Sergeant Cardono. I dare say that any one close to him
might have discerned his beady eyes glitter and glance quickly from side
"to side, but his countenance was turned steadfastly as ever upon the"
snow at his feet.
Again came the same startling challenge out of the vague emptiness of
"space, the bullet apparently bursting like a bomb among the snow. And"
again Cardono took as much notice as if some half-dozen of village
loungers had been playing ball among the trees.
Only when a third time the _whisk_ of the bullet in the snow a yard or
"two to the right preceded the sound of the shot, Cardono shook his head"
"and muttered, ""Too long range! The fools ought to be better taught than"
"that!"" Then he continued his tramp steadily, neither looking to the"
"sun shone no more, and the merriment was stilled for ever. So she"
"thought, and, if she were not right, it needed a philosopher to tell her"
"so; and then she would not have believed him, but caught her woe closer"
"to her heart, and nursed it with fiercer tenderness against his shallow"
"prating. Perhaps he might have told her too, that it is cruel kindness"
"unasked to set people on a pinnacle, and, when they cannot keep foothold"
"on that slippery height, to scorn their fall. Other things such an one"
"might well have said, but more wisely left unsaid; for cool reason is a"
"blister to heartache, and heartache is not best cured by blisters. Never"
yet did a child stop crying for being told its pain was nought and would
soon be gone. Yet this prescription had been Lady Eynesford's--although
"she was no philosopher, to her knowledge--for Alicia, and it had left"
"the patient protesting that she felt no pain at all, and yet feeling it"
all the more.
"""What do you accuse me of? Why do you speak to me?"" she had burst out."
"""What is it to me what he has done or not done? What do you mean, Mary?"""
Before this torrent of questions Lady Eynesford tactfully retreated a
little way. A warning against hasty love dwindled to an appeal whether
"so much friendliness, such constant meetings, either with daughter or"
"with father, were desirable."
"""I'm sure I'm sorry for the poor child,"" she said; ""but in this"
"world----"""
"""Suppose it's all a slander!"""
"""My dear Alicia, do they say such things about a man in his position"
"unless there's something in them?"""
"""It's nothing to me,"" said Alicia again."
"plucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and"
"shivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,"
"although his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with"
"the living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet"
infinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape
the scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.

The grizzled general--there was also one who was gray--was thinking
that this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and
usually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his
ire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent
"than himself. And always orders of the ""Tell me how to kill that man"""
"rather than the ""Kill that man"" sort. The distinction bothered him"
obscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls
"which made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's"
right-minded leaders--even the Thinkers weren't certain which.
"The gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a"
"more turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and"
the dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.
He asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation
be in metal rather than flesh?
The austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such
pains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success
"with Buddhism. Sitting before his _guru_, his teacher, feeling the"
"Occidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had"
felt a little like this.
"The burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,"
"for about ten minutes, then suddenly dump it back into its cradle, stare"
"at it gloomily or utter a laugh, and go out.  Sometimes, he would come up"
"when Gyp was there, and after watching her a little in silence, almost"
drag her away.
"Suffering always from the guilty consciousness of having no love for him,"
"and ever more and more from her sense that, instead of saving him she"
"was, as it were, pushing him down-hill--ironical nemesis for vanity!--Gyp"
"was ever more and more compliant to his whims, trying to make up.  But"
"this compliance, when all the time she felt further and further away, was"
straining her to breaking-point.  Hers was a nature that goes on
passively enduring till something snaps; after that--no more.
"Those months of spring and summer were like a long spell of drought, when"
"moisture gathers far away, coming nearer, nearer, till, at last, the"
deluge bursts and sweeps the garden.
XV
The tenth of July that year was as the first day of summer.  There had
"been much fine weather, but always easterly or northerly; now, after a"
"broken, rainy fortnight, the sun had come in full summer warmth with a"
"gentle breeze, drifting here and there scent of the opening lime blossom."
"In the garden, under the trees at the far end, Betty sewed at a garment,"
and the baby in her perambulator had her seventh morning sleep.  Gyp
stood before a bed of pansies and sweet peas.  How monkeyish the pansies'
"faces!  The sweet peas, too, were like tiny bright birds fastened to"
"green perches swaying with the wind.  And their little green tridents,"
"growing out from the queer, flat stems, resembled the antennae of"
"friendship,"" she answered with a smile.  ""I really wonder that I did not"
"object to her in the days long ago."""
"""Ah!""  I laughed, ""you certainly had no cause.  It is true that we have"
been good friends ever since the day when she arrived home from the
"convent-school at Bruges, a prim young miss with her hair tied up with"
"ribbon.  Thrown constantly together, as we were, I became her male"
confidant and intimate friend; hence my licence to give her counsel in
many matters and sometimes to criticise those actions of which I don't
"approve."""
"""Then if that is so, you care a little for her--just a little?  Now"
"admit it."""
"""I don't admit anything of the kind,"" I answered frankly.  ""For five"
"years we have been constantly together; and times without number, at"
"Lady Barmouth's request, I have acted as her escort here and there,"
until she looks upon me as a kind of necessary appendage who has a right
to chaff her about her flirtations and annoy her by judicious sarcasm.
"I don't entertain one single spark of love for her.  In brief, she has"
"developed into an essentially smart girl, in the true sense of the word,"
and by reason of our constant companionship knows that to attempt a
flirtation with me would result in a most dismal failure.  I accused her
"once, not long ago, of having designs upon my heart, whereupon she"
replied that to accomplish such a thing would be about as easy as to win
the affection of the bronze Neptune in the garden-fountain of the
"Embassy."""
"""You have been seen together a great deal of late?"""
"""Who told you so?"""
DR. J. C. BOSE CALLED AND EXAMINED
"83,635. (Chairman). The witness favoured an arrangement by which Indians"
"would enter the higher ranks of the service, either through the"
Provincial Service or by direct recruitment in India. The latter class
"of officers, after completing their education in India, should"
ordinarily go to Europe with a view to widening their experience. By
this he did not wish to decry the training given in the Indian
"Universities, which produced some of the very best men, and he would not"
make the rule absolute. It was not necessary for men of exceptional
"ability to go to England in order to occupy a high chair. Unfortunately,"
on account of there being no openings for men of genius in the
"Educational Service, distinguished men were driven to the profession of"
Law. In the present condition of India a larger number of distinguished
men were needed to give their lives to the education of the people.
"83,636. The witness himself had spent part of his career in Europe, and"
"looking back he could say that this had been of great profit to him,"
"not so much on account of the training he got, as by being brought into"
personal contact with eminent men whose influence extorted his
"admiration, and create in him a feeling of emulation. In this way he"
"owed a great deal to Lord Rayleigh under whom he worked, but he did not"
see why that advantage should not eventually be secured by Indians in
India under an Indian Lord Rayleigh.
"83,637. There should be only one Educational Service, but men who were"
distinguished in any subject should not start from its very lowest rung
but should be placed somewhere in the middle of it.
"83,638. There were men in the Provincial Service who were very"
"Queen-Regent,"" whispered the portress, Rebeca, pointing upwards; ""but"
"promise me to commit no murder or do any hurt to the little maid."""
"""Be quiet, woman,"" muttered Rollo, more roughly than was his wont; ""we"
"are come to save both of them from worse than death. Sergeant Cardono,"
"bring the ladder!"""
"The Sergeant disappeared, and it was not many seconds before he was back"
again adjusting its hooks to the side of an iron balcony in front of one
of the lighted rooms. Almost before he had finished Rollo would have
"mounted, impetuously as was his custom, but the Sergeant held him back"
by the arm.
"""I crave your forgiveness,"" he whispered, ""but if you will pardon me"
"saying so, I have much more experience in such matters than you. Permit"
me in this single case to precede you! We know not what or whom we may
"meet with above!"""
"Nevertheless, though the Sergeant mounted first, Rollo followed so"
closely that his hands upon the rounds of the ladder were more than once
in danger of being trodden upon by the Sergeant's half-boots.
Presently they stood together on the iron balcony and peered within. A
tall dark man leaned against an elaborately carved mantelpiece
indolently stroking his glossy black whiskers. A lady arrayed in a
"dressing-gown of pink silk reaching to her feet was seated on a chair,"
"and submitting restlessly enough to the hands of her maid, who was"
"arranging her hair for the night, in the intervals of a violent but"
somewhat one-sided quarrel which was proceeding between the pair.
Every few moments the lady would start from her seat and with her eyes
flashing fire she would advance towards the indolent dandy by the
widely deposited over the continent of North America.
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The Cambrian system of North America comprises
"three distinct series, the LOWER CAMBRIAN, the MIDDLE CAMBRIAN,"
"and the UPPER CAMBRIAN, each of which is characterized by its own"
peculiar fauna. In sketching the outlines of the continent as it
"was at the beginning of the Paleozoic, it must be remembered that"
wherever the Lower Cambrian formations now are found was certainly
"then sea bottom, and wherever the Lower Cambrian are wanting, and"
"the next formations rest directly on pre-Cambrian rocks, was"
probably then land.
EARLY CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. In this way we know that at the opening
"of the Cambrian two long, narrow mediterranean seas stretched from"
north to south across the continent. The eastern sea extended from
the Gulf of St. Lawrence down the Champlain-Hudson valley and
thence along the western base of the Blue Ridge south at least to
Alabama. The western sea stretched from the Canadian Rockies over
the Great Basin and at least as far south as the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado in Arizona.
Between these mediterraneans lay a great central land which
included the pre-Cambrian U-shaped area of the Laurentian
"peneplain, and probably extended southward to the latitude of New"
Orleans. To the east lay a land which we may designate as
"APPALACHIA, whose western shore line was drawn along the site of"
"the present Blue Ridge, but whose other limits are quite unknown."
"The land of Appalachia must have been large, for it furnished a"
"great amount of waste during the entire Paleozoic era, and its"
eastern coast may possibly have lain even beyond the edge of the
present continental shelf. On the western side of the continent a
narrow land occupied the site of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

"exceeding five hundred pounds a year, payable out of money provided by"

"7. The registrar of every prize court in a British possession shall, on"

"cases adjudged in the court since the last half-yearly return, and shall"
with all convenient speed send the same to the Admiralty registrar of
"the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court, who"
welcome it and then I would destroy it once and for all. I would enjoy
"my leave at any cost. It would become my only reality, and when it was"
over it would be a reality which I would take back to the front. I would
"hoard it and always think of it out there, so that the war would seem"
"like a dream, the end of which I could await with patience and"
resignation.
I went out to seek friends and acquaintances. I also hoped to meet some
war enthusiasts. I would tell them something about the war. How would
their theories be able to stand before my actual experiences!
I was soon disillusioned.
I dined with a wealthy kinsman. The slaughter of millions had brought
"him prosperity. He had never done any fighting except with his mouth,"
"but it is precisely that kind of fighting that infuriates the spirit,"
"engenders heroic ardour, and causes the nostrils to dilate. He was so"
"bellicose that he even desired to do some _real_ righting, not"
understanding the difference between the two. He thought of joining an
"infantry unit--the artillery were not good enough, he did not want to"
"fire at an enemy he could not see, he wanted to use the bayonet and"
murder his fellow men in hand-to-hand encounters.
I began to understand why many men I had met were glad to come back from
leave.
"I tried to dissuade him, although I felt it would do him good to see"
something of the war and he would learn a much-needed lesson. And yet I
"did not want him killed or horribly mutilated, although I knew that he"
"and those like him were alone responsible for the entire war, both at"
its origins and its continuance.
"“It's rather a mad notion, is n't it?”"
"“I don't think so at all,” replied Miss Lindon in a most disconcertingly"
matter-of-fact tone. “The only thing is that since poor papa died I've
"had so little to do with gentlemen, and have forgotten their ways."
"You see, dear, you have put me quite in a flutter. How do I know, for"
"instance, what you would like to have for breakfast? Your dear"
grandpapa used to have only one egg boiled for two minutes--he was
most particular--and a piece of dry toast; whereas I well remember
Mrs. Brownlow telling me that her husband used to eat a hearty meal of
"porridge and eggs and bacon, with an underdone beefsteak to follow. So"
"you see, dear, I have no rule which I could follow; you would have to"
tell me.”
"“That's quite a detail,” said John, rather touched by her unselfish,"
"if tangential, dealing with the proposal. “The main point is,” said he,"
"moving a step or two forward, “would you care to come and play propriety"
for me and this daughter of misery?”
“Do you really want me to?”
"“Naturally, since I 've asked you.”"
"She rose and came up to him. “My dear boy,” she said with wet eyes, “I"
"know I'm not a clever woman, and often when clever people like you talk,"
I don't in the least understand what they 're talking about; but I did
"love your dear mother with all my heart, and I would do anything in the"
wide world for her son.”
"John took her hand and looked down into her foolish, kind face, which"
wore for the moment the dignity of love. “I'm afraid it will mean an

(ANDREYEFF.)
Throughout the winter one question above all others was discussed by the
"few who took an interest in the war: ""What were the Germans going to"
"do?"" It was clear that they had been able to withdraw many divisions"
from their Eastern Front. Would they be numerically equal or superior to
the Allies on the Western Front?
"On the whole we were of opinion that, whatever happened, our positions"
"would prove impregnable, although we observed with some astonishment"
that there were no extensive trench systems or fortified places behind
our lines. I doubted whether the Germans would even attempt to break
through--I thought they would merely hold the Western Front and throw
"the Allies out of Macedonia, Palestine, and Mesopotamia."
The winter was over and the fine weather had set in. For several months
we had been working in a wood-yard and saw-mills. Our lives had become
"unspeakably monotonous, but the coming of warm days banished much of our"
dreariness. The hazy blue sky was an object of real delight. I often
contrived to slip away from my work and lean idly against a wall in the
mild sunshine. At times I was so filled with the sense of physical
"well-being, and so penetrated by the sensuous enjoyment of warmth and"
"colour, that I even forgot the war."
"At the bottom of the wood-yard was a little stream, and on the far bank"
clusters of oxlips were in bloom. Here we would lie down during the
midday interval and surrender to the charm of the spring weather. It
"seemed unnatural and almost uncanny that we should be happy, but there"
"were moments when we felt something very much like happiness. Moreover,"
"(170*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1/2 inch to"
"the left of the second sacral spine; _exit_, immediately below"
the left anterior superior iliac spine; the patient was
"kneeling at the time, and the same bullet traversed his left"
"thigh in the lower third. When seen on the third day, the"
"lower part of the abdomen was motionless, tumid, and tender."
The bowels had been confined for three days; there had been no
"sickness, and the tongue was moist and clean. Temperature 100°,"
"pulse 90, fair strength, respirations 38. The patient had once"
"had an attack of acute appendicitis, and he himself said he was"
"sure he now had 'peritonitis,' as he had pain exactly similar"
in the belly to that he had suffered in his previous illness.
"No further signs, however, developed under an expectant"
"treatment, and he remained some two months in hospital, while"
the wound in the thigh and a third injury to the elbow-joint
were healing.
"(171) _Entry_ (Mauser), at the highest point of the left crista"
"ilii; _exit_, through the right ilium, 2 inches horizontally"
anterior to the posterior superior spine. Absolutely no
abdominal symptoms followed. The bowels were confined five
"days, and then opened by enema. The patient complained of some"
"stiffness in the lumbo-sacral region, but the right"
synchondrosis was no doubt implicated in the track.
(172) Wounded at Paardeberg (range 800 yards). _Entry_
"(Mauser), 2 inches diagonally below and to the right of the"
"umbilicus; _exit_, not discoverable. For the first two days the"
patient had to lie out with the regiment; on the fourth he was
removed to the Field hospital. During the first three days the
"patient vomited (green matter) frequently, and the belly was"
"Chiriqui with a view to establishing a packing house there, but"
reported that the supply of cattle was inadequate for even the smallest
establishment. Yet the country is admirably adapted for cattle raising.

"The climate of this region is equable, both as to temperature and"
humidity. Epidemic diseases are practically unknown among either men or
beasts. Should irrigation in future seem needful to agriculture the
multitude of streams furnish an ample water supply and innumerable sites
for reservoirs.
Westward from David the face of the country rises gently until you come
"to the Caldera Valley which lies at the foot of the Chiriqui Peak, an"
extinct volcano perhaps 8000 feet high. Nowhere in Panama do the
"mountains rise very high, though the range is clearly a connection of"
the Cordilleras of North and South America. The Chiriqui Peak has not in
"the memory of man been in eruption, but the traces of its volcanic"
character are unmistakable. Its crater is a circular plain about half a
mile in diameter surrounded by a densely wooded precipitous ridge. As
the ascent is continued the woods give way to grass and rocks. While
"there is a distinct timber line, no snow line is attained. At the foot"
"of the mountain is El Bouquette, much esteemed by the Panamanians as a"
"health resort. Thither go Canal workers who, not being permitted to"
"remain on the Zone during their vacations, wish to avoid the long voyage"
to North American ports.
[Illustration: CHIRIQUI NATIVES IN AN OX-CART]
This neighborhood is the center of the coffee-growing industry which
should be profitable in Panama if a heavy protective tariff could make
it so. But not even enough of the fragrant berries are grown to supply
dead friends to receive the blessing of the archbishop after the battle
of Roncevalles[35]; and of Napoleon sending the sailor back to England.
There is a moment in the story of Gunnar when he pauses in the midst of
"the slaughter of his enemies, and says, “I wonder if I am less brave"
"than others, because I kill men less willingly than they.”"
And in the “Njal's Burning” from Andrew Lang's “Book of Romance” we
"have the words of the boy Thord when his grandmother, Bergthora, urges"
him to go out of the burning house.
"“You promised me when I was little, grandmother, that I never should go"
from you till I wished it of myself. And I would rather die with you
than live after you.”
Here the moral courage is so splendidly shown; none of these heroes
"feared to die in battle or in open single fight, but to face a death by"
fire for higher considerations is a point of view worth presenting to
the child.
In spite of all the dramatic excitement roused by the conduct of our
"soldiers and sailors,[36] should we not try to offer also in our"
stories the romance and excitement of saving as well as _taking_ life?
I would have quite a collection dealing with the thrilling adventures
"of the Life-Boat and the Fire Brigade, of which I hope to present"
examples in the final Story List.
"Finally, we ought to include a certain number of stories dealing with"
"Death, especially with children who are of an age to realise that it"
"must come to all, and that this is not a calamity but a perfectly"
natural and simple thing. At present the child in the street invariably
connects death with sordid accidents. I think they should have stories
"83,648. If a foreign professor would not come and serve in India for the"
"same remuneration as he obtained in his own country, the witness would"
certainly not force him to come.
"83,649. (Mr. Abdur Rahim). Recruitment for the Educational Service"
"should be made in the first place in India, if suitable men were"
available; but if not then he would allow the best outsiders to be
brought in. In the present state of the country it would be very easy to
fill up many of the chairs by selecting the best men in India.
"83,650. The aim of the universities should be to promote two classes of"
"work--first, research; and secondly, an all-round sound education. Men"
of different types would be required for these two duties.
"83,651. (Mr. Madge). Any idea that the educational system of India was"
"so far inferior to that of England, that Indians, who had made their"
"mark, had done so, not because of the educational system of the country,"
"but in spite of it, was quite unfounded. The standard of education"
prevailing in India was quite up to the mark of several British
universities. It was as true of any other country in the world as of
"India that education was valued as a means for passing examinations, and"
"not only for itself, and there was no more cramming in India than"
elsewhere.
"83,652. The West certainly brought to the East a modern spirit, which"
"was very valuable, but it would be dearly purchased by the loss of an"
honorable career for competent Indians in their own country.
"83,653. The educational system in India had in the past been too"
"mechanical, but a turn for the better was now taking place and the"
"universities were recognising the importance of research work, and were"
"""A lamentable display of manners, my dear.  I shall withdraw now and"
"compose a stiff note to him.  The amenities must be observed."""
"Looking as severe as a naturally jovial face would permit him, and"
"wondering a little if he had pronounced ""amenities"" right, he strode"
to the library.
The library was his Majesty's favourite apartment.  Here in the
"mornings he would discuss affairs of state with his Chancellor, or"
receive any distinguished visitors who were to come to his kingdom in
"search of adventure.  Here in the afternoon, with a copy of _What to"
"say to a Wizard_ or some such book taken at random from the shelves,"
he would give himself up to meditation.
And it was the distinguished visitors of the morning who gave him most
to think about in the afternoon.  There were at this moment no fewer
"than seven different Princes engaged upon seven different enterprises,"
"to whom, in the event of a successful conclusion, he had promised the"
hand of Hyacinth and half his kingdom.  No wonder he felt that she
needed the guiding hand of a mother.
The stiff note to Barodia was not destined to be written.  He was
"still hesitating between two different kinds of nib, when the door was"
flung open and the fateful name of the Countess Belvane was announced.
The Countess Belvane!  What can I say which will bring home to you
"that wonderful, terrible, fascinating woman? Mastered as she was by"
"overweening ambition, utterly unscrupulous in her methods of achieving"
"her purpose, none the less her adorable humanity betrayed itself in a"
passion for diary-keeping and a devotion to the simpler forms of
lyrical verse.  That she is the villain of the piece I know well; in
"not born a princess! It goes to my heart to make her a prisoner!"""
The Sergeant uttered a guttural grunt which intimated that in his
opinion the influence of the petticoat on the career of a soldier might
"be over-done. Otherwise he maintained his gravity, speaking only when he"
was directly appealed to and giving his judgment with due submission to
his superiors.
Finally it was judged that they should make a night march over the
"mountains, find some suitable place to lie up in during the day, and in"
the morning send in La Giralda and the Sergeant to San Ildefonso in the
guise of fagot sellers to find out if the gipsy boy of Baza had spoken
the truth.

San Ildefonso and La Granja are two of the most strangely situated
places in Spain. A high and generally snow-clad Sierra divides them from
Madrid and the south. The palace is one of the most high-lying upon
"earth, having originally been one of the mountain granges of the monks"
"of Segovia to which a king of Spain took a fancy, and, what is more"
"remarkable, for which he was willing to pay good money."
"Upon the site a palace has been erected, a miniature Versailles,"
"infinitely more charming than the original, with walks, fountains,"
"waterfalls all fed by the cold snow water of the Guadarrama, and fanned"
by the pure airs of the mountains. This Grange has been for centuries a
"favourite resort of the Court of Spain, and specially during these last"
"years of the Regent Cristina, who, when tired with the precision and"
"etiquette of the Court of Madrid, retired hither that she might do as"
she pleased for at least two or three months of the year.
But he would not be persuaded. He said he was _dying_ to go out and see
the fun.
"At the word ""fun"" I felt a sudden and violent contraction of all my"
muscles. I had an almost irresistible impulse to stand up and strike him
across the face. But I was in a public restaurant and I controlled
myself. He did not seem to notice anything.
The conversation drifted away from the war and became commonplace. I
"tried to relate a few of my experiences, but somehow or other they"
seemed unsuited to the occasion.
"I had set out with the intention of destroying a mouldering, tottering"
"edifice built up of illusions and ignorant prejudices, and I found"
"myself face to face with towering, strong, unshakable walls, strong and"
"unshakable precisely because it was built of illusions, lies, and"
prejudices.
"I felt the burden of war descending upon me with all its crushing,"
annihilating weight. I fought a losing fight against the conviction
that for the rest of my leave I would be able to talk of nothing else
and think of nothing else but the war. If only I could talk to someone
"who would understand, that at least would bring relief!"
"I longed to see my two friends, although I felt some anxiety lest they"
"might have changed, or rather lest they might not have changed with me."
It was in the evening of my first day that we met. At first the one
embarrassed me a little by his apparent cold aloofness. But his caustic
observations on the war soon made it clear that he had stood the test. I
"realized, from the hatred that lay behind them, that he had suffered as"
much as many a soldier in the trenches.
One evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red
"mansions, ringing their bells. At the twelfth he rested his lean"
hand-baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and
"forehead. The bell sounded faint and far away in some remote, hollow"
depths.
"To the door of this, the twelfth house whose bell he had rung, came a"
"housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome, surfeited worm that"
had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy
with edible lodgers.
He asked if there was a room to let.
"“Come in,” said the housekeeper. Her voice came from her throat; her"
"throat seemed lined with fur. “I have the third floor back, vacant"
since a week back. Should you wish to look at it?”
The young man followed her up the stairs. A faint light from no
particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls. They trod
noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn.
"It seemed to have become vegetable; to have degenerated in that rank,"
sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to
the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter. At
each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall. Perhaps plants
had once been set within them. If so they had died in that foul and
"tainted air. It may be that statues of the saints had stood there, but"
it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them
forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished
pit below.
"“This is the room,” said the housekeeper, from her furry throat. “It’s"
_Cock._ That shall be done anon.
"_Gammer._ Nay, tarry, Hodge, till thou hast light, and then we'll"
seek each one.
_Ralph Roister Doister_ and _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ mark the end of the
Interlude stage and the commencement of Comedy proper. Leaving the
"latter at this point for the present, we shall return in the next"
chapter to study its fortunes at the hands of Lyly.

"Morality Plays, though theoretically quite as suitable for tragic effect"
"as for comic, since the former only required that Mankind should"
"sometimes fail to reach heaven, seem nevertheless to have developed"
"mainly the lighter side, setting the hero right at the finish and in the"
"meantime discovering, to the relief of otherwise bored spectators, that"
"wickedness, in some unexplained way, was funny. As long as propriety"
forbade that good should be overcome by evil it is hard to see how
"tragedy could appear. Had Humankind, in _The Castell of Perseverance_,"
"been fought for in vain by the Virtues, or had Everyman found no"
"companion to go with him and intercede for him, there had been tragedy"
indeed. But religious optimism was against any conclusion so
"discouraging to repentance. The lingering Miracles, it is true, still"
presented the sublimest of all tragedies in the Fall of Man and the
"apparent triumph of the Pharisees over Jesus. Between them, however, and"
"the kind of drama that succeeded the Moralities, too great a gulf was"
"fixed. Contemporaries of those original spirits, Heywood and Udall,"
could hardly revert for inspiration to the discredited performances of
villages and of a few provincial towns. Tragedy had to wait until there
was matured and made popular an Interlude from which the conflict of
"Virtues and Vices, with the orthodox triumph of the former, had been"
"""If your Lordship means to say that I wish to withdraw dishonorably from"
"my engagement with your sister, I crave the privilege of telling you that"
"you lie!"""
"I never was more calm in my life, and my words brought a cold smile to"
Hamilton's lips.
"""My friend De Grammont will have the honor of waiting on you to-morrow"
"morning,"" he answered, bowing politely."
"""I shall be delighted to see his Grace,"" I answered. ""Good night, my"
"lord!"""
Here was a solution of my problem in so far as it concerned my engagement
"with Mary Hamilton, for if I killed her brother, she would not marry"
"me, and if he killed me, I could not marry her. The fact that a gleam"
of joy came to me because of my unexpected release caused me to feel
"that I was a coward not to have broken the engagement in an honorable,"
straightforward manner rather than to have seized this opportunity to
force a duel upon her brother. It is true I had not sought the duel
deliberately and had not thought it possible one second before uttering
the word that made it necessary. Still it was my act that brought it
"about, and I felt that I had taken an unmanly course."
After leaving Count Anthony I walked across the room to where Mary
was standing at the outer edge of a circle of ladies and gentlemen who
"surrounded De Grammont, listening to a narrative in broken English, of"
"his adventures, fancied or real, I know not which, but interesting,"
and all of a questionable character.
"When I spoke to Mary, she turned and gave me her hand. I had not"
expected the least display of emotion on her part; therefore I was not
"tapering towards the end are made. The real Kula article, in which"
"the discs are much thinner, smaller in diameter and even in size from"
"one end of the necklace to the other, these were introduced into the"
"Kula at other points, and I shall speak about this subject in one"
"of the following chapters (Chapter XXI), where the other branches of"
the Kula are described.

"Now, having come to an end of this digression on kaloma, let us return"
"for another short while to our Sinaketan party, whom we have left"
on the Lagoon of Sanaroa. Having obtained a sufficient amount of the
"shells, they set sail, and re-visiting Tewara and Gumasila, stopping"
"perhaps for a night on one of the sandbanks of Pilolu, they arrive at"
last in their home Lagoon. But before rejoining their people in their
"villages, they stop for the last halt on Muwa. Here they make what is"
"called tanarere, a comparison and display of the valuables obtained"
"on this trip. From each canoe, a mat or two are spread on the sand"
"beach, and the men put their necklaces on the mat. Thus a long row of"
"valuables lies on the beach, and the members of the expedition walk"
"up and down, admire, and count them. The chiefs would, of course,"
"have always the greatest haul, more especially the one who has been"
the toli'uvalaku on that expedition.
"After this is over, they return to the village. Each canoe blows its"
"conch shell, a blast for each valuable that it contains. When a canoe"
"has obtained no vaygu'a at all, this means great shame and distress"
"for its members, and especially for the toliwaga. Such a canoe is"
"said to bisikureya, which means literally 'to keep a fast.'"
"state of defence as is possible, since the attack of the gipsies may be"
"expected at any moment!"""
"Rollo stepped to the window to summon his company, but found them"
already assembled on the balcony. It was no time for formal
"introductions, yet, as each entered, Rollo, like a true herald,"
delivered himself of a brief statement of the position of the individual
"in the company. But when La Giralda entered, the stout waiting-maid rose"
with a shriek from the floor where she had been sitting.
"""Oh, my lady,"" she cried, ""do not trust these wicked people. They have"
come to murder us all. That woman is the very old goatherdess with whom
the Princess Isabel was so bewitched this morning! I knew some evil
"would come of such ongoings!"""
"""Hush, Susana,"" said her mistress with severity; ""when you are asked for"
"any information, be ready to give it. Till then hold your peace."""
"Which having said she turned haughtily back again to the strangers,"
without vouchsafing a glance at her husband or the trembling handmaiden.
"""I can well believe,"" she said, ""that you have come here to do us a"
"service in our present temporary difficulty, and for that, if I find you"
"of approved fidelity, you shall not fail to be rewarded. Meantime, I"
"accept your service, and I place you and the whole of your men under the"
"immediate command of his Excellency the Duke of Rianzares!"""
She turned to the tall exquisite who still continued to comb his
whiskers by the chimney-piece. Up till now he had not spoken a word.
"Rollo scarcely knew what to reply to this, and as for the Sergeant, he"
had the hardest work to keep from bursting into a loud laugh.
Us to that place of Joy and Grace
Prepared for us since Adam's fall.
I think there is no doubt that we have made considerable progress in
this matter. Not only do we refrain from telling these highly moral
"(_sic_) stories but we have reached the point of parodying them,"
"in sign of ridicule, as, for instance, in such writing as Belloc's"
"“Cautionary Tales.” These would be a trifle too grim for a timid child,"
but excellent fun for adults.
It should be our study to-day to prove to children that the immediate
"importance to them is not to think of dying and going to Heaven, but"
"of living and--shall we say?--going to College, which is a far better"
preparation for a life to come than the morbid dwelling upon the
possibility of an early death.
"In an article signed “Muriel Harris,” I think, from a copy of the"
"_Tribune_, appeared a delightful article on Sunday Books, from which I"
quote the following:
"“All very good little children died young in the story-books, so that"
unusual goodness must have been the source of considerable anxiety to
affectionate parents. I came across a little old book the other day
called ‘Examples for Youth.’ On the yellow fly-leaf was written in
"childish, carefully sloping hand: ‘Presented to Mary Palmer Junior, by"
"her sister, to be read on Sundays,’ and was dated 1828. The accounts"
"are taken from a work on _Piety Promoted_, and all of them begin with"
unusual piety in early youth and end with the death-bed of the little
"paragon, and his or her dying words.”"
IX.--_Stories containing a mixture of Fairy Tale and Science._ By this
"combination you lose what is essential to each, namely, the fantastic"
ranks of library editions that no one reads. These stiff and formal
"backs, these ornamental edges, these dandified and dyed airs, repel me"
from my ancient friendships. The intimacy of years is broken--frozen.
"They open no longer eagerly at the old accustomed places, stained"
"with frequent thumbings, where my own hand cut the dear intimate"
leaves--they are deckle-edged and bedamned and horrible which were wont
to be delightfully impertinent. I cannot find my way in the old garden
"that I loved--the old dog-ears are smoothed out, gone--my pencillings"
"erased, their whisperings mute, they nudge my elbow no more. These, my"
one-time boon companions snub me; give me but the flabby handshake of
"necessity. They open their houses to me mincingly, and yawn affected"
"utterance. They no longer tickle me in the ribs, touching me on the"
"sleeve, nor beckon; they do not chuckle familiarly--nor brood with"
me upon the roll and march of the great significancies. Their new
clothes are insistent--upon them as upon me. They smell of the oil of
respectability like gagged Sunday-school children. We know each other
no longer--except with formal bow and elaborate etiquette--as when a
royal person enters the room of entertainment and puts good-fellowship
to the rout.”
"He made a pause, and, passing his gaunt hand over his brow, he added"
sadly:
“I have come home to find myself in a strange land.... Shining-faced
respectability has usurped my chair.... My kingdom has slipped from
me.... The flowers in my garden are dead.”
Noll patted him on the back:
"“Tut, tut, man--you have come into a new kingdom.”"
He heard Julia’s voice upon the stair; and he saw that the other had
other work which might help their country in its need.
And Bertie Adams?
When he realized that his beloved and revered Miss Warren was shut
"off from escape in Belgium, could not be heard of, could not be got"
"at and rescued, he went nearly off his nut.... He reviewed during a"
succession of sleepless nights what course he might best pursue. His
age was about thirty-two. He might of course enlist in the army. But
"though very patriotic, his allegiance lay first at the feet of Vivie"
"Warren. If he entered the army, he might be sent anywhere but to the"
Belgian frontier; and even if he got near Belgium he could not dart
off to rescue Vivie without becoming a deserter. So he came speedily
"to the conclusion that the most promising career he could adopt,"
"having regard to his position in life and lack of resources, was to"
"volunteer for foreign service under the Y.M.C.A., and express the"
strongest possible wish to be employed as near Belgium as was
"practicable. So that by the end of September, 1914, Bertie was"
"serving out cocoa and biscuits, writing paper and cigarettes, hot"
coffee and sausages and cups of bovril to exhausted or resting
"soldiers in the huts of the Y.M.C.A., near Ypres. Alternating with"
"these services, he was, like other Y.M.C.A. men in the same district"
"and at the same time, acting as stretcher bearer to bring in the"
"wounded, as amateur chaplain with the dying, as amateur surgeon with"
"the wounded, as secretary to some distraught officer in high command"
whose clerks had all been killed; and in any other capacity if
called upon. But always with the stedfast hope and purpose that he
might somehow reach and rescue Vivie Warren.
and flung into the corner. Articles of wearing apparel were scattered
"about, while over everything were sifted scraps of white paper in"
seemingly endless quantity. It was these torn scraps that roused Bob’s
"indignation. He seemed to know intuitively, without the evidence of the"
"limp, empty book covers here and there, that the foreman had taken time"
to tear into shreds every record and paper connected with the drive
"which he possessed. Time books, scalers’ measurements--everything--had"
been destroyed practically beyond the possibility of reconstruction.
There would be no accurate way now by which the firm could figure their
profits or costs or labor charges. The very paying of the drive crew
would be a matter of guesswork.
“Jove!” exclaimed Bainbridge through his clenched teeth. “I didn’t know
a man could be so rotten!”
"He stared at the wreck for a minute longer, and then turned over with"
"his foot the square, wooden box which lay upset in the middle of the"
mess. Apparently it had served Schaeffer as a receptacle for these same
"records. It was quite empty, but underneath lay something which brought"
"a thoughtful, questioning expression into the searcher’s face, and made"
him stoop to pick it up.
"“Thirty-eight caliber,” he murmured, staring at the freshly opened"
pasteboard box which had contained fifty cartridges. “Hum!”
"Presently he let it drop again. He did not move for a space, but stood"
"staring at the ground with that same odd, thoughtful pucker in his"
forehead.
"There was nothing surprising in the fact of Schaeffer’s being armed,"
Neither was it strange for a man in the riverman’s position to carry off
his ammunition loose instead of in the box. That was not the point. It
entertained it.  It was decided that the rubbish left after some
repairs had been done to the barracks should be used for mending and
"filling up the ditches in their street, and for the transport of this"
"five horses were given by the fire brigade.  Still more, they even saw"
the necessity of laying a drain-pipe through the street.  This and many
other things vastly increased the popularity of the teacher.  He wrote
petitions for them and published various remarks in the newspapers.
"For instance, on one occasion Vaviloff's customers noticed that the"
herrings and other provisions of the eating-house were not what they
"should be, and after a day or two they saw Vaviloff standing at the bar"
with the newspaper in his hand making a public apology.
"""It is true, I must acknowledge, that I bought old and not very good"
"herrings, and the cabbage ... also ... was old.  It is only too well"
known that anyone can put many a five-kopeck piece in his pocket in
this way.  And what is the result?  It has not been a success; I was
"greedy, I own, but the cleverer man has exposed me, so we are quits ..."""
"This confession made a very good impression on the people, and it also"
gave Vaviloff the opportunity of still feeding them with herrings and
"cabbages which were not good, though they failed to notice it, so much"
were they impressed.
"This incident was very significant, because it increased not only the"
"teacher's popularity, but also the effect of press opinion."
"It often happened, too, that the teacher read lectures on practical"
morality in the eating-house.
"""I saw you,"" he said to the painter Yashka Tyarin, ""I saw you, Yakov,"
"beating your wife ..."""
"""There are some of them upstairs now,"" she replied, ""but, alas, none who"
will ever reclaim them from us! The excuse is the best that can be
"devised to introduce us into San Ildefonso, and, perhaps, if we have"
"luck, inside the palisades of La Granja also."""
"So without further parley the Sergeant proceeded, in the most"
"matter-of-fact way possible, to load the ass with huge fagots of"
kindling wood till the animal showed only four feet paddling along under
"its burden, and a pair of patient orbs, black and beady like those of"
"the Sergeant himself, peering out of a hay-coloured matting of hair."
"This done, the Sergeant turned his sharp eyes every way about the dim"
"smoky horizon. He could note, as easily as on a map, the precise notch"
in the many purple-tinted gorges where they had left their party. It was
exactly like all the others which slit and dimple the slopes of the
"Guadarrama, but in this matter it was as impossible for the Sergeant to"
make a mistake as for a town-dweller to err as to the street in which he
has lived for years.
"But no one was watching them. No clump of juniper held a spy, and the"
Sergeant was at liberty to develop his plans. He turned quickly upon the
old gipsy woman.
"""La Giralda,"" he said, ""there is small use in discovering the"
"disposition of the courtiers in San Ildefonso--ay, or even the defences"
"of the palace, if we know nothing of the Romany who are to march"
"to-night upon the place."""
"La Giralda, who had been drawing a little milk from the udders of each"
"she-goat, to ease them for their travel, suddenly sprang erect."
"temperature normal, pulse 72, respirations 24, tongue moist,"
bowels confined. Rigidity of abdominal wall and deficient
"mobility of nearly whole right half of belly, the whole lower"
half of which moves little with respiration. No track palpable
"in abdominal parietes. No dulness, no distension. The"
temperature rose to 99.5° at night. On the fourth day the
"bowels acted freely, the pulse fell to 60, the respirations"
"were 24, and the temperature normal."
Tenderness and rigidity persisted in the right flank to the end
"of a week, after which time no further signs persisted."
(175*) Wounded at Modder River while lying on right side. Range
"500 yards. Walked 400 yards after injury. _Entry_ (Mauser), at"
the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the right
"iliac crest; _exit_, 3 inches to right of and 1/2 inch below"
the level of the umbilicus. The injury was followed by no signs
of intra-abdominal lesion; on the third day the temperature was
"normal, pulse 80, and the tongue clean and moist. Some soreness"
"at times and tenderness on pressure were complained of, but the"
man was discharged well at the end of one month.
(176*) Wounded while doubling in retirement at Modder River.
"_Entry_ (Mauser), immediately above the junction of the"
"posterior and middle thirds of the left iliac crest; _exit_, 1"
"inch below costal margin (eighth rib), 3 inches to the right of"
"the median line. The bullet was lying in the anterior wound,"
whence it was removed by the orderly who applied the first
dressing on the field. The patient remained on the field seven
"and a half hours, and when brought into hospital at once"
"commenced to vomit. The ejected matter, at first green in"
"colour, during the next forty-eight hours changed to a dirty"
"passed in front and back of the body over a string tied around the hips,"
the forward extremity being left longer and flowing like an apron. On
feast days the string is replaced by a broad band of white beads. Around
the neck and chest they wear thick cords of the same beads and on their
wrists broad silver cuffs. Hats are not used; the hair is usually tied
with a red ribbon and often adorned with the bright flowers of the
forest.
"“The female outfit is not less simple, consisting of a piece of calico"
"less than three feet wide and about nine feet long, wrapped around the"
lower part of the body and reaching a little below the knees. This is
"all, except that the neck is more or less loaded with beads or silver"
"coins. But for this the women display less coquetry than the men, which"
may be because they feel sufficiently adorned with their mere natural
"charms. Fondness for cheap rings is, however, common to both sexes, and"
little children often wear earrings or pendants.

INDIAN GIRL OF THE DARIEN]
“The scantiness of the clothing is remedied very effectually by face and
"body painting, in which black and red colors are used, the first"
exclusively for daily wear. At times men and women are painted black
from the waist down; at other times it is the whole body or only the
"hands and feet, etc., all according to the day’s fashion, as was"
explained by one of our guides. For feast days the paintings are an
"elaborate and artistic affair, consisting of elegantly drawn lines and"
patterns--red and black or simply black--which clothe the body as
effectually as any costly dress.
"acquire no intelligence sitting down in Robat, whereas, if he came"
"with me, he would get all he wanted at first hand!"
I set myself to pick up all the information I could about the
"conditions of British ""influence"" in this part of Persia, and on"
the borders of Afghanistan. To make it in any way clear why we had
any influence here at all we must revert to the old fear of the
"threatened advance of Russia on India, in the days before Russia"
became our ally in the Great War.
Slowly and gradually Russia had been extending her influence in the
Pamirs until her outposts on the Oxus River were only eight marches
"from Chitral. Evidently, as a wide counter, strategic move, the"
Indian Government had sought to increase its own influence with
Persia and Afghanistan by pushing forward her outposts to Robat and
Nasaratabad.
"Consequently, at the time of which I am writing, Robat, Nasaratabad"
and Birjand were held lightly by chains of small posts composed
entirely of Indian troops and some local levies commanded by British
"officers. Our lines of communication running from Birjand to Nushki,"
"a distance of about six hundred miles, were held, in widely scattered"
"posts, by only one battalion of Indian Infantry and one regiment of"
Indian Cavalry and four mountain guns. Thus it will be seen that it
was very difficult to obtain any troops for a movable column.
"A British Consulate had also been established at Nasaratabad, which"
is on the borders of Afghanistan and Persia. During the War the
"importance and influence of the Consul increased considerably, as he"
was in a position to gather information which was of great value to
"the military commanders, who constantly sought his advice."
far from _The Bedford Castle_.
"To Marsh, already furious at the trick the ice had played him, this"
forced proximity to his rival brought home with added irony the fact
"that he had been forestalled, while it emphasized his knowledge that"
henceforth the conflict would be carried on at closer quarters. It
"would be a contest between two men, both determined to win by fair"
means or foul.
"Emerson was a dream-dazzled youth, striving like a knight-errant for"
"the love of a lady and the glory of conquest, but he was also a born"
"fighter, and in every emergency he had shown himself as able as his"
experienced opponent.
As Marsh looked about and saw how much Boyd's well-directed energy was
"accomplishing, he was conscious of a slight disheartenment. Still, he"
"was on his own ground, he had the advantage of superior force, and"
though he was humiliated by his failure to throttle the hostile
"enterprise in its beginning, he was by no means at the end of his"
"expedients. He was curious to see his rival in action, and he decided"
to visit him and test his temper.
"It was on the afternoon following his arrival that Marsh, after a tour"
"of inspection, landed from his launch and strolled up to where Boyd"
"Emerson was at work. He was greeted courteously, if a bit coolly, and"
"found, as on their last meeting, that his own bearing was reflected"
"exactly in that of Boyd. Both men, beneath the scant politeness of"
"their outward manner, were aware that the time for ceremony had passed."
Here in the Northland they faced each other at last as man to man.
"""I see you have a number of my old fishermen,"" Marsh observed."
And so I first saw the great Gustavus Adolphus. It was said that he
"would at times fall into fits of Berserk rage, and that in the field"
"he was another man, keen as his sword, swift as fire, pitiless to"
"those who flinched, among the foremost in the charge, a very"
thunderbolt of war. But as I saw him taking papers from women's hands
"at the end of the Burg Strasse, he had rather the air of a quiet,"
"worthy prince--of Coburg or Darmstadt, it might be,--no dresser and no"
"brawler; nor would any one, to see him then, have thought that this"
was the lion of the north who had dashed the pride of Pappenheim and
flung aside the firebrands of the south. Or that even now he had on
his shoulders the burden of two great nations and the fate of a
million of men.
CHAPTER XXVI.
THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.
After this it fared with us as it fares at last with the driftwood
that chance or the woodman's axe has given to a forest stream in
Heritzburg. After rippling over the shallows and shooting giddily down
"slopes--or perchance lying cooped for days in some dark bend, until"
the splash of the otter or the spring freshet has sent it dancing on
in sunshine and shadow--it reaches at last the Werra. It floats out on
"the bosom of the great stream, and no longer tossed and chafed by each"
"tiny pebble, feels the force of wind and stream--the great forces of"
"the world. The banks recede from sight, and one of a million atoms, it"
"is borne on gently and irresistibly, whither it does not know. So it"
was with us. From the day we fell in with Count Leuchtenstein and set

ASIA MINOR.
The first Oriental religion adopted by the Romans was that of the goddess
"of Phrygia, whom the people of Pessinus and Mount Ida worshiped, and who"
received the name of _Magna Mater deum Idea_ in the Occident. Its history
"in Italy covers six centuries, and we can trace each phase of the"
transformation that changed it in the course of time from a collection of
very primitive nature beliefs into a system of spiritualized mysteries used
by some as a weapon against Christianity. We shall now endeavor to outline
the successive phases of that slow metamorphosis.
This religion is the only one whose success in the Latin world was caused
"originally by a mere chance circumstance. In 205 B. C, when Hannibal,"
"vanquished but still threatening, made his last stand in the mountains of"
"Bruttium, repeated torrents of stones frightened the Roman people. When the"
books were officially consulted in regard to this prodigy they promised
that the enemy would be driven from Italy if the Great Mother of Ida could
be brought to Rome. Nobody but the Sibyls themselves had the power of
averting the evils prophesied by them. They had come to Italy from Asia
"Minor, and in this critical situation their sacred poem recommended the"
practice of their native religion as a remedy. In token of his {47}
"friendship, King Attalus presented the ambassadors of the senate with the"
"black aerolite, supposed to be the abode of the goddess, that this ruler"
had shortly before transferred from Pessinus to Pergamum. According to the
mandate of the oracle the stone was received at Ostia by the best citizen
"of the land, an honor accorded to Scipio Nasica--and carried by the most"
"The third forward bay, located beneath the other two and down a set of"
"steel stairs, was the one he needed to penetrate. It contained all the"
"computer gear: flight control, navigation, and most importantly, the"
artificial intelligence (AI) system for pilot interface and backup.
He suddenly found himself thinking a strange thought. Since no air-
"breathing vehicle had ever flown hypersonic, every component in this"
"plane was, in a sense, untested. To his mind, though, that was merely"
one more argument for shutting down the damned AI system's override
"functions before he went hypersonic. If something did go wrong, he"
wanted this baby on manual. He only needed the computer to alert him to
potential problems. The solutions he'd have to work out with his own
"brain. And balls. After all, that's why he was there."
"As he walked down the steel steps, he thumbed through the magnetic"
"cards, praying he had the one needed to open the lower bay and access"
the computers. Then he began inserting them one by one into the green
"metallic slot, trying to keep his hand steady in the freezing cold."
"Finally one worked. The three encoded diodes blinked, and a hydraulic"
"arm automatically slid the port open. Next the interior lights came on,"
an orange high-voltage sodium glow illuminating the gray walls.
"This third bay, like the two above it, was big enough to stand in. As"
"he stepped in, he glanced back up the stairs, then quickly resealed the"
"door. Off went the lights again, so he withdrew his penlight and turned"
to start searching for what he wanted.
Directly in front of him was a steel monolith with banks of toggle
"switches: electrical power controls, communications controls,"
"propulsion system controls, reaction-control systems. Okay, that's the"
"fell down dead upon the stage, and so was carried thence away by"
"his lords and gentlemen, and then the music ceased. Hereby was"
"signified, that as glass by nature holdeth no poison, but is clear"
"and may easily be seen through, ne boweth by any art; so a faithful"
"counsellor holdeth no treason, but is plain and open, ne yieldeth"
"to any indiscreet affection, but giveth wholesome counsel, which"
the ill advised prince refuseth. The delightful gold filled with
"poison betokeneth flattery, which under fair seeming of pleasant"
"words beareth deadly poison, which destroyeth the prince that"
"receiveth it. As befel in the two brethren, Ferrex and Porrex, who,"
"refusing the wholesome advice of grave counsellors, credited these"
"young parasites, and brought to themselves death and destruction"
thereby.
But it is time to set forth the plot in more detail. The importance of
_Gorboduc_ as an example of English 'classical' tragedy prompts us to
"follow it through, scene by scene."
"_Act I, Scene 1._--Queen Videna discovers to her favourite and elder"
"son, Ferrex, the king's intention, grievous in her eyes, of dividing his"
kingdom equally between his two sons. _Scene 2._--King Gorboduc submits
"his plan to the consideration of his three counsellors, whose wise and"
lengthy reasonings he listens to but elects to disregard.
"_Act II, Scene 1._--The division having been carried out, Ferrex, in his"
"part of the kingdom, is prompted by evil counsel to suspect aggressive"
"rivalry from his brother, and decides to collect forces for his own"
defence. _Scene 2._--Ferrex's misguided precautions having been
"maliciously represented to Porrex as directed against his power, that"
prince resolves upon an immediate invasion of his brother's realm.
_Act III._--The news of these counter-moves and of the imminent
white patch of a sail showed vaguely through the gathering gloom.
Their black armor stood out ghostly against the ascetic trunks of the
"trees. Grim silence prevailed, and so immobile was their attitude,"
"that they might have been taken for stone images of a dead, gone age."
"The wind cried restlessly amid the trees, gusty at intervals, but"
tuning its mood to a desolate and constant moan. The woods seemed full
of a vague woe and of troubled breathings. The trees seemed to sway to
"one another, to fling strange words with the tossing of hair and"
"outstretched hands. The furze in the valley, swept and harrowed,"
undulated like a green lagoon.
"Between the hills and the cliff lay the marshes, threaded by a meagre"
stream that quavered through the green. A poison mist hung over them
despite the wind. The mournful clangor of a bell came up from the
"valley, with a vague sound as of voices chanting."
After a time the bell ceased pulsing. In its stead sounded a faint
"eerie whimper, an occasional shrill cry that startled the moorlands,"
leaped out of silence like a bubble from a pool where death has been.
The men were shaken from their strained vigilance as by a wind. The
"utter gray of the hour seemed to stifle them, then a sound stumbled"
"out of the silence and set them listening. It dwindled and grew again,"
came nearer: it was the smite of hoofs in the wood-ways. The rider
"dismounted, tethered his foam-flecked steed to a tree and stumbled up"
"to where the Duke of Spoleto and Francesco stood, their gaze riveted"
upon the ghostly masonry of Astura.
Panting and exhausted he faced the twain.
"""They have all died on the scaffold,"" he said with a hoarse, rasping"
"_Wounds of the omentum._--Here, again, I am unable to express any"
"opinion, although the supposition that hæmorrhage from this source took"
place is natural.
"Prolapse of omentum was comparatively rare, except in cases with large"
wounds; it was apparently seen with some frequency among patients who
"died rapidly on the field of battle. I only saw it twice, and on each"
occasion in shell wounds. The wounds from small-calibre bullets were as
a rule too small to allow of external prolapse.
"Fig. 89, however, illustrates a very interesting observation. A patient"
"in the German Ambulance in Heilbron, under Dr. Flockemann, died as a"
result of suppuration and hæmorrhage secondary to an injury to the
colon. At the autopsy a portion of the omentum was found adherent in the
"wound of exit, but it had not reached the external surface. The chief"
interest of the observation lies in the light it throws on the mechanism
of these injuries. It is impossible to conceive that a small-calibre
bullet coming into direct contact with the omentum could do anything but
"perforate it. It, therefore, appears clear that in a displacement like"
"that figured, only lateral impact occurred with the omentum, which was"
"carried along by the spin and rush of the bullet into the canal of exit,"
where it lodged.
[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Great Omentum carried by the bullet into an
exit track leading from the abdominal cavity. A. Outline of opening in
the peritoneum]
_Results of injury to the intestine._ 1. _Escape of contents and
infection of the peritoneal cavity._--I think there is little special to
be said on this subject. The escape of contents into the peritoneal
"cavity was by no means free, unless the injury was multiple. Thus in one"
"Thus, even at the beginning of the Paleozoic, the continental"
plateau of North America had already been left by crustal
movements in relief above the abysses of the great oceans on
"either side. The mediterraneans which lay upon it were shallow, as"
"their sediments prove. They were EPICONTINENTAL SEAS; that is,"
"they rested UPON (Greek, EPI) the submerged portion of the"
continental plateau. We have no proof that the deep ocean ever
occupied any part of where North America now is.
The Middle and Upper Cambrian strata are found together with the
Lower Cambrian over the area of both the eastern and the western
"mediterraneans, so that here the sea continued during the entire"
period. The sediments throughout are those of shoal water. Coarse
cross-bedded sandstones record the action of strong shifting
currents which spread coarse waste near shore and winnowed it of
finer stuff. Frequent ripple marks on the bedding planes of the
strata prove that the loose sands of the sea floor were near
enough to the surface to be agitated by waves and tidal currents.
Sun cracks show that often the outgoing tide exposed large muddy
"flats to the drying action of the sun. The fossils, also, of the"
strata are of kinds related to those which now live in shallow
waters near the shore.
The sediments which gathered in the mediterranean seas were very
"thick, reaching in places the enormous depth of ten thousand feet."
"Hence the bottoms of these seas were sinking troughs, ever filling"
with waste from the adjacent land as fast as they subsided.

Cambrian are found resting unconformably on the pre-Cambrian rocks

One loses track of time while sailing in south Florida waters. There is
a lassitude that laughs at clocks; the lotus floats over the waves even
"as over the land, and a poetic languor steals into the soul breeding an"
"indifference to hours and days--wretched things, at best, that were only"
"meant for slaves! Neither of us realized our passing into Barnes Sound,"
"and saw only that the _Whim_, sails gracefully drawing, cut the water as"
cleanly as a knife.
"Another day passed during which we shot at sharks, or trawled, or lay on"
deck smoking and occasionally gazing over the side at displays of fish
and flora twenty feet beneath us. But upon the third morning I asked:
"""Where are we bound, Gates?"""
"""Mr. Thomas says Key West, sir, and then Havana."""
"""Mr. Thomas, indeed,"" I laughed, for it was exactly like Tommy to take"
"over the command of a ship, or anything else that struck his fancy."
Before leaving Miami he had received a twenty page letter from the
Bluegrass region of Kentucky which threw him into a state of such
volatile ineptitude that I was well satisfied to let him give what
"orders he would, sending us to the world's end for all I cared. In a"
"very large measure Tommy's happiness was my own, as I knew that mine"
would always be dear to him.
"During our most trying hours in France, thoughts of this wonderful girl,"
"whose name was Nell, unfailingly kept his spirits high. In moments of"
confidence that come to pals on the eve of battle I saw that some day
"they might be eternal ""buddies""--certainly if he had his way; and toward"
"this achievement he had been, since graduating from the University of"

the black turban hat with the gold-green macaw wing in its accustomed
place.
He who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker during
a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology.
The poet sings of the “crowded hour of glorious life.” The broker’s
"hour is not only crowded, but the minutes and seconds are hanging to"
all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms.
And this day was Harvey Maxwell’s busy day. The ticker began to reel
"out jerkily its fitful coils of tape, the desk telephone had a chronic"
attack of buzzing. Men began to throng into the office and call at him
"over the railing, jovially, sharply, viciously, excitedly. Messenger"
boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams. The clerks in the
office jumped about like sailors during a storm. Even Pitcher’s face
relaxed into something resembling animation.
On the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and
"glaciers and volcanoes, and those elemental disturbances were"
reproduced in miniature in the broker’s offices. Maxwell shoved his
chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a
"toe dancer. He jumped from ticker to ’phone, from desk to door with the"
trained agility of a harlequin.
In the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became
suddenly aware of a high-rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding
"canopy of velvet and ostrich tips, an imitation sealskin sacque and a"
"string of beads as large as hickory nuts, ending near the floor with a"
silver heart. There was a self-possessed young lady connected with
these accessories; and Pitcher was there to construe her.
1517-18
"Erasmus at Louvain, 1517--He expects the renovation of the"
Church as the fruit of good learning--Controversy with Lefèvre
"d'Étaples--Second journey to Basle, 1518--He revises the edition"
"of the New Testament--Controversies with Latomus, Briard and"
Lee--Erasmus regards the opposition of conservative theology
merely as a conspiracy against good learning
When Erasmus established himself at Louvain in the summer of 1517 he had
"a vague presentiment that great changes were at hand. 'I fear', he"
"writes in September, 'that a great subversion of affairs is being"
"brought about here, if God's favour and the piety and wisdom of princes"
do not concern themselves about human matters.' But the forms which that
great change would assume he did not in the least realize.
He regarded his removal as merely temporary. It was only to last 'till
"we shall have seen which place of residence is best fit for old age,"
which is already knocking'. There is something pathetic in the man who
"desires nothing but quiet and liberty, and who through his own"
"restlessness, and his inability not to concern himself about other"
"people, never found a really fixed abode or true independence. Erasmus"
"is one of those people who always seem to say: tomorrow, tomorrow! I"
"must first deal with this, and then ... As soon as he shall be ready"
with the new edition of the New Testament and shall have extricated
"himself from troublesome and disagreeable theological controversies, in"
"which he finds himself entangled against his wish, he will sleep, hide"
"himself, 'sing for himself and the Muses'. But that time never came."
"Where to live when he shall be free? Spain, to which Cardinal Ximenes"
"called him, did not appeal to him. From Germany, he says, the stoves and"
plunder the palace from top to bottom and to give all within the
neighbouring town of San Ildefonso to the sword.
"The programme, as thus baldly announced, was indeed one to strike all"
"men with horror, even those who had been hardened by years of"
fratricidal warfare in which quarter was neither given nor expected.
"Besides the plunder of the palace and its occupants, the leaders of the"
gipsies expected that they would obtain great rewards from Don Carlos
for thus removing the only obstacles to his undisputed possession of the
throne of Spain.
The heart of Rollo beat violently. His Scottish birth and training gave
"him a natural reverence for the sanctity of sickness and death, and the"
"idea of these men plotting ghoulishly to utilise ""the onlaying of the"
"hand of Providence"" (as his father would have phrased it) for the"
"purposes of plunder and rapine, unspeakably revolted him."
"Immediately he called a council of war, at which, in spite of the frowns"
"of Sergeant Cardono, little Concha Cabezos had her place."
"La Giralda was summoned also, but excused herself saying, ""It is better"
"that I should not know what you intend to do. I am, after all, a"
"black-blooded Gitana, and might be tempted to reveal your secrets if I"
knew them. It is better therefore that I should not. Let me keep my own
"place as a servitor in your company, to cut the brushwood for your fire"
and to bring the water from the spring. In those things you will find me
"faithful. Trust the gipsy no further!"""
"Rollo, remembering her loyalty in the matter of Dolóres at the village"
"of El Sarria, was about to make an objection, but a significant gesture"
from the Sergeant restrained him in time.
Then suddenly the affair altered its complexion.
The oncoming tug was barely twice its length from the scow when Boyd
saw Big George cease his violent antics and level a revolver directly
at the wheel-house of the opposing craft. Two puffs of smoke issued
"from weapon, then out from the glass-encased structure the steersman"
"plunged, scrambled down the deck and into the shelter of the house."
"Instantly the bow of the tug swung off, and she came on sidewise,"
"striking Balt's scow a glancing blow, the sound of which rose above the"
"shouts, while its force threw the big fellow and his companions to"
their knees and shattered the glass in the pilot-house windows. The
"boats behind fouled each other, then drifted down upon the scow, and"
"the tide, seizing the whole flotilla, began to spin it slowly. Rushing"
"to the ladder, Emerson leaped into another launch which fortunately was"
"at hand, and the next instant as the little craft sped out from the"
"side of _The Bedford Castle_, he saw that a fight was in progress on"
"the lighter. It was over quickly, and before he reached the scene the"
"current had drifted the tows apart. George, it seemed, had boarded the"
"tug, dragged the captain off, and beaten him half insensible before the"
man's companions had come to his rescue.
"""Is the scow damaged?"" Emerson cried, as he came alongside."
"""She's leaking, but I guess we can make it,"" George reassured him."
"They directed the second launch to make fast, and, towed by both tugs,"
they succeeded in beaching their cargo a mile below the landing.
"""We'll calk her at low tide,"" George declared, well satisfied at this"
outcome of the misadventure. Then he fell to reviling the men who had
caused it.
Athwart the raptures of a vision'd bliss.
"""I'll seek no joy that is not linked with thine,"
"No touch of hope, no taste of holy wine,"
"And after death, no home in any star,"
"That is not shared by thee, supreme, afar"
As here thou'rt first and foremost of all things!
"Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings"
"That wait on thought, when, in thy spirit-sway,"
"Thou dost invest a realm unknown to kings!"""
"Had not she, Edris, consigned him to his ""own disdain, Athwart the"
"raptures of a visioned bliss?"" Ay! truly and deservedly!--and this"
"disdain of himself had now reached its culminating point,--namely, that"
"he did not consider himself worthy of her love,--or worthy to do aught"
than sink again into far spaces of darkness and perpetually
"retrospective Memory, there to explore the uttermost depths of anguish,"
"and count up his errors one by one from the very beginning of life, in"
"every separate phase he had passed through, till he had penitently"
"striven his best to atone for them all! Christ had atoned! yes,--but"
was it not almost base on his part to shield himself with that Divine
Light and do nothing further? He could not yet thoroughly grasp the
"amazing truth that ONE ABSOLUTELY PURE act of faith in Christ, blots"
"out Past Sin forever,--it seemed too marvellous and great a boon!"
When he retired to rest that night he was fully and firmly PREPARED TO
DIE. With this expectation upon him he was nevertheless happy and
"tranquil. The line--""Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings"""
"haunted him, and he repeated it over and over again without knowing"
why. Wings! the brilliant shafts of radiance that part angels from
"mortals,--wings, that, after all, are not really wings, but lambent"
"have been splendid and of some use.” Given the character of the lady,"
"we might, as adults, question the last part of the boy's statement, but"
this is pure cynicism and fortunately does not enter into the child's
calculations.
In my own personal experience (and I have told this story often in the
German ballad form to girls of ten and twelve in the High Schools in
England) I have never found one girl who sympathised with the lady or
who failed to appreciate the poetic justice meted out to her in the end
by the dignified renunciation of the knight.
"Chesterton defines sentimentality as “a tame, cold, or small and"
inadequate manner of speaking about certain matters which demand very
large and beautiful expression.”
"I would strongly urge upon young teachers to revise, by this"
"definition, some of the stories they have included in their repertory,"
and see whether they would stand the test or not.
IV.--_Stories containing strong sensational episodes._ The danger is
"all the greater because many children delight in it, and some crave for"
"it in the abstract, but fear it in the concrete.[19]"
"An affectionate aunt, on one occasion, anxious to curry favour with"
"a four-year-old nephew, was taxing her imagination to find a story"
suitable for his tender years. She was greatly startled when he
"suddenly said, in a most imperative tone: “Tell me the story of a"
_bear_ eating a small boy.” This was so remote from her own choice
"of subject that she hesitated at first, but coming to the conclusion"
that as the child had chosen the situation he would feel no terror
"in the working up of its details, she began a most thrilling and"
"blood-curdling story, leading up to the final catastrophe. But just as"
It was an early rumour of this intention which had so stirred the
"resentment of Don Baltasar Varela, and caused him to look about for some"
instrument of vengeance to prevent the accomplishment of the designs of
"""that _burro_ of the English Stock Exchange,"" as his enemies freely"
named Mendizábal.
"But Cristina of Naples was a typical woman of the Latin races, and,"
however strongly she might be determined to establish her daughter on
"the throne of Spain, she was also a good Catholic, and any oppression of"
Holy Church was abhorrent to her nature.
"Upon this probability, which amounted to certainty in his mind, the"
Abbot of Montblanch resolved to proceed.
"Moreover, it was an open secret that a few months after the death of her"
"husband Fernando, Cristina had married Muñoz, one of the handsomest"
"officers of her bodyguard. For this and other Bourbon delinquencies,"
"conceived in the good old Neapolitan manner, the Spaniards generally had"
the greatest respect--not even being scandalized when the Queen created
"her new partner Duke of Rianzares, or when, in her _rôle_ of honorary"
"colonel of dragoons, she appeared in a uniform of blue and white,"
"because these were the colours of the ""Immaculate Conception."""
But enough has been said to indicate the nature of the adventure which
"our hero had before him, when after a toilsome march the party halted in"
the grey of the dawn in a tiny dell among the wild mountains of
Guadarrama.
"The air was still bleak and cold, though luckily there was no wind."
"Concha, the child of the south, shivered a little as Rollo aided her to"
"dismount, and this must be the young man's excuse for taking his blue"
"military cloak from its coil across his saddle-bow, and wrapping it"
"in places on the sea floor, secreting stony masses composed of"
"thin, close, concentric layers, connected by vertical rods. The"
Stromatopora are among the chief limestone builders of the
Silurian and Devonian periods.
"CORALS developed along several distinct lines, like modern corals"
"they secreted a calcareous framework, in whose outer portions the"
"polyps lived. In the Ordovician, corals were represented chiefly"
"by the family of the CHOETETES, all species of which are long"
since extinct. The description of other types of corals will be
"given under the Silurian, where they first became abundant."
"ECHINODERMS. The cystoid reaches its climax, but there appear now"
"two higher types of echinoderms,--the crinoid and the starfish."
"The CRINOID, named from its resemblance to the lily, is like the"
"cystoid in many respects, but has a longer stem and supports a"
"crown of plumose arms. Stirring the water with these arms, it"
creates currents by which particles of food are wafted to its
"mouth. Crinoids are rare at the present time, but they grew in the"
greatest profusion in the warm Ordovician seas and for long ages
thereafter. In many places the sea floor was beautiful with these
"graceful, flowerlike forms, as with fields of long-stemmed lilies."
"Of the higher, free-moving classes of the echinoderms, starfish"
"are more numerous than in the Cambrian, and sea urchins make their"
appearance in rare archaic forms.
CRUSTACEANS. Trilobites now reach their greatest development and
more than eleven hundred species have been described from the
rocks of this period. It is interesting to note that in many
species the segments of the thorax have now come to be so shaped
that they move freely on one another. Unlike their Cambrian
"ancestors, many of the Ordovician trilobites could roll themselves"
favour of the more difficult path. Dr. Bose chose the more difficult
"path, and entered into a phase of activity which was to test all his"
strength.
CASTE IN SCIENCE
Dr. Bose's discovery of Universal sensitiveness of matter was
"communicated to the Royal Society on May 7th, 1901, when he himself gave"
"a successful experimental demonstration. His communication was, however,"
"strongly assailed by Sir John Burden-Sanderson, the leading"
"physiologist, and one or two of his followers. They had nothing to urge"
against his experiments but objected to a physicist straying into the
preserve that had been specially reserved for the physiologist. He had
unwittingly strayed into the domain of a new and unfamiliar caste system
"and offended its etiquette. In consequence of this opposition his paper,"
"which was already in print, was not published. This is not by any means"
"to be regarded as an injustice done to a stranger. Even Lord Rayleigh,"
"who occupies an unique position in the world of science, was subjected"
"to fierce attacks from the chemists, because he, a physicist, had"
ventured to predict that the air would be found to contain new elements
not hitherto discovered.
"It is natural that there should be prejudice against all innovations,"
and the attitude of Sir John Burden-Sanderson is easily explained.
Unfortunately there was another incident about which similar explanation
could not be urged. Dr. Bose's Paper had been placed in the archives of
"the Royal Society, so that technically there was no publication. And it"
"came about that eight months after the reading of his Paper, another"
communication found publication in the Journal of a different society
which was practically the same as Dr. Bose's but without any
acknowledgment. The author of this communication was a gentleman who had
"The natives of Sinaketa, as we have seen in the last chapter, acquire"
"a certain amount of the Koya produce by means of trade. There are,"
"however, certain articles, useful yet unobtainable in the Trobriands,"
"and freely accessible in the Koya, and to these the Trobrianders"
"help themselves. The glassy forms of lava, known as obsidian, can be"
found in great quantities over the slopes of the hills in Sanaroa
"and Dobu. This article, in olden days, served the Trobrianders"
"as material for razors, scrapers, and sharp, delicate, cutting"
instruments. Pumice-stone abounding in this district is collected
"and carried to the Trobriands, where it is used for polishing. Red"
"ochre is also procured there by the visitors, and so are the hard,"
basaltic stones (binabina) used for hammering and pounding and for
"magical purposes. Finally, very fine silica sand, called maya, is"
"collected on some of the beaches, and imported into the Trobriands,"
"where it is used for polishing stone blades, of the kind which serve"
as tokens of value and which are manufactured up to the present day.
II
But by far the most important of the articles which the Trobrianders
"collect for themselves are the spondylus shells. These are freely,"
"though by no means easily, accessible in the coral outcrops of Sanaroa"
Lagoon. It is from this shell that the small circular perforated
"discs (kaloma) are made, out of which the necklaces of the Kula"
"are composed, and which also serve for ornamenting almost all the"
articles of value or of artistic finish which are used within the
"Kula district. But, only in two localities within the district are"
"these discs manufactured, in Sinaketa and in Vakuta, both villages in"
"Southern Boyowa. The shell can be found also in the Trobriand Lagoon,"
rigorous equality preached by Rousseau.
The new constitution of 1791 was also a source of discord. In its
"jealousy of the royal authority, the National Assembly seized very"
many of the executive functions of government. The results were
"disastrous. Laws remained without force, taxes went uncollected, the"
"army was distracted by mutinies, and the monarchy sank slowly into the"
"gulf of bankruptcy and anarchy. Thus, in the course of three years,"
"the revolutionists goaded the clergy to desperation, they were about"
"to overthrow the monarchy, every month was proving their local"
"self-government to be unworkable, and they themselves split into"
factions that plunged France into war and drenched her soil by
organized massacres.

We know very little about the impression made on the young Buonaparte
by the first events of the Revolution. His note-book seems even to
show that he regarded them as an inconvenient interference with his
plans for Corsica. But gradually the Revolution excites his interest.
"In September, 1789, we find him on furlough in Corsica sharing the"
hopes of the islanders that their representatives in the French
National Assembly will obtain the boon of independence. He exhorts
"his compatriots to favour the democratic cause, which promises a"
speedy deliverance from official abuses. He urges them to don the new
"tricolour cockade, symbol of Parisian triumph over the old monarchy;"
"to form a club; above all, to organize a National Guard. The young"
"officer knew that military power was passing from the royal army, now"
"honeycombed with discontent, to the National Guard. Here surely was"
Corsica's means of salvation. But the French governor of Corsica
"intervenes. The club is closed, and the National Guard is dispersed."
Thereupon Buonaparte launches a vigorous protest against the tyranny
"An ""intelligent"" officer--Matters political--Three tribes"
and a fourth--Their women and inter-tribal laws--Sarhad
conditions--A summons to the Chiefs--A bid for rank--Telegraph
wires and Sheitan--Two first-class liars--A strategic scheme--An
ungazetted General--Lost kit--Swallows and flies--Forces
available--Communications freed--The Kacha levy and a
shock--Mirjawa.
My first visit in Robat was to the officer who had been commanding
"the scattered British forces up to that date. He was a very sick man,"
and had been holding out with the utmost difficulty until he could be
"relieved. Here I met Major Landon of the 35th Scinde Horse, one of"
the three Intelligence Officers employed by the Indian Government in
Persia.
I very quickly realised that Landon was an officer of very high
"intelligence, as well as an Intelligence Officer, and that he had a"
"fund of information concerning the country, and the conditions and"
characteristics of the inhabitants of both Persia and Baluchistan. In
"fact, I judged that he would be such an asset that, then and there, I"
"invited him to become my Brigade-Major, although I ruefully remarked"
"that I had, at present, no brigade!"
"He was keen to accept, but did not know how the authorities at Simla"
"would view his acceptance of such a post, and asked me whether I"
should be willing to shoulder the responsibility of annexing him for
"the campaign. Considering that my shoulders were broad enough, I"
promptly replied that my orders had been to take command of all the
"scattered forces I could find and co-ordinate them, and that I looked"
"upon him as my second ""find,"" Idu and his two companions being the"
"first. Further, that he was here as Intelligence Officer and would"

above and 1-1/2 inch within the left anterior superior iliac
"spine; _exit_, 1-1/2 inch to the right of the tenth dorsal"
spinous process. The same bullet had perforated the forearm
just above the wrist prior to entering the abdomen. No local or
constitutional signs indicated either bowel injury or
"perforation of liver. The man, however, was suffering from a"
"slight attack of dysentery, passing blood and mucus per rectum"
with great tenesmus. He was sent to the Base at the end of a
"week, and returned to England well three weeks later. He"
"attributed his dysentery to the wound, as the symptoms did not"
exist prior to its reception; but as the disease coincided
exactly with what was very prevalent amongst the troops at the
"time, I do not think there was any connection between it and"
the injury.
"(179) Wounded near Thaba-nchu. _Entry_, over the centre of the"
"sacrum at the upper border of fourth segment; _exit_, 1-1/2"
"inch above left Poupart's ligament, 2 inches from the median"
"line. Aperture of entry oval, with long vertical axis. Exit"
"wound a transverse slit, with slight tendency to starring (see"
"fig. 19, p. 58). One hour after being shot the patient vomited"
once. There was some evidence of shock and considerable pain.
The bowels acted involuntarily simultaneously with the
"vomiting, and incontinence of fæces and retention of urine"
persisted for four days. The vomit was bilious in appearance;
no blood was seen either in it or the motions.
Forty-six hours after the injury the condition was as follows:
"Face slightly anxious and pale; skin moist, temperature 100.4°;"
"pulse 116, regular and of fair strength; respirations 24;"
although the dream might be said to lend itself to such suggestions.
The idea of moral retribution and eternal punishment may also be present
in dreams. This may be illustrated by the dream of a lady who had an ill
"and restless girl companion sleeping with her, and was disturbed as well"
by a yelping and howling terrier outside. She had also lately heard that
a friend had brought over a python from Africa. 'I dreamed last night I
had a basket of cold squirming snakes beside me; they just touched me all
"over, but did not hurt; I felt mad with loathing and hate of them, and"
"the beasts would not kill me. That, I thought, was my eternal punishment"
for my sins.' In her waking moments the dreamer was not apprehensive of
"eternal punishment, and it may be in such a case that, as Freud suggests,"
an unfamiliar moral idea emerges in sleep in much the same way as an
unfamiliar or 'forgotten' fact may emerge.
"On the whole, it may be said that while the moral attitude of the dreaming"
"state is not usually identical with that of the waking state, there still"
nearly always is a moral attitude. It could not well be otherwise. Our
emotional states are intimately bound up with moral relationships; we
"could not display such highly emotional states as we experience in dreams,"
"with all their tragic accompaniments, in the absence of any sense of"
morality.

NOTE TO THE ARTICLE ON 'COMMERCIAL MORALITY'
In the October number of the _Anglo-Japanese Gazette_ (London) is
"published a criticism by Mr. Curtis, editor and proprietor of the _Kobe"
"Herald_, on 'the ridiculously sweeping assertions,' as he calls it, made"
by Mr. Longford in his article. I subjoin herewith a passage which
relates to Mr. Longford's assertion that a 'cordon' is drawn by the
"Japanese round the trading centres of Yokohama and Kobe, and that"
foreign merchants are suffering under the 'thraldom':--
"Well, let me say that no sane, fair-minded man who knows anything"
whatever of his subject would ever dream of accusing the whole
Japanese people of a lack of commercial morality. All this talk
about a cordon being drawn round the treaty ports is rubbish. No
"such barrier exists, save perhaps in the imagination of a few who"
cannot shake off the prejudices and disabilities of the past. The
"idea sounds absurd to me, knowing, as I do know, that all the"
go-ahead firms have been doing their utmost for some time past to
open up connections in the principal cities. Mr. Longford seems to
think that business is conducted in Japan to-day just as it was
"performed. Appendix incision, about [Symbol: ounce]j of fæcal"
fluid and fæces in a localised cavity on outer and anterior
aspect of cæcum evacuated; adhesions very firm. Cavity sloughy
throughout and cæcum covered with dull grey lymph. The opening
"in the bowel was not localised, and it was considered wiser to"
treat the case like one of perforation from appendicitis than
to run the risk of breaking down adhesions. A small awl-like
opening was found in the ilium with powdered bone at its
entrance leading to the wound of exit.
"The after-treatment of the case gave rise to no anxiety, but"
healing of the resulting sinus was slow; fæcal-smelling pus
"escaped for some days, and a number of small sloughs came away."
"On the twelfth day the patient was sent down to Wynberg, where"
he remained twelve weeks. A counter-incision was needed in the
loin to drain the suppurating cavity three weeks after the
"primary operation, and five weeks after the operation an escape"
"of gas and fæces took place from the anterior wound, while the"
"bowels were acting, as a result of a dose of castor oil. No"
"further escape of fæces occurred, and he left for England with"
a small sinus only. No extension of inflammation into the
"original wound track ever occurred, both openings and the canal"
healing by primary union.
"The sinus remained open, and occasionally discharged for a"
"further period of six months, and then healed firmly; since"
when the patient has been in perfect health.
"(182*) _Splenic flexure, descending colon._--Wounded at"
"Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), in sixth left intercostal"
"space in mid-axillary line; _exit_, in left loin, below last"
"rib, at outer margin of erector spinæ. The patient remained in"
"supply of granite, gneiss, marble, slate, and other such building"
materials. Still more valuable are the stores of iron and copper
and other metals which they contain.
At the present time the pre-Cambrian region about Lake Superior
"leads the world in the production of iron ore, its output for 1903"
being more than five sevenths of the entire output of the whole
"United States, and exceeding that of any foreign country. The ore"
bodies consist chiefly of the red oxide of iron (hematite) and
"occur in troughs of the strata, underlain by some impervious rock."
A theory held by many refers the ultimate source of the iron to
the igneous rocks of the Archean. When these rocks were upheaved
"and subjected to weathering, their iron compounds were decomposed."
Their iron was leached out and carried away to be laid in the
Algonkian water bodies in beds of iron carbonate and other iron
"compounds. During the later ages, after the Algonkian strata had"
"been uplifted to form part of the continent, a second"
concentration has taken place. Descending underground waters
charged with oxygen have decomposed the iron carbonate and
"deposited the iron, in the form of iron oxide, in troughs of the"
strata where their downward progress was arrested by impervious
floors.
The pre-Cambrian rocks of the eastern United States also are rich
"in iron. In certain districts, as in the Highlands of New Jersey,"
the black oxide of iron (magnetite) is so abundant in beds and
disseminated grains that the ordinary surveyor's compass is
useless.
The pre-Cambrian copper mines of the Lake Superior region are
"among the richest on the globe. In the igneous rocks copper, next"
"to iron, is the most common of all the useful metals, and it was"
"Viggon Sarri smiled confidently. He glanced at Linus Brein and asked,"
"""Just how competent do you think this new thing is?"""
"Linus shrugged. ""We've analyzed the infrawave pattern they've"
developed. It is obvious that this is their first prototype of an
infrawave space detector. The pattern is of the primitive absorptive
"type, which is both inefficient as a detector and is also inclined to"
"produce spurious responses. From our observations, their equipment"
must be extremely complex too. It must be loaded to the scuppers with
"fragile circuits and components, because the search pattern keeps"
"breaking down, or becoming irregular. An efficient detector cannot"
be made of the infrawave bands until the third order of reflective
"response is discovered. I doubt that any research team, no matter how"
"big, can start with the primitive absorption phase of the infrawaves"
and leap to the higher orders of infrawave radiation in less than a
"lifetime of study."""
"""So, gentlemen?"" asked Viggon of his two aides. ""Can you predict"
"whether or not their new detector will deliver the goods?"""
All looked expectantly at Linus Brein.
"""We've been recalculating our probabilities at the introduction of each"
"new phase of their behaviour,"" Linus Brein said seriously. ""From their"
"actions, I would say that they do not know, grasp, or perhaps even"
guess that space has flaws and warps in the continuum. They have been
"going at their search in a pattern of solid geometrical precision, but"
"have been paying no attention to those rifts, small as they are, that"
actually make a straight course bend aside for a distance. So due to
the fact that their search pattern has already passed over one of these
"rifts in which the one lifeship lies, and passed beyond in their line"
"The pulse rose to 120, and respiration to 26, and there was"
"pain, which was subdued by 1/3 grain of morphia, administered"
"subcutaneously. A fair amount of urine was passed, and the"
"bowels acted once, the motion containing blood."
On the second day after operation there was some improvement;
"the pulse still numbered 116, and the temperature was raised to"
"100°, but the belly moved fairly, and pain was moderate."
"Abundant foul-smelling, bile-stained discharge came from the"
wound when the plug was removed. Rectal feeding was
supplemented by small quantities of milk and soda by the mouth.
"The condition did not materially change, but on the fourth day"
it was evident that the suturing of the stomach wound had given
"way, and liquid food escaped readily when taken. The discharge"
remained bile-stained and very foul. No extension of
"inflammation to the general peritoneal cavity occurred, but it"
was evident that the patient was suffering from constitutional
"infection from the foul wound, the lower part of which opened"
up somewhat after the removal of the stitches on the seventh
day. The wound was irrigated three times daily with 1-300
"creolin lotion, but remained very foul. The man slowly lost"
"strength, although escape from the stomach considerably"
decreased. On the tenth day a sudden severe hæmorrhage
"occurred, presumably from a large branch of the coeliac axis."
"The bleeding was readily controlled by a plug, and did not"
"recur; but the patient rapidly sank, and died on the twelfth"
"day after the operation, and fourteen days after reception of"
the injury. No _post-mortem_ examination was made.
"2. _Wounds of the small intestine._--These were comparatively common,"
but offered little that was special either in their symptoms or the
"Although these words were written nearly half a century ago, they are"
so specially applicable to-day that they seem quite “up-to-date”:
"indeed, I think they will hold equally good fifty years hence."
In spite of a strong taste on the part of children for what is ugly
"and brutal, I am sure that we ought to eliminate this element as far"
as possible from the school stories--especially among poor children.
Not because I think children should be protected from all knowledge
"of evil, but because so much of this knowledge comes into their life"
outside school that we can well afford to ignore it during school
"hours. At the same time, however, as I shall show by example when I"
"come to the positive side, it would be well to show children by story"
illustration the difference between brute ugliness without anything
"to redeem it and surface ugliness, which may be only a veil over the"
"beauty that lies underneath. It might be possible, for instance, to"
show children the difference between the real ugliness of a brutal
"story of crime and an illustration of it in the sensational papers,"
"and the apparent ugliness in the priest's face of the “Laocoon” group,"
because of the motive of courage and endurance behind the suffering.
Many stories in everyday life could be found to illustrate this.
VIII.--_Stories of infant piety and death-bed scenes._ The stories
"for children forty years ago contained much of this element, and the"
following examples will illustrate this point:
"Notes from poems written by a child between six and eight years of age,"
"by name Philip Freeman, afterwards Archdeacon of Exeter:"
"Poor Robin, thou canst fly no more,"
Thy joys and sorrows all are o'er.
"Through Life's tempestuous storms thou'st trod,"
track of foreign bodies carried in with the projectile. See case 160.
Fig. 84 illustrates an example where the limitation to the abdominal
wall was evident on inspection. Here the division of the thick muscles
of the abdominal wall had led to the formation of a swelling exactly
"similar to that seen after the subcutaneous rupture of a muscle, and two"
soft fluctuating tumours bounded by contracted muscle existed in the
substance of the oblique and rectus muscles.
[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Wound of Abdominal Wall (Lee-Metford). Division
of fibres of external oblique and rectus abdominis muscles. Case 159]
The cases which presented the most serious diagnostic difficulty in this
relation were those in which the wound was situated in the thicker
muscular portions of the lower part of the abdominal and pelvic walls.
"Such a case is illustrated in the chapter on fractures (see fig. 55, p."
"191). I saw one or two such instances, in which only the exploration"
necessary for treatment of the fracture decided the point. In many of
the wounds affecting the lateral portion of the abdominal wall the
"question of penetration could never be definitely cleared up, as wounds"
of the colon sometimes gave rise to absolutely no symptoms.
In a certain proportion of the injuries the peritoneal cavity was no
"doubt perforated without the infliction of any further visceral injury,"
and in these also the doubt as to the occurrence of penetration was
never solved.

"of the injury and did not fall; he got down, however, and lay"
"of German-Jewish or Dutch-Jewish descent, who in the present"
generation had become Catholic Christians as it ranged them with the
"best people. They were worthy and wealthy Belgian citizens, but"
presumably would not have deeply regretted a change in the political
"destinies of Belgium, provided international finance was not"
"adversely affected. There were also a few Belgian Socialists--a few,"
"but enough--who took posts under the German provisional government,"
on the plea that until you could be purely socialistic it did not
matter under what flag you drew your salary.
"Von Giesselin was most benevolently intentioned, in reality a"

slew their oppressors.) He hoped through the pieces played at the

"Belgians round to a reasonable frame of mind, to a toleration of"
existence under the German Empire. But his efforts brought down on
him the unsparing ridicule of the Parisian-minded Bruxellois. They
were prompt to detect his attempts to modify the text of French
"operettas so that these, while delighting the lovers of light music,"
need not at the same time excite a military spirit or convey the
least allusion of an impertinent or contemptuous kind towards the
Central Powers. Thus the couplets

NOTE TO DIALOGUE VIII.
Before the preceding pages had been printed two events worth mentioning
here took place. One is the lamented death of Sir Henry Irving. The
other is the public discussion which took place under the auspices of
"the London Shakespeare League, on the best method of presenting"
Shakespeare's plays on the modern stage. On the latter subject perhaps I
may add a word. While in Japan the tendency is to introduce
"women-players into the company of male players, and improvement of"
"scenery is much sought after on European lines, both of which are due to"
"the occidental influence, it is curious to notice that exactly reverse"
"movements, namely the dispensing with the female players and the"
"returning back to the primitive simplicity of stage properties, are"
advocated in England by competent persons with regard to the
representation of Shakespeare. I extract below among others a passage of
the speech of Mr. Bernard Shaw on the occasion of the discussion
"a certain district in the South-East, abutting on to the frontiers"
"of Afghanistan and of Baluchistan, and known as the Sarhad, which is"
occupied by a number of nomad tribes who claim absolute independence.
At this time these tribes were causing considerable embarrassment and
difficulty to the Indian Government.
"The Germans and their agents, who were past masters in the art of"
"propaganda, were still endeavouring, as they had done for years"
"before the outbreak of hostilities, to work upon the discontented"
portion of the Indian population in the hope of rousing them into
"open rebellion. They believed this to be quite possible, in spite of"
the magnificent way in which India had offered her resources of men
"and money to the British Raj, and hoped thereby to handicap us still"
further in our great struggle in the West.
"They were pouring their agents, with their lying propaganda, into"
"India via Persia and Afghanistan. Afghanistan, like Persia, was"
"nominally neutral, but she was breaking her neutrality by many open"
"acts of aggression, and was offering every facility in her power"
"to the German agents in their passage through her territories, and"
thence into the Punjab.
"To reach Afghanistan, however, the German agents had to pass through"
some part of Persia. The Persian Government placed no restrictions on
"the movements of either British or Germans, of which fact the latter"
took full advantage.
A glance at the map will show that apparently the easiest route for
"them to take across Persia was in the North, in the Russian sphere of"
"influence, and to approach Afghanistan through Korasan; or, failing"
"this, by a route rather farther South, across the Lut Desert, in the"
direction of Birjand. As a matter of fact they had tried both these
but I find that if I continue to do this I shall have but little time
for anything else.
The very unexpected welcome which the book has received prompts me to
take this plan and means of replying to many who have honored me by
"writing me personal letters. First, permit me to thank those who have"
"written letters of praise and gratitude, and to say that, although I may"
"be unable to reply in a private letter, I am not indifferent to these"
"evidences of your interest, and am greatly helped in my work by your"
sympathy and encouragement. I have also received most courteous letters
"from various clergymen who, disagreeing with me, desire to convert me"
either by mail or personal (private) interviews.
"It is wholly impossible for me to grant these requests, since my time"
"and strength are demanded in other work, but I wish to say here what I"
"have written to several of my clerical correspondents, and desire to say"
to them all.
"Although I cannot enter into private correspondence with, nor grant"
"personal interviews to, such a number of your body, I am entirely"
willing to respond in a public way to any replies to my arguments which
come under the following conditions:
1. On page fourteen of the introduction to my book Col. Ingersoll says:
"""No human being can answer her arguments. There is no answer. All the"
priests in the world cannot explain away her objections. There is no
explanation. They should remain dumb unless they can show that the
"impossible is the probable, that slavery is better than freedom, that"
"polygamy is the friend of woman, that the innocent can justly suffer for"
"the guilty, and that to persecute for opinion's sake is an act of love"
"and worship."""
"shrapnel, had perforated the arm, which the patient was sure was by his"
"side at the moment of injury, and the X-rays showed it to lie at the"
"bottom of the pleural cavity, where we assumed it had fallen. When,"
"however, the bullet was removed by Mr. Watson, he found that the fixed"
pain and tenderness had been the result of a fracture of a rib from the
"inner side, not involving loss of continuity; hence the actual"
"indication for the operation had been a delusive one, since the bullet"
"had not fallen, but expended its last force in injuring the rib. The"
"patient made an excellent recovery, and rejoined his regiment at the end"
of six weeks. I saw several cases in which the bullet was lodged in
either the lung or bones of the spine do well with no interference. The
great disadvantage of primary removal in inducing an artificial
pneumo-thorax and in laying open a hæmothorax is obvious.
"In case of lodgment of the bullet in the lung, bearing in mind the"
"infrequency of untoward symptoms, the latter should be watched for prior"
to interference.
The following cases illustrate some typical instances of wound of chest
accompanied by the development of hæmothorax:--
"[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 3.--Primary Hæmothorax, with rise of"
"temperature. Secondary rise, with fresh effusion and pneumonia."
Spontaneous recovery. Case No. 154]
(154) _Severe hæmothorax. Spontaneous recovery._--Wounded at
"Modder River at a distance of 30 yards. _Entry_, at the"
junction of the left anterior axillary fold with the
"chest-wall; _exit_, immediately to the left of the seventh"
dorsal spinous process. The patient arrived at the Base with
"signs of an extensive hæmothorax, accompanied by a temperature"
"which reached 102° on the fourth day, and on the evening of the"
"for derision from all the “chorus of irresponsible reviewers, the"
irresponsible indolent reviewers.”
I believe that Fiction will find those that can be reached by no other
means. Fiction sometimes sets a man seeking for Fact.
Very diffidently and very reverently I may remind my contemporaries
"that one, who has, at any rate, profoundly influenced the course of"
"history, whatever view we may take of His person, did not disdain this"
"method, “He taught them by parables.”"
“Let me tell you a story.” Is there any age of mankind which does not
respond to the invitation and give audience? A story stilled the
"tumult of the nursery in our earliest days, when heavy storms shook"
"the windows and the tedium of a long, wet afternoon had turned play"
into fretfulness. A story beguiled us into interest when our History
"lesson had seemed an arid futility in Fourth Form days, and our"
magisterial enemies began to show themselves human after all when they
bade us read _The Last of the Barons_ as we were painfully plodding in
"the Plantagenet period, and found the War of the Roses a very thorny"
waste.
It is strange to turn over the pages of eminent evangelical sermons
of the early Victorian days and to notice how “Novel reading” is
denounced. Probably the worthy divines who fulminated against fiction
"were thinking of their own boyhood, and the mischief which came to"
them from Fielding and Richardson and Smollett surreptitiously
perused. Sir Anthony Absolute’s detestation of the circulating library
survived in some provincial circles even when Sir Walter Scott had
come to his own. The last forty years have altered things
"considerably, and though some men may pretend to despise novels,"
now-a-days they must take them into account. Wise and learned persons
"formations of the stratified rocks of the earth's crust, giving to"
"each formation its maximum thickness wherever found, amounts to"
not less than forty miles. Knowing how slowly sediments accumulate
"upon the sea floor, we must believe that the successive cycles"
which the earth has seen stretch back into a past almost
"inconceivably remote, and measure tens of millions and perhaps"
even hundreds of millions of years.
HOW THE FORMATIONS ARE CORRELATED AND THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD MADE
"UP. Arranged in the order of their succession, the formations of"
the earth's crust would constitute a connected record in which the
"geological history of the planet may be read, and therefore known"
as the GEOLOGICAL RECORD. But to arrange the formations in their
natural order is not an easy task. A complete set of the volumes
of the record is to be found in no single region. Their leaves and
chapters are scattered over the land surface of the globe. In one
"area certain chapters may be found, though perhaps with many"
"missing leaves, and with intervening chapters wanting, and these"
absent parts perhaps can be supplied only after long search
through many other regions.
Adjacent strata in any region are arranged according to the LAW OF
"SUPERPOSITION, i.e. any stratum is younger than that on which it"
"was deposited, just as in a pile of paper, any sheet was laid"
later than that on which it rests. Where rocks have been
"disturbed, their original attitude must be determined before the"
law can be applied. Nor can the law of superposition be used in
identifying and comparing the strata of different regions where
the formations cannot be traced continuously from one region to
the other.
The formations of different regions are arranged in their true
"due to the fact that they are often metalliferous, carrying"
valuable native metals and metallic ores disseminated in fine
"particles, in strings, and sometimes in large masses in the midst"
of the valueless nonmetallic minerals which make up what is known
as the VEIN STONE.
The most common vein stones are QUARTZ and CALCITE. FLUORITE
"(calcium fluoride), a mineral harder than calcite and"
"crystallizing in cubes of various colors, and BARITE (barium"
"sulphate), a heavy white mineral, are abundant in many veins."
The gold-bearing quartz veins of California traverse the
metamorphic slates of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Below the zone
of solution (p. 45) these veins consist of a vein stone of quartz
"mingled with pyrite (p. 13), the latter containing threads and"
grains of native gold. But to the depth of about fifty feet from
"the surface the pyrite of the vein has been dissolved, leaving a"
"rusty, cellular quartz with grains of the insoluble gold scattered"
through it.
The PLACER DEPOSITS of California and other regions are gold-
bearing deposits of gravel and sand in river beds. The heavy gold
"is apt to be found mostly near or upon the solid rock, and its"
"grains, like those of the sand, are always rounded. How the gold"
came in the placers we may leave the pupil to suggest.
"Copper is found in a number of ores, and also in the native metal."
Below the zone of surface changes the ore of a copper vein is
"often a double sulphide of iron and copper called CHALCOPYRITE, a"
mineral softer than pyrite--it can easily be scratched with a
knife--and deeper yellow in color. For several score of feet below
the ground the vein may consist of rusty quartz from which the
"monopolized the market, for the trade statistics show 17,000,000 bunches"
of bananas imported by rival companies in 1912. As for its stimulation
"of the business of the ports of New Orleans, Galveston and Mobile, and"
"its revivifying of trade along the Caribbean, both are matters of common"
knowledge.
"[Illustration: ABOVE THE CLOUDS, CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]"
The banana thrives best in rich soil covered with alluvial deposits and
in a climate of great humidity where the temperature never falls below
75 degrees Fahrenheit. Once established the plantation needs little
"attention, the plant being self-propagating from suckers which shoot off"
"from the “mat,” the tangled roots of the mother plant. It begins to bear"
"fruit at the age of ten or eleven months, and with the maturing of one"
bunch of fruit the parent plant is at once cut down so that the strength
of the soil may go into the suckers that succeed it. Perhaps the most
technical work of the cultivator is to select the suckers so that the
"plantation will not bring all its fruit to maturity in one season, but"
"rather yield a regular succession of crops, month after month. It was"
interesting to learn from a representative of the United Fruit Company
"at Bocas del Toro, that the banana has its dull season--not in"
"production but in the demand for it which falls off heavily in winter,"
"though one would suppose that summer, when our own fruits are in the"
"market, would be the period of its eclipse."
[Illustration: THE CHIRIQUI VOLCANO]
[Illustration: NATIVE MARKET BOAT AT CHORRERA]
While most of the fruit gathered in the neighborhood of Bocas del Toro
"is grown on land owned and tilled by the Company, there are hundreds of"
small individual growers with plantations of from half an acre to fifty
of the lighthouses which serve its own great fleet and the ships of all
the world. It has dredged new channels and marked them with buoys. It
has installed along the Central and South American coasts a wireless
telegraph service of the highest power and efficiency. It has
"constructed hundreds of miles of public roads, maintains public schools,"
and in other ways renders at its own expense the services which are
presumed to fall on governments. The American financiers associated with
it are now pushing to completion the Pan-American railroad which soon
"will connect New York with Panama by an all-rail route, and thus realize"
what once was esteemed an impractical dream.
But it is the United Fruit Company’s activities in Panama only that are
pertinent to this book. They demonstrate strikingly how readily one
natural opportunity afforded by this land responded to the call of
"systematic effort, and there are a dozen products beside the banana"
which might thus be exploited.

The fruit is thrown out by the company’s inspectors for scarcely visible
flaws]
"On the Atlantic coast, only a night’s sail from Colon, is the port of"
"Bocas del Toro (The Mouths of the Bull), a town of about 9000"
"inhabitants, built and largely maintained by the banana trade. Here is"
"the largest and most beautiful natural harbor in the American tropics,"
and here some day will be established a winter resort to which will
flock people from all parts of the world. Almirante Bay and the Chiriqui
"Lagoon extend thirty or forty miles, dotted with thousands of islands"
"decked with tropical verdure, and flanked to the north and west by"
superb mountain ranges with peaks of from seven to ten thousand feet in
height.
"blood excited them, and they besprinkled the statue of the goddess and her"
"votaries with it, or even drank it. Finally a prophetic delirium would"
"overcome them, and they foretold the future."
"This ferocious worship aroused curiosity at first, but it never gained"
great consideration. It appears that the Cappadocian Bellona joined the
"number of divinities that were subordinated to the _Magna Mater_ and, as"
"the texts put it, became her follower (_pedisequa_).[12] The brief"
"popularity enjoyed by this exotic _Mâ_ at the beginning of our era shows,"
"nevertheless, the growing {55} influence of the Orient, and of the"
religions of Asia Minor in particular.
After the establishment of the empire the apprehensive distrust in which
the worship of Cybele and Attis had been held gave way to marked favor and
the original restrictions were withdrawn. Thereafter Roman citizens were
"chosen for _archigalli_, and the holidays of the Phrygian deities were"
solemnly and officially celebrated in Italy with even more pomp than had
been displayed at Pessinus.
"According to Johannes Lydus, the Emperor Claudius was the author of this"
change. Doubts have been expressed as to the correctness of the statement
"made by this second-rate compiler, and it has been claimed that the"
transformation in question took place under the Antonines. This is
erroneous. The testimony of inscriptions corroborates that of the Byzantine
"writer.[13] In spite of his love of archaism, it was Claudius who permitted"
"this innovation to be made, and we believe that we can divine the motives"
of his action.
"Under his predecessor, Caligula, the worship of Isis had been authorized"
after a long resistance. Its stirring festivities and imposing processions
gained considerable popularity. This competition must have been disastrous
"to the priests of the _Magna Mater_, who were secluded in their temple on"
"preparation for his higher and better destiny. The cultured, the"
"scholarly, the ultra-refined, may live well and uprightly by their"
"'moral sense,'--if they so choose, provided they have some great ideal"
"to measure themselves by,--but even these, without faith in God, may"
"sometimes slip, and fall into deeper depths of ruin than they dreamed"
"of, when self-centred on those heights of virtue where they fancied"
"themselves exempt from danger."""
"He paused,--there was a curious stillness in the room,--many eyes were"
"lowered, and M. le Duc's composure was evidently not quite so absolute"
as usual.
"""Taken at its best""--he continued--""the world alone is certainly not"
worth fighting for;--we see the fact exemplified every day in the cases
"of those who, surrounded by all that a fair fortune can bestow upon"
"them, deliberately hurl themselves out of existence by their own free"
"will and act,--indeed, suicide is a very general accompaniment of"
"Agnosticism. And self-slaughter, though it may be called madness, is"
"far more often the result of intellectual misery."""
"""Of course, too much learning breeds brain disease""--remarked Dr."
"Mudley sententiously--""but only in weak subjects,--and in my opinion"
"the weak are better out of the world. We've no room for them nowadays."""
"""You say truly, sir,""--replied Alwyn--""we have no room for them, and no"
"patience! They show themselves feeble, and forthwith the strong oppress"
"them;--they can hope for little comfort here, and less help. It is"
"well, therefore, that some of these 'weak' should still believe in God,"
since they can certainly pin no faith on the justice of their
fellow-man! But I cannot agree with you that much learning breeds brain
disease. Provided the learning be accompanied by a belief in the
"Supreme Wisdom,--provided every step of study be taken upward toward"
results attending them. Wounds were met with in every part of the small
gut; but I saw no case in which an injury to the duodenum could be
specially diagnosed.
"As to the symptoms which attended these injuries, it is somewhat"
"difficult to speak with precision, and it must be left to my readers to"
form an opinion as to how many of the cases recounted below were really
instances of perforating wounds. My own view is that in the majority of
"the cases that got well spontaneously, the injury was not of a"
"perforating nature, and that for reasons which have been already set"
"forth. It will, however, be at once noted that in all the five cases in"
which the injury was certainly diagnosed in hospital death occurred.
The cases of injury to the small intestine are perhaps best arranged in
three classes.
"1. Those who died upon the field, or shortly after removal from it. In"
"these the external wounds were often large, the omentum was not rarely"
"prolapsed, and escape of fæces sometimes occurred early. Shock from the"
"severity of the lesion, and hæmorrhage, were no doubt important factors"
in the early lethal issue in this class. Many of the injuries were no
"doubt produced by bullets striking irregularly, by ricochets, by bullets"
"of the expanding forms, or by bullets of large calibre. As being beyond"
"the bounds of surgical aid, this class possessed the least interest."
"2. Cases brought into the Field, or even the Stationary hospitals, with"
"symptoms of moderate severity, or even of an insignificant character,"
in which evidence of septic peritonitis suddenly developed and death
ensued.
3. Cases in which the position of the wounds raised the possibility of
"injury to the intestine, but in which the symptoms were slight or of"
"western door. That stood open,--the bell had long ago ceased,--Mass was"
"over,--and all was profoundly still."
"Out of the warm sunlit air he stepped into the vast, cool,"
"clear-obscure, white glory of the stately shrine,--with bared head and"
"noiseless, reverent feet, he advanced a little way up the nave, and"
"then stood motionless, every artistic perception in him satisfied,"
"soothed, and entranced anew, as in his student-days, by the tranquil"
grandeur of the scene. What majestic silence! What hallowed peace! How
jewel-like the radiance of the sun pouring through the rich stained
"glass on those superb carved pillars, that, like petrified stems of"
"forest-trees, bear lightly up the lofty, vaulted roof to that vast"
height suggestive of a white sky rather than stone!
"Moving on slowly further toward the altar, he was suddenly seized by an"
"overpowering impression,--a memory that rushed upon him with a sort of"
"shock, albeit it was only the memory of a tune!--a wild melody,"
"haunting and passionate, rang in his eras,--the melody that Sarasate,"
"the Orpheus of Spain, had evoked from the heart of his speaking"
"violin,--the sobbing love-lament of the ""Zigeunerweisen""--the weird"
minor-music that had so forcibly suggested--What? THIS VERY
"PLACE!--these snowy columns,--this sculptured sanctity--this flashing"
"light of rose and blue and amber,--this wondrous hush of consecrated"
calm! What next? Dear God! Sweet Christ! what next? The face of
Edris?--Would that heavenly countenance shine suddenly though those
rainbow-colored beams that struck slantwise down toward him?--and
should he presently hear her dulcet voice charming the silence into
deeper ecstasy?
"Overcome by a sensation that was something like fear, he stopped"
"abruptly, and leaning against one of the quaint old oaken benches,"
"strove to control the quick, excited throbbing of his heart,--then"
highly organized fauna-flora of to-day may be compared to the
"growth of some noble oak as it rises from the acorn, spreading"
loftier and more widely extended branches as it grows.
7. While higher and still higher types have continually been
"evolved, until man, the highest of all, appeared, THE LOWER AND"
EARLIER TYPES HAVE GENERALLY PERSISTED. Some which reached their
culmination early in the history of the earth have since changed
only in slight adjustments to a changing environment. Thus the
"brachiopods, a type of shellfish, have made no progress since the"
"Paleozoic, and some of their earliest known genera are represented"
by living forms hardly to be distinguished from their ancient
ancestors. The lowest and earliest branches of the tree of life
have risen to no higher levels since they reached their climax of
development long ago.
8. A strange parallel has been found to exist between the
evolution of organisms and the development of the individual. In
the embryonic stages of its growth the individual passes swiftly
through the successive stages through which its ancestors evolved
during the millions of years of geologic time. THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE INDIVIDUAL RECAPITULATES THE EVOLUTION OF THE RACE.
The frog is a typical amphibian. As a tadpole it passes through a
stage identical in several well-known features with the maturity
"of fishes; as, for example, its aquatic life, the tail by which it"
"swims, and the gills through which it breathes. It is a fair"
inference that the tadpole stage in the life history of the frog
"represents a stage in the evolution of its kind,--that the"
Amphibia are derived from fishlike ancestral forms. This inference
is amply confirmed in the geological record; fishes appeared
before Amphibia and were connected with them by transitional
of Avilion!
"Yet still he kept her close beside him on the steps of the mighty Dom,"
"half-longing, half-hesitating to take her further, and ever and anon"
assailed by a dreamy doubt as to whether she might not even now pass
"away from him suddenly and swiftly, as a mist fading into heaven,--when"
all at once the sound of beating drums and martial trumpets struck
loudly on the quiet morning air. A brilliant regiment of mounted Uhlans
"emerged from an opposite street, and cantered sharply across the Platz"
"and over the Rhine-bridge, with streaming pennons, burnished helmets"
"and accoutrements glistening in a long compact line of silvery white,"
"that vanished as speedily as it had appeared, like a winding flash of"
"meteor flame. Alwyn drew a deep, quick breath; the sight of those armed"
soldiers roused him to the fact that he was actually in the turmoil of
"present daily events,--that his supernal happiness was no vision, but"
"REALITY,--that Edris, his Spirit-love, was with him in tangible human"
"guise of flesh and blood,--though how such a mysterious marvel had been"
"accomplished, he knew no more than scientists know how the lovely life"
of green leaf and perfect flower can still be existent in seeds that
have lain dormant and dry in old tombs for thousands of years! And as
"he looked at her proudly,--adoringly,--she raised her beautiful,"
"innocent, questioning eyes to his."
"""This is a city?"" she asked--""a city of men who labor for good, and"
"serve each other?"""
"""Alas, not so, my sweet!"" he answered, his voice trembling with its own"
"infinite tenderness; ""there is no city on the sad Earth where men do"
"not labor for mere vanity's sake, and oppose each other!"""
Her inquiring gaze softened into a celestial compassion.
"the air magically of the swarm of aircraft in her path, and quietly,"
"calmly, majestically, the _Arcturus_ floated upward."

"Breckenridge, sixty seconds after the initial lift, actuated the system"
of magnetic relays which would gradually cut in the precisely measured
"""starting power,"" which it would be necessary to employ for sixty-nine"
"minutes--for, without the acceleration given by this additional power,"
they would lose many precious hours of time in covering merely the
few thousands of miles during which Earth's attraction would operate
powerfully against their progress.
Faster and faster the great cruiser shot upward as more and more of the
"starting power was released, and heavier and heavier the passengers"
felt themselves become. Soon the full calculated power was on and the
"acceleration became constant. Weight no longer increased, but remained"
constant at a value of plus twenty three and six-tenths percent. For a
few moments there had been uneasy stomachs among the passengers--perhaps
a few of the first-trippers had been made ill--but it was not much worse
"than riding in a high-speed elevator, particularly since there was no"
change from positive to negative acceleration such as is experienced in
express elevators.
"The computer, his calculations complete, watched the pilot with"
"interest, for, accustomed as he was to traversing the depths of space,"
there was a never-failing thrill to his scientific mind in the delicacy
and precision of the work which Breckenridge was doing--work which could
be done only by a man who had had long training in the profession and
who was possessed of instantaneous nervous reaction and of the highest
degree of manual dexterity and control. Under his right and left hands
were the double-series potentiometers actuating the variable-speed

"In modern times, the nurse, who is now receiving such complete"
"training for her duties with the children, should be ready to"
imitate the “dreamer” of the Indian tribe. I rejoice to find that
regular instruction in Story-telling is being given in many of the
institutions where the nurses are trained.
Some years ago there appeared a book by Dion Calthrop called “King
"Peter,” which illustrates very fully the effect of story-telling. It"
is the account of the education of a young prince which is carried on
"at first by means of stories, and later he is taken out into the arena"
of Life to be shown what is happening there--the dramatic appeal being
always the means used to awaken his imagination. The fact that only
_one_ story a year is told him prevents our seeing the effect from day
"to day, but the time matters little. We only need faith to believe that"
"the growth, though slow, was very sure."
"There is something of the same idea in the “Adventures of Telemachus,”"
"written by Fénélon for his royal pupil, the young Duke of Burgundy; but"
whereas Calthrop trusts to the results of indirect teaching by means of
"dramatic stories, Fénélon, on the contrary, makes use of the somewhat"
"heavy, didactic method, so that one would think the attention of the"
young prince must have wandered at times; and I imagine Telemachus was
"in the same condition when he was addressed at some length by Mentor,"
"who, being Minerva (though in disguise), should occasionally have"
displayed that sense of humour which must always temper true wisdom:
"Take, for instance, the heavy reproof conveyed in the following"
passage:
“Death and shipwreck are less dreadful than the pleasures that attack
"tenable positions. In one type of dream, we imagine we easily achieve all"
"sorts of difficult and complicated actions, but in reality we make no"
movement; the ease and rapidity with which the mental machine moves is due
"to the fact that it is ungeared, and is effecting no work at all. In the"
other type of dream we make violent but inadequate efforts at movement
"and only partially succeed; the machine is partially geared, in a state"
intermediate between deep sleep and the waking condition.]
"[Footnote 83: Jacques le Lorrain, _Revue Philosophique_, July 1895.]"
"[Footnote 84: The systematic megalomania of insanity can, however, have"
"its rise in dreams; Régis and Lalanne (_International Medical Congress_,"
"1900; _Proceedings, Section de Psychiatrie_, p. 227) met within a short"
period with four cases in which this had taken place.]
"[Footnote 85: This indeed seems to have been recognised by Wundt, who"
regards a 'functional rest of the sensory centres and of the apperception
"centre,' resulting in heightened latent energy which lends unusual"
"strength to excitations, as a secondary condition of the dream state."
"Külpe (_Outline of Psychology_, p. 212) argues that the existence of"
vivid dreams shows that fatigue with its diminished associability fails
to affect the central sensations themselves; this increased excitability
"resulting from dissociation may itself, however, be regarded as a symptom"
of fatigue; hyperaesthesia and anaesthesia are alike signs of exhaustion.]
[Footnote 86: The exhaustion sometimes felt on awaking from a dream
perhaps testifies to its emotional potency. Delboeuf states that a friend
of his experienced a dream so terrible in its emotional strain that on
awaking his black hair was found to have turned completely white.]
[Footnote 87: The fundamental character of emotion in dreams has been
more or less clearly recognised by various investigators. Thus C. L.
rise of temperature.
_Symptoms of hæmothorax._--In the more severe cases of primary bleeding
"the symptoms did not, as a rule, reach their full height until the third"
or fourth day after the injury. The patients then often suffered
"severely. The pulse and temperature rose, and to general symptoms of"
loss of blood were added: occasional lividity of countenance; severe
"dyspnoea, accompanied by inability to lie on the sound side or to"
assume the supine position; absence of respiratory movement on the
"injured side; pain, restlessness, cough, and sometimes continuance of"
"hæmoptysis, small clots usually being expectorated."
Accompanying these symptoms were the usual physical signs of fluid in
the pleura in differing degrees and combination. Dulness of varying
"extent up to complete absence of resonance on one side, often"
accompanied in the incomplete cases by well-marked skodaic resonance
"anteriorly. Loss of vocal resonance, and fremitus; oegophony, tubular"
respiration over the root of the lung or at the upper limit of the
"dulness, and more or less extensive displacement of the heart. Obvious"
"increase in girth, fulness of the intercostal spaces, or gravitation"
ecchymosis was rare. The latter was most common in instances in which
multiple fracture of the ribs existed (see fig. 83). I think the rarity
of the last sign must have been due to the early coagulation of the
"blood, and its retention by the pleura, as I saw well-marked gravitation"
ecchymosis in one or two cases of mediastinal hæmorrhage.
"The above complex of symptoms was common to all the cases, but in the"
"slighter ones they gave rise to little trouble, and cleared up with"
great rapidity.
"[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Gravitation Ecchymosis in a case of Hæmothorax,"
accompanying fracture of three ribs from within. The influence of the
"moderate severity, and which recovered spontaneously."
The whole crux in diagnosis lay in the attempt to separate the two
"latter classes, and, personally, I must own to having been no nearer a"
"position of being able to form an opinion on this point, in the late"
than in the early stage of my stay in South Africa. The advent of
peritoneal septicæmia was in many instances the only determining moment.
"On this matter I can only add that, in civil practice, an exploratory"
abdominal section is often the only means of determination of a rupture
of the bowel wall.
With regard to the cases of suspected injury to the bowel which
"recovered spontaneously, the symptoms were somewhat special in their"
"comparative slightness, and in the limited nature of the local signs."
"Thus the pulse seldom rose to as much as 100 in rate, 80 was a common"
"average. Respiration was never greatly quickened, 24 was a common rate."
"The temperature rarely exceeded 100°. Vomiting was occasionally severe,"
"but usually not persistent, ceasing on the second day. A good quantity"
"of urine was passed. As to the local signs, these again were of a"
"limited nature; distension did not occur, or was slight; movement of the"
"abdominal wall was only restricted in the neighbourhood of the wound,"
"the affected area amounted to a quarter, or at most half, the abdominal"
"wall, and rigidity was localised to a similar segment. Local tenderness"
"usually existed; but, as a rule, there was little or no dulness to point"
to the occurrence either of fluid effusion or a considerable deposition
of lymph.
Again many of the patients suffered with very slight symptoms of
"constitutional shock, although there was considerable variation in this"
particular.
"(165*) Wounded at Graspan, sustaining a compound fracture of"
"their pores. As the heat of the interior increased, these gases"
transpired to the surface and formed the primitive atmosphere and
hydrosphere. The atmosphere has therefore grown slowly from the
smallest beginnings. Gases emitted from the interior in volcanic
"eruptions and in other ways have ever added to it, and are adding"
"to it now. On the other hand, the atmosphere has constantly"
"suffered loss, as it has been robbed of oxygen by the oxidation of"
"rocks in weathering, and of carbon dioxide in the making of"
limestones and carbonaceous deposits.
While all hypotheses of the earth's beginnings are as yet unproved
"speculations, they serve to bring to mind one of the chief lessons"
"which geology has to teach,--that the duration of the earth in"
"time, like the extension of the universe in space, is vastly"
beyond the power of the human mind to realize. Behind the history
"recorded in the rocks, which stretches back for many million"
"years, lies the long unrecorded history of the beginnings of the"
planet; and still farther in the abysses of the past are dimly
seen the cycles of the evolution of the solar system and of the
nebula which gave it birth.
We pass now from the dim realm of speculation to the earliest era
"of the recorded history of the earth, where some certain facts may"
be observed and some sure inferences from them may be drawn.
THE ARCHEAN.
"The oldest known sedimentary strata, wherever they are exposed by"
"uplift and erosion, are found to be involved with a mass of"
crystalline rocks which possesses the same characteristics in all
"parts of the world. It consists of foliated rocks, gneisses, and"
"schists of various kinds, which have been cut with dikes and other"
"More forcible lateral impact produced a split of the peritoneum, or of"
this together with the muscular coat. Such a lateral slit is shown in
"fig. 85, although the clearness of outline is somewhat impaired by the"
presence of a considerable amount of inflammatory lymph.
Fig. 86 exhibits a lateral injury of a more pronounced form. The bullet
here struck the most prominent portion of the under surface of the
"bowel, and produced a circular perforation not very unlike one produced"
"by rectangular impact, except in the lesser degree of eversion of the"
mucous membrane. Here again the appearance is somewhat altered by the
"presence of a considerable amount of lymph, but this is of less"
importance in this figure because the lymph is localised to the portion
of the bowel in the immediate neighbourhood of the opening which had
suffered contusion and erasion.
[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Gutter Wound of Small Intestine caused by
lateral impact. Position of shallow portion of gutter indicated by
deposition of inflammatory lymph. Circular perforation. (St. Thomas's
Hospital Museum)]
"Fig. 87, A B, illustrates a symmetrical perforation of the small"
"intestine; the aperture of entry (A) is roughly circular, and a ring of"
mucous membrane protrudes and partially closes the opening. The aperture
"of exit is a curved slit, again partially occluded by the mucous"
membrane. The same amount of difference between the two apertures did
"not always exist; in many cases both were circular, and apparently"
"symmetrical. Beyond this I have seen three apertures in close proximity,"
"two lying on the same aspect of the bowel, and the first of these was no"
doubt an opening due to lateral impact similar to that seen in fig. 86.
In the recent condition little difference existed between the three
apertures.
3. _Wounds of the large intestine._--Injuries to every part of the large
"bowel were observed, and spontaneous recoveries were seen in all parts"
"except the transverse colon, which, as already remarked, is near akin"
to the small intestine with regard to its position and anatomical
arrangement.
"The only case of perforation of the vermiform appendix that I heard of,"
"one under the care of Mr. Stonham, died of peritoneal septicæmia."
Several cases of recovery from wounds of the cæcum and ascending colon
are recounted below. The only points of importance in the nature of the
"signs of these injuries were their primary insignificance, and the"
comparative frequency with which _local_ peritoneal suppuration followed
them. The absence of a similar sequence in some of the cases in which
"wounds of the small intestine were assumed, was, in my opinion, one of"
the strongest reasons for doubting the correctness of the diagnosis. It
is also a significant fact that injuries of the ascending colon--that is
"to say, of the portion of the large bowel which perhaps lies most free"
from the area occupied by the small intestine--were those which most
frequently recovered.
The following cases afford examples of the course followed in a number
"of injuries to the large intestine, and illustrate both the"
uncomplicated and the complicated modes of spontaneous recovery.
"No. 180 affords a good example of an extra-peritoneal injury, and of the"
especially fatal character of such lesions. This case was also one of my
surgical disappointments.
"Nos. 182, 183 are of great interest in several particulars. First, the"
"aperture of exit was large and allowed the escape of fæces, not a very"
"common feature in wounds not proving immediately fatal. Secondly, in"
"neither were any peritoneal signs observed. Thirdly, in each the exit"
"order by the LAW OF INCLUDED ORGANISMS; i.e. formations, however"
"widely separated, which contain a similar assemblage of fossils"
are equivalent and belong to the same division of geological time.
The correlation of formations by means of fossils may be explained
by the formations now being deposited about the north Atlantic.
Lithologically they are extremely various. On the continental
shelf of North America limestones of different kinds are forming
"off Florida, and sandstones and shales from Georgia northward."
Separated from them by the deep Atlantic oozes are other
sedimentary deposits now accumulating along the west coast of
Europe. If now all these offshore formations were raised to open
"air, how could they be correlated? Surely not by lithological"
"likeness, for in this respect they would be quite diverse. All"
"would be similar, however, in the fossils which they contain. Some"
fossil species would be identical in all these formations and
others would be closely allied. Making all due allowance for
differences in species due to local differences in climate and
"other physical causes, it would still be plain that plants and"
"animals so similar lived at the same period of time, and that the"
formations in which their remains were imbedded were
contemporaneous in a broad way. The presence of the bones of
whales and other marine mammals would prove that the strata were
"laid after the appearance of mammals upon earth, and imbedded"
relics of man would give a still closer approximation to their
age. In the same way we correlate the earlier geological
formations.
"For example, in 1902 there were collected the first fossils ever"
found on the antarctic continent. Among the dozen specimens
obtained were some fossil ammonites (a family of chambered shells)
of genera which are found on other continents in certain
"the third metacarpal was pulverised, although the bullet, which"
"was longitudinally flanged, was retained."
"(162) Wounded outside Heilbron. _Entry_, below the eighth right"
"costal cartilage; _exit_, below the eighth cartilage of the"
left side. The wound of entry was slightly oval; that of exit
continued out as a 'flame'-like groove for 2 inches. A week
later the wound track could be palpated as an evident hard
continuous cord.
_Penetration of the intestinal area without definite evidence of
visceral injury._--This accident occurred with a sufficient degree of
"frequency to obtain the greatest importance, both from the point of view"
"of diagnosis and prognosis, and as affecting the question of operative"
interference. Amongst the cases reported below a number occurred in
which it was impossible to settle the question whether injury to the
"bowel had occurred or not, and I will here shortly give what explanation"
I can for the apparent escape of the intestine from serious injury.
We may first recall the general question of the escape of structures
lying to one or other side of the track of the bullet. I believe that
there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of the remarks already made as
"to the escape of such structures as the nerves by means of displacement,"
and that the occurrence of such escapes is manifestly dependent on the
degree of fixity of the nerve or the special segment of it implicated.
The general tendency of the tissues around the tracks to escape
"extensive destruction from actual contusion has also been referred to,"
"and is, I think, indisputable."
"If these observations be accepted, I think there can be no difficulty in"
allowing that the small intestine is exceptionally well arranged to
"escape injury. First of all, it is very moveable; secondly, it is so"
Abdominal section fifty-three and a half hours after accident.
Incision in right linea semilunaris. Great omentum adherent to
"ascending colon, which was covered with plastic lymph. Gas and"
intestinal contents escaped from an opening at the line of
reflexion of the peritoneum from the ascending colon;
retro-peritoneal extravasation and emphysema extended the whole
"length of the ascending colon and around duodenum, the wall of"
the colon itself exhibiting subperitoneal emphysema. The colon
was freed and the rent sewn up with interrupted sutures. About
[Symbol: ounce] iv of foul fæcal fluid were evacuated from
"loin, and a free counter-opening made. The opening in the ilium"
by which the bullet had entered the abdomen was found at the
brim of the pelvis; the loin and peritoneal cavity were sponged
dry and flushed with boiled water; no lymph was seen on the
small intestine. A large gauze plug was inserted into the
"posterior wound, one end of the plug being brought out of the"
operation incision.
During the succeeding six days progress was not unsatisfactory:
"the abdomen became soft, moved with respiration, there was no"
"sickness, and the bowels acted. The pulse fell to 90,"
"respirations to 20, and the temperature did not exceed 102° F."
"The wound suppurated freely, however, and although there were"
"no further signs of peritoneal septicæmia, it was evident that"
"general infection had taken place, and on the sixth day a"
"parotid bubo developed on the right side, which was opened."
On the seventh day the patient suddenly commenced to fail
"rapidly; vomiting was almost continuous--at first curdled milk,"
later frothy watery fluid--and on the eighth day he died. The
"abdomen remained soft, sunken, and flaccid, and death no doubt"
resulted from general septicæmia rather than from peritoneal
The geological formations contain a record still more important
than that of the geographical development of the continents; the
fossils imbedded in the rocks of each formation tell of the kinds
"of animals and plants which inhabited the earth at that time, and"
from these fossils we are therefore able to construct the history
of life upon the earth.
FOSSILS. These remains of organisms are found in the strata in all
"degrees of perfection, from trails and tracks and fragmentary"
"impressions, to perfectly preserved shells, wood, bones, and"
"complete skeletons. As a rule, it is only the hard parts of"
animals and plants which have left any traces in the rocks.
"Sometimes the original hard substance is preserved, but more often"
"it has been replaced by some less soluble material. Petrifaction,"
"as this process of slow replacement is called, is often carried on"
"in the most exquisite detail. When wood, for example, is"
"undergoing petrifaction, the woody tissue may be replaced,"
"particle by particle, by silica in solution through the action of"
"underground waters, even the microscopic structures of the wood"
being perfectly reproduced. In shells originally made of
"ARAGONITE, a crystalline form of carbonate of lime, that mineral"
"is usually replaced by CALCITE, a more stable form of the same"
"substance. The most common petrifying materials are calcite,"
"silica, and pyrite."
Often the organic substance has neither been preserved nor
"replaced, but the FORM has been retained by means of molds and"
"casts. Permanent impressions, or molds, may be made in sediments"
"not only by the hard parts of organisms, but also by such soft and"
"perishable parts as the leaves of plants, and, in the rarest"
"instances, by the skin of animals and the feathers of birds. In"
"of activity for many aspiring young men. But for my disciples, I call on"
"those very few, who, realising inner call, will devote their whole life"
with strengthened character and determined purpose to take part in that
infinite struggle to win knowledge for its own sake and see truth face
to face.
ADVANCEMENT AND DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE
"The work already carried out in my laboratory on the response of matter,"
"and the unexpected revelations in plant life, foreshadowing the wonders"
"of the highest animal life, have opened out very extended regions of"
"inquiry in Physics, in physiology in Medicine, in Agriculture and even"
"in Psychology. Problems, hitherto regarded as insoluble, have now been"
brought within the sphere of experimental investigation. These inquiries
are obviously more extensive than those customary either among
"physicists or physiologists, since demanding interests and aptitudes"
"hitherto more or less divided between them. In the study of Nature,"
"there is a necessity of the dual view point, this alternating yet"
rhythmically unified interaction of biological thought with physical
"studies, and physical thought with biological studies. The future worker"
"with his freshened grasp of physics, his fuller conception of the"
"inorganic world, as indeed thrilling with ""the promise and potency of"
"life"" will redouble his former energies of work and thought. Thus he"
"will be in a position to win now the old knowledge with finer sieves, to"
research it with new enthusiasm and subtler instruments. And
thus with thought and toil and time he may hope to bring fresher views
into the old problems. His handling of these will be at once more vital
"and more kinetic, more comprehensive and unified."
The farther and fuller investigation of the many and ever-opening
problems of the nascent science which includes both Life and Non-Life
law gives the succession of the formations in local areas. The
fossils which they contain demonstrate the law of the progressive
"appearance of organisms, and by means of this law the formations"
of different countries are correlated and set each in its place in
a universal time scale and grouped together according to the
affinities of their imbedded organic remains.
GEOLOGIC TIME DIVISIONS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF HUMAN HISTORY. We
"may compare the division of geologic time into eras, periods, and"
"other divisions according to the dominant life of the time, to the"
ill-defined ages into which human history is divided according to
"the dominance of some nation, ruler, or other characteristic"
"feature. Thus we speak of the DARK AGES, the AGE OF ELIZABETH, and"
the AGE OF ELECTRICITY. These crude divisions would be of much
"value if, as in the case of geologic time, we had no exact"
reckoning of human history by years.
And as the course of human history has flowed in an unbroken
stream along quiet reaches of slow change and through periods of
"rapid change and revolution, so with the course of geologic"
"history. Periods of quiescence, in which revolutionary forces are"
"perhaps gathering head, alternate with periods of comparatively"
"rapid change in physical geography and in organisms, when new and"
higher forms appear which serve to draw the boundary line of new
"epochs. Nevertheless, geological history is a continuous progress;"
its periods and epochs shade into one another by imperceptible
"gradations, and all our subdivisions must needs be vague and more"
or less arbitrary.
HOW FOSSILS TELL OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE PAST. Fossils are used
"not only as a record of the development of life upon the earth,"
but also in testimony to the physical geography of past epochs.
"relatively small scale, that of the normal monarchic community with a"
variously vigorous democratic element; shaken frequently by civil
strife; wasting much strength in insensate wars; losing much through bad
kings and gaining somewhat from the good; passing painfully from bigotry
to tolerance; getting rid of their old aristocracies and developing new;
"exhibiting in the mass the northern vice of alcoholism, yet maintaining"
racial vigour; disproportionately taxing their producers as compared
"with their non-producers; aiming, nevertheless, at industry and"
"commerce, and suffering from the divisive social influences they entail;"
"meddling in international strifes, till latterly the surrounding powers"
"preponderated too heavily; disunited and normally jealous of each other,"
"even when dynastically united, through stress of crude patriotic"
"prejudice and lack of political science; frequently retrograding, yet in"
the end steadily progressing in such science as well as in general
culture and well-being. Losses of territory--as Finland and
"Schleswig-Holstein--at the hands of stronger rivals, and the violent"
"experiences and transitions of the Napoleonic period, have left them on"
"a relatively stable and safe basis, albeit still mutually jealous and"
unable to pass beyond the normal monarchic stage. To-day their culture
"is that of all the higher civilisations, as are their social problems."
§ 4
"In the history of Scandinavian culture, however, lie some special"
illustrations of sociological law. The remarkable fact that the first
great development of old Norse literature occurred in the poor and
remote colonial settlement of Iceland is significant of much. To the
"retrospective yearning of an exiled people, the desire to preserve every"
"memory of the old life in the fatherland, is to be attributed the"
"grounding of the saga-cult in Iceland; and the natural conditions,"
"enforcing long spells of winter leisure, greatly furthered the movement."

No?
Not even Uncle Paulie?
What did you hear about that thing?
What thing?
The Brooklyn thing?
"No, no."
The guy from downtown.
"The guy there from where Christie used to live, there?"
"The guy who disappeared up the block from Christie, the one they made the beef on."
You know the guy I mean?
His name was Batts.
His people are driving everybody crazy looking for him.
Nobody knows what happened to him.
He came into the joint that one night and then he just disappeared.
"Yeah, maybe ten?"
Ten?
"Yeah, me too."
"But, did you get any flowers?"
I think you know I did.
"I thought it was really sweet, and I was gonna say, if you're not busy, we could hang out this Friday?"
I think I'm free.
"Yep, yes I am."
I'm working on the bar at a local Valentine's disco thing.
"It's under-18s, so it might be a bit lame, but if you fancied keeping me company?"
A date?
"No, Will, not a date."
Just two friends hanging out.
Great.
See you Friday.
It's a date.
"No, it's not a date."
Cool.
"She said it wasn't a date, but we both knew it was."
"Before that,"
"I had to make the most of my new, pointless, shitty manual job."
Hellooooo?
"Will MacKenzie, I'm here for work experience."
"Hello, you must be Will."
"Great to meet you, I'm Jim."
This here's Wolfie and Steve.
"Hi, Jim, hi, Steve, hello, Wolf."
Wolf-ie.
"Wolfie, right, gotcha."
You'll have a right laugh.
Long as you don't mind a bit of blue talk.

Let me see those hands!
Ladies and gentlemen we would lik e to begin boarding Japan Airlines Flight 3 20.

"It's just go, go, go."
"Like, you fly from one place to another to another."
-See you.
-Bye-bye.
think we're very lucky in the fact that when we were touring this time  we get to go to a lot of different parts of the world and you come across a place you haven't been to yet. t's just always so exciting.
-Harry!
"-please, Harry!"
please!
Harry!
This is a little strange.
"This many photographers aren't allowed in the building in, Iike, england."
"Hey, Harry!"

How are you?
You okay?
Let's go.
"Bro, how crazy was that?"
I've never seen that.
That's mad.
That was crazy.
"Like, you know, all I kept thinking was, ""And this is in Japan."""
Yeah.
"AND YOU NEED HELP, AND YOU KNOW IT."
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
IS THAT A TACTICAL JUDGMENT OR A PERSONAL ONE?
BOTH -
"- EVERYBODY I KNOW IS IN DANGER RIGHT NOW,"
EVERYONE I'M CLOSE TO.
WELL...
I'M WILLING TO RISK IT...
IF YOU ARE.
HOW'S MY MOM?

ARE THESE BULLET HOLES?
"YEAH, I BROKE IT IN FOR YOU."
IT'S A SHORT RIDE TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

-Except stop busting my balls.

"-Want to go to the diner, or what?"
We'll go to the diner over there on the boulevard.
-Which diner?
-Rockaway Boulevard. lt's open 24 hours.
-They got danishes there?
"-Yeah, they got everything."
Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.
You hear about the points we were shaving up in Boston?
It's terrific.
Nunzio up in--
I thought he'd never shut the fuck up.
I know.
Pain in the ass.
-Whatta you wanna do with him?
-Chop him up and get rid of the car.
Call me when you get through.
"-Frank, let's chop him up."
-All right.
"-Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker, you?"
-I thought you said chop him up.
"Up at Charlie's, not here!"
"Come on, what are you doing?"
Get the fuck out of here.
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my fucking head!
"Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?"
I just need to connect.
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
"Oh, my God."
Where am I?
Who are you?
I can't stop it.
I don't know who I am.
So I...

"No, no, no, no!"
"No, no, no!"
"Hi there, Billy, how ya doing?"
Glad to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
"Oh, here."
"I'll take it, it's my mom's."
Okay.
"Well, uh, how was your trip?"
Fine.
"Uh, did ya sit by the window?"
Yeah.
"Billy, tell Mike what you saw."
"I don't know, a bunch of clouds."
"Billy, come on, you saw the Grand Canyon."
"Hey, hey, you saw the Grand Canyon?"
"We're going to see the Grand Canyon from the ground, up close."
"Really, it's one of the most spectacular sights in the whole world."
So is Central Park.
Are we going to spend our whole vacation here?
"No, I'm with you, come on."
Wait 'til you see the trip I got planned for us.
- You're going to love it.
- I hope so.
"Listen to me, I'm telling you this city has grown a whole lot since you've left here."
"- I can tell, it's amazing."
"- Oh, yeah."
"I sell some lots, you know."
I sold some parcels out here.
I've contributed to its growth.
- Really?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Big, big lots?"
"- Oh, yeah, oh, huge."
"I love you, and nothing's gonna go wrong."
I won't let it.
"You understand, Diane?"
I won't let it.
"I love you, Bobby."
Hey.
[ Chuckles ]
I have to get back to the club.
Hey.
"Come on, now."
"You don't want me to be late on the night I'm gonna elope, do you?"
"Diane, why do you have to go?"
Why can't we just get out-- Bobby.
"Bobby, I have to go back to the club."
"If I don't, Jessie'll be suspicious."
"Don't you worry, honey."
No man is ever gonna lay a hand on me again except you.
I swear it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay.

Ugh.
"Oh, I do not want this vacation to end."
"Promise me when we get home, we'll only speak French to each other."
"Oh, ce sera comme nous sommes sur notre propre île privée au paradis."
I was kind of hoping for English with a fake French accent.
But of course.
I had such a good time.
Mm.
And you are really sexy.
"You put the ""moan"" in Mona Lisa."
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
"You put the ""oomph"" in arc de triomphe."
Ooh.
You put your hands in my pants at the Louvre.
"I know that that's not what we're doing right now, but it was fun."
Yeah.
It was all fun.
"Yeah, it was."
And you know what the best part was?
What?
No Mansfield.
"I mean, you blew off opening a new office in Hong Kong to go to Paris with me, and your boss didn't even call or e-mail or text."
He fired me.

Why aren't you in uniform?
It doesn't fit me anymore!
He must be a right fucking bastard!
I know what I'd have told him.
He blushed.
You should've seen him.
"Just 'cause I said ""toilet."""
"Is he good-looking, Sharon?"
"Ah, you're joking me."
You know Roland the rat?
"Well, he looks like him, only not as nice."
"He asked me why I wasn't wearing me uniform... so I stuck out me belly... and I said, ""It doesn't fit me anymore!"""
"You were dead right, Sharon."
You should've stuck one of your tits... in his mouth as well.
You should see the state of me nipples.
Jesus.
"Frank Kinsella's a ride, isn't he?"
- It wasn't him.
- I didn't say he...
It wasn't him.
It wasn't his brother.
It wasn't my brother.
It wasn't Bart Simpson.
It wasn't anybody.
"Now get off me bleedin' back, will ya?"
I'm sick of it!
- She didn't...
"- You keep out of it, right!"
"He is a ride, though, isn't he?"
Frank Kinsella.
Bitch.
"What's that that's on, Sharon?"
I want action plans on my desk in one hour.
Stay vigilant.
I'm not losing any more of you.

One of my co-workers died today.
"Geez, peg."
That's too bad.
Right there on the job?
"Yes, it was sudden."
I know how you feel...
blindsided.
Like when my cousin ralphie got hit by a bus.
"Granted, he did just knock off a newsstand, but still."
Big shock.
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Now just pump the brakes right there.
- I got a question.
- Have at 'er.
Then I got a comment.
"Well, let's hear it, good buddy."
"Now, my question."
"When have you ever heard a girl go,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- Well...
- Other than in a porno.
- I don't believe I have.
- Me neithers.
That's because we don't say that.
- Well...
- Not unless it's in a porno.
WAYNE:
Now my comment.
"You see, the way Dary did the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes"" in pornos."
That's the way they do it.
"The girl gets all excited, and she goes,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"Yes, but the way you're doing the ""yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
DARYL:
It is the way they do it.
"They go, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- That's exactly how they do it.

"No, they don't."
What they do is they find a super-high pitch for those first four yes's.

"IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICHAEL."
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
"A LITTLE OF THIS, A LITTLE OF THAT."
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN GETTING YOUR REPORTS FROM YOUR FBI BUDDIES?
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
ANYTHING THEY COULDN'T FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
"IF YOU TELL THEM,"
"THEY DON'T HAVE TO FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES, DO THEY?"
"UH, I..."

"I SAID NICE THINGS, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH."
THANK YOU.
YOU HAVE A JOB FOR ME?
"A WOMAN I MET, EVELYN."
SHE HEARD I WORK SECURITY.
SHE ASKED ME FOR HELP.
I GUESS HER EX RAN OFF WITH THEIR SON.
"WE RAN CHECKS, CREDIT CARDS, AIRLINES, GOT NOTHING."
SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME LEGWORK.
BUT A JOB THAT SMALL -- NOT REALLY OUR THING.
YOU THOUGHT OF ME?
I WOULD CONSIDER IT A FAVOR IF YOU TOOK THE JOB.
AND THE MONEY'S NOT BAD.
MONEY'S NOT THE PRESSING ISSUE.
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
IDENTITY.
NOT FOR TRAVELING?
"MICHAEL, IF YOU LEAVE MIAMI,"
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT KIND OF THING.
It's simple.
"This is our home, and this is my grandmother."
How do you do?
-You're all right?
Need a doctor?
"-No, thank you, I feel fine."
All right.
"Then, go home!"
"In a minute, Grandma, as soon as he's had his coffee."
How does it look?
What would Marco say?
Mark would say he should go home as soon as he's had his coffee.
I'm sorry.
-Who's Mark?
-My fella.
He's coming home from Europe tomorrow.
"I mean, today."
"Rosa, why did you do this?"
Why did you bring me here?
What was your first idea on it?
That I thought you were pretty?
It looked as if they were gonna turn you into tomorrow's headlines.
I thought it might be messy for your wife.
It was awfully nice of you.
Shame on you!
It's 4:00 in the morning.
4:00!
I have to attend a meeting at 10:00.
"I'm supposed to be as sharp as a tack, and as clear as a bell."
But you're not worried about what Mrs. Bourne will say.
-Mrs.
Bourne will be very understanding.

"- Nice thing you did, getting her even."
"- l always get even, lieutenant."
I'll leave the door unlocked.
You can walk in any time.
"Come on, Casey."
"If my laundry is picked up, when can I expect it back?"
Wednesday?
When does the laundry pick it up?
What time?
Send the boy up at 8.
"While you're on the wire, get me Surf 3181."
"Yeah, thanks."
"Hello, Dusty."
Yeah.
"Yeah, my company's gone."
"I'm alone, I think."
What did the world look like when you first opened your eyes?
"Head like a balloon, huh?"
With what?
"Oh, yeah."
What kind of a taste do you have?
Sour molasses?
"Maybe it was DDT. I don't know, I never drank any bef ore."
How's your stomach feel?
Am I checking up on you?
Of course.
"I f orgot to tell you, I don't trust anybody, especially women."
"Look, I got a job f or us."
What time is the top rush hour f or lunch in this hotel?
Park your car in the garage at 1:00 and meet me in the lobby.
Got it?
"Oh, wow, that's a really good question."

"Oh, hi, Meg."
Could you tell Chris breakfast is ready?
"Oh, um, I-I-I think he got up early."
"He, um, said something about a fat kid rally at Little Caesars."
"Huh, it's not like Chris to miss breakfast."
"Oh, don't worry, Mom."
I...
I'm sure he'll be home later.
"Well, I hope so."
We were supposed to go to the library to wipe boogers in fancy books.
I like to wipe mine in Bronte novels.
It's like a time bomb to gross out lonely chicks.
"Oh, Heathcliff."
"Oh, come on."

"Chris, what did you do with my video tapes?"
I had a whole system.
I was trying to find a good movie to watch.
I've never even heard of most of these.
"""Jeffrey at the Park."""
"""Mikey's Scoliosis Exam."""
"""Nephew Somersault Compilation."""

"Oh, hell, no."

Too rich for me.
"All right, that general's out."

This hand's too good to waste on a bluff.
Ooh.
"Is that the lyric to one of yours songs, Joe?"
"All right, I think both of y'all are bluffing."
So here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna see your 10 and I'm gonna raise you 20.
Mm-mm-mm.
What you think about that?
Step up.
Seriously.

"- So, you pull the thing back?"
"- Oh, it looks nice, yeah."
- Did it click?

I don't feel like smiling.

His mind was going in eight different directions at once.
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?
Morrie?
Him?
That's when I knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.
That's how it happens.
That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.
He's a nut job.
He talks to everybody.
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.
"Nobody cares what he says, he talks so much."

Sorry.

wine.
I would say red.
Or it could be white.

"Miss Cross, you have a father in the Navy, Lucas Augustus Cross?"
-My stepfather.
-Have you seen him lately?
Not for a year and a half.
-What's wrong?
"-He went on leave, didn't come back."
He's listed as a deserter.
"Miss Cross, are you sure you haven't seen him?"
I didn't even know for sure that he was in the Navy.
He hasn't called you or written you?
-No.
"-He disappeared from town... a year and a half ago, deserting his family."
"Well, it looks like he's running true to form."

I will.

It's not your fault they can't find him.

I can't keep it to myself any longer.
-Every time I go out in that yard...
-What are you talking about?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!

What are you talking about?

"Lucky for us, our needs are small."

"Come on, let me see the money."
The money.
Let me see the money.
The money.
Keep it moving.
"Come on, come on, give me the money."
"All right, come on."
Keep it running smoothly.
Looks beautiful on you.
Give me the money.
Thank you.
That sure is a lot of milk money.

"Well, what do you need all this money for, anyway?"
"Oh, we're going to buy a pros thetic leg."

"Fi, ifwe go out there without a plan, we're exposed."
She's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
She can come after me.
I'm ready.
Yeah?
- What about Sam?
"- I'm game, Mike."
"What about ifshe comes after my mom, my brother..."
Doug's sonJasper?
It was a passionate affair.
I knew it was wrong.
What am I supposed to do?
"Said she'd kill her husband, I should kill my wife so we could live together."
I just let it go.
I thought it was talk.
"The next thing you know, lo mató, Mr. Garcia is dead."
She did it.
Son of a bitch.
But I'm still thinking that she did it because he was beating her.
-This is when I talked to your detective.
-Detective Kelly.
"Yeah, yeah."
Then she gives me a call three days ago.
"She calls me from prison, right?"
"""l did my part,"" she says."
"""Now you gonna do yours. """
That's why I was upset when you came over.
Now I realize that she's crazy.
She says she murdered him so we can live together forever.
-Your wife knows nothing about this?
-l confessed.
-She knows I'm here.
-You did the right thing.
I had to.
What about if she gets off on bail?
"She's angry with me, the next thing you know--"
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeah.
-M.E.'s office says Devlin's on his way.
-Toxicology?
-He didn't say.
"So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing."

"Oh, yeah, play basketball, it's not like we have a killer to catch."
The clock's ticking.
He's our best lead.
"All right, game's to 21."

Man's in a hurry.
"Okay, since, uh, you're a guest in my house, you take it in."
I got a tip.
"So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is bad."
"Danno, shut up."
"Please, don't call me Danno, huh?"
"- Yo, How long you two been married?"
"- Come on, play ball."
"Okay, all right."
Time out.
Time out.
"All right, time."
"Ahem, you, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"- No, I've played once or twice."
- Yeah?
I could see that.
"It looked like I was watching LeBron, maybe he's just this much better:"
"- Football was my sport, okay?"
- Now you tell me that?
- Ready to quit?
- Yes.
- No.

"My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?"
"# My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# You can't knock it, or rock it, or be-bop it"
# It's an itch you can't scratch Nothing's gonna stop it...
Oh... you're up.
I thought I'd bring you a cup of tea.
"Er... come and sit down, Tom."
There's... something I'd better tell you.
"I'm going to divorce you, Tommy 'cause I want to get married again."
He's...
He's a good man.
He lives in the next village.
He's a plumber.
"Oh, come on."
You didn't think I wanted to grow old on my own.
"Well, speak to me, then."
I'll bring this in to Frances.
She'll probably be glad of a cuppa.
"- Frances, can I come in?"
- No.
Go away.
"Oh, please."
"Hear me out, Frankie, will you?"
I brought a nice cup of...
- Did you listen?
I said no.
- Please.
I just want to talk.
Huh?
Here...
I don't know where to start.
"Listen my words, Michelangelo."
There is one life only.
Hmm?
We got precious gift from Lord God.
"N... no matter if nobody speak your name on television or nothing the Lord God, he know you are there."
Hmm?
"That's why, to him, you never invisible."
OK?
"It's not your fault, Michelangelo."
It's not your fault.
Even if you invite them to come here the childrens choose to come.
Everybody choose what they do.
Mm-hm.
"It's OK, it's OK."
Michelangelo.
Give me that.
"It's, like, my turn."
My mother used to say this about residency--
It takes a year to learn how to cut...
It takes a lifetime to learn not to.
I'm up.
I'm here.
What's going on?
"Uh, Jackson's BP, it's a little down from yesterday."
"No big deal, but if we make a few calls, get pushy, maybe we could get him bumped up a few spots up on the transplant list."
"Dr. Bailey, you-- you paged me 911 at 2:30 in the morning, uh, to chat?"
"Uh, you..."
like to chat.
- You're chatty.
- Not at 2:30 in the morning.
"Look, he's young."
Let's get some vacation time telling them you need to rest since the accident.
"That's that, but what about the wedding?"
Do I have to do that too?
!
I'm sure he'll be back by then!
He will!
"Even if not, I have no intention of doing that."
Should we do a little cleaning while we wait for Se Young?
"I've washed Yoon Jae's body for him, now I have to do that to his house too?"
Forget it.
"When you see Se Young, greet her with manners."
Don't stare at her with lusty eyes.
I'll look at her with innocent eyes.
Where is the vacuum...
Here it is...
It's heavy.
I guess the bag isn't empty.
Yoon Jae's packed his suitcase...?
I wonder where he was planning on going?
He's never mentioned anything...
Where was Yoon Jae planning on going without me?
Yoon Jae...!
Hi.
I've been so worried!
"If something like that happened, I should've been the first to know!"
Hey!
What are you doing?
!
Yoon Jae...
I love you.
Yoon Jae...!
"Seo Yoon Jae, you son of a bitch..."
I need to talk to you.
It's important.
"So, I got offered a job, a couple days ago in Houston."
And I've been giving it a lot of thought.
And I'm gonna take it.
You remember how much we all wanted to get out of here when we were kids?
ANd you guys always had Galveston.
So Wes' lawyer told me that you missed counseling.
So what she's advising me about is....
In Wes' best interest.
That he come with me to Houston.
Get out' my house.
Get out!
Get out!
"Wait, Hollis."
"Jacob's gonna end up in Juvie and you know it, and then what?"
Wes too?
"Next time you come back over here, you'll be bringing him home."
I just want what's best for him.
Travis left 'cause you didn't want kids.
"You never wanted kids, Pam."

I thought he'll do few murders in his life.
I thought he'll get settled.
I wanted to you marry the daughter of Chota Khujli.
But came out useless.
Take your argument at home.
Bhai give me one chance.
No one gets two 4s at one ball and two chances in one life.
Stupid fool like you Laxminarayan is no one else in the world.

"Mr. Monk, are you mocking me?"
In public?
I don't make fun of your job.
That's because I have a real job.
I'm solving a homicide here.
"Well, I have a real job, too."
I'm changing people's lives.
I'm making them rich.
Yeah.
You are not making them rich.
You're not giving them financial advice.
You're just reading little numbers off little white ping-pong balls.
"And if it wasn't you, they'd just hire some other bim..."
Some other what?
Bim what?
Bimportant person.
"Mr. Monk, do you think I'm a bimbo?"
"Look, I know what I do isn't the most bimportant job on the earth, but what do I do for you?"

"No, we're good."
So how long have you two been friends?
"306, 00:24:06,820 -- 00:24:10,689 I'm not suppose really to talk to you any more, so ..."
Oh wait !
I think you got a phone message.
But that's all I'm saying.
Now I got to zip.
You have one new message.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.

I threw out the flowers.

And I'm really done with you.

I want you to leave me alone ...
Um... me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time...
Maybe three years.
What?
You asked how long we have been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes .
Right.
We met in the hospital.
In a hospital ?
Yea.
"326, 00:25:36,910 -- 00:25:40,620 It was that dull hospital over at Lexington."

You ever been to Poughkeepsie?
Huh?
- Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?
"- Hey, man, give me a break."

"I stand not just before you, Anna   but also my boss and father-in-law, Jørgen   and Helene and, of course, the rest of you."
"Anna, we met at Jørgen's firm when it was in the suburbs."
I didn't dare speak to you because you were the boss's daughter.
Then one day you needed to borrow 1000 kroner.
Jørgen wasn't there and so I had to lend it to you.
You'd think he was marrying Jørgen.
"But Jørgen and Helene, I would like   to thank you for the way you've welcomed me into the family."
I know you think it's early for Anna to marry   but please know that it feels very right to me.
"Anna, I love you more than all the world."

"Al, she didn't commit suicide."
She was murdered.
Are you sure that's a bullet hole?
I saw more than a few of these in my last year in med school.
How could the chief of police miss this when he pulled her out of the water?
"Well, uh, maybe her hair was covering it or--"
I don't see an exit wound.
I guess the bullet's still in there.
"Sam, you're not gonna-- Al,"
"I'm a-- a doctor, right?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
"But, I mean, that-- that-- that does-- that doesn't mean-- Well, you know."

"Oh, from the war."
"Well, where's the bullet?"
There wasn't any.
There wasn't any?
Small entrance wound.

Is she about you ?
"Of course she is, look at me."
I'm a hell of a catch.
She's just... honestly she's just a bit scared to take it to the next level.
Anyway.
Tell me about...
Stuart.
We met in the States.
He worked in the building next to the hospital where I was working.
"So, I was seeing him all the time."
I've never thought I'd end up with someone in finance.
But he's just one of those people.
-And Alvaro where is?
-He has been going to get dressed.
-It was looking for to You.
-Goes all good?
"Amigos, amigos."
"I caused that you touched the legs of a woman, eh?"
"yes, thanks, thanks."
"It tell me, how are the low ones of professor Cappi?"
It is very good.
To me it seems to me a callus.
Where is Lella?
"It is enough with that Lella, already you have to us fed up."
"Yet what we are doing by you, by your sexual education."
"Yes, but I want to Lella."
Yours it is a old fashioned sexual education.
"Eh, you watch that ass."
Who is?
"Dr. Laura Bonezzi, the fiancee of Prof. Cicchirini."
-No!
-Yes.
"It is possible that at the most wanker they are, more beautiful they are his fiancees?"
-There am ear my name.
"-Good day, professor."
-What have you said?
"-I have not spoken, you have spoken to him?"
-I no. have spoken to him.
"-I have not spoken, have spoken to him."
"-No, I no. have spoken to him."
-I?
"Who has spoken, that raises the hand."
-He has spoken.
"-I have not raised the hand, professor."
Dear Anna!
"Finally, I've got a nice load back to Berlin and could already be with you the day after tomorrow."
Now it's over!
But...
"As if the Devil were involved, today the car axle broke and now it can take a while again."
Man!
"Well, has she decided yet?"
- She is still here.
"- Well, do you already know how and where?"
Mrs John!
Mrs John!
Mrs John!
...Here...
"Watch out, you'll marvel at what I've prepared for you here."
"Mrs John...please, Mrs John."
But I cannot...here...
- have my child all alone.
Mrs John..
"- But Pauline, be quite calm."
What is going to happen?
I've everything ready here...
At the pharmacy they asked me if I intended to set up a hospital.
You just watch how cosy I'll make it for you...
But Mrs John...please...
I cannot have my child...here...
"All by myself, Mrs John..."
"But I'll be with you, Pauline."
"I and Bruno... and he'll watch over you, day and night."
"Breathe deeply, Pauline!"
Very deep and quiet.
As I read it to you from the book.
That's fine.
"- I mean, it's not good for clothes."
- It's just cheese.
- It's wax.
"It's, like, balled up wax."
"- Oh, the wax."
- I love the happiness of that moment.
- Yeah.
- Look at Jonny's face.
- Yeah.
- John Cho.
- Holla back.
- I love that shirt.
"- I bought that from the wardrobe sale and gave it to Eddie, a.k.a. Jesus Christ."
"- Oh, really?"
You did?
- Yeah.
The hype man knows what you want but he's not sure if you want it enough.
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
This was funny.
"So you just randomly picked this extra to be, like, the guy who loves the band, right?"
I didn't even pick him.
"Our AD, Christo, picked him."
"He said, ""You okay with this guy being the fan of the band?"" I said, ""Yeah."""
- Then the backflip.
"- All of a sudden, he can do a backflip and no one knows it."
Right.
"And it was just something he just did, right on a whim?"
"He said, ""Can I dance?"
"Can I do whatever I want?"" I said yes."
- Look at this.
- And then he threw in the backflip.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothin'.
This is where I was in foster care.
Oh.
Sorry.
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
"It's not luck, I mean..."
"You got out of here because you're very talented, and... people love you, and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I wanna talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding a crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God."
I didn't know.
"No, hey, listen."
It'll--it'll give me a chance to spend more time with my kids.
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
Don't buy all the hot dogs.
Okay?
I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the Cat Lady sketch."
We're two minutes short!
"So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurleen Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
It's Dad's receipt books.
You found Dad's stinginess collection.
I thought Morn threw out that crap.
Aren't you starving?
Are you telling me he wrote down all his expenses?
It's from when he used to wake us up with a whistle.
"""Dad's inspection."""
Cheapskate.
"On July 12, 1980 you ate a Popsicle, Dorona-."
"Look. ""Popeye Popsicle for Dorona, 40 agorot."""
What's a Popeye Popsicle?
I'm glad you've calmed down.
You had me worried with your freak-out-.
What?
You look nice in those undies.
Surprising.
Did you think I sleep in a suit?
You have a cute ass.
- God help you with that sinful talk...
- Why sinful?
Maybe we don't have the same father?
"Who knows, maybe we have a different mother."
Maybe you came out of thin air like Jesus.
"But if I had to choose, I prefer you."
"You're sexier than him, too bad you're gay."
Look.
He stopped keeping track 6 months after I was born.
So what?
Why did he stop?
Did he stop spending?
Maybe he was fed up-
- Right-I was born and he got fed up-.
"Okay, kids, don't try this at home."
(grunts)
What the hell?
Was that real?
"Wait, did somebody hit him?"
(phone rings)
"Yes, ma'am, we'll..."
we'll look into it.
Thanks.
"Hey, Marcus, my niece just called."
"She was watching some live video online, and she thinks she saw this guy get assaulted."
She's worried he might be dead.
"A guy who uses the name ""O.G. Pwnzr""?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's him."
She's not the only one.
911's ringing off the hook.
Apparently he was some sort of online celebrity.
"Whatever happened, it went viral."
Look at the number of viewers.
"30,000 people have seen this?"
Only no one knows the guy's real name or where he was in New York when this happened.
"If he's dead, there's a murder scene out there, and no way to find it."
(grunting)

Hey.
Hey.
No Sherlock?
He wasn't there when I woke up this morning.
"I texted him, but I haven't heard back."
Okay.
"He needs extra oxygen, he's gonna have to spend the night."
"Okay, that will be fine."
"Then, we'll hold off on the film for now, but if he gets any worse... ."
He gets x-rayed.
He says he didn't do it.
"D, I don't like this any better than you do, man."
He wouldn't lie.
"Come on, man."
Did he lie about the tagging?

She should be sobering up by now.

Okay.

Nothing.
"You wouldn't know ""amazing"" if it sat up in your soup."""
This is garbage.
"In fact, that's where garbage belongs."

I wanted a slightly different image so I thought maybe Bollywood Elvis would be good.
"I'd get a butler, but he can be an anteater and..."
my best friend's got four arms.
"Is it the next step from the Boosh, would you say?"
I think for me.
Julian wanted to go off and do some straight theatre and explore that.
I wanted to get hold of the animation side of it.
We'd the Moon and the 2D animation in the Boosh and I wanted to see how far you could take that.
So the guy that I work with did the Moon and animation in the Boosh.
And I met him at art school.
"The brief was to try to make the most psychedelic, weirdest show ever."

Hello!
Look at you!
Hello.
..Sarah Harding!
Look at you.
Hi.
Look at this.
"You two know each other, I assume?"
"Yeah, well, kind of."
Yeah.
What does that mean?
That's rough. I better go.
- ls Sharon here?
"- Yes, and so is dad."
"But he's upstairs lying down, he said not to disturb him."
"He said we should send out for some pizza, right?"
"But of course he didn't give me any money, he's trying to starve us."
Danielle!
"He's just upset, you know, about M r."
Cherski and everything.
- Go get your money box.
- No way!
"J ust lay it out, dad will pay you back later."
- You lay it out.
- l don't have any money!
is there anything to eat?
We're sending out for pizza.
"So, how's your dad doing?"
- How much money do you have?
- None. I'm seriously hungry.
"H i, is Sharon still here?"
"Oh, good. I mean, hi."
- l don't believe this.
- Believe it.
"- Hey, let Brian pay!"
- l don't mind.
- Pay for what?
"- Yes, why not?"
"I mean, maybe he doesn't mind paying for it."
We were going to send for pizza.
"I mean, good. I do have plenty of cash on me, it's no problem."
- What's no problem?
- We were going to send for pizza!
Where have I been?
I've been trying to get here!
"Look, we'll never be able to find her."
If...
"If I walk over there, she's gonna walk over here."
"If I'm on this side, she's probably gonna be on that side!"
"All right, panicking's not gonna help, Shane."
"Hey, want to dance, tough guy?"
"No, I'd step on your feet, I'd hurt you."
"Thank you, though."
"All right, now, everybody up, everybody up!"
This is Eden East!
This place is amazing!
I can't believe they kept this from us!
I knew you would love it.
This is why I brought you here.
Vitality!
"Oh, it is so nice to be out with lots of people!"
Everyone's smiling and laughing.
Don't you guys love this?
It's great.
"In a couple more minutes, I'll just roofie myself."
"I will go get my special Salvadore drink, yes?"
"Oh, yes."
"""Guess I am on my way."""
"""Mighty glad you stayed!"""
Yes!
Yes!
He is so much fun!
"Oh, God, don't even start."
I'm just having fun.
"No, it's just..."
"Oh, you're Watt."
I'm the manager!
- What?
- I'm the manager!
"Yes, I know."
You've just told me.
What's the matter with you?
"Now, listen to me."
I booked a room with a bath.
"When I book a room with a bath, I expect to get a bath."
You've got a bath.
"I'm not paying £7.20p per night, plus V.A.T., for a room without a bath!"
Here is your bath.
You call that a bath?
It's not big enough to drown a mouse.
It's disgraceful!
I wish you were a mouse.
I'd show you.
And another thing.
I asked for a room with a view.
"Deaf, mad, and blind."
"This is the view as far as I can remember, madam."
"Yes, yes, this is it."
"When I pay for a view,"
I expect something more interesting than that.
"That is Torquay, madam."
That is not good enough.
"Well, may I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window?"
"Sydney Opera House, perhaps?"
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon?
Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically...
Don't be silly.
I'll see you around.
"Now, just come on in."
Let's count it first.
Make sure it's all here.
"If you got the money, we're good."
It's all there.
"Just bring it in, man."
Okay?
"I wanna make sure I got my money, so come on in and count it."
"One hundred, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, nine, we're up to a thousand?"
Yeah.
There's one.
"Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, two thousand."
Getting closer.
"What's wrong, Tim?"
You look a little depressed.
"Okay, can we just get this over with, man?"
Just count the money and let us get out of here.
Hey!
"You wanna calm down, man?"
You would think I wasn't the one that got ripped off here.
"Yeah, why don't you call the cops then, Guy?"
"Ooh, good one, Billy."
Three...
Six...
Twenty-nine.
What do you know?
It's all there.
All right.
"It's taken care of and it's all paid up and he don't owe you a dime extra, all right?"
"Billy, let's go."
It's over with now.

His voice is too light.
"And first of all, Jay-Z's voice, man, it's just so fun."
"If he was outside of a haunted house, it would be hilarious."
"He'd be trying to warn people about what's going on in the haunted house, he'd be..."
"""Yo, don't go in there."
"There's a ghost in there."""

"""You serious?"
"""Okay, you're dead."
Bye-bye.
"""Fuck you."
"Ha ha ha ha, yep."""
"""Yep!"""
"""Solange is in there."
"Be careful."""

These are the few we just caught?
What do they have with them?
Silk and red jade.
"Compared to those,"
I think these scums here are worth more.
They look tough.
-Take them away.
-Yes.
Hey hey hey.
Watch it.
What's on your mind?
Eh?
Nothing.
What Prince Ju-Mong has found out... don't you wish to know?
I don't place high hopes on that.
"Now, it seems no one can come up with something good."
The reason I gave him two days is because I know this expedition means a lot to him.
"For us,"
We can always leave it to next time.
"But for Prince Ju-Mong, he can't do the same."
"Compared to the acknowledgement I want from Father,"
Prince Ju-Mong's need of King Geum-Wa's acknowedgement far outweighs mine.
Looks like the scale has tipped.
What do you mean by that?
You used to treat Prince Dae-So and Ju-Mong equally.
Now it seems you're leaning closer to Prince Ju-Mong.
"What you've said, I can't deny."
How should I put it?
"They let him off the hook, but it wasn't easy, let me tell you."
That's great news!
I guess.
You guess?
"Leo, come on."
Ben didn't burn down the school and he didn't get kicked out of school or get anyone else kicked out.
That's the best possible outcome.
It's over!
Congratulations!
"Oh, it's far from over."
He has to get through the rest of the school year without getting in trouble.
He won't get in anymore trouble.
He's not a bad kid.
Dylan's still circling around.
"Oh, another girl will come along and he'll forget all about her."
"(KNOCKING) No, I won't."
Ben!
I heard the good news.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Congratulations!
We should all go out and celebrate.
He can't go out.
He's on restriction.
"Oh, Leo."
Wait.
"I'm on restriction from seeing Dylan, but I can still go out."
"I'm going out with Alice, uh, we're going to go catch a movie or something."
"Oh, are you?"
"Yeah, she's coming over."
I will just be in the kitchen.
"That's okay, isn't it?"
~ Sorry.

"A chance to get yourself a decent suit, John."
She died of leukaemia.
Left me her watch.
"~ I'll be with you in a tick, gents."
~ Thank you.
"What was your gran's name, son?"
Er...
I just called her Grannie.
I would've called her Glamorous Grannie.
This is a Rolex.
"Look, I-I just need the money."
"I'm sorry, son."
Mr Dawson has very strict rules about these things.
"I'm not sure that this really belonged to your gran, may she rest in peace."
"~ What are you trying to accuse us of, like?"
~ Being stupid.
~ How are you today?
~ Champion.
I'm sorry about the smell.
"The working stiff normally has all my sympathy, but this set of work-shy bastards, I could crucify."
I've got rats.
"We'd like to speak to Mr Dawson, please."
He's not in at the moment.
Perhaps I can help you?
Are you buying or selling?
Ah.
There is no Mr Dawson.
It's just a name I can blame when I have to say no.
"People can get, erm..."
What's the technical word?
"I know you don't know much about time,"
But for us it's a big deal.
"But you don't have to worry about time, 'cause no matter what time it is,"
I'll be here to feed you.
- Ms. Levin?

Hi.
I'm Shawn Gilder.
I'm a teacher here in Arizona.
I'm calling to inquire about a former student of yours.
"His name is Mikey Trenton, and he's in the fourth grade."
Mikey Trenton?
I don't remember a Trenton.
Yeah.
"He had a different last name, but he won the spelling been last year."
"Oh, my God."
You must mean Michael Kelvin.
Why do you say that?
You haven't heard about the tragedy?
"No, I haven't."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I don't know if I should say.
Please tell me.
"It was his whole family, and..."
What happened to his family?
They were murdered.
"We never found out how because the police are still looking for the killer, and--"
I'm going to the market.
You got any requests?
A six pack?
"Just kidding, Mom."
"- Good-bye, sweetie."
It's a...
It's the famous line from...
I'll be right back with your order.
"Belinda, I hope you don't mind, but I'm gonna head home."
- We can just hang out another time.
"- Oh, no, don't."
"I know this is weird for you but if you just help me out, we'll get out of here quickly."
- I don't think I can...
"- Christine, please."
Marly is just...
She's looking for an excuse to fire me.
"And I really need this job, so please, please help me out."

"It's going to get a little hairy around here, Lieutenant so we're glad to see you, late or not."
The rest of my outfit will be coming with the heavy equipment.
They set it down right where the work is.
"- How's that, sir?"
- Could you move that jungle back for us?
"Just say the word, and I'll move it to China."
We don't need that much.
Just a clear killing zone.
"- Will do, sir."
- Watson!
Arrange pads.
How many men?
And don't worry.
We totally redo the paint.
In a color of our own choosing.
"Yeah, whatever."
I'm easy.
"Hello, Carl."
"I too, am Carl."
"And this is my son, Carl Jr."
We are all Carls.
Neat.
"Yes, yes."
Remove his brain!
I wonder if you can get the whole thing in your mouth.
"Hey Meatwad, how's the job going?"
"Um, just okay."
"Carl washed his car there, didn't he?"
"Yeah, but..."
But what?
I'm having some reservations about this work.
And some nightmares.
Nightmares?
"There was a time in my life when I thought dancing in front of the car wash would be the only thing I'd ever want to do, but the way these people wash cars..."
I just don't know anymore.
"Well, Carl seems happy with it."
Is he licking it?
"Yeah, he's been doing that all morning, I'm afraid."
"You know, snakes -- in the wild, of course -- have to unhinge their jaw to eat a car."
I think the trouble with you is that you have all that skin around your mouth.
Shake!
What?
He's doing it!
Carl?
"No look now, she... she is back."
She's working at the Windsor Lockwood Clinic.
Why would she come back without telling us?
"If we're gonna start unraveling the mysteries of female logic, we're gonna need stronger drinks."
"The question is, knowing what we know about Jesse do you want to see her?"
"- Yeah, I guess."
- Good!
"I messaged her, she said tomorrow's fine."
Danny!
- Slade!
- Hey darlin'.
Hey Pru.
"Mark, hey."
So amazing to see you again.
"God, how long has it been?"
- 16 years.
- No that can't be.
"You're looking great, really."
So are you.
And I know I am.
"- Not a day older older, apart from... from the grays."
- What?
That's big news.
Are you OK?
"Oh, uh, fine, yeah."
"You know, it's a shock."
Hell of a shock.
We're working to find out more.
"Well Danny felt... and we all felt that since you were there that day, you know, you had a.... you had a right to know."
Well I thought about it a lot.
Every year on that day.
"I always remember the date, every year."
"Uh, can we get a picture please?"
"Uh, sure."
Princess... picture pants here she loves taking photos.
It's a wedding gift.
Especially of hot guys.
"No, I'm just kidding."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I like it.
Mm-hmm.
Um... are they ready?
"Uh, I think so just give us two seconds."
I'll go get Drew.
Do one shirtless.
- Ok.
"Hey, we ready?"
No.
What do you mean no?
Well... we're waiting on Drew.
"Ah, so typical."
Drew left no explanation with anyone.
I guess he felt he didn't need to since he never actually asked Jill to marry him in the first place.
"But as difficult and embarrassing as the day was for Jill, deep down,"
I don't think she was surprised.
You can't push a guy into marriage like that and then expect a happy outcome.
Perhaps at one point Drew did love her.
He just forgot why.
What now?
Do you want to go get some pepperoni pizza?
"Honey, I think she needs something a little bit stiffer than a pizza."
"How about a double Jack on the rocks, huh?"
"Uh, excuse me, Jill, I..."
I've ordered an MRI.
"Don't be silly, Christine."
Only the Chief of Neuro can order an MRI.
You know that.
"That's not true, actually."
What do you mean?
I did it.
At 7:10 this morning.
I signed off on the paperwork.
Surely not in Steg's name?
How do I know what it looked like to the tech on duty?
"Come on, Brenda."
Kingdom Hospital Neuro can't grind to a halt because Steg oversleeps.
Don't look at him.
"Hey, Doc, you're losing it."
"What's up, Doc?"
You should be sterilized.
At least then you couldn't breed.
"Hey, you forgot something, Doc."
Maintenance.
This is where I work.
"Will you try to remember that, Mama?"
"Yes, Bobby."
"You're a bit of a crackpot, I guess."
But I'm very fond of you.
"- I have some work to do up here, so..."
"- Honey, don't worry about me."
I'll be fine.
I know my way around this place like the back of my hand.
"- Mr. Goode, I'd like to report..."
- Johnny's not here.
- I'm just holding down the seat for him.
I was.
"(SHE SCOFFS) Exactly - ""was""."
How long?
(SIGHS) 18 years.
And how many times did you do the dirty on her?
Never.
"Well, it's my life, and actually, I really like it."
"Oh, yeah, so what about the drugs?"
The meth?
"See, I think you've got one... maybe two months before your teeth start falling out."
"Come on, Jenny."
Eh?
"See, the thing is, I don't think you're doing this by choice."
Not really.
That's just a cuddly thought so you can sleep at night.
Nah.
"Need the coinage, rent to pay."
What do you want?
All right.
"Well, I can tell I'm not gonna change your mind, so why don't you just call your mum, let her hear your voice?"
It's not my voice she wants to hear.
She's no different from the freaks that get off on these films.
It's not who I actually am that matters.
It's who they wish I was.
Jen!
- I...
- Tell her I'm fine.
"All right, that's it, the show's over!"
"Come on, show's over."
"Oi, oi, oi."
Jenny Jones...
- Get off me!
Plums out of her damn orchard.
"Come on, call her up."
"Well, I guess I should get back."
Unless you want me to take the rest of the day off.
"No, go ahead."
I'm doing much better.
It was a big help getting out of the house.
"I really should have taken the day off,"
"Too, it wasn't for... what do they say?"
... pressing business.
"I know, Jeff."
I don't mind.
"As a matter of fact, I think I'm going"
Back to work myself tomorrow.
Are you sure you're not pushing it?
"No, it'll be better at work."
"Now, hurry up, 'cause you're late."
I'll finish my coffee.
Come on by tonight?
JEFF:
Yeah.
OK.
OTIS:
"Yes, Ms. Ramsey."
"Like I was telling Richard, during the Depression,"
I used to ride a trolley for a nickel all the way out here
To the end of the line just to steal
Fruit out of your orchard.
[Chuckles]
I bet you were one of the boys who I took a pot
Shot at with my slingshot.
"Well now, what's on your mind, Detective Burris."
"Yeah,I don't-- I don't want to be unconscious on a hospital bed forever, and"
"I don't want to be unconscious on a hospital bed forever, and if I leave the decision up to on a hospital bed forever, and if I leave the decision up to Murph, you know, no matter what"
"if I leave the decision up to Murph, you know, no matter what he chooses, he'll never feel"
"Murph, you know, no matter what he chooses, he'll never feel like he made the right choice."

"Oh,God."
Tonight I was gonna surprise her and take her to a Ronda Rousey

"Wait,what?"

"Wait,what?"
Ronda Rousey meet-and-greet?
"--Please, like I'd bother with that"
Pavel Ivanovich!
It was Vladimir Nikolaevich's order
I just came from his office.
Wish I never did.
Know what he said to me?
--That it doesn't fit the place --Fine.
Let's see if he's in the right place!
Don't get into it!
"--Raya, please connect me with the birdie --Sorry, with whom?"
"Forgive me, my head is all confused."
With my wife.
--Bobylev!
"--Pavel Ivanovich, it's my lunch hour now..."
--Drive me to the city council --Of course.
With pleasure.
I thought I'd run out and find a bumper during lunch
It's in my garage.
"I came there, but I forgot my key"
"--It was in my coat --Hey there, Pavel!"
--I need to see you --Hi.
"Bad timing, come by later"
"Listen, what did you say to my dad?"
That I stole some bar of soap from you...?
Forgot?
I'll remind you.
"May 1943, Boys Village in Amur Region"
My soap vanished in the morning.
In the evening you brought a bottle of booze.
"--What ""Boys""?"
--Where we were demoted together
That girl Manja gave it to me.
"- Oh, great, now I'm all nervous."
- Don't be.
No man would invite you on his motorcycle unless he's ready to make a commitment.
You expect me to believe that?
"No, but you made lying look like so much fun, I thought I'd give it a whack."
"So, um,"
I'm going upstairs to throw out all my booze and not eat these donuts.
"Yeah, it is fun."
Morning.
"Oh, my God, I got flowers."
They're on my desk and you assume they're for you?
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
They're for you.
Hmm...
I wonder who they're from.
I wasn't even going to ask.
I know how much you value your privacy.
It's not signed.
"It just says, ""Had a great time."""
- Molly.
- What?
Are you seeing someone?
Someone I don't know about?
How am I going to help you cover it up if I don't know what you're hiding?
I've got nothing to hide.
But let's not mention these to my father.
"Or anyone who might tell my father, like... him."
"- Hey, Alex."
"- Hey, Stephen."
Alex?
One second.
Um... oh.
I think he was probably just thrown out of the building.
He's got a lovely face.
"Well, he's quite stout, which I actually like."
"Oh, his name's Mr Baker."
I don't know what his Christian name is.
She's gone.
She gave me her hand cream.
She loves you!
"""A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches."""
"Genesis, 32, verse 28."
His name is James.
I imagine you would remember him as Jimmy.
Jimmy?
Jimmy Baker?
Tubby Baker is Jimmy Baker!
Of course he's Jimmy Baker!
The one that jumped down from the the day of the you don't know where he went?
Up there.
"Then I said, ""Catch him up"", so she's run out, looking for you."
Jimmy!

# Enid...
# Come away...
# With me
# All those years I could never feel joy

# I'd lost touch with the wonderful boy
# That I was
Yeah.
"I mean, no."
"No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
- Maybe we should just...
- You're right.
"Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
"No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
Ah.
We have the rest of our lives to talk.
"Yeah, unless he kills us first."
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
"Wow, things are clickin'."
I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in...
in the ball pit.
Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
"So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like,"
"""At this point, I hate you."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, really?"
"'Cause you didn't hate me last week."""
Trevor sounds like a dog.
Right?
"God, I missed our daily dishes."
Me too.
"I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own."
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
"Sir, they're gonna be fine."
They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
"Tío Eduardo, I hear you make a great coffee."
"Well, as a matter of fact, I do, Miss..."
- Santanico.
"- Ah, Santanico Pandemonium."
"That's right, you told me."
Santanico Pandemonium.
- Would you care for a cup?
- Please.
- [coffee pouring] - [Eddie] Santanico.
Where do I know that name from?
"[Santanico] Oh, I used to be in a famous show in Mexico."
And now you wanna kill the CEO of the Browns.
"- Jesus, Eddie."
- Take it easy.
It ain't my lingo.
"Amancio Malvado, the head of the ""Browns,"" as you call him, he deserves to die."
Mm.
"Whatever you say, San..."
That's where I know you from.
"Jesus Christ, you... you got the same name as that chick in that famous Mexican horror flick."
I even got a copy.
You're gonna love it.
What are you doin' over there?
- What?
- What are you doin'?
"Nothing, I'm just lookin', uh, lookin' for a place to put those tapes."
- What's this?
This ain't mine.
- It's nothin'.
"You little shit, you were gonna switch the cases!"
"All right, who are you, sweetheart?"
"- [Richie] Eddie, put that down."
Good.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no."
We're about to get started.
Have a seat.
Please.
So we can get out of here.
"Anna and everyone, we are required to be here on time."
We have a lot of work to do and it's not fair to the others if we're late.
"Yes, it won't happen again."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I thought it might be helpful today if we watch the confession again.
Why?
And I don't know how it happened.
I don't.
"Danny, come into my office, please."
I heard about what happened last night.
That was crazy.
Must've been a horrible thing to discover.
First time I've seen a dead body.
It was shocking.
I bet.
I bet.
Did the police give you any trouble?
"Because if they did, I can take care of it."
You know I've got you covered.
"Thank you, Henry."
"No, I think I'm good."
She'd been dead for a couple of hours.
Ruled me out as a suspect.
"And she had a history of abuse, so they're pretty confident it was an OD."
Yeah!
Snow day means a full day of snuggle time with mama!
- Yeah!

Get it!

Aah!
"- Oh, good."
You're finally up.

What the hell?

"Someone was snoring the day away, lazybones."
"Mom, today is a day that's been gifted to me by the universe."
Please don't ruin it by being you.
"You only have one more college essay left to write, and then you're done."
That has nothing to do with snow day.
Of course it does.

She's a school crossing guard.

The idea that woman is getting drunk on the job.
"Small, innocent, helpless, possibly even frail children in her charge--"
What's happening in there?
"Hey, Frank."

She's gonna kick their butts if they don't stop yapping at each other.

Let's go.
Let's go again.
"Mr. Hoolick, my name is Skeets Powell, and I've been sent to welcome you on behalf of the student body."
"Oh, well, thank you very much, but I'm not..."
We drew lots for you.
"I've got you from 1:00 till 3:00, and then Ann Brown has you from 3:00 to 3:30."
"Joan Francis gets you until 4:15, and then Natalie Lee has you until 5:00."
"Oh, looks like I'm booked solid."
"Yeah, well, look, I'll pick you up in 15 minutes, so don't be late."
Bye!
Bye!
I got 15 minutes yet.
Who was that?
Skeets.
Oh.
(GIRLS CHATTERING)
"Good afternoon, Willy."
"Good afternoon, Aunt Nancy."
It couldn't be.
No.
I hope our amusing little school isn't boring you too much.
A school's a school.
How clever!
A school is a school.
"No man ever proposes unless he's pushed into it, isn't that right?"
It most certainly is.
And with that blond hussy chasing after Ed he's going to need a lot of help to shove him into proposing.
- That's what I keep telling her.
- Please.
"All right, but I know what I'm talking about."
You've got to make up Ed's mind for him just like I made up your father's.
Men being the simple-minded creatures they are.
There are the boys.
I've gotta run.
Much obliged for the butter.
"I'll return you the eggs and bluing, Mrs. Taylor."
"Oh, hello, Ruth."
"- Hello, I'm robbing you again."
"Hi, Ed."
"Hi, Ruth."
"Hello, sweet."
How's everything?
Couldn't be better.
I got to talking and almost forgot supper.
"I'm glad you said ""almost"" because I'm hungry."
- And I'm a man that really gets hungry.
"- Oh, no."
"What you got there, margarine?"
"No, butter."
I borrowed it.
"Butter, huh?"
"Hey, what is this, Christmas or something?"
"Hello, Pop."
"- Hey, get a load of this."
"- Buddy, look at yourself."
- What's the matter?
How do you contact her?
How did you know I'm here?
"I cannot reveal anything, for the sake of protection."
"If I kept the names of women I spent the night with, my phone would need more memory."
What?
"I won't be meeting her in the future, so why would I keep her phone number?"
Such a player.
"You really are the one, really unlucky."
Could it be that...
"You like that woman, don't you?"
Your tastes are very unique!
Kim Yeong...
My name is Kim Yeong Ju.
She's related to a case I'm working on involving Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan.
"You, really don't know?"
I don't know.
Okay.
Fine?
Work hard.
Where is this woman hiding?
Excuse me!
Where are you going?
I see you're limping.
"The clinic doesn't have X-Ray, so I'm going to the hospital."
"Wait for me a moment, I'll quckly bring my car."
Get in the car.
I don't want to.
I'll clean up the mess I made.
Hurry!
Get in the car.
"I will take her, just go."
"Her leg is like that, because of me."
What we're gonna do is we're gonna take them out to the ocean.
You can't set them free in the ocean.
They'll die.
They're freshwater fish.
Okay.
"I hear you, sweetheart."
You are so smart.
We'll come up with plan B. We'll come up with a really good idea.
It won't be sort of kind of good.
It'll be a perfect idea.
You'll love it.
"All right, so we're gonna look at lipstick, we're gonna look at jewelry."
"- Shoes, bags."
- We're gonna...
"Oh, shoes."
- You guys wanna look at shoes?
"- Let's look at shoes, please."
"- Yes, heels."
"- Oh, my God, wait a second."
Wait.

What...?
We're supposed to have dinner with Judge Maynard and Timmy.
"Yeah, okay, as soon as I finish this level."
"No, get your coat on."
It's a three-hour drive to that cabin.
Can't you just cook something here?
Excuse me?
I am not going to cook you dinner while you sit here in your own mess playing your TV games.
"Oh-ho, and the martyr returns."
"Chris, I..."
I think it's time for you to go.
"Okay, I'll go."
"But I want you to know,"
I faked all my light-headedness.
"Mm, good Kool-Aid."
"Whoa, whoa."
Sound familiar?
"Oh, my God, Chris."
"Oh, there you are."
I've been looking all over for you.
Why?
You want to humiliate me with more slave work?
"No, I..."
I wanted to apologize.
I should've never blackmailed you.
I'm really sorry.
And I want you to come home.
I thought you said no one would miss me?
"I said a lot of stupid things I didn't mean, Chris."
But I miss you.
"Thanks, Meg."
"I miss you, too."
"You know, living in that family, we both have pretty crappy lives."
- It looks so good on you.
I've dreamed about this for so long.
- Do you wanna fire it up?
- I can't.
Blair and I have a meeting at Rouge Tomate.
That's cryptic.
Both.
So how are you today?
Miserable.
But at least college will be the fresh start it's supposed to be.
"No Chuck, no Nate."
"- No anybody, really."
- Except Gossip Girl.
- Forget I said that.
- It's okay.
I read them too.
"""Spotted:"

I hope he has so much fun that they have to quarantine him.
- Open your present.
- What?
- It's to remind you of who you are.
- I love it.
I'm gonna put it up on my wall at Brown as soon as I get back from Europe.
Come with me.
I chased a guy for years who wasn't that into me.
And I'm going to a glorified state school.
My mother married an entertainment lawyer.
So I need to just stop moving and contemplate the failure of my life.
"When you're ready to start moving, you know I'll be here."
"Like I said, an open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the lost boys."
They all share the same look in their eyes... the look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."
But an orphan's an orphan.
"Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?"
You ever even been in love?
No.
I have never been in love.
I think this little guy is hungry.
(Laughs)
"Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie."
- I'm gonna get directions.
- I will.
"Hey, man."
How are you?
I've been better.
"Listen, my wife and I... are really lost."
"I'm trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
Why don't you buy the map?
Then I can help you.
Okay.
Okay.
Now your problem is... (Map rustles)
Is you're way up here.
You see that?
"(Door bell chimes) Oh, my God."
- Yeah.
"Okay, ready?"
"Here, give me your foot."
The secret tattoo.
"My best friends Sport, Janie and I thought we should be blood buddies."
But this was so much less painful.
Just remember the rule.
If anyone sees the secret tattoo swift and painful death.
It's... starting.
Here comes... nice Marion Hawthorne.
It's happening.
I can feel it happening.
Good Lord.
It's the dreaded Hawthorne effect.
Oh.
"Good morning, Janie, Simon... and Harriet."
Harri... et!
I got to get to class.
See ya.
See you guys in a few.
Sixth grade.
All the usual suspects are back in action.
"First of all there's Rachel Hennessy,"
Marion's second in command.
The only thing more pathetic than being Marion Hawthorne is wanting to be Marion Hawthorne.
"Pinky Whitehead, the human fish belly."
"If Janie's theory is right, then Pinky's DNA was combined with a pint of vanilla yogurt at birth."
Carrie Andrews thinks she's cool... 'cause she spent her summer vacation growing boobs.

JURY DISMISSAL:
KYLE WADE WHITE MALE A REALLY BIG GUY
What are those?
- Prayer beads.
They're beautiful.
"- Yes, well, it's very important to put your nervous energy into something, huh?"
Do you have any more of them?
Hello?
"- Ginny, thank God."
You need to go to Uncle Peter's house.
Stay there until I tell you to come back.
Visit gross Uncle Pete?
Hard pass.
So did that cute Ryan guy ask about me?
Is he single?
For once in your life just do what I ask.
- What is the matter with you?
Don't give me a hard time.
"Just go to Uncle Peter's house and do not come back to the hotel, okay?"
Just go now.
"Okay, okay, I'm going."
"Hey, Clark."
"Hey, I know you said that we can't use an iPad, but what about an eReader?"
- That's a good question.
I don't see why not.
"- Yeah, there's no Wi-Fi."
"I mean, there's no connection to the outside world, so..."
That's a question for the judge.
I got it under control!
I took a goddamn red-eye to be here this morning.
I'm exhausted.
I hate this fucking city.
You can't talk to me that way.
I'm not a fucking kid anymore.
What the fuck happened to you?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"You're a dead man, you know that?"
It's not the first time I've heard that today.
Stupid fucking cop.
Do you know who my father is?
Where's the little girl?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"For your sake, I hope that's a lie."
"Look at you, you stupid fucking nigger cop."
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where's the little girl?
[cell phone rings] [grunts]
Fuck.
[cell phone rings]
"Rook, did you--did you hang up the phone on me?"
"Is that what you did, Rook?"
I'm afraid Rook can't come to the phone right now.
Who is this?
Does it matter?
Put Rook on the phone.
It's too late for that.
If that's true
I'm talking to a dead man.
So they keep telling me.
Where's the girl?
See who dares call me Fat Pig in future!
Fat Pig!
- Get him!
- Yes sir!
"Oh, it's you who made this sound?"
"Don't look at me, look at the glass."
"Yes, a spy needs to be very secretive!"
So you're Fat Pig?
"No, but I know a Fat Pig is eyeing my 'Beast'."
"So I got you to uncover him, and I found out."
So you've set me up!
"I told you not to look at me, look at the glass!"
What if there's no glass?
Then look at the ash-tray.
- What if I look at the vase?
- lf you like!
Where's the 'Beast'?
- ln my head.
- What?
"The 'Beast' is the formula for an atomic bomb,"
"Meant to have a deal with the American, but got chased about."
So I got you to help me close this big job.
"Oh yes, big job!"
Can you see it?
Very clearly.
- Does it look good?
- Looks great!
You're still looking at the good view?
"Not any more, only at the menu!"
Lucky you!
Why?
"That's what happened to me, stared at the good view too long."
"Zelda, didn't you used to have a crush on Stuart Ramsey?"
Maybe when I was eight.
He might be interesting now.
He's done well for himself.
Practically runs the post office.
"Then why don't you be interested, Ellie?"
"Why, I hadn't thought about it."
[gasping] [giggling]
I hadn't thought about it but I possibly could be.
Zelda's got her hands full with Mr. Sellers.
And Mr. Fitzgerald.
[sighs] Don't you two have anything better to talk about?
"No, this is Montgomery."
[laughs]
"Oh, look, it's Bucky Turner."
[horn honking]
"We see you, Bucky!"
We're gonna tell your mama!
His mother's dead.
"Sorry, Bucky, about your mama!"
[giggling]
Livy:
"I know this is awful to say, but... sometimes I miss the war."
Livy.
You have to agree it was more fun.
"More men, more falling' in love."
Fallin' in love?
"Yeah, fallin' in love, pretty near every night."
- Not me.
"- That's because your daddy didn't let you go to the dances, but Zelda and I, we participated in the war effort."
Doesn't this take the cake?
Milton Grable.
"Apologies, but I am in such a hurry."
Another one'll be along any mo.
"Yes, oh."
You didn't know?
"No, no, I didn't."
"Woollahra, thanks."
Um...
"What do you think you're doing, you bastard?"
!
Give those back!
Have you told the school?
Shit!
Don't let him in!
"No, I don't want my son's head pixelated all over the Sunday papers."
"Crown Street, thanks."
Where are your manners?
He'll tire of this woman.
Boys can't see straight with a hard-on.
No 15-year-old boy is going to tire of a woman shoving perfect tits in his face.
"You need to know that you have ruined his life, OK?"
And you have ruined my life.
(Slams phone down)
His English teacher.
Have you ever had sex with any of your teachers?
"No, neither did I."
You need a hand with the biros?
"When I was a student backpacking, I went to the Prado in Madrid."
Hate art.
I made a mistake of going to the National Gallery once.
Boring as.
"Ah, and with one sentence, 2,000 years of civilisation is dismissed."
Bevan didn't mind it but...
Why don´t you try and go get some rest?
I´m on this.
"(speakerphone) Mr President, Mrs Palmer´s here to see you."
"Send her in, please."
Start waking people up.
Set up a conference call with the cabinet members -
"Homeland Security, fbi, National Health Services."
- We´re gonna need everyone on this one.
"- Yes, sir."
Wayne.
"Sherry, I asked you here to help me, not make things worse."
I did not want you going to Alan Milliken´s house.
"Relax, David. I didn´t go there."
- You didn´t go?
- No.
"When we spoke on the phone, you told me it was crucial that you speak to Julia in person."
Yes.
And I changed my mind.
I spoke to her over the phone.
- About what?
- About Kelly´s disappearance.
I asked her if she would check Alan´s cellphone for any recently made calls.
- And?
- She wouldn´t do it.
"You don´t take no for an answer, Sherry."
What aren´t you telling me?
"Nothing, David. I swear."
What have you been up to if you weren´t at Milliken´s?
- Making calls.
- You could have made them from here.
"Yes, but I didn´t."
I parked on the side of the road.
"♪ if this is all in sight, I don't want your kind of love ♪"
"Oh, I've been on my feet so long, I've sprouted roots."
"Hello, angie, sorry."
"An 8-hour shift, and I got a whole 50 cents in tips."
The war's over.
I thought we were all spending money again.
How was your day?
Would have been a considerable improvement.
I got a bottle of schnapps and half a rhubarb pie.
Let's see which one makes us sick first.
"Oh, sounds lovely, but I was just about to go to bed."
"It's 8:00, grandma."
Come on.
Tell me about your crappy day.
I'm really tired.
M-maybe some other time.
Didn't mean to disturb you.
"No, you didn't disturb me."
I ju...
"no, it's fine."
I know a brush-off when I see it.
Angie...
oh.
"Ah, miss carter, miss martinelli,"
"May I introduce you to our new resident,"
Miss dorothy underwood?
"Oh, call me dottie."
Nice to meet you.
"This place is pretty swell, huh?"
Hmm.
"Seems like one big, happy family."
"No, it's a pleasure to meet you."
I feel a bit...
"- Yeah, yeah."
- Can you...?
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Mm?
It's done.
So are either of the kids' fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abi's dad sends money and a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know."
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe.
I'll need it for the beach.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Not watching porn or playing one of your computer games, Calum?"
- I couldn't sleep.
"- Yeah, me neither."
"When we was in the car, my breathing went all funny."
I couldn't get air into my lungs.
It's panic.
And the best way of controlling that is singing.
"Sing to yourself - it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff."
"Hey, Anthony."
"Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret."
Let's go.
"-Mr Roth, I must take you into custody."
-I understand.
What's your reaction to the Israeli High Court ruling?
I'm a retired investor on a pension.
"I went to Israel to live there as a Jew, in the twilight of my life."
"Hey, Frankie!"
"Come on out, let's play some Hearts."
Frankie!
Is it tyue you're worth over 300 million dollars?
"I'm a retired investor, living on a pension."
I came home to vote in the presidential election because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot.
Jesus Christ.
"Hail Mary, full of grace."
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women.
"Blessed is the ftuit of thy womb, Jesus."
"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners."
Hey!
"Everybody, pay attention."
This is my ftiend Carlo Rizzi.
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.
"This is my stepbrother Tom, and that's his girl Theresa."
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.
Say hello to Carlo.
"He's good-looking, isn't he?"
Yes.
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.
Don't run away.
Just hear me out for two seconds.
"Look, this running has to stop."
How much time could you possibly need?
"This isn't about me, Vic."
"It's about our kids, about them being safe."
Do you honestly think I'd put my children in danger?
"Not intentionally, but the things going on in your life..."
Something told me to run.
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.
This isn't gonna change things between us.
Don't punish them because of me.
"I'll move out if I have to, if that's what it takes."
But I need to know that they're at home where they can be safe.
I don't...
"I don't know, okay?"
I'll think about it.
"Hey, how'd your meeting with I.A.D. go last night?"
Good.
Good.
You ran out of here so quick.
They told me not to discuss it with anyone.
But it went fine.
Anything yet?
- Hi.
I'm Detective Wagenbach.
- All right.
Just a second.
"- Bob, the police are here."
"- Oh, I'm glad you listened to reason."
"- Dad, wow."
"As of tomorrow morning, Julie will be the new Chief Executive Officer of the Newport Group."
"Who needs more champagne, hmm?"
"- Hey, thanks."
- Yup.
- Any Summer sightings?
"- Oh, no, not yet."
What if she doesn't show?
"What if, after all this, she never knows the blood and sweat and-and other people's pee that went in to getting her those tick"
"Well, then you'd be happy for her 'cause you're her friend, right?"
"Totally, yeah."
"Hey, you came."
- Where's Zach?
"- Oh, um, he couldn't make it."
"- Oh, that's..."
That's real... that's too bad.
"Um, let me show you to your very V.I.P. seating."
It's this way.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wasn't planning on coming here tonight.
I'm here for Team Summer.
I'm here for Team Seth.
"So, what do you think?"
- Seth and Summer... star-crossed lovers?
- Or better off just friends.
- Destined to be together?
- Or just too dysfunctional together to make it work.
- I guess only time will tell.
"- Yeah, I guess."
"You want to go in, watch the band?"
You're the best we've got.
Am I really?
"It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, Tom."
"Some of their problems come down to faith their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."
I need out.
I'm unfit.
"Think I've lost my faith, Tom."
Hello?
"Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil."
"Operator, you have got to be kidding!"
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!
Jesus Christ.
Can you believe this?
He doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday.
-Maybe the circuit is busy.
"-Oh, circuits, my ass!"
He doesn't give a shit.
-Why don't you let me--?
"-No, I've got it, Sharon."
It's all right.
Yes.
"No, operator, don't tell me there's no answer."
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome.
"Would you try it again, please, and let it ring?"
Hello?
Yes.
"No, operator, I've given you the number four times."
"Do you take an illiteracy test to get that job, for Christ's sakes?"
"Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!"
Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Okay.
Introduce yourself!
Pleased to meet you.
We got off on the wrong feet.
I didn't know who you were.
"Brother, I have a little party going at the back gate."
Come wet your whistle.
I'm on duty.
I have to guard my prisoners.
Come on?
Are you afraid they'll break out of here when they're barely clinging to life?
Let the new kid watch your post and come with me.
I shouldn't be doing this...
"Oh, it's all right!"
"Kid, stay right here and watch the prisoners."
You got that?
"Chun-su, Chun-su!"
"Chun-su, wake up!"
Water...
Water...
Here.
Here's some water.
I'm sorry...
I caused to you and Chun-su...
"No, it's not your fault."
Baron Huh did this to us.
This is what I get for twenty years of loyalty.
Isn't this pathetic?
But I will not go down like this.
"Baron Huh, that bastard, I will kill him if it's the last thing I do!"
I hope I'm not asking too much of you.
Don't mention it.
Chun-su isn't just your friend.
"Last night in Detroit six people were killed and many injured when army, navy and marines clashed with zoot-suited thugs."
Stores and property were destroyed.
Riots have been reported throughout our country.
MAN 3:
"Come on, guys, you don't want to start any trouble."
(MEN chattering)
MAN 2:
Get your late Times.
"Hey, it's time to be moving, ladies."
Let's get Pedro and get over to the dance and off of these streets.
De volada.

Pedro and Esperanza had a date.

(PEDRO speaking spanish)
"Hey, let's see the finished product, hombre."
"You're gonna like it, esa."
Now you'll always be a part of me.
Chingao!
"Este vato's a fine artist, ese."
It's beautiful !
PEDRO:
Órale.
And so is the price.
"Hey, we better be hatting, ese."
"The streets are hot, hombre."
(SPEAKS spanish) lf you got a problem being on the streets wearing your colors...
(SPEAKS spanish)
"Oh yeah, between the Hearst newspapers and Walter Winchell on the radio, you'd think the pinche war was right here in L.A. , hombre."
Are you all right?
"-Hey, you don't look so good."
-I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report in my dad's inbox.
He keeps everything.
victoria ON PA:
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
Jackson!
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
(gasping)
(sighs)
Perfect.
STlLES:
Look at the dates.
"erica: ""Passengers arrived at the hospital DOA."
"""The estimated time of death 9:26 p.m., June 14, 1995."""
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
(LAUGHS)
"No, I'm sorry."
"Yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Natasha Franks.
Yeah JP shoots her all the time.
What about her?
Ok I just read this it was on CMZ.
"So ""Natasha Franks, German supermodel."
Recently has confirmed reports that she is Three months pregnant.
Sources confirm that celebrity... fashion photographer JP Gio.
Whatever his name is...
is the father.
JP is well known as a Los Angeles savant and has been linked to several Hollywood socialites.
"Stay tuned... as the story develops."""
I'm done.
I'm sorry.
I'm done dating men in this city.
So tired of being the nice girl that always get burnt.
"Wait, wait..."
I mean this guy's a jerk.
No I...
"Hey, Dale."
Hey.
Hi.
Zach.
"You look, you look fantastic."
"Oh, thanks I..."
I cut my bangs.
It suits you very much.
I knew ZACH before he was a rock star.
He was the lead singer of this cool garage band.
"Now he's got four Grammys, and he's a shoe in for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
But to me... he'll all ways be good old Zach.
"Wow, long time no see."
"Ah, this is my friend Hallie."
Fine.
He thinks I'm paranoid!
"I should bring him the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am."
"Come on, let's go inside."
"- Yeah, it's gone."
- I don't hear anything.
Let's go back to your mother's.
- They all right?
- Beautiful.
They're great.
"Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?"
Didn't I tell him?
Yeah.
I need a hit.
Want to see helicopters?
"Come on, I'll show you helicopters."
"I've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you."
My plan was I had to get home and get the package ready for Lois to take on her trip.
"Also, I had to get to Sandy's house to give the package a whack with quinine."
"Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass."
"Then I had the cooking to finish, and I had to get Lois ready for her trip."
- It's Sandy.
What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.
- When are you coming over?
- In an hour.
"- You staying tonight, right?"
- I can't.
I got my brother tonight.
"Come on, stop."
"We'll talk about it later, okay?"
Goodbye.
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy,"
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy, not just 90%."
not just 90%.
You know?
You know?
This is what I'm thinking -
"This is what I'm thinking - pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, we'll shake hands, part as friends."
"we'll shake hands, part as friends."
What do you say?
What do you say?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
I could live with that.
I could live with that.
Lennie McPherson?
Lennie McPherson?
I am he.
I am he.
Phil Scott.
I rang you.
Phil Scott.
- Is it?
"OK, OK, that's..."
that's just the wind.
Donkey!
And apparently it knows my name.
"That's very funny, Shrek."
But I know it's you doing this.
"Hey, I'm standing right here with you, Donkey."
No way.
"This place is not haunted by a ghost, and when the sun comes up, Donkey will be the new King of..."
"It's right behind me, isn't it?"
- Donkey.
"- Oh, my goodness!"
"Well, that's what I'd call a ""knight"" to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say... grab the kids and let's get going.
And that's why we're the Kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
We probably won't see him for a month.
"So, what else have you got in your bag of tricks?"
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
"Oh, very nice!"
I am not happy!
Get your jacket off and get out!
"This season, on Hell's Kitchen:"
How dare you?
"If you don't get out, I'll drag you out."
Really?
It's the one you've been waiting for.
I'm Seaman Robert Epplund.
We were on the Hagen together.
You knew Petty Officer Adams?
"We were friends, yeah."
I just found out what happened.
I can't believe it.
He was doing fine when I saw him last night.
What time was that?
"Uh, like, 11:00 or so."
"His crew was the first section off for liberty, we were the second."
He was in a great mood.
He was going to see his girlfriend.
"Like, totally in love with her."
He kept saying she was the one.
"""The One's"" name wouldn't happen to be Meredith Bilson, would it?"
"Yeah, that's her."
Does she know?
We'll stay in touch.
Thank you.
Thanks.
The director has always been very protective of his family.
That should come as no surprise.
"No, it's not just that."
It's something else.
Can't put my finger on it.
"And you're worrying that whatever ""it"" is may prevent the director from seeking the truth?"
"It's not him, Duck."
It's me.
Family or not.
I gotta do my job.
"Do you have news, Dr. Mallard?"
I was just about to brief Agent Gibbs.
Bridget!
"3 years ago, my heart was broken by you."
"After 3 years, my body and soul are in your hands again."
You can do whatever you like.
May your body rot and your soul burn in hellfire!
"Doesn't matter, I'll die anyway."
But this is the best way to go.
I'll die for my country and all mankind.
What a hero!
Pity no one knows about this.
"You know, I know, God knows and the Devil knows."
The man downstairs knows too!
"Unlike you, everybody knows you're a real whore!"
You think you're the greatest hero on Earth?
I am woman too!
"I know you are woman, a bad woman too!"
I said I am woman!
"You're not just bad, but wicked too!"
Listen:
I am woman.
You...!
What did you say?
"I am woman, answer me!"
I am woman too!
"18 years old girl, like a rose."
"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"
"Woman at 40, beauty most,"
"Man at 40, what a ghost."
"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows,"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
"For all intents and purposes, it already happened."
(INHALES) I mean...
I'm in the room.
I don't look mad or pissed.
(CLEARS THROAT)
The painting's coming out great.
Yeah.
The painting's coming out great.
You probably asked us to do it for inspiration or something.
We're all friends.
And we just need to trust that it's going to be okay.
Fuck!
What the fuck was that for?
(SIGHS) That's for kissing my girlfriend tomorrow.
"T-minus one hour, in case you were wondering."
"Please, stop counting down like it's a fucking shuttle launch."
- Sorry.
- JASPER:
"Yeah, yeah."
I told you Crab Apple was a sure thing.
He just needed a few more races.
"Let's roll half the winnings into tomorrow's bets, and I'll come pick up the rest."
Uh-huh.
"Okay, yeah."
"Um, let me just get something to write on."
I thought there wasn't a bottle in the photo.
That's because it was down here.
"What time is it, babe?"
"Finn, you okay?"
"Yeah, uh, no."
It's this part of the painting-it's unfinished.
I'm clearly about to paint it.
"No, I'll call Mrs. Page myself."
"Operator, would you please connect me with Evelyn Page?"
I don't believe Norman did what you said he did!
2 people saw them.
Marion Partridge has probably spread all over town!
Don't you dare say a word against Norman!
"If you brought your son up with some intelligence, decent principles..."
He has no interest in girls!
He never had.
He never learned about sex at home.
The word was never mentioned.
"-Hello, Mrs. Page."
-Come in here.
-Where is Norman?
"-Outside, just going home."
-Mother.
-You just stay right here.
-What's the matter?
-Norman!
-Come in here!
"-What is it, mom?"
-Where were you today?
"-What is it, mother?"
You were seen at Crystal Pond swimming in the nude with Norman.
"-Oh, that's a lie!"
-How could you think such a thing?
You were seen clearly and plainly by two people!
"We went swimming, Mrs. MacKenzie, but we had our suits on."
And by now everybody in Peyton Place knows about it!
So help me if anything is wrong with her because of this!
I didn't do anything.
"We didn't do anything, did we, Allison?"
I have to continue working or I'll be told off.
They love to play bite the cake.
And we've got games where they can win prizes.
"Niels, Arie's Niels."
I know where he is and what he's doing.
I got the guns.
We can finally kill him.
After 35 years.
I'm out.
-What?
I don't want to kill anybody anymore.
Why so ethical suddenly?
-Suddenly?
It's taken some time.
How many Krauts did you kill in those days?
"20, 30?"
There won't be another one.
Every life's precious.
"-Oh, come on."
"Once, I was going on holiday with my wife."
"We had a blowout, an accident."
Totally messed up.
"When I came to, I had so many tubes in my body, I looked like an octopus."
And your wife?
-Dead.
She had already been cremated when I came to.
And you married the nurse?
A bit of a cliché.
-Yes?
"Well, I've got another one for you."
"When I was laying in hospital, I thought life had to continue."
"I'd never wanted to have children, but ten months later... our eldest son was born."
"In South Korea, there are only five people who know about this."
What's the plan?
Infiltrate Pyongyang.
And take the lives of 30 North Korean generals.
Are you planning to go on the mission?
I can't just give up.
"I will be the one going, you should quit."
You're not alone now.
Kyeong Hee.
Mu Yeol.
"Must have been tiring alone, right?"
I'm sorry.
Please hold this...
"This is our son, isn't it?"
Let me have a look at him.
"Oh, he's really handsome."
"Baby, I'm your father."
I heard that you didn't come out quickly.
Your mother worked so hard.
"Both of you, you are now new parents."
"Ms. Kyung, you've worked hard."
"Kid, she is your sister-in-law."
Thank you for returning safely.
I saw the news.
You don't know how much I was worried.
"Don't worry, I'm all right now."
Crazy guy!
Why would my wife worry about you?
I know that you're as strong as my husband.
"Ah, I'm broken-hearted!"
I need to get married this year at once.
"Well, take good care of sister-in-law."
That's a Palm.
Keep it.
Got ten more on order.
Why don't you crawl on back to your crib?
"Hey, you need a beer, keg's always on tap."
Yeah.
This ain't right.
What's the verdict?
"Well, other than a few hiccups, it's looking good."
What hiccups?
"According to Julien's statement, he didn't see the shooting."
What do you mean?
He was right there!
He says he was in the woman's apartment.
But I wouldn't worry about it though.
It's gonna be a good shoot.
–Dutch.
–Jordan's alibi checked out.
I ran a records check on everyone in Kayla's building.
–Any hits?
–Two: a woman passing bad checks and a Bob Lindhoff.
Bob Lindhoff?
I just had him down here.
"Nine years ago, an attempted kidnapping charge, later dropped."
She's coming to again.
Get in the car.
Hey!
"Hey, I tried to call, but there was no answer."
We went out to grab a bite to eat.
What's up?
I've got a suspect down at the station I was hoping you could I.D.
You mind coming back?
Look!
"Look, my baby."
Those are all places where Daddy's been.
Look.
Where's that?
"In Australia, he travelled by bus."
He saw crocodiles.
"No, Mommy doesn't like them."
Or over in India.
"It was so filthy, he didn't like it either."
"And up here, the red pin, that's where we are, sweetie."
"That's where you and I are, in Daddy's room."
The green pins are where he's going this summer.
"All the way up to the cold, cold icebergs."
"I've never eaten baboon, but I've tasted every other animal."
Take the rancher.
who won't eat Warthog...
My wife made Wiener Schnitzel from Warthog.
"The rancher asked, ""What is it?"" My wife said, ""Wiener Schnitzel."""
His cook was about to tell him what it was.
I said to her.
"""Tell him and I'll slap you!"""
I said we'd tell him later ourselves.
He doesn't eat Warthog.
But he loved it.
I asked.
"""Know what you just ate?"
"Warthog."""
"""No way."
"That was a Wiener Schnitzel."""
"I said, ""See how wrong you can be?"""
'Cause a Warthog doesn't have dark meat like our wild boar.
Problem with the elevators?
"With 2, always 2."
"Hook, did you just see a little girl, in the hallway, maybe?"
I didn't see anyone.
"But then, half the lights are out again."
Abel to Security.
- It's Otto.
- And Hook.
The lights are out in West 1.
And Elevator 2 is acting up again.
"And Blondie, did you see him?"
No.
Flipping a breaker isn't a solution.
It's only a Band-Aid.
Did you see a little girl?
"If kids are wandering out of Paeds, Dr. James is going to be very unhappy."
I have never seen Dr. James unhappy.
There you are.
I've been so worried about you.
"Hon, stay on the lane, okay?"
I hate it when you run on the main road.
"It's October, in case you haven't noticed."
There's no traffic on the main road.
All the summer people went home a month ago...
God bless their pointy little heads.
"Well, still, it makes me nervous, so just stay on the lane, okay?"
- I suppose I could.
- Great.
"- And by the way, you were great."
- So were you.
- See you later.
"- Peter, what are you painting?"
- I don't blame you for not trusting me.
"Look, if it makes you feel any better, the Marta I knew wouldn't be involved in anything like this."
People don't change that much.
"Jacob, where are we going now?"
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get her back.
"If I'm gonna save her, I'll need your help."
Can I trust you?
C'mon.
That's it.
"Shit, c'mon."
Jared.
How'd you recognize me?
From pictures.
Of us together.
Where's Jacob?
"Take me to Julia, and when I know she's okay, I'll call him."
"What would you say if I told you, uh she was still in Italy?"
Then you don't get your money.
"Good old Jacob, huh?"
I shoulda known he'd keep the game interesting.
Where is he?
Is he looking at us now?
Is the girl in Italy?
"No, she's here in Zurich."
I have a taxi waiting.
How long was I with you?
Not long.
You were setting me up.
To get the money.
(speaking German)
How did we get together?
Does it really matter?
I'll go with you ifyou go home.
Go home ?
"Get the hell away from me, you punk-ass bitch."
You're the one don't have the balls.
to walk away from this shit.
"I should have tookyour ass tojail along with mine, man."
"But you didn't, so you do not have to get in that car."
"Malakai, you are so much smarter than this shit."
I know what you can be.
I know what you're capable of.
Let'sjust walk away.
Walk away to what ?
"I'm not you, Derek."
I can't do nothing but what I'm doing.
"I can't go to Georgetown with a 1 0.0 G.P.A., operating on people, doing brain surgery..."
- or whateveryou're gonna be doing.
"- You can, man."
"- lf l can do it, you can do it."
- All I have is my respect.
Andthat's what lgotta go take care of.
"You wanna bail out on me, man ?"
That's fline.
But you can kiss my ass with all your future bullshit.
I know who the hell I am...
right now.
"Kai, man, wait, man."
"Let's go, man."
[CarEngineStarts]
Sara ?
Ready to go ?
Um--
Yes.
Why should my wife make dog food?
We haven't even got a dog!
"Now, look, I could be wrong."
Anybody can make a mistake.
"Well, you certainly are wrong."
I don't think I am.
"But if you want to make sure,"
I'll get Charlie.
He raises dogs.
-(chuckling):
Dog food.
-Charlie.
"Boy, jealousy, sometimes."
I'm telling you.
"Well, it'd better not be!"
"Yes, Mr. Peck?"
"Charlie, do you know what that is?"
I should know.
I've been using this for years.
It's dog food.
(grumbling)
(grumbling)
"You know, Alice, a French name would be cute for him."
"Well, I'll worry about a name for him after I get Ralph to agree to let me keep him."
"I told you, you're worrying over nothing."
"Once Ralph gets a look at that little face, he's got to fall in love with it."
"Well, I hope so."
"You know something, Trix,"
I never realized what wonderful company a little pup is around the house all day.
"You know, this day just flew by."
Sure.
"That reminds me, I gotta be getting back upstairs."
"I grabbed him by the lapels, I said,"
"""This is it."
Your time.
Bucky time.
"Go get her."""
He looked so cool walking over to her.
So brave.
[ Breathes deeply ]
She looked up and saw him and smiled.
♪♪
They were so fast.
[ Whispers ] Jocks always are.
♪♪
It was a half a second before Bucky's pants hit the ground.
- [ Fabric drops ]
- He just froze...
- [ Laughter ] - ...standing there in his little white undies.
The laughs were deafening.
"He turned to me, his eyes pleading for help, trembling..."
I did nothing!
"- I couldn't even get out ""Bucky!"" - [ Gasps ]"
"He turned around and ran, his pants still at his ankles, until he was out the door."
And I never saw him again.
"Until Monday at school, when I saw him again."
But he was different.
He would never be the same.
The Bucky I knew was dead.
And now it's happening all over again.
Not if we stop it.
"I was excited about my prom, too."
I had the cutest vintage YSL jumpsuit.
"And when I got there, the nuns got all weird because my date was a 28-year-old Wall Street banker."
I'm sorry.
No need to be sorry.
It's my fault.
I knew this day would come.
I thought I'd be okay.
"But in reality, I can't take it."
I am sorry too.
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to leave you hanging.
"But there comes a time when we have to choose, right?"
And I just didn't choose work like you did.
Can I ask you to do one thing for me?
"Even if there's no work, call me sometime."
I'll call for sure.
"As soon as I give birth, you'll be the first person I call."
Oh shit.
I can't.
I have to call my dad.
Then I will call you 2nd.
You go do whatever you want to do then.
That photo I have lots of pimples.
Erase them for me.
No hurry.
Your deadline is 2 days.
Beyotch.
Make my boobs a little bigger too.
- Is this man the best you can do?
- When did I have time?
I'm always with you.
Surprise proposal clip of Je and Shane.
Wait.
"You have moment like this too, Je?"
Yes!
Ha ha!
Ooh!
I might have overcooked that.
Ha!
This is amazing!
Once more!
I am a driving god!
"It is a car fit for one, at least."
TYRES SCREECH
So the driving god sped off there at 5mph.
Track days are such big business that there are lots of companies making cars designed for the purpose - racers with indicators so they can go on roads.
This Palmer Jag is one of them.
"It costs £47,000, and that's a lot."
"Don't worry - there are lots of others, which are cheaper."
"# Hey, ooh-wooh"
# Wooh-why
# Hey he-ey... #
That's the stats.
"Now, let's see which is fastest on the track."
"# I don't know what to say, you don't care"
# Anyway
# I'm a man in a rage
# With a girl I betrayed
"# Here comes love, tastes like honey"
# You can't buy it with money
# You're not alone any more
# You shook me to the core
# You shook me to the core... #
Here are the cars in reverse order.
"In 5th place, the Lotus Elise at 1.28.02."
4th: the Caterham at 1.25 flat.
I think someone took my wallet.
You heard Ed.
I gotta get some sleep.
So-
"Come on, Jerry."
Give him a six.
Yes!
Look at that.
He listens.
"You are the man, Jerry!"
Oh!
I'm winning more money.
I'm winning more money!
All right.
"Keep it comin', Jerry, 'cause I'm in the zone and you are en fuego."
I've never seen anything like it.
We've switched tables on him.
We've switched decks.
We even switched chips.
The man keeps dealing winners.
How much has he cost us?
"This guy is up 300,000."
Are you sure the dealer isn't cheating?
Maybe he's signaling the player.
We did a complete analysis.
It's just one of those streaks.
"Well, if he continues on one of those streaks, doesn't it make sense to put him where he's gonna cause the least amount of damage?"
"Yes, Miss Mancuso, it does."
"The people here, do they think about making sense?"
"We try to, Miss Mancuso."
And what's with the Miss Mancuso routine?
I thought you told me that's what you wanted me to call you.
"- I love you too, sweetie."
What's up...?
I literally just walked in the door.
What did I do?
You missed her talent show.
"No, I didn't miss it."
"That's, like, next Thursday."
"No, it was last Thursday."
It was on the school calendar.
What did she do?
She was a flag twirler.
That's a talent?
"She practised for like six weeks, John."
She thought you were gonna be there.
It would've been really nice to have a bit of a reminder.
"- Come on, I'm not your secretary, John."
- I'm not asking you to be my secretary.
"Look, I'm just-"
- I'm trying.
I'm trying really hard to be in her life.
"It's a little late for that, wouldn't you say?"
Have a good day.
Are you mad at me?
Just tell me.
Will you be on that all day long?
"""Yes."" Well, that sucks, because, you know, I thought you would want this, but..."
- Lame.
You don't even know what it is.
Do you really think a bribe's gonna work?
Yeah.
I'm hoping so.
"- We're both adults here, John."
"♪ Weaving the good life for you, sugar ♪"
♪ In every way ♪
[sighs]
"So, what can I do for you?"
"Well, I really need to talk to Topher in person."
- I called a bunch of times.
- Yeah.
He didn't know what it was about.
The hotel.
We had a deal.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
I got the good people of Venice to support the hotel development.
You remember.
"Come on, man."
You were there.
"And in exchange, Topher was gonna... well, I think I was gonna get a house."
[chuckles] A house?
Topher promised you a house?
"Well, not in so-- I know that that's what he meant."
"Look, all you did was... placate a community pressure group."
It was just PR.
[faint chiming]
You know what?
Why don't we just call it an even ten thou and we won't darken each other's doors again?
That's not gonna happen.
"Hey, I went to bat for you guys."
Okay?
I betrayed--
I upset a lot of good people who trusted me.
It's not right to do that and get nothing in return.
You owe me.
"- Oh, you're one of Stoney's boys?"
"- Uh, no."
You staff or intern?
Actually I'm a representative.
Reginald Webster of Delaware.
"Oh, fuck me."
"I'm sorry, Webster."
What can I do for you?
- I'm running late.
- I was hoping I could grab your attention for a second.
- What's the skinny?
"- Well, uh..."
"- I'm late, Mr. Webster."
- I understand a chair's opened up in the committee... and I'd like to put my name forward.
I believe you'll find me industrious and hardworking.
The Judiciary's for senior members.
Wheeling was in for five terms before we let him in.
My hands are tied.
There's nothing I can do.
"Shelly, I've been trying to reach you for five days."
- I left you 32 messages.
"- Well, leave me a 33rd."
- Where you from?
- Delaware.
"Oh, yeah, you were..."
You knocked Emory Bettis out.
Emory used to be in the Thursday night game.
He was always good for a few hundred bucks.
I guess he ran his campaign like he played poker.
I take it you have a predisposition.
"- About the confirmation, I mean."
- No.
I told you Mario's a ciaparatt!
"Daddy, what's that mean?"
"""Rat catcher"", good fornothing."
- What are you doing forus?
- It's nobody's fault.
We're not going to Grandma and Grandpa's in milan?
"You'II go the American school anyway, yourmotherwiII take you, if it were up to yourfather..."
"Then university in milan, you'II become a lawyer, get married and buy a house in milan's biggest square!"
- Or stay here and marry Pina.
- Who's she?
"The daughter of the pizza maker at ""The Reef""."
She's not bad looking.
Know how much herfather puts in his account every month?
Fish sticks!
"Fish sticks, again."
- What's Pina like?
- A monster.
Are you crazy?
Did they see you come in?
"We work at the Post Office, not the CIA!"
"- Quiet, I'm running a huge risk!"
- What?
I've been busting my ass in hicksville for15 years.
Don't shout orwe're screwed!
"help me, orSiIvia won't talk to me anymore."
There's another opening in milan.
In a month the manager in Via valparaiso is retiring.
- I have to get thatjob.
- Loweryourvoice!
- There.
"- There, what?"
Is it him?
It sort of wobbled as well.
They'd come in their triangle car.
"HUMS ""Roobarb"" THEME"
You have had a reputation as what I would call a party animal.
Is that fair?
"I do like a party, yeah."
Who doesn't?
"I've seen you photographed out and about on the Camden scene, staying up beyond midnight."
Is this true?
Ten past one.
That's my record.
Don't you feel terrible the next day?
Yeah.
You mean the day after the next day.
The next day you're still up.
CHEERING You feel good the next day.
"Well, what...what would a typical evening involve if I came along with you?"
"If I rang and said, ""Noel..."" You pick it up by mistake."
"""It's Rob."
Hi.
You came on my show.
"""You said we could go out to Camden together."
It's half six now.
Em...
"""I've left it a bit late."
I've just had my dinner.
"""Where shall we meet?"" Where would we meet?"
I don't know...
LAUGHTER
In a forest.
I'd send someone out for you.
Now your new show is even weirder than the Boosh.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the inmate Benigno Martin.
"This isn't a visitor's day, but let me see."
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
I'm sorry.
This isn't a visitor's day.
"and what's more, the intern hasn't requested a visit."
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.
I arrived yesterday.
Are you a relative?
"No, I'm a friend."
My name is Marco Zuloaga.
"- May I see your ID, please?"
"- Yes, of course."
Can I phone him?
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Good-bye, and thank you."
- 627...
- Wait.

Quiet.
No bombings Tuesdays apparently.
How nice.
Look at this.
It's worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
"But I take it, I burry it in the sand for a thousand years it becomes priceless."

"Men will kill for it, men like you and me."
What about your boss?
Der Führer?
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see him together.
I've got nothing better to do!
Doctor Indy!
Come back home now!
"Next time, Indiana Jones, it will take more than children to save you."
I thought I would find you there.
"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
Marion is dead.
"Yes, I know."
I am sorry.
"Life goes on, Indy."
There is the proof.
I have much to tell you.
"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
He wouldn't go to the hospital.
Of course he wouldn't.
"It's like an anxiety thing, you know."
- He's okay.
"- He's fine, okay?"
I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean to scare you.
"Jesus, Patty."
I'm sorry.
Look.
"Uh, the reason-- the reason why I'm-- I'm here is, um... you seem to be the only person who knows how to ground him."
And he could really use that right now.
"So if there's anything that you can do,"
I just-
- I'd really appreciate it.
Okay?
Why are you doing this?
What do you mean?
This case.
Why are any of you doing it?
It's destroying him.
It looks like it's destroying you.
My mom is acting like a complete crazy person.
"Okay, with all due respect, your mother's not my fucking problem."
Okay?
"And, uh, no one's getting paid for this."
So I don't know why the fuck we're doing this.
"But... everyone needs a reason to wake up in the morning, and it's a pretty good fucking reason."
"I'm having a day, okay?"
Okay.
So... are you in?
- Of course.
That's when they get into trouble.
H i.
M ind if I?
You might as well turn it off.
No. I like it.
This is hard.
We need to talk.
"When I was twelve, my mother gave me my sex talk, I'm not sure either of us has fully recovered,"
- Now that you and Jordan are--
- Oh my God.
"Mom, please."
Angela. I can accept that you have a boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Fine.
A pal.
A male pal.
Whatever word you want to choose.
The point is...
"I'm your mother, and I don't think you're ready."
"- Mom, please."
- l don't think you're ready.
But...
I have to know if this is what's happening...
because I don't think that I keep you from--
"- Mom, I beg you to stop."
"- l need to know that you are using-- l mean, I remember how this feels, I do..."
but it's the times that we live in...
"- Mom, please."
- Honey...
"I know you do not want to think about these things, I know..."
- you think you are invulnerable...
- l don't think that--

"No,mm-mm."
"Not me, not this girl."
"No,mm-mm."
"They're cops,jody."
What is she doing here?
I called her.
She should know what's going on.
"Well,it's coming out of your profits,bob."
"Wait a minute,jody."
That sisal's expensive.
"You need to calm down,mrs.Carvell."
Calm down?
I just found a dead guy in the living room and I am losing money every day.
"Ohand my father just died of leukemia, so don't you tell me to calm down."
"I'm thinking before we open this up, maybe we should rub some vick's under our noses."
I don't think we'll find a body.
Hope not.
Hate that.
Nothing?
"Well,whatever lance corporal finn was planning on putting in here, he didn't get a chance to."
"Mcgee,give me your flashlight."
You didn't bring your own?
It's too heavy.It pulls my pants down.
Now close the door.
To the right.To the right.
Yeah.
"Just,more to the left.More to the left."
-Okay.
"-Okay,hold it."
Yeah.
too small to hold a body.
Big enough to hold a head.
Is that what I think it is?
"Oh,yes."
Gold.
I'm gonna go see if I can get some answers out of her.
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to find Trudy!
Talking to locals is the best way to get information!
"You guys should be doing it, too."
That's a great idea.
We split up.
"That way, we find her twice as fast."
"Shane, with me."
"We shouldn't split up, we should stay together."
"Listen, Dave, time is of the essence, okay, and if we don't find her, here's what else."
"We meet back at the exit in, like, an hour, okay?"
Come on.
Let's go.
"Jason, there's a ton of people here."
"If we split up, we're gonna..."
Stay with Joey.
This place rocks.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm trying to have a good time.
I'm trying to have a party going on.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
We gotta find Trudy.
I don't want to get into this.
"Come on, buddy."
"What, are you dying to be part of the new singles scene?"
Look at all these people.
"They're running around, they're..."
Yeah.
Do you remember that he had scars on his face?
"Oh, sure."
It would look like he was burned.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"This is where your father had his office, right there, where it says tickets, upstairs."
That's 1501.
"That's where he was, right here."
[truck roars by]
(Kahn) The office at 1501 Walnut Street was the last place I saw my father.
My mother would bring me here sometimes after hours and on weekends.
Lou would lean out the top floor window and toss down a key wrapped in yellow tracing paper to let us in.

"Give my regards to King Tut, asshole."
How much time do we have left?
- 45 seconds.
He's leaving.
Turn it off.
- I can't disarm it.
- What?
They've got it rigged.
I got an idea.
I always knew you'd get us back.
"- Yeah, right."
- Later.
"Thanks, Daniel."
You sure you wanna do this?
"Stupid, bloody engine, eh?"
How can one little drink...
I gotta get home or I'll be late.
How about a kiss?
Not thank you.
I could be back in action tomorrow... ?
Bon a fee passengers come on!
Bon a fee passengers to the right.
Catrin?
I got caught in the raid.
Ended up in the big street shelter.
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know if you were safe.
I never know if you're safe.
Oh God!
Look at you.
I'll be alright after a cuppa tea.
They've already ruptured the mains.
"Look, Catrin..."
I want you to go back to Ebbw Vale.
Ellis!
It's the biggest steelworks in Europe.
"They are more likely to get bombed there, than here..."
It's just not the bombing.
I can't afford for us to live here anymore.
"I can't afford for us to live, anywhere."
I earn.
"If I want on my own, I can toss myself in a Paris studio."
I could keep painting.
You don't have to keep me.
I earn!
Your wages seem better off a husband's roof over your head.
That poor woman.
Father?
Yes?
I have to confess that my feelings were very hurt last year at the flower show.
"Ah, yes."
I am extremely sorry about that.
No.
"No, not just by you."
"When I looked at Edie's flower arrangement,"
I realised mine would never be as good.
And I think I've been punishing her for that ever since.
That was very brave of you to say so.
"And God, I am sure, will forgive you."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Father."
"Now, I'll see you back at St Mary's."
I just pray to God we're not too late.
"Me too, George."
Father?
"Good Afternoon, Lady Felicia!"
"Good work, Sid!"
George!
Father.
"How are you, Henry?"
"Mr Lee, the good news is we've got your man."
"Well, woman."
It turns out Iris Lightman did this to you.
Popped into your shed first thing yesterday and slipped hemlock in your teacup.
The one thing I don't understand is why she's tried to fit up George here.
"I've never met the woman, Henry."
"Don't have any thoughts on it, do you?"
I saw her at the shed... ..this morning.
"I'll do the dishes, honey."
You run down to the drugstore and get me tonight's papers.
I wanna see what they say about me.
"Okay, I'll be right back."
All right.
Get all the papers.
[door closes]
[sighs]
98 pounds.
[bell buzzing]
For goodness' sake.
A person has no privacy around here.
Mr. de Mario.
Mind if I come in?
"No, of course not."
My daughter--
"I just saw her going down the street, so I know you're alone."
Yes.
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Mr. de Mario?"
Pleasure?
I just dropped in to give you a little piece of advice.
What about?
About the murder of Clara Nash.
I don't know anything about that.
"Yeah, I know."
But you've got an overworked imagination.
Clara used to tell me how you liked to dream things up.
She thought it was very funny.
Only it might not be so funny now.
I've already told them everything I know... and I didn't tell them anything but the truth.
That's what I'm worried about.
"Oi, don't start."
"Mom, you're the one who wanted us here."
"Listen, you're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all."
What kind of people are these?
-What do you want me to do?
-Do?
What can you do?
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?
Did you know what they were like?
Your father never stayed out all night without calling.
Stay out?
"Daddy never went out at all, Ma!"
Keep out of it!
You don't know how I feel!
How do you feel now?
You don't know where he is or who he's with!
He's with his friends!
Dad!
Will you leave him out of this?
He's suffered enough.
The man hasn't been able to digest a decent meal in six weeks.
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?
We were worried to death!
A married man does not stay out like this!
Normal people don't act like this!
What's wrong with you?
You're not normal.
She's right!
"What's wrong with you, Henry?"
What kind of person are you?
Chat up in the morning!
Death in the afternoon.
You're almost as pretty as my mother!
You should have let me know.
It was easier to take the train!
In which hole did you fall?
It was a woman who was being courted by a gangster!
I spent the night with her.
I don't know where she is.
I came here.
Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?
I lost my luggage!
"My mom's picture, my father's last letter, his tie, handkerchiefs too!"
I don't know where!
"""I loved her""."
That's not the truth.
She touched me... moved me...
You remind me of your father.
"He was handsome, your father."
"You always fall for beauty, especially when it doesn't buckle."
What use are your truths?
Does they wash whiter?
My shirt.
It was the journey.
The night.
The rain... the rain...
"Do you get a kick out of it, or is it just stupidity?"
I kick stupidity?
Stupidity!
"And when your mother came to Paris for the last time,"
I knew I'd never see her again.
I tried to talk myself into believing she was happy.
I thought you forgot about us.
I haven't seen you here in a long time.
I'm not who you think I am.
"Well, when his family disappeared... there was a lot of rumors."
Some said they had gone back to Russia.
Others said there was trouble with their grocery in Little Odessa.
Russian mob controls everything in Little Odessa.
Maybe that's why he joined them.
- How old was he?
- Sixteen.
Forced to live on the street.
You gotta be strong to be a white boy growing up in this neighborhood.
Did he ever mention me?
Your brother's.
He kept it here all these years.
- Was he happy?
- Yeah.
"The last I saw him, he had matured."
Got real serious.
- But he had choices.
- What choices?
- He was alone.
- I'd have taken him in.
He was a strange boy.
You should go back to France.
What you find here could be ugly.
Did he ever mention someone named Alex Bohemia?
But there's a nightclub in Little Odessa called the Bohemia.
"Your vodka, Mr. Suverov."
"Excuse me, I'm looking-"
"Mr. Suverov, you have a phone call."
Follow me.
So j... give me your skates.
What?
Why?
"You've dragged me so far, we're closer to my office than we are to the car."
Take 'em off!
He just wasn't ready.
But me?
I had a message for the small stuff that used to rule my life.
"Hey, Phil."
"Honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
"So, I'm at the beach..."
Long story.
"Anyway, I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor."
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
I'm kind of busy.
"Okay, great."
"Suck it, small stuff."
Why are we stopping?
"For many, a near-miss with death is a wake-up call."
"But when a man misses his own near-miss, he truly sees what he's been missing."
No more putting my dreams on hold.
"Five years ago, I made a bucket list."
It was time to start crossing things off.
Scariest moment of my life.
Ohh.
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you!
"But amazingly, something great came out of it."
I found out how my sister truly feels about me.
"Girls, are you sure?"
"I think about my father, about my mother."
I'm searching in the mud.
- Don't you want to look at me?
- It's difficult.
Tough day?
Was it easier with the gangster's woman?
It was just a reflex.
She loved me.
So one has to be in love to reflect?
It's better for the other one.
- The neighbor?
- Up above.
Do you mean God?
Could it be just the two of us for two minutes?
It'd be too sad.
"But everything's sad, open your eyes!"
I can't see.
"I can see into, but not..."
"And how am I, into?"
Young.
Would you like to visit?
"I can be just as cheap a tart as your tramp, you know!"
No you can't.
You enjoy that?
"You really are fucked up, friend of a friend!"
It's André!
"André, meet my friend of a friend, Léo."
André is a man on the move.
"He's moving in Mom, who's moving him up."
"Forget sweet talk, when it comes to whoring, I'm his bet."
"""But once in America, what will we do?"
"""Monsieur de la Fayette will provide you with instructions!"""
And why things happen this way and not the other.
I think there's no much use in talking about what happened already.
Probably...
You're always trying to explain people what happens to them.
Instead of looking to yourself.
"Once, I was thinking of you.."
And then I got sad.
Then I'm not funny always.
You never put any effort in a better living.
"For example, you say you like living in the field."
Then why don't you move here?
Would you come with me?
Why do you say that?
I'm saying if you'd live here with me.
I don't know.
I told you I may not like the idea.
What does that mean to what we were talking?
Do you love me Sara?
And what did that come from?
I'm asking you.
How I couldn't love you.
You're my father!
And if I weren't?
Imagine for a moment that I weren't.
What a nonsense!
What do I know?
Could you give me a cigarette?
I'm going to bed.
We had a long ride.
Good night.
Bye.
Good night.
"Dale, Baby."
What you do here?
Wow let me guess...
Baby's mama?
Did you just call me a baby?
Baby she didn't just call me a baby now did she?
What?
Don't screw with me slut!
Excuse me?
You don't know her do you JP?
Yeah baby.
This is Dale.
Not anymore you don't.
Bye bye.
This is my first bitch slap but seeing the look on her Botoxed face.
You deserve him!
"Totally makes it worth it,"
I like!
And he's going to put me in his next movie.
But isn't he kind of old?
Aren't you going to have to you know...
Do him?
Probably.
Oh God!
If I have to stand here and listen to this bimbo yap about the blowjob she'll have to give to get a movie part.
I'll pee in my pants.
Um excuse me...
We're in line.
"Um, actually you're at the mirror which doesn't really constitute the line."
Well just go... fine.
I'll give you my number and then you know maybe we can hang out sometime?
You gonna give me your number?
I wrote it before I left.
"I got my mum to send it, as an alibi."
E-Eleanor was right.
It was me.
"I'm sorry, Chris."
You convinced me the first time around someone else is going to have to own up.
"For fuck's sake, somebody please!"
"- Come on, don't go all gay on me."
- Fuck's sake.
"- Please, no!"
"- Man up, fella."
"Do you want the truth, Justin?"
Your brother was a creep.
"- No, that's not true!"
"- Yes, it bloody is!"
A creep!
"A weirdo, all twitchy and desperate."
- I thought you were his friends.
- He didn't have any friends.
No one liked him.
None of us.
So you just watched while Chris pushed him around?
I didn't see the fight.
But I saw Felix.
He was upstairs in the bedroom.
Eleanor was going down on me and...
- Felix was watching us.
- What?
"I was getting a blowjob and Felix was standing in the doorway staring at me, with my dick out."
"I told him to get lost, naturally."
"""Get lost, you bloody queer!"" were my exact words, I believe."
Are you saying my brother's queer?
I dunno.
A bag bag.
Was it a suitcase or an overnight bag?
"Yeah, that's it."
An overnight bag.
"He goes out for a jog, like you said, and then... ..he comes back out with a bag."
What was I supposed to do?
Did anything happen to spook him?
Did he see you?
Of course not.
What?
"If we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers"
"Better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum."
Iain?
What do you mean a runner?
Just took off all of a sudden.
Find him for me.
And then what?
Operation Merlin's all but dead and buried.
"""I want him dealt with, John."
"And this time no guns."""
"John, I finally cracked it."
It's churros.
What are you talking about?
Those Spanish doughnut things you dip in hot chocolate after you've been out all night.
?
?
"So again last night, the wife got a call around 10:30."
It's the husband calling to say good night.
Exactly.
He's always calling.
They must like each other.
Everybody loved Stacks.
He was supposed to do was steal the panel truck and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours out in Jersey.
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.
Morrie...
Have a drink and shut up.
Just because he set this up he felt he could bust Jimmies balls for an advance on the money we were going to steal.
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.
I had everybody working for me.
"Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd."
D'ya have a good flight?
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where'd you find such creeps?
They're not that bad.
"And it's worth it, isn't it?"
is this the same baby you used last week?
"No, that one was my sister's."
This is Deirdra's.
Big yawn.
"She looks just like you, Lois."
That's what the stewardess said.
-Yeah...
"Take it easy, Sandy."
"Come on, Henry..."
Give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.
You got all day.
"Just make it last, all right?"
Take it easy.
-l got to go.
-Where are you going?
Don't start.
He used to scramble around like a goddamn maniac.
Doug flutie?
He's the doug flutie of fire?
"That's funny, dad."
"Hey, flutie, where we you on 9/11?"
"Yeah, doug, where were you?"
"Don't give me that, you know,"
"""if only I knew that you were running into the second tower"" bullshit."
"I only ran in because-- well, because it was the next goddamn job."
"But you, i can't figure it out."
What were you waiting for?
Too much of a goddamn pussy to go in?
"First tower comes down, they're yelling, ""pull out!"
"Pull out!"""
"All I know is if you're a fireman and you ain't carrying someone else and you've still got 2 legs and 2 goddamn feet, you move on to the next goddamn job."
"Doug flutie, my ass."
Doug flutie would have run in.
"No balls, tom."
No balls at all.
"- I was looking for you, asshole."
"- Why, huh?"
- Jesus christ.
- Holy shit.
Don't tell me you were afraid.
- What?
- He was afraid.
- I was worried.
- About what?
- You.
- Me?
"600, 700 fire fighters in there."
Thousands of other people needing to be rescued.
I looked through your suitcase.
How often do you shave?
Once every day.
That's better.
"Well, you're not going to give me away, are you, Mike?"
It's very important to Nancy that you don't.
She'll be in very big trouble if you do.
"Now, why are you dressed up like that?"
"Oh, well, to help Nancy."
"Okay, but why are you dressed up like that?"
To help Nancy.
"You see, I can't explain it now, Mike, except that if they find out, see, that I'm a grown-up man, it can get Nancy in all kinds of trouble, see."
We don't want that to happen.
"So you'll help me out, huh?"
Okay.
Good.
"Do you collect rocks, too?"
"No, not really."
Then what are you doing with this?
"Oh, that ain't mine."
I found this in your suitcase in your pants' pocket.
Oh.
It still ain't mine.
Can I have it?
"Sure, be my guest."
Thanks.
I'll run a test on it.
I'm going to be a geologist.
"Oh, that's swell."
What do we do now?
Let's go.
Let's go.
"Fuck you, Kyle!"
# And you know #
- # We're together at school again # - # School again #
# With all of our friends... #
Aww!
# We'll be doing this forever... #
"Ugh, God, shut up!"
# What a special day... #
"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
# Never #
# Going away #
"Hey, kid, what happened?"
I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore.
"Yeah, well, my Dad blew a gasket when I told him, and then he beat my Mom."
"Dude, what did I tell you?"
You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!
"Mr. Garret, Mr. Garret!"
This kid wants to join the basketball team.
He's really good.
Really?
"Look, I should be getting to class."
"Hey, we sure could use you, kid."
I can never find enough kids that wanna play ball.
All the kids and the school funding goes to the theater department.
You see?
They need you.
"This is fate, kid-- fate."
I don't know.
"Look, just come in at recess and shoot some balls with the team."
"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some balls with the team, Goddamn it."
Okay.
"Hey, that's great, Bridon!"
"Oh, I'm sure he'd never..."
"- No, that does sound quite like him."
Yeah.
And that's why I want him gone.
"You could be his role model, teach him how to beat it."
"No, no, no."
You've picked the wrong man.
I don't think so.
"Ah, Mitchell, my bro."
- Yes.
- OK.
"Brilliant, brilliant."
"OK, I know we all got off to a bad start but I'm thinking if we all pull together, this could be an interesting, enriching and very brief experience for us all."
"Yeah, level with me, Mitch."
How do you stick it with this sad-arse?
I think you need a new wingman.
"I, sir, am a registered poon hound."
"Have you ever actually had sex, Adam?"
"You know, proper balls-deep sex?"
Have you touched a boob?
"Be honest with me, Adam."
Have you ever even touched a boob?
Because...
Ha-ha-ha!
I have.
Loads!
"Ah, someone doth protest too much."
You don't come near me.
"But, Mitch, we're like brothers in arms."
I'll have a Scotch.
This is near me.
This is where I told you not to be.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
"I, um--"
I came to pick out a dress for Hilla's funeral.
And to listen to her records while you read her diary?
"It's, uh, in German."
"Look, Stephanie, I am the coroner."
That doesn't give you the right to go through her things.
She was beautiful.
My camera loved her.
You took that?
It's a hobby I'd hoped to turn into a profession.
Hillie and I were gonna go back to New York together.
"She was gonna be a big fashion model, and I'd shoot all her covers."
She'd have made it too.
"I keep expecting her to walk through the door, you know?"
Hillie understood life better than most people.
Maybe because she'd seen so much death.
That's why I can't believe she killed herself.
Maybe she didn't.
- What do you mean?
- She may have been murdered.
"Oh, God."
Do you have any idea who may have done it?
No.
Everyone loved her.
No one... would want her dead.
What?
Nothing.
It's not nothing.
What are you thinking?
Truesdale fired her.
Do you guys want to go see a movie?
Ooh. hold on. hold on.
Hello?
Check your bank account. your money's back.
It's georgina.
Georgina where are you?
what happened to poppy?
You don't have to worry about her ever again.
You got your money. that's all that matters.
- Now you can go to yale. - well i'm going to n.y.u. now.
Oh. great. then i'll see you next year.
Wait. what does that mean?
Hello?
georgina?
What?
Georgina sparks?
Yes that's right.
I recently enrolled in gallatin.
Here's my paperwork and my check.
Thank you miss sparks.
Is there anything else?
I'd like to request a roommate-- blair waldorf.
She's my best friend and i just can't wait to live with her.
Serena.
Carter.
Aren't you supposed to be in dubayy?
You know you can't lose me for long. where you headed?
Everywhere.
I have something you might want to know before you go.
I hope it doesn't have to do with blair.
No it has to do with you.
It's about santorini what you were looking for there.
I think it was on last month's Power Vocabulary Builder.
I'm serious.
You're the antithesis of him.
"I have never seen 2 people who look so much alike, who are so different inside."
Be careful.
"And so one night in Innsbruck, before the entire Norwegian ski team, he proposed a toast."
Devon?
Are you all right?
You are a stubborn one.
Now we shall begin.
I have the formula.
Good.
One card.
This better not be another 10.
Ten.
"Thank you, michael."
That makes 21.
"I'm telling you, it's beginner's luck."
That's what you said yesterday.
I'm no longer a beginner.
"In addition to which, it's not luck."
The odds in blackjack are 0.6 percent in favor of the house.
"However, if one applies-"
"KITT, I wish your computers had less on odds and more on the key Rita gave me."
"A key from blank stock is extremely difficult to trace, michael."
april's calling.
"Hello, April."
"michael, you've got to come back right away."
"Why, what's wrong?"
It's Devon.
"He went out with an old friend last night, and..."
And what?
- What will I break?
- The head.
Now go to the shrine and pray.
- Shall I pray for something for you?
- Go ahead.
- Shall I pray for a wife for you?
- A wife?
All right.
Even if the wife is 60 years old she should have wealth amounting to one-fourth of 56 crore rupees!
56 crores?
is that all?
Move it now!
Come on!
You speak as if you are a King!
"Do you know, Pooja?"
First you will have to meet my brother at home.
"If my brother approve of you, it will mean everything's okay!"
What if your brother doesn't approve?
"Then you look for another boy, and I will look for another girl."
You are so scared of your brother?
I am not scared. I adore him!
You don't realize what a big person my brother is!
- 6 feet 2 inches.
- l am not talking of his height.
- His chest is 42 inches.
Right?
- You are right!
"I have flicked this jacket from him. lt's great, isn't it?"
That's why it's so loose-fitting on you.
- What did you say?
Loose-fitting?
- Yes!
"-Yeah, right."
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.
"""Have your ex-wife move in."
"That wouldn't be awkward."""
"Imagine, I go away for a few days.."
and my boyfriend is living with a woman he got pregnant.
"So, what'd you tell him?"
You didn't tell Mona Rachel moved in?
She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
"Plus, she got me taffy."
-Really?
I've never had any.
-Ever?
My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
Thank you.
Are you gonna tell her?
I will.
I want to butter her up first.
"I'm gonna take her to dinner, do all this romantic stuff."
When she thinks I'm the best boyfriend ever..
I'll tell her my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
"If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady."
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?
Is it gum?
Is it food?
What's the deal?
"Oh, it's nice."
May I try a pink one?
So I just have to plan the perfect night.
"Hey, what's the best date you ever had?"
"No.No, I meant every goddamn word of it."
You don't want to take back any of that?
Nope.
Nope.
Ok.
"Oh, and, uh, I slept with frenchie."
"I'm sorry, what?"
I slept with frenchie.
And I got the note to prove it.
You're carrying that around with you?
Wouldn't you?
"Jeez, it sounds like the end of the world down here."
"Jesus, he's pounding the leather off that thing."
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
"Yeah, no more spic jokes."
"No, F.D.N.Y. Boxing team."
"We get him in the ring, we get some side action going, pick up a little extra cabbage."
"I mean, with me and you coaching him, we'll clean up."
Whatever happened to no more mr.
"Nice guy, you guys don't give me any respect, buh-buh-buh?"
That's the job.
This is a chance to make money.
"And for that, I will revert back to my happy-go-lucky whore self."
"Just, uh, think he'll go for it?"
Can't hurt to ask.
"Christ, let's let him finish up first."
- You gavin?
- Yep.
- On your break?
"Yes, I know, honey."
Get in the car.
I`m just fixing the license plate.
"Do you see that, kids?"
That`s the St. Louis Arch.
"""The Gateway to the West. """
"It`s over 600-feet tall, and there`s an elevator all the way to the top."
That`s 60 stories to you and me.
"Dad, can we go up on it?"
No.
"Dad, what river is this?"
That`s the Mississippi.
The mighty Mississip.
"""The old Miss."""
"""The old Man."""
"Clark, I think this is the wrong exit."
"What`s the difference, as long as we get across the river?"
clark?
What are you doing?
"Just relax, ellen."
This is so dangerous!
We have no business being in an area like this!
This is a part of America we never get to see.
That`s good!
"No, that`s bad."
We can`t close our eyes to the plight of the cities.
"Kids, are you noticing all this plight?"
This will just make us appreciate what we have.
roll them up!
I`d better ask these fellas how to get back on the expressway.
I wonder if you could tell me how to get back on the expressway?
Fuck your mama!
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa.
But thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants.
I wanna do something for me.
We'll go as friends.
It won't be romantic.
Unless we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie so I can maybe picture you with a backpack.
- What's wrong with my tie?
- I need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
"So I'm the one who does the good deed, and that guy goes off with the girl?"
"Yeah, it's good to be that guy."
Do you go to NYU?
- I'm starting in the fall.
- I just transferred from BU.
Scott.
I'm Dan.
"Nice to meet you, Scott."
Maybe I'll see you around.
We got this for you.
"- I'll take that, thank you."
- What are you doing here?
What I should have done months ago.
"In five seconds, your phones are going to go off with the latest Gossip Girl blast."
[PHONE BEEPING]
She is nothing if not punctual.
- Where even the buffalo wouldn't roam.
Okay.
That's it.
Lecture's over!
Class dismissed!
"Except you, Pierce."
Since you insist on behaving like a dunce... you can cap it off by staying after school.
- Why me?
They were bad too.
"- Yeah, but you're the top Katzenjammer."
"Since I gave Klinger the day off, you can fill in for him."
Here.
File these.
"Ah, the X-rays."
"I should've known he'd file them under ""E."""
"Good morning, Captain."
You people certainly divide up the diddly work democratically.
That's why we're over here...
to make the world safe for diddly.
[Chuckling] I'd like to leave these for your C.O.
It's the names of all the reenlistees.
- How many pigeons did you bag?
- I signed up two fine young men... who realize they have a solid future with Uncle Sam.
Let me see them.
I want to know who to untie.
"""Rizzo, L."" Mm."
"""Klinger, M."" Klinger?"
That one was pure gravy.
Six years.
He wasn't even on the list.
"I'm afraid the gravy's on you, Vickers."
- Klinger is strictly a homing pigeon.
She could have just been saying that so he'd have to marry her.
Got a lot to lose.
Harvard Law School's coming up.
All this one day.
A kid and an unmarried mother... could ruin everything.
I was gonna marry her.
What?
We were gonna elope the night she died.
- I don't believe it.
- Neither do I.
- Hilla broke it off with you.
"- No, she didn't."
"On the Fourth ofJuly, she told you she loved someone else."
"You fought, and she ended it between you."
Who told you that?
Hilla.
In her diary.
"No, that wasn't me."
Not that weekend.
I was at a tournament in Boston.
That's right.
The kid won.
Brought back a real big trophy.
"Whoever she broke it off with, it wasn't me."
Wejust started dating each other around that time.
And you didn't get her pregnant either.
"Next time you come around here with wild accusations, get your facts straight, Melvin."

That's a beautiful melody.
They're so much better than regular bars because worse is better.
"I know, right?"
"They're my favorite, too."
I'm quirky like that.
I've got quirky taste.
I'm a quirky girl.
It seems like we would be perfect for each other.
But really we're terrible for everyone.
ANNE MURRAY:
♪ And though I...
What the hell?
Are you listening to Anne Murray?
"Uh, I am experiencing Anne Murray."
Why?
That music is complete crap.
"Um, excuse me?"
"It's all just vapid, overproduced tripe."
It has no edge whatsoever.
"Yeah, neither does a soft summer breeze, or a letter from an old friend."
I'm pretty sure envelopes have edges.
"Fine, an e-mail."
Dick.
Whatever.
You know what?
I don't care.
"I think Anne Murray sucks, and that's my opinion."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, I'm going to make a believer out of you, Brian."
I am going to show you the true meaning of Anne Murray.
"Don't waste your time, I'm not going to change my mind."
"I don't know, Bri, I can make things happen when I want to."
Just ask my twin brother.
-Your town;
-My town.
"-Oh, maybe you'll do, huh, colonel;"
"Well, it's the same old place, same...."
-l'm gonna leave you here.
-Where are you going;
At Charley's.
Cards are pretty hot for me today.
You better not get fresh with Charley.
He can teach you.
Yeah;
"Charley said you were pretty good at cards, but I was better."
I can take Charley the best day he ever lived with you standing on his shoulders.
"Try it any time you say, colonel."
Any time at all.
I'll bet the women spoil him silly.
-Yeah.
"-Not only the women, either."
Jeff says he can charm the gold out of your teeth.
"How is Jeff, Papa;"
"Well, he's like everything else around here, lost his bite."
JEFF:
Not much like the nightgown you wore when I put you to bed.
"-Oh, Jeff."
"-Ha, ha."
How do you like the way I fixed up your room;
"-Oh, it's beautiful."
"-ls it, though;"
Got my idea from one them magazines.
"-Well, if you want anything, yell."
"-Oh, don't go, I wanna talk to you."
-l wanna know about Brock.
"Maybe I should've listened to you, Seth, and done it the way you said."
"Come on, don't talk like that."
- We're gonna get you help.
- Seth.
"Seth, I can save him."
- No.
- He was right.
This world  ain't the same no more.
[laughs weakly]
I don't even know what that was.
Hey... hey.
I thought I could handle anything you two punks throw at me.
But I ca...
I can't dance on this dance floor no more.
"You were right, Seth."
Time for me to hang up my wingtips.
[sobbing] No.
"You two knuckleheads, you gotta promise me..."
You gotta take care of each other.
[exhales softly]
To Eddie Cruickshank.
Uncle Eddie.
Rest in peace.
[sighs]
"- Richard, say something."
- What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
"Something, anything."
He never got his Shangri-La.
"Son of a bitch would never admit it, but we had more in common than he knew."
"You know, from the moment he took us in, all I ever cared about was making sure he didn't regret it."
"Man, did I screw that up."
"Uh, the ring is like the cloak that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts."
"Yeah, I don't speak virgin either."
The ring-- it makes you invisible.
You're not precious.
"Oh, good, you're awake."
"Look, Ted, there's something we have to talk about."
Boundaries?
Invasion of privacy?
Losing your key privileges?
"It's about the 20-year-old, Ted."
You have to bang her.
For me!
Why do you want me to hook up with this 20-year-old?
I thought I disgusted you.
"Yeah, that was all an act."
"Look, look, look, I love Robin and she's the only girl I want to be with."
But my body is detoxing after years of one-night stands.
"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
"Oh, yeah."
That's okay.
I'll just buy a new dream journal.
What-what-what are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's got to be some pictures of her in here.
Damn it.
No.
Those are all worthless.
"I need some one-night-stand material, Ted."
Oh.
Oh.
Here's your mom.
Then the next thing I knew he had me pinned up against the wall.
It's OK.
Take your time.
He said he had a knife.
"And that if I didn't do what he wanted, he'd kill me."
And he told me to open the door.
And...
I was so scared I couldn't find my keys.
"You're doing really well, Lucy."
He got really angry and... he ripped the back of my dress.
With a knife.
And... he started touching me.
This car horn started beeping.
And he just grabbed my bag and ran off.
And...
I heard the cab pull away.
Can you describe the cab?
"It was green, I think."
Maybe blue.
Did you see his face?
Only for a second or two.
Anything else you can remember at all?
Something that sticks in your mind?
He had these trainers on.
They were white with a blue stripe.
And one of them had orange paint splashed on the toe.
It was on the right foot.
OK.
You've done really well.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Right, if you'll excuse us."
Looks like the fiance is off the hook.
I see eight Rolex boxes.
The guy's got two arms and eight Rolexes?
"Two arms, eight Rolexes and one safe he didn't use."
Genius.
Actor.
I remember running to the door and falling on the ground.
"And thinking,"
"""Why isn't Colin here?"
"""He should be here."""
Do you know where he was?
It's not like I know her name.
Got a friend you can stay with?
No.
I'm just the girlfriend from back home.
So I left The Edison with a buddy around 1:00.
And I just passed out back at his place.
His name?
What does that matter?
So I can confirm your whereabouts.
"Hey, come on, man, you can't actually think that I would..."
That's why I need his name.
Look...
I love Miranda.
All right.
Give me her name.
She's in the business.
I...
It wouldn't feel right to give you her name until my people talk to her people.
You do know I can ask anyone of a dozen photographers who you left The Edison with.
I didn't...
I didn't cheat on Miranda.
Colin cheated on Miranda with Chelsea Sennett.
And then I- I do the rest.
"You know, I'd really like to know how you got me to do this."
You and I both.
What are you thinking?
You're just- You're really-
You're very beautiful.
Don't sound so surprised.
(SCOFFS) No.
"No, I guess it takes a moment like this to wake a guy up, so he can actually see what's right in front of him."
That's our cue.
(GASPS)
(LIGHTER FLICKS)
IVAN: it's amazing.
"Even hazy and out of focus, you can still recognize your own silhouette."
I wondered all day- How?
How is this possible?
"So, Marcus here is going to babysit."
And you-
You're going to take me to see what's over there.
(IVAN CHUCKLES)
I would not have believed you if you'd told me.
Kicks them out every night at 8:00.
Yeah.
What about the daytime ones?
I don't know.
"Since we found it, it's only been doing 'em at night."
What's this?
"Uh, it's- it's the newest one."
Okay-
Okay-
Here's the deal.
Every day you're going to take this photo.
I'm not him.
"Uh, I know that, Aubrey."
(chuckles anxiously)
"He left his wife, he left me."
"You know, I would-- I would never ever do that."
What are you saying?
"I'm saying that... when I commit to something, it's real."
That I'm serious about us.
Did I say the wrong thing?
No.
"Of course not, Aubrey... (sighs) ...but there's a lot going on."
I know.
"And when it's all taken care of,"
I'm gonna feel the same way.
BRENNAN:
"I know this is difficult, Booth, but... (groans) ...you're gonna get through it."
"Yeah, sounds like something Aldo would have said."
He was right.
(Booth groans)
"Yeah, but this is different."
"Bones, he, um... he died... 'cause he was trying to protect me."
What do you mean?
You know that X-ray that we saw in the sound studio?
I know who that was.
There was no name on it.
I looked for that.
He died of a gunshot wound in the head.
Center core.
"3,000 feet away."
I'm the one who made that shot.
That is a ridiculous assumption.
There are other snipers capable...
The house was gone.
It wouldn't be the worst thing to stay here a little longer.
It's comfortable.
"Well, depends on your definition of comfort."
"I mean, Al, I'm hardly ever here."
"It's not for me, it's for you."
Is it?
-Can you get me some lemonade?
-I'll see if there's some around.
-How'd you sleep?
-I don't know.
Whatever you hit me with took me down.
I feel fucking drugged.
"Yeah, well, you were drugged."
-I don't like downers.
-You weren't liking the uppers either.
Yeah.
-I told you not to call my house.
"-Look, I had to contact your family."
You're underage.
That's the law.
My mom's gonna kick my ass.
"I mean, she's freaking now."
But she's gonna torch my fucking ass when I get out of here.
Why are things so wrong with your mom?
I don't know.
You seem like you do.
"She just doesn't get me, all right?"
"She's in my face about my grades, my hair, my friends, tattoos."
All this other shit.
You know?
I can't do nothing right.
"Yes, of course I do."
Humphrey.
Where's your mind?
"You know, I know it sounds crazy, but I actually kind of miss high school."
I miss Blair Waldorf and her daily ego demolitions Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch.
"Even Chuck Bass, who'd get so close to talk."
"Wow, you miss Chuck Bass."
"Well, not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass."
"But, yeah, I think it's safe to say that the nostalgia has officially begun."
"Apparently, the Upper East Side feels the same about you."
"What's up, Dan?"
Vanessa.
Shouldn't you be giving the deputy mayor her coffee?
"Well, I think she'd rather I gave her something else."
"- Yeah, she made a pass at me."
- God.
Is she hot?
"- Actually, yeah, she is."
- You're both disgusting.
"You know, I don't wanna be the guy Gossip Girl made me out to be."
"So, what are you gonna do?"
Go backpacking.
- If you'll have me.
"- Well, it's too late."
- I'm-
- I'm taking someone else.
"- Oh, really?"
Who?
- That's me.
- Him.
"Yeah, we're gonna have a great time, Melissa and I."
"Oh, really?"
Bosnia.
1995.
"The general-- remember, I told you about him?"
The warlord that you had to shoot.
You saved a lot of lives doing that.
I killed him...
"I, uh..."
I killed him right in front of his own son.
He's got allies and family.
This is about revenge.
"You-you can't know that, Booth."
It was just one X-ray.
"I mean, Aldo knew that I was the shooter."
He killed himself so he wouldn't have to give me up.
That's one possibility.
There are others.
"It's the only thing that makes sense, Bones."
"And whoever this is, they're not gonna stop until..."
What should we do?
Just be ready.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
"Previously on ""Somewhere Between""..."
"For one to live, one must die."
"Mommy's coming, angel."
I came back.
To eight days before.
Why am I the one under arrest?
She's the one who attacked me.
He's a trophy keeper.
All I'm asking for is the code to the lock on DeBray's apartment.
These could be trophies he took from the first five victims.
"Hi, dreamboat."
I'm not talkin' to you.
Skeets.
(DOOR CLOSING)
"You want to see me, Aunt Nancy?"
"Well, yes, Willy."
I...
I wanted to have a little talk with you.
Uh-huh.
(CLEARING THROAT)
"I'm rather worried about you, Willy."
Did I do somethin' wrong?
"Oh, no, no."
I don't think so.
"Oh, no, I'm sure not."
"Well, I..."
"Uh, what I mean to say is, well, I don't think you know very much about girls, do you?"
I wouldn't want you to get into trouble.
What kind of trouble?
"It's difficult to explain, but..."
"Well, some people are born girls, and some people are born boys."
I'm glad.
It makes it so much nicer for dancing.
Yes.
"What I'm trying to say, Willy, is that girls are usually more mature than boys."
You have to be careful.
"Oh, you're talkin' about the birds and the bees."
I'm talking about you kissing Skeets in the park.
"Well, can you explain that?"
Not in one afternoon.
"Well, now, it's..."
It's perfectly all right for little girls and little boys to kiss.
"It was my dream, you know."
Free of the goombahs.
Run a charter in the islands.
Eddie was gonna help me.
You and Eddie?
That's a strange marriage.
He was only gonna find clients.
I'll tell you something.
"If I'd met him earlier, I'd never be in this mess."
If only Tino hadn't whacked Eddie.
Know why he was there that morning?
Santos wasn't there to take Tino down.
He was there to get information on the judge.
How do you know?
I was there that morning.
What information on the judge?
"That you get with $1 0,000 and a plane ticket."
Come up with it by tomorrow.
This meeting is adjourned.
Let us bring you in.
We'll put you in the Witness Protection Program.
"No, thanks. I got my own Witness Protection Program."
Morning.
The sharks are already circling.
Another Zapatti washed up.
They fished him out of the 79th Street Basin.
"Victim's hands were bound in a 3-inch chain, ship's chandlery type."
Forensics reveal blows...
... froma bluntinstrument.
Where have you been?
-Had a busy night.
-l'm sure you did.
Give him a little kick in the slats.
Yeah.
Hold on with your thighs.
That's it.
Kind of roll your hips a little.
Roll your hips along with the horse.
You ride good.
"So, I finally got my teaching diploma... and I taught in Cincinnati for a while, and Denver, and..."
"Well, I've been everywhere."
I'm an adventuress.
I thought that was a girl that worked in dance halls.
- No?
- No.
That's a girl who goes on adventures.
How do you figure this day we're having out here?
- An adventure.
- Yeah?
"How do I work into it, this adventure?"
I see a man of the Old West trying to live in the New.
Do you know how raggedy-ass and terrible the Old West really was?
- No.
- lf you spend any time with me... you'll find out just how raggedy-ass it was.
"You love it out here, don't you?"
"Yes, I do."
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Looking for Lee Mendenhour's place.
Two drainages over is a little basin.
Lee is situated on the morning side.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
"Well, I thought maybe."
"By the way Miss, did you know that Kayama-san is driving a bus in Ito in Izu?"
Kayama-sensei's doing that?
"Kayama-san was your teacher, right?"
He went from a famous dancer to a bus driver pretty quickly!
We're eating.
Would you mind waiting downstairs?
Sorry.
I'll talk to you later.
Do you think what he said about Kayama-sensei is true?
"Considering the source, I don't know how much stock you should put in the story."
Takao.
What is it?
I haven't seen you in quite a while.
May I?
There's a seat over there.
That's
- I see.
Your mother is on the second floor.
Did you know that?
Wouldn't it be better to stay away from people like Numata?
He's someone whom I've known since I was a student.
"He's helped me out, you know."
Mother!
Don't hang around with Numata.
He's so irritating!
He's trying to stir things up in the family.
That's not something you should say out loud.
He has the hots for you.
Takao!
Father is coming home tomorrow.
He sent me a letter.
Takao.
Come on!
Teach me.
Are you afraid?
You're right.
Because they're all dead.
All my teachers.
-What time is it?
-What?
We go to the club.
"We go to the club, we'll dance."
"There's nothing else to do, we might as well dance."
"Come on let's go, let's go."
-Are you looking for Adrian?
"-Adrian is dead, it's every man for himself."
"I'm delighted to see you, you don't know how it thrills me."
-You're glad?
-Sure I'm baby you're the man.
I love your sexy body.
-You're freaky.
"-Sure I'm baby, freaky for you."
Let's go to my place.
Come on.
Well now that we've had dinner and coffee and everything...
Why don't you take off your jacket and make yourself at home.
I really should update my notes.
"You're absolutely right, now is ""the"" perfect time."
This is gonna be the fuck of your lifetime.
-I got some coke.
-I don't care about that.
I just want you...now.
"Orgasms, wasn't that the subject we were discussing?"
I think that right now I should study the alien.
I missed it.
I left him with mama before he was two years old.
So that means I've missed four of his birthdays.
So we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about...
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
"I bet Bonnie would be surprised if she knew she had a half-brother over in nigger town, though."
"You know, you really should have some of our baby's cake."
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
Here.
Goddamn it!
I told you I don't want any.
This what you want?
What are you doing?
"This is what you want, isn't it?"
"Come on, cut it out."
Cut it out.
Cut it out!
Goddamn it!
Why did you ever fuck with me?
"Me and my brother's daddy was white, did you know that?"
"Of course, we never knew him."
He had another family.
But that's why I kind of look white.
Because my daddy was white.
"And I guess you figured since I kind of look white, you can fuck me."
What the hell.
I just want to let you know that my confessional is open all week long.
"I'll be there if you need to speak about anything or talk, get things off your mind."
And I um...
I don't mean to have to do this.
It's kind of required.
This is a crisis prevention helpline if you need to talk to somebody about anything.
And this is a poison control.
Probably might need that.
I don't know.
The good news is we have singles night on Tuesdays down in the basement.
We like to dance around.
It's a lot of fun.
I married the church but I dance and look.
"And if anyone has lifestyle changes they might want to reconsider, they can just, oh, come to my office."
"Thank you, Father."
You're welcome.
Thank you.
That's not him.
He's gone.
Let's go see mommy and daddy.
Ok.
"Look, Katie."
It's a bride!
It's a bride!
Come on!
"I'm gonna be a bride one day, too."
This is what my dress is gonna look like.
Like it?
Yes.
Very pretty.
Thanks.
Today's my first communion.
"That's why I don't get no mail at my house,"
- I ain't got money in no bank.
- He's got over 40 grand hidden.
"- Maggie, what the fuck?"
!
- Why don't you give Carlos money?
- ¿Tú estás loca?
- As a loan to get back the bodega.
- Maggie!
- This could be a way out of here.
"You heard what he said, he needs that money."
You were gonna give me that money to open my own space.
"Shut the fuck up, you're family."
Carlos isn't family?
He'll pay you back.
"It's my business, I can take care of it, okay?"
People buggin' out around me today.
"Later, bro'."
"You got a big fucking mouth, and I ain't got no money."
Where did you put them?
Where'd you put them?
"I'm tired of your fucking bullshit game, viejo."
Where are my fucking drawings?
Carlos...
I should be the one that would be making the questions here.
How many gallons of milk did you deliver today?
How many cases of aguacate?
Yuca?
- Plátanos?
Café?
- I don't fucking know.
That's what you should be worrying about.
Or Marie.
"Or me, if you like."
"You know, I don't know how to say this."
I...
"You know, the things I deal with you and me don't have much of a..."
"What you might call ""an experiential overlap."""
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
"Frightened of things that could happen might happen, might not happen."
Fifty years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis I sleep just fine.
Okay.
And I came to realise it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So...
Get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"Ten thousand even, same as last time."
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30 44, five each."
Three pounds should be 48 each.
Who's short?
All right.
"You know, I didn't mean to bail on you fellas, but I've been waiting over six months to get into Canyon Valley."
"And let me tell ya, it was worth it."
I already lost 10 pounds!
In -- in one day?
"No offense, Sheriff -- 'cause you look great -- um, but aren't you the least bit curious as to how you dropped 10 in a day?"
"Well, to tell you the truth, Agent,"
I don't really give a flyin' fudge. [ Chuckles ]
"My husband, Doug, left me last year 'cause he said I loved cookie-dough milkshakes more than him."
Sorry to hear that.
Dean:
"Yeah, Doug's a dick."
You deserve better.
Thanks.
But he was right.
That was a dark time for me.
Whoever said you eat your pain?
Not me.
I guzzled it.
[ Laughs ]
Anyhoo...
I guess I just wanted to feel pretty again.
And Canyon Valley did that.
Only question is...
What are you doing here?
"[ Clears throat ] We're, uh, uh..."
We're undercover.
Yeah.
Sort of got that.
We think that there's a connection between Canyon Valley and the murders in town.
What kind of connection?
Suction marks.
[ Chuckles ]
"It is true that I missed you all day long in that bed, it was endless."
"I tried to forget everything in sleeping, but I couldn't."
Do you know what I kept thinking about ?
about that day that we spent here together.
It was a great day !
Simon !
"Simon, are you alright ?"
"Yes, I'm ok !"
"Are you hungry, Babette ?"
I'm starving !
It's smells good !
What did you make?
It's pork with honney and curry.
That's the curry I can smell.
I've got a bottle of Bordeau.
That sounds great !
It will go well with the meat.
Remind me to buy you some place mats.
You haven't got much tableware.
"You know that Simon couldnt care less, and I hate shopping."
"Never mind, you're such a good cook."
I like it !
You'll have to give me the recipe.
What's wrong ?
I have something to tell you.
I have to leave again.
I am sailing back for work in a few days time.
Just like this.
Yes !
Five weeks.
We are sailing to south Africa.
It is the last time I am leaving for so long.
646.
- And 5 more.
- Here is another 20.
Plus 3.
The change they gave me when I bought the fur coats.
And you said it wasn't a good idea to buy them.
- Mr. Dürchlich?
"- Well, yes."
"You use the pencil as a phone, but still, you don't have the money for the hotel."
What can I say?
Nice prospects.
"Well, we'll surely cover the rest somehow."
How much are you still missing?
- 54.
- That's nothing.
That's right!
-You've got to do it someday.
"-Yeah, but how?"
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me.
It's called marriage.
-Wouldn't that just bowl him over?
-I'm sure it would.
And me too.
But... don't think of doing it just to bowl him over.
"Betty, you're the only girl I've ever wanted."
Rodney...
"Rodney, not that way..."
What good is life if I go through it not having guts to do it my way?
Rodney... I've really loved you for such a long time.
It must take a lot of patience to make something so beautiful.
That's what they tell me.
He picked up your brother because... you were crying.
He saw my distress and offered me money.
He said it was a good family.
"Oh, God!"
What have I done?
You survived.
Made a home for me.
You did what you had to do.
I don't blame you.
You should've told me.
I know.
"Can you remember his name, the lawyer?"
Why?
"Somebody killed him, Mother."
He was trying to come home.
They killed him.
"Alain, please."
Can you remember his name?
Etienne St. Denis.
He had an office in Place Pigalie in Paris.
Parents always lie to their children... to prepare them for the way they'll be treated later by the government.
Maybe I'm wasting my time.
"But if I don't go now, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."
What do you gain?
You only open old wounds.
The lawyer can't bring him back.
My brother was adopted.
"If I can find his family, I can learn about him."
Kind of get to know him.
The lawyer's office is on the sixth floor.
"Remember, I'll do the talking."
Okay?
Or else one day your scream will kill me.
Look..
"look brother, my heart is beating so fast."
"Forgive me, Airport my friend, but.."
"No brother, today I will have to.."
..tell you what your problem is.
Why do you have such dreams?
What else ajobIess person do otherthan have dreams?
till my dreams dont come true these..
..dreams will keep on following me.
Oh this means I will have to get you ajob.
"Come brother, I will talk to my producer about you today."
And get you ajob of spot boy.
Which hero is shooting over here?
"Hey forget about the hero, the producer and.."
..director Mr. N. Chandra is coming.
-Okay.
call him sir and fall on his feet.
But why should I call him sir?
Because this is how you greet here!
Come on!
-Sir!
What is it?
"-Sir, that.. he is Krishna."
"He is a very hard working boy, sir."
He wants a spot boysjob.
"Its a small thing, keep him."
Why do you need to ask me?
"You have done me a huge favour, sir."
Sir..
- He gave me a house to stay.
I had my clothes with me and you..
"California, here we come!"
"Dinoco, here we come!"
"Oh... oh... uh, I needed this."
Hello?
"Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine?"
"Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?"
And it is such an honor to be your agent that it almost hurts me to take ten percent of your winnings.
Merchandising.
And ancillary rights in perpetuity.
"Anyway, what a race, champ!"
"I didn't see it, but I heard you were great."
"Thanks, Harv."
"Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali."
I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.
"- You let Harv rock it for you, baby."
- Right.
Friends.
"Yes, there's..."
"OK, I get it, Mr. Popular."
So many you can't even narrow it down.
"Hey, when you get to town, you better make time for your best friend!"
Break bread with your mishpocheh here!
That'd be great!
We should totally...
"OK, I gotta jump, kid."
Let me know how it goes.
I'm out.
What?
A minivan?
"Come on, you're in the slow lane."
This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling here.
How?
I killed the people that fucked me.
"That's it, if you fuck me you'll die."
"Come on, baby!"
"No, it's true!"
It's not true.
I'm serious.
I'm serious too.
Hey you!
How many people want me see me fuck Margaret and not die?
It's too much Adrian
Lay off!
There's something very strange going on here.
I'm going to leave.
Right there's something strange going on here.
I bet you 300$ that I can fuck Margaret and not die.
Of course she won't die.
But I'm not sure watching you fuck is worth 300$.
But it sure sounds interesting.
I'd like to watch but I'm not sure Margaret's in the mood.
Adrian!
"You should stay away from me, I'm a killer."
"You like to fuck, baby, better than anything in the world."
I don't want you!
Why not?
Because I'm killing all the people that I fuck.
"You kill me bitch, that's the joke of all time."
Adrian...
Leave me alone.
You like it honey?
You like it...
"Don't do it, Adrian."
I need to know what happened.
"So... there's no party and it's just us, and what, this is some sort of set up?"
You're his friends.
I thought you might be able to help.
"- Come on, Paul."
We're going.
- I can't drive.
I'm pissed.
There was a party at the end of the summer term.
I think something might have happened there.
"He topped himself, mate."
It's sad but it happens.
I don't see what we can do about it.
And you shouldn't have got us to come here under false pretenses.
That's just out of order.
This was in his pocket.
Did any of you send it?
This is the key.
This is what drove him to it.
"""Truth or Dare, bitch!"""
What does this mean?
"I mean, you're his friends, you must have some idea."
I've heard enough of this.
I'm leaving.
Who's coming?
- But we can't take the cars.
"- Yeah, well, we can take our chances."
"I'm not finish yet, Chris."
"Well, I am."
Step aside.
I can't do that.
"- Oh, my God!"
Simon!
I'm coming!
Why is he being like that?
He's just drunk.
He'll come round.
LOVE
The perfect girlfriend would be...
Sweet and loving...
Back you up even in bad times.
Love...
I don't know if I've tried it...
"Well, of course I love all my friends."
I love mum and dad.
But real passion... no.
There's status in having the right boyfriend.
It gives you status.
If you're rich with loads of money it isn't cool to have a poor boyfriend.
A student on a... grant or whatever they go on.
The boys have most of the say.
It's always been like that among people like us.
They make the money.
She has to look good.
Of course she has to be nice.
If I'm going to marry her and have kids   and a joint bank account and all that shit   she's got to be nice.
- Is Sofie OK?
- Ask her.
- What happened?
- He doesn't want to discuss it.
- My sister's in a porn mag.
- Where can I get a copy?
- At the kiosk.
- You sisters are so fucked up.
- Hey.
- Hey.
"I don't know whose day's been worse, yours or mine."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You?
I never thought I'd see something like that.
It's different when they roll in on a gurney.
"Yeah, but you stepped up."
That's all that counts.
I did my job.
At least we saved one of them.
- So I heard she gave an ID.
- Partial one.
I filled in some details.
"What, you saw the guys?"
A glimpse as they drove off.
"- They were black, huh?"
- I think so.
You think so?
"Well, it was quick, you know?"
But- And I only saw one of them.
So that's why the cops are picking up brothers all over town.
I told them what I saw.
"What you saw, or what you thought you saw?"
"I was trying to help, Greg."
Can't you see you fed right into what they always wanna jump to?
"Look, I'm really sorry for what happened to you, but that's on the cops, not me."
It's all part of the same thing.
What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"- So, what, now I'm a racist?"
Sir is calling.
Must be the wife's massage.
Today I'm on duty.
Otherwise someone like you has never been spared by me.
Get his information and let him go.
You came out to be intelligent.
You don't look like one.
But you are.
But How did you put the gun in my bag?
I'm shocked.
You were standing before me and I was standing behind you.
You were standing before me and I was standing behind you.
You were looking on your left your left.
I came slowly...
"but that bag of yours, it was in the left."
"Here is your gun, and listen."
You met me here.
Don't meet me there.
Understood?
"I don't take help, not even from my father."
You know my nature.
But I know your nature.
Your size is 52 but you wear 48.
"How do you know, Sir?"
"If it was 52, wouldn't you be adjusting again and again."
"Okay, tell me which room is under my name."
"Your name, Sir?"
Laxminarayan.
Okay
Listen.
A letter is suppose to arrive on my name.
"One minute, let me check."
"How was, um..."
"""I... am... fine."""
Okay.
I guess that clears that up.
"Back to work, people."
As you were.
"Yeah, we'll talk..."
Nice post-it.
"Yeah, well, the last thing I need are people feeling sorry for me."
Is there any thing else?
'Cause I have a few weeks of work to catch up on.
Nothing.
"Well, just... the Campbell interview's this afternoon."
"- You ready or, uh-- - yeah, I can handle it, Jimmy."
Who's this?
Does it really matter?
And... these?
"It's your future, dude."
"You know, I didn't want you coming back to an office full of..."
Marjorie.
Nice.
- You want to talk about it?
"- No, I'm good."
- 'Cause I'm here if you want to.
- I know you are.
"Thanks, Jimmy."
Thank you.
"Okay, uh..."
"This is officially now, uh, an M.F.Z.--"
A Marjorie Free Zone.
"So we're rolling out the teaser campaign 2 weeks before the 21st, which is the hard date the game actually hits the stores, and the web site goes live with online, tv and trade pub print being our tent poles."
We also are doing game rental inserts.
"Zhu Li, come on!"
We got guests.
Whip up a pot of that green tea I love.
"Yes, sir."
Zhu Li's in prison with you?
Of course.
I don't go anywhere without my assistant.
Do you?
"We're not interested in your tea, and this isn't a friendly visit."
Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened.
I did some good things too.
"Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?"
I did.
"Bolin, who got you into the movers?"
I did.
"Asami, who saved your company?"
I did.
"Mako, who got you thrown in jail?"
I did!
"Oh, yeah, I guess that was a bad thing."
"You stole everything from me, and you tried to kidnap the president."
Those are pretty bad too.
I wasn't going to hurt him.
I just needed to start a war.
"Well, a bigger war."
"Well, we're gonna end it."
Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?
The future industries stuff?
It's on my battleship.
You have a battleship?
Of course I do!
"I bought the first one they made, named her the Zhu Li."
Only financially.
"Well, finance is the basis of most relationships, don't you think?"
"Don't play this with me, Mr. Sabourin."
I'm a tigress.
I'll bite you.
I accept your offer.
"26th floor, miss."
Yes?
I'd like to see Mr. Sabourin.
Do you have an appointment?
"No, but he'll see me."
Just give him this.
"What is your name, please?"
Just say Kelly.
"Will you wait right here, please, Miss Kelly."
Our plan is to buy companies that are in financial trouble and then build them up.
Now here's a company in Canada that I'm particularly interested in.
Wilson Oil?
I know that stock.
Sells at a dollar.
It hasn't been very active lately.
"Well, I want you to get me the background on it and then go into the legal aspect of the situation here with Herb."
Alright.
Where is she?
In the reception room.
"Alright, show her in."
"You must forgive me, I have a private meeting."
"You may go in now, Miss Kelly."
Hello.
"Mrs. Ryan, I'd like you to meet Miss Kelly."
"Miss Kelly, Mrs. Ryan."
How'd you do?
170 pesetas.
That's his final offer.
Anyone who doesn't want to work can stay home.
We've too many people already.
"If you want to sign up, get in line."
Sir!
Hey!
Excuse me.
Juan Robles.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
Alfonso Corrales.
I'm with the police.
I'm here about the murders.
If I can be of any help...
Let me know if you need anything.
- See you around.
- Thank you.
Yes.
"Yes, don't worry."
Of course.
"Good night, Manuel, and thanks."
"The field boss says there's no Dyane 6 on the Corrales property, neither registered or unregistered."
And Marina's mother says her daughter is at a movie.
I'll call Mr. Corrales tomorrow and have him come in for a blood test.
- It's late for today.
- It's 11 o'clock.
I don't think it's late.
I'll call him tomorrow morning.
I don't think there will be any problem.
Right now I'm going to have them check on the girl.
I'm not asking you to call him on the telephone.
I'm asking you to authorize a blood test.
"Well, you have your memories."
That's the best thing to keep.
Nobody can take that away.
Right?
"- Hi, Ida."
Is it okay if we come in?
- Yeah.
Vivienne is here to take you... to show you the photograph of you and your family.
Would you like to go see it?
- I'm going.
- Good.
Let's go.
Okay.
"So this is where you were thinking about the entrance, I think."
I'll show you this one.
- Okay?
- My husband's here somewhere.
"Yep, yep, yep."
"And, uh, then over here... this is Ben and Hilda Katz."
- Look over here.
- This is called the Ben and Hilda Katz Building... because they gave the $3 million to help start it.
- I knew that.
- So there they are.
And if the foundation... are going to have people here all the time who've done things for Baycrest.
So these were the first 64 people that were chosen.
And we just opened it the week before last.
- My husband's somewhere here too.
- Not on this one yet.
No.
We're going up in the auditorium to find him.
- And this is the Heritage Museum.
- Just a minute.
You'd lose your head if it wasn't fastened on.
"You were the door to another life, where my seed might have been affirmed."
Ta-da!
I found your shoe!
"I""ve brought back to this hole a breath of life, which I am trying to use."
"We make it, carnal."
"We don""t fake you, we just take you."
"""Cause La Primera""s ese."
"Always has been, always will be."
"Ã""rale."
"Ã""rale."
"Welcome to the clica, carnal."
"Por vida, ese."
Por vida.
"Are you coming out, ese?"
Staying in.
"Are you sure you know what you're doing, ese?"
SimÃ²n.
You scared me by showing me a glimpse of what my life might have been.
That's Lourdes.
"Ã""rale."
"Hey, be careful!"
"Don't worry, homes, I ain't gonna crash."
Check that one out.
See all the people?
They were throwing rice and shit.
Look at Mama.
Pull over up here.
I gotta take a leak.
"This medal I send to you as a gift for helping me find my voice, a key to my soul which I will use."
St. Dismas is the patron saint of all those in prison.
He has protected me.
How many of you want something to drink?
5?
10?
20?
How big's the party?
You got no right to make fun of me.
"I got a disorder, diagnosed by a legitimate doctor."
I got inside several different people.
"- Me, Mary Maude..."
- I met her.
JM...
"There are others, I don't know."
Let's get the department shrink to ride shotgun for Frank.
Are you kidding?
"Look at the way he's smiling, he's having a ball."
Tell JMJ I wanna talk to her.
"If you want to talk to JMJ, you have got to call her."
- What the hell is he doing?
- Watch and wait.
"Well, tell JMJ that I'd like to see her."
I don't talk to her.
"Whatever he's doing, it's inappropriate."
Can't you see he's playing her game?
- I only know she's in here.
- She's faking.
They don't know about me.
I am the dominant.
He'll trip her up.
- The dominant?
- That's what they call it.
"I know about the others, but they don't know about each other."
"You know JMJ, but you can't talk to her?"
I want Pete back.
"I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe, and I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room."
Fine.
I thought you were going to quit.
"Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Yeah.
"Thank you, good night."
You will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer.
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.
[Horn honking]
Hello?
Excuse me?
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, do you think there's two lines and we're all in this line and you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
You believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"Now I want all the hot dogs, please."
"Yeah, I'm buying all the hot dogs."
You don't have to do that.
"No, no, no, You don't have to do that."
That is ridiculous.
And I'm giving them to the good people.
"I should have seen coming, and I didn't."
Do you want to talk about it?
"No, I don't."
I'll...
I'll be fine.
"Well, I just got some news that we should have seen coming but didn't, and it's not good."
What is it?
We've just been subpoenaed to testify against Louis.
♪♪
What's that?
Moo shu pork and fried rice.
"The way I treated you before,"
I wasn't sure if you'd eaten yet.
- Harvey...
- And I was thinking that maybe we could eat while I tell you that I'm sorry and that I told Donna.
- You told her?
- Yes.
You were right.
"I needed to tell her, and it was unfair to her, and it was unfair to you."
- I never said that.
"- No, but you meant it."
"Harvey, if you're not careful, you're gonna become a full-fledged outstanding boyfriend."
Boyfriend?
Boyfriend.
Then I'll try not to be careful.
Come in.
"By the way, how did she take it?"
She was fine.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Turned out she already knew.
"Well, I'm glad you told her."
Who cares?
He just came to finish off the relationship with Grandma.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Thank you.
Why didn't you tell us... about Uncle?
I wish I had known.
When we found out... about Uncle... we all cried.
"Looking at Nagasaki, it's hard to believe this is where the bomb was dropped."
"People do forget everything, and so quickly, too."
But I will never forget!
"Say, let's go back there once more."
"You mean, that school?"
Yes.
Let's go to Grandpa's place.
Where is Nagasaki?
We can't see it yet.
It's on the other side of that mountain.
I wonder what happened to the children?
They didn't want to meet Clark.
That's for sure.
It's all our fault.
Our... stupidity.
But Clark...
We didn't think that.
"Clark, is there any place that you would like to see in Nagasaki?"
"Yes, there is."
"So, we'll go to the hotel, and then..."
I don't need a hotel.
I'm going to stay at Aunty's place.
"Before that, there's a place I'd like to see."
The place where Uncle died.
"Sorry I'm so late, they just wouldn't go."
But everyone had a lovely time.
"From now on, Mr Teddy wants fish and chips every Friday."
"Miss Poppy's very naughty, isn't she?"
"What with being engaged to Dickie Metcalfe, and egging on that Scotchman, Jock McGregor."
She's fella-fond.
"Poor James, he's tortured day and night by unrequited love."
"Ooh, talking of love, there's one thing I don't understand."
"How can a bishop, who's a bachelor, have a son?"
Good night.
"Good night, Dorothy."

A film by AKIRA KUROSAWA
RHAPSODY IN AUGUST
That was me.
My mouth was open.
"More importantly,"
I finally have enough bars on my phone to stalk Randy on Snapchat.
"Oh, great!"
"All of our problems are solved, except for food, money, and a place to sleep."
So negative.
Have you not seen the sneeze-guard-less bait shop salad bar?
"Speaking of pathetic, let me just check in on poor Randy."
Just another lonely night here in Texas... with all my new best friends!
- Hey!
- Ha-ha!
Hey!
I was up next for Twister!
Classic Jake.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Ha.
I'm sure he's just putting on a happy face.
That's obviously the only way to handle Jake.
"Deep down, I can tell he's genuinely upset."
I'm just genuinely happy right now.
"Ugh, this salad bar stinks."
"No, wait."
That's me again.
"Oh, my God, Max!"
The diner people put money in our PayPal account!
"They say it's from Chestnut, but he's not allowed on the Internet when we're not home."
I can't believe it.
Me neither.
The diner people are all we have in this world.
And I used to have a closet just for scarves.
Give me 10 hours.
"If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going."
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If I don't get back, you get her home."
HOOK:
"Ladies, in this world we are slaves to time, and ours is running out."
"In other words, tick-tock."
(ZIPS SLEEVE)
I was hoping it would be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
That's a good girl.
"This will allow you to climb, but there are other dangers."
Thankfully you've got me to protect you.
"I can't climb one-handed, can I?"
Don't think I'm taking my eyes off you for a second.
I would despair if you did.
Let's go.
- (BIRD CALLING) - (WIND WHISTLING)
(GRUNTS)
(PANTING)
First beanstalk?
"Well, you never forget your first."
"You know, most men would take your silence as off-putting, but I love a challenge."
I'm concentrating.
HOOK:
"No, you're afraid."
Afraid to talk.
"To reveal yourself, to trust me."
Things would be a lot smoother if you do.
You should be used to people not trusting you.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
Let me think about it.
"You know what tomorrow is, don't you?"
Frabjous Day.
How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
"-Still believe this is a dream, do you?"
-Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.
You're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someone who's half-mad.
"Yes, yes."
But you would have to be half-mad to dream me up.
(LAUGHS)
"I must be, then."
I'll miss you when I wake up.
(PLAYING TRUMPET)
Who will step forth to be champion for the White Queen?
That would be I.
You have very poor evaporating skills.
I should be the one.
I'll do it.
"-No, me."
"-No, me."
"No other slayer, nohow."
"If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead."
"Alice, you cannot live your life to please others."
"The choice must be yours, because when you step out to face that creature,"
you will step out alone.
Nothing was ever accomplished with tears.
Would you bid a half?
75.
Got a dollar.
How about going on for a half?
$1.50.
Would you bid $2?
Did I hear $2?
I got $2 right over here.
"Thank you, sir."
Sold to Western Trail Packing Company for $2.
Could I see that bill of sale?
"Thank you, son."
You consider this an actual bill of sale?
"I'm just the auctioneer, sir."
The bill of sale's been sworn to.
"Well, whoever swore to it... was a liar and a cow thief."
Those cows belong to John Coble of the Wood River Cattle Company.
Who the hell are you?
Stock detective.
What's a stock detective?
Me.
"You may call yourself some kind of stock detective... but I'm a deputy sheriff, and I'm the law here."
Lock these men up.
I'll file the charges.
"Nobody's going to jail, unless you start some trouble."
I see.
"I'll tell you what, Horn."
I'm gonna kill you.
You ain't gonna kill nobody.
"If he don't, I will."
- Your damn charges ain't gonna stick.
- lf the charges don't stick...
They're... small fry... tiddlers.
Their father was in the Resistance.
Dirty little habits...
The tiddler says...
"Good evening, Miss."
"Fire and brimstone at Mr. Venom's, huh?"
You made a good move.
I'm making another:
Your engagement present.
- Good behavior:
"Seven years, minus ten days."
"- Shit, how could I know?"
They haul me out of the clink only to say that you're shitting in Venom's boots.
It's not '45 or '68 any more.
"In '45, you were king of the streets."
What a result.
- The streets are still around.
- So am I. But the posters have changed.
"Well, I'm not dumb enough to get my head on a poster!"
But dumb enough to have your father clean up after you.
Your stepbrother is right.
"To survive, it's better to forget."
"So they got you banged up, guaranteed you a soldier's pension, is that it?"
"What I did, I did in memory of you."
And for her.
"That's one too many, Mickey."
"To survive, you've got to forget!"
I did it for you.
"Here, have your beloved son!"
Your favorite!
I love you!
Mary!
"Jove's sake, he's like a tree!"
Hence why he moved me up here.
What?
You can't change the rules just cos you found a tree man.
You have to check with me first.
"No, it's my sport."
I invented it.
I've been playing it for ages!
It's my sport.
Is this still the meeting?
"No, ignore that."
"Basically, my point was..."
"Hello, I'm Marcus."
I'm gonna do some really good stuff around here for you.
So...
Like what?
"Like, well... give you comfier chairs and unblock the toilets... and oil that squeaky door."
"Oh, thank you."
"Yes, exactly."
"For too long, this company has put profits above people."
Yeah.
"If there's anything you need at any point, just ask and I will deliver."
Thank you very much.
"Could I go and find a big man for my jugball side, please?"
Yeah.
"Not exactly what I had in mind, but OK, fine."
"Wicked, thanks."
It's terrible!
I can't eat anything.
"You don't know any dentists, do you?"
"Davus here could extract the bad tooth, if you want."
"What, really?"
What's in a name?
"One must serve tea, after all!"
Don't lie!
Shut up!
It's because of you that he got into trouble.
Where'd he get the 5000 Rupees he paid your surety from?
Speak the truth!
Where did the 5000 Rupees come from?
I wish I had.
They caught me putting back the money!
You should've told them that you're putting the money back!
They didn't let me speak!
They chased me and I ran!
But this job is not for you!
"Ajob is a job, after all!"
I only have to earn my living.
Yes.
I miss the respect I got as a chef.
Forget it!
I was sick of the hotel-life anyway.
I'm thinking of joining the movies now.
"Get me a role, will you?"
"If I become a star, I will soon join politics."
I could even become a minister soon after.
"You want to act, don't you?"
Of course!
"""Killing two birds with one stone"""
Wonderful!
That's a great title for a film!
"I play the stone, all right."
Who are the birds?
You will play both the roles.
"As long as you'r e all on the other side of it, yes."
What'd he say?
He said not to worry about it.
Feel like doing some tape work?
"Yeah, in a minute, but I'm gonna go see Rebecca first."
-
- Elevator woman?
-
- It's the menschy thing to do.
It is.
"I could blow her off, but -- -"
- But you'r e not that guy.
-
- I'm not that guy.
-
- This would be a good time to talk to him.
-
- Leave me alone.
'Cause you can see he's by himself in his office.
What makes you think Casey's inter ested in advising me on how I can get Gordon not to br eak up with me?
-
"- He's not, but he'll do it anyway."
-
- Why?
'Cause he's secr etly in love with you.
-
- He's not.
-
- He's only pr etending he's not.
"We've been through this, you and I."
"He's pr etending he's pr etending he's not so I think he is, but he's not, but he thinks he is, which doesn't matter, anyway, because I'm in love with Gordon."
-
There are certain moments that define your entire life.
Moments when a shock goes through your body.
"And although you don't understand it yet, you know... from this point forward, nothing will ever be the same again."
News flash:
It ain't real.
"On the outside you might be Soccer Mom of the Year, but on the inside... it's all you can do to hold it together."
Keep up the image.
"All across America, families are hiding behind the same mask... of baseball practice, Girl Scout cookies, Harry Potter sequels... and $15 Yu-Gi-Oh!"
Cards.
"Truth is, we're all living in fear and hiding behind our SUVs."
"One of these days, the other shoe's gonna drop, honey."
It's going to drop.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Here we go.
"We""re all set."
"- Do you have a pen, please?"
"- Yes, I do."
Here you go.
How are we feeling?
- It hurts.
- Yeah.
"- What time is the soccer game, honey?"
- About 2:00 on Saturday.
- Who are you playing?
- The Cougars.
"If we beat them, we""re in the playoffs."
"Mom, can I go to the park?"
What?
Yeah.
"Oh, my!"
Look at you.
Lieutenant?
"Aw, holy shit."
Yeah.
I'll be right there.
There's been another murder.
Milwaukee.
Why don't you just come in here and sit?
How long was this one dead before they found her?
What's she doing here?
Not even an hour.
The husband came home with the kids.
"Would you come with me, please?"
- What?
- Come on.
What's going on with this girl?
I happen to like her.
Is it any of your business?
"Yeah, it's my business because it's my ass."
Mitchell's talking about... putting another team on the case.
Mitchell's what?
Who the hell's he going to put on this case... that's not already working on it?
"I mean, we followed every goddamn lead."
We got enough evidence to put the guy away for life.
We've got one fucking problem... we have no idea who did it.
And she is the only one that saw that killer.
That's why I keep coming back to her.
"I'm telling you, she's the key."
To the case or to you?
Ridge...
I bought her flowers.
I bought her fucking flowers.
Me.
She didn't put poison in my cup.
"Well, Mrs Lightman didn't mention meeting you."
How come you've said nothing about it till now?
It's the truth.
"That woman poisoned you, so why on earth would you want to cover for her?"
She didn't do it.
Right.
Fair enough.
"I'm done here, George."
I'll stay here with Henry.
No!
Just leave me alone... all of you!
"Iris has motive, opportunity, previous, and what's more she's lied to us."
We've easily got enough.
"You've met her, Father."
Do you think she did it?
No.
But I don't know who did.
Why is Henry behaving so strangely towards me?
I don't know that either.
But let him rest.
Haven't you got an appointment this lunchtime?
"Mrs McCarthy, sorry I'm a bit late."
But I thought you were...
Inspector Mallory has arrested Iris Lightman.
And as Henry wants to be left alone...
The inspector's also arranged a car to drop us off in Cheltenham.
Oh!
"Oh, they're beautiful!"
That is very...
I'll just go and get myself ready.
There's no need.
"- No, no."
"- Yes, we are."
"- No, we aren't."
We are.
"All the girls came to get me, that's cool."
Where's Sarah?
"- Kitty, he's sitting in the back with you."
"- No, seriously, thanks for bringing the whole family."
"I mean, my day wasn't bad enough."
They were worried about you.
"Oh, you had the do the right thing, right?"
"Because Kevin always does the right thing, except sleep with women."
"Justin, could you shut up for ten seconds?"
"If you didn't want my help, why'd you ask?"
'Cause I was in jail.
I figured I should call the family lawyer.
"I mean, that's what you are, right?"
If your father could see this behavior!
He'd what?
Judge me?
Tell me to get a job?
He'd be so diappointed!
Disappointed?
Who the hell is he to be disappointed?
He's the disappointment!
What does that mean?
Forget it.
"Your father loved you more than anything on Earth, you little spoiled brat!"
- You know what love means in this family?
It means you suck!
- Get in the car!
It means nothing you do will be good enough!
"But let me tell you something, I know you love this car."
You love this car so much that you come in two days a week.
Two days a week to just look at it and then you walk out.
"Gerald, life's too short, man."
Life is too short.
Okay?
Things change in an instant.
Take it from me.
Okay.
So be a man.
Take control of your life.
Be a man.
Buy this car.
Show all these people that they're wrong.
That you can make a decision.
I'm gonna really think about it.
No.
"No more thinking, Gerald."
No more thinking.
No more dithering.
"No more wasting everybody's time, especially your own."
'Cause that's what you're doing.
You're wasting your time every time you come in here.
Buy this car because you love it and because you want this car and you want to drive off this lot in this car today.
Buy it.
Okay.
Okay.
Mr. Garrity!
"Yes, sir."
"All right, Gerald over here would like to go ahead and start paperwork on purchasing this hybrid here."
"Yes, I would."
"Congratulations, Gerald."
Roth?
"-Come in, Michael."
"Sit down, make yourself comfortable."
It's almost over.
-Do you follow the football game?
-Not for a while I haven't.
I enjoy watching football in the afternoon.
One of the things I love about this country.
Baseball too.
Ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series in 1919.
I heard you had some trouble.
Stupid.
People behaving like that with guns.
The important thing is you're all right.
Good health is the most important thing.
"More than success, more than money."
More than power.
I came here because there's going to be more bloodshed.
"I wanted you to know, so another war won't start."
Nobody wants another war.
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission to get rid of the Rosato brothers.
When I refused he tried to have me killed.
"He was stupid, I was lucky."
I'll visit him soon.
The important thing is that nothing interferes with our plans for the future.
Nothing is more important.
-You're a wise and considerate man.
"-And you're a great man, Mr. Roth."
-There's much I can learn from you.
"-Whatever I can do to help, Michael."
-Excuse me.
Lunch.
What?
"Oh, yeah."
- Games!
- What are you talking about?
♪ Open yourself up and love some games ♪
"- What are you doing, Mags?"
- What is that?
- ♪ Some games ♪ - [laughing]
"We could play Skalagoes, huh?"
"Honey, I don't know what you're saying."
"Hey, scribble Scrabble, where's the piece at?"
- Something is not right there.
- Let's play some games!
"Okay, so, ""I'm just a girl, standing here..."""
"""Notting Hill."" ""Notting Hill""!"
"That's it, yes!"
You should've just said Julia Roberts.
"Emma, don't tell me how to play the game."
"Okay, fine, fine, fine, go, go, go, go."
"- Turn it up, turn it up."
- What is...
"Oh, okay."
"This is a place where they're growing dinosaurs, and children and their families come and visit."
Why would you bring a dinosaur back to life?
- What's the movie?
- You know what's gonna happen.
"Electricity's gonna go out, and then all hell's"
- gonna break loose.
"- Yeah, that's exactly what"
"- happens, but say the movie."
"- Some of those dinosaurs are really smart, like, I believe a raptor could"
- use its claws to open a door.
Not quite sure I get your meaning.
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.
"- It's killing me, literally."
I'm dying.
"- Here, have a cookie."
"No, I'm cool."
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.
We used to sleep together all the time.
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.
"It wasn't all the time, but it happened."
I know I'm not just making this up.
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?
"Honestly, we may not have the best insight."
Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.
He's right.
The signals are totally different.
"Like, here."
"Here's ""I wanna sleep with you."""
"One, two, three."
"That's it, three seconds or more, it's on."
"And here's ""I don't wanna sleep with you."""
"One, two..."
"- Nope, thanks for playing, move along."
- It's that simple.
- That was a cheap shot.
- What are you...
"You know, excuses are like assholes."
"Everybody's got one, and they all stink."
"- Oh, yeah?"
You wanna go at it right now?
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
You wanna settle this now?
Let's do it right here.
Let's settle this son of a bitch right here.
"Hey, hey."
Take it easy here.
Jesus.
"Show a little class, will ya?"
Geez.
"Look, I'm an old man."
I don't fight no more.
I let my daughter do my fighting for me.
"And maybe in a couple years, when this little graham cracker... might have the stuff to compete, maybe we'll see."
Wait.
"You know what, asshole?"
Why don't you go to hell?
"- Dee, stay out of this."
- No.
This guy has been all over us since we walked in.
"I tell you what, jerk."
Why don't you take you big mouth... and go someplace else with it?
"Listen, little buttercup, I'm just bustin' your old man's balls."
- You don't have to get your panties in an uproar.
"- Oh, my God."
Are you standing there?
"Come on, move."
Poor guy.
Anybody told Meuller?
No.
None of the guys wanted to break it to him.
Wait till he hears it.
"Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be Pete."
"For the last time, are you coming in with us or not?"
"I told ya no, and I mean no."
"Oh, you're stir-nuts."
He don't know what he's saying.
"Aw, come on, Frank, get wise to yourself."
"Lay off, Red."
Will you lay off?
Stacey's on the outside.
I'm sure he's working for me.
I'll take my chance that way.
"Tough luck, kid."
[MACHINERY RATTLING]
Jiggers.
"Meuller, you can't beat this joint!"
You have no chance!
Let me go!
"Meuller, why ain't you at work?"
Get back to your machine.
[SPITS]
Get over agin that wall.
I'm gonna bury you in the Hole.
You hear what I told ya?
Get over agin that wall.
So you're the guy that wouldn't let Lassiter go to the hospital?
"I'll put you where he is, if you don't keep away from me."
And you're the guy that made him fall and busted his back!
"Mr. Thomason, you're under arrest."
Please stand up.
"Couldn't leave it alone, could you, Caine ?"
"Hang on a second, gentlemen."
Now I am conducting an investigation in this room.
Say good-bye to Mr. Thomason.
He's our suspect now.
Fed trumps county.
Get him out of here.
Thomason was leading us to his contacts.
- We were closing in.
- Closing in on what ?
I can't discuss it.
This would be a good time for you to start.
This isn't just smoke and mirrors.
"There are people in our country, this very state in fact, who want to do us harm."
Answer my question.
Haven't you heard of the greater good ?
Was my brother Raymond involved in this ?
And I want the truth.
Raymond's dead.
Now we both know that's not true.
You keep digging... and it will be.
I did some checking of my own.
Bob Keaton's release was approved by federal authorities.
"He was a Fed, wasn't he ?"
"Yelina, Bob Keaton was a DEA agent."
And Raymond ?
I need to know.
I have the right to know.
"Horatio, is he still... is he still alive ?"
It's possible.
I volunteered you guys.
–You can't be serious.
–Your shirt's gay enough for the job.
–What do you mean you gave us to Aceveda?
What...
Great.
I've got your assignments.
"Briefing room, five minutes."
Is everything okay with Kayla?
When was the last time you saw your roommate?
–Last night around 6:00.
–She didn't come home all night?
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.
Any idea where she might have gone?
There's two million single men in L.A. Take your pick.
"We found her car in the garage, but not her purse or keys."
Is there someone close?
Somewhere she might have walked to?
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?
We have every reason to believe that she's still alive.
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch... but our rent's due next week.
–Vic.
I got great news.
–What?
Just be glad you hired me and not the brain-dead idiot your wife did.
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?
"Corrine's P.I., they're making nonsecure calls from his cell phone."
I caught one.
Found where she's at.
"Is that right, Denny?"
I'm Pica now.
"Some days yes, other days no."
(Mouthes) Pica.
"The police have your DNA on the knife, the victim's blood on your clothes."
Witnesses saw you running from the lane.
They may have.
But I didn't do it.
He was alive when I found him.
"I took the knife out, but he died."
OK.
"Alright, we'll look into it further and get back to you."
You can't possibly believe him.
We've got our instructions.
Got your baggy eyes spot-on.
"Thanks, mate."
"Who is he, for Christ's sake?"
He is Pica.
What do we know about his prior?
Statutory rape. 15-year-old girl.
He was 19.
Girl.
Interesting.
You reckon it was a stitch-up?
"Well, come on."
"He looks like he did it, he sounds like he did it, he's homeless, he's got a serious prior."
It's the easiest stitch-up in the world.
Jails are full of guys who are there because they look like him.
You know?
No.
So you guys have sorted things out?
We haven't sorted out a bloody thing.
And you won't be going anywhere.
We'll see about the television.
All right?
"I'm very pleased that you like Dr. Travers, darling."
I did too.
"Well, he said he'd stop by in a couple of days to see how I'm feeling."
Good.
"And I will tell you exactly what he's going to say, that your husband is taking very good care of you."
I'll be right back.
- What did you do?
- Oh.
The antibiotics Dr. Travers gave me.
Let me help you.
He should've given me clumsy pills instead.
Better take this before I forget.
"- Gerard, I'll be coming down for breakfast at 7:15 tomorrow morning."
Tell Mrs. Gunnerson it will be the usual.
That's right.
Thank you.
Good night.
"Oh, here, darling."
"Oh, thank you."
To my beautiful wife.
Alexis.
"It's late, very late."
There's nothing more that you can do tonight.
Let's go home.
"I want to stay here, Dex."
You're tired.
You can come back tomorrow.
"Yes, I know, but I want to stay and talk to Galen's doctors."
Even if it means spending the night?
Do you just carry that thing around for dramatic effect?
Yeah.
around for dramatic effect?
Yeah.
And I use it to boil eggs.
Yeah.
And I use it to boil eggs.
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
And I use it to boil eggs.
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
"Oh,she'shere."
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
"Oh,she'shere."
So I think that Haylie might
"Oh,she'shere."
So I think that Haylie might actually maybe for some reason
"So I think that Haylie might actually maybe for some reason like you, so ix-nay actually maybe for some reason like you, so ix-nay on the death stuff."
"like you, so ix-nay on the death stuff."
"Just ask her if she's, like, on the death stuff."
"Just ask her if she's, like, a cat person or a dog person."
"Just ask her if she's, like, a cat person or a dog person."
I'ma turtleperson.
a cat person or a dog person.
I'ma turtleperson.
Justkeepit light.
I'ma turtleperson.
Justkeepit light.
"You know, tell the truth."
Justkeepit light.
"You know, tell the truth."
Theawfultruth!
"You know, tell the truth."
- You slept with Jack?
- You slept with Vanessa?
Serena Van Der Woodsen here's looking at you.
Jack?
Blair?
Really?
That's calculating.Even for you.
I was sad and he tried to comfort me.
You call that comfort?
More like collusion.
Like you didn't do that with the dregs of d.u.m.b.o.
I'm standing right here.
I can't believe you slept with miss Carr.
And you were in jail?
I can't believe you let some guy take photos of you.
Wh-what was he doing there?
"No,no,no."
It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
Okay?
"You guys just stop it,okay?"
She's trying to create
A divide between us.
This is exactly what she wants.
We can't let that happen.
You want to know something?
I don't think it's her that created the divide.
I think it was you.
"You're the reason we're on ""gossip girl"" in the first place."
If it wasn't for you we'd all be safe.
Okay that's enough.
We all did what she said we did.
- You can't blame Serena for this.
- Course not.
What?
"If we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers."
"Better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum."
Iain?
"What do you mean, a runner?"
"Just took off, all of a sudden."
- Find him for me.
- And then what?
Operation Merlin's all but dead and buried.
"I want him dealt with, John."
"And this time, no guns."
"- John, I've finally cracked it."
It's churros.
- What are you talking about?
The Spanish doughnuts you dip in hot chocolate after you've been out.
- Churros.
- Good.
"Once again last night, the wife got a call at 10:30."
- The husband saying good night.
- Exactly.
He's always calling.
They must like each other.
"We need to get in, get the phone number, without her knowing."
How?
We need a woman.
"Like Mr Ray Charles says, we've got a woman."
- You must be joking if you think...
- How many other birds do you know?
We meet again.
Thanks again for everything you did to help me.
"Oh, don't just thank me."
Okay.
It's...
Order an abdominal M.R.I. and a urine catecholamine.
It's just a hunch.
Okay.
Oh.
I almost killed you with an educational rattle.
Sorry.
I didn't knock in case you were sleeping.
I just came to get Cooper's clothes.
"Yeah, and to check up on me, make sure I'm not crazy."
I know the drill.
"What, you want to hold the baby?"
Do I look like someone who wants to hold a baby?
I'm wearing silk.
Are you breast-feeding?
No.
"No, I'm not."
"You know, a lot of women don't breast-feed."
I don't need to breast-feed.
L...
like I should feel bad about it?
I...
"I am so sick of people trying to make me feel like what I feel isn't what I should feel, if that makes any sense."
No.
"No, Charlotte, I'm not breast-feeding, okay?"
What you do with your boobs is your business.
"I only ask because you look like you need a martini, and if you're not breast-feeding, you can have a martini."
You want a martini?
Yeah.
Please.
Naomi.
Eva has never gotten over it.
She has worked like mad.
I've hardly seen her.
"-Never miss home, Aksel?"
-No.
It's been 20 years.
Things look different now.
And Eve?
It's been 20 years for her too.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
"Hello, my friend."
I have been in contact with the ministry.
I thought it should exist willingness to find a political solution.
There is a whole community.
Hundreds of people.
There is not a single company that will take us with pliers!
I do not think it's going to go this time.
Do not say that.
I've failed them.
I've failed everyone.
Me you...
"-No, You have not."
"-Yes, That was your."
"Solar Tech was your life's work, and I threw it away."
I love this place.
The people here are ...
I have lived here more than half my life.
All would have been affected.
"So what you're saying, is that you practically bankrupt?"
"No, what I am saying is that I believe in miracles."
"If it's what it takes to save the situation,  so I believe in anything."
- That guy is such an asshole.
- Don't blame it on him.
You're not makin' any progress.
I'm goin' to get the jump rope.
- Men are such pricks.
"- Oh, tell me about it."
I bet you're real tired of them pushing you around.
"Oh, God, you have no idea."
If only there was a way that you could be... physically tough enough to intimidate men.
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?
Let's just say I provide a much-needed service around this place.
"Step into the shadows and, uh, we'll talk."
Yeah?
"Mac and Dennis, dude."
Open the door.
- What?
- It's Mac and Dennis.
Open the door.
"Open the door, bro."
"All right, guys."
Hang on a second.
"It's like, uh..."
It's like 11:00 in the morning here.
- We don't care.
Open the door.
"- Surprise, bitch."
You're hittin' me with that?
"Charlie, let's be honest."
Punching boards isn't your thing.
- But that's okay.
"- Yes, that's okay, because for you... it's not gonna be about inflicting punishment... it's gonna be about having punishment inflicted upon you."
- You gotta talk to me.
- What does Dr. Beckett say?
- He says I'm hilarious.
"Thursdays at 4, highlight of his week."
He should be paying me.
"- Okay, I..."
- I...
Just please.
"Please, just..."
I didn't know that he had stopped coming to see you.
"I'm really scared, and I'm really confused because Eddie has so much going for him."
- He's so loved.
"- Julia, depression is not circumstantial."
It's got nothing to do with what you did or you didn't do.
Eddie is not choosing to feel this way.
I know.
I know.
And she could reach around a wall and smack you in the head before you...
And the arm would...
All you'd hear is this:
Ernest Hemingway blew his head off with a shotgun.
"Click, bang."
Thank you.
Can we get the check?
"His wife, Mary, said he was simply cleaning the gun."
And I think that's some housekeeping gone awry.
"Hey, how are you?"
- Haven't seen you here in a while.
- Yeah.
"Had he hung himself, would it have been that he was just cleaning the rope?"
- How's he doing?
- Fine.
Oh!
[groans]
"Boy, if Dad could see you now."
I am doing what he asked me to do.
I'm trying to help you.
I know you want the bonds.
- I can give them to you.
- And why would you do that?
Were you not listening?
That blood could satisfy your need to kill.
And what if I like to kill?
Do you?
"Look, what's the catch?"
You let Freddie go.
And I get to come with you and help you through this.
Are you out of your mind?
You seriously trust that Carlos won't just eat you the first chance he gets?
I don't trust him.
I trust you.
"I know you'll protect me, Scott."
[rock music plays]
"[Eddie] How did you get Seth to give you the plans, anyway?"
[Richie] Let's just say I convinced him.
[exhales]
"It's a little fancy, don't you think?"
I'm workin'.
[Richie sighs]
"Hey, listen."
I'm sorry I had to twist your arm about all this.
"What, are you kiddin'?"
I'm back!
"But if you ever try anything like that again, I'll kill ya."
It's port wine.
From Portugal.
Wine?
You were supposed to get decorations for the class.
Sorry.
I tried to go this morning but there was this huge line at Portuguese Party City.
- Really?
- No.
There's no Portuguese Party City.
There's no Portuguese anything.
How'd we end up with Portugal?
I was working during the sign up.
"By the time I got there, the only country left was Portugal."
There's a Portuguese family in the class and even they picked Jamaica.
"Ritchie, come on."
"We're late, we're late."
- I don't wanna be late for this thing.
- What should I wear?
We're supposed to dress like our country.
Oh.
"Well, wear anything."
Stand next to the kid dressed as Spain.
- Everyone will buy it.
- Okay.
You think they eat Raisin Bran in Portugal?
"Yes, but in Portugal, they call it..."
[PORTUGUESE ACCENT] ...Raisin Bran.
[CHRISTINE GRO ANS]
- I don't wanna do this.
"- Well, why'd you sign up for it?"
"Oh, Richard, you don't know this school."
"They've got a million events a week and you gotta volunteer and if you don't, they ostracize you."
I want you out of here.
"And from now on, I don't want anybody going to his tavern,"
I don't want anybody eating his food.
"Spit that out, Johnson."
"I brought this from home, sir."
I said spit it out.
I think he meant into a napkin.
- I'm going to go.
- Good.
And take these lousy sandwiches with you.
"Those are my gym clothes, sir."
I'm really glad we could have dinner.
"Me, too."
You okay?
You seem a little nervous.
"No,"
I'm not nervous.
Just a little hopped up from the pepper shrimp.
"Alex, I get it."
You're afraid someone will see us together and tell your father.
I'm not afraid.
It's just there's nothing to tell him.
Okay.
"But I can tell my friends about you, right?"
Tell them what exactly?
"What, are you kidding?"
I kissed one of Manhattan's Ten Most Eligible Singles.
"That's only happened to me, like, three or four times."
"Hey, let's walk this way."
What?
I think I see the mail-room guy from my office.
"Sorry, I just feel like everyone's staring at us."
And no sor of music would tempt you out?
Not at all.
Not even if it was Tiger Feet by Mud?
"Well, that would tempt me out, yes."
Or Fox On The Run by Sweet or anything from the '60s or 'the 70s.
"Pretty much anything I'll go and dance to, actually."
I hate being in the kitchen at parties.
I'm no good at it.
Do any of you have party tricks that you do?
Any little things that you can sort of just...?
"Yes, yes, Rhys?"
Take that.
Listen to this.
"Two, two, testing."
"That's not it, is it?"
What I'll do is I'll do...
"For the festive season, I'll do the sound effects of Santa arriving at the top of the house and then coming down the chimney to put the presents under the tree."
Here he comes.
"Santa arriving, folks."
MAKES FAST GALLOPING SOUND
MAKES THUMPING SOUNDS
Ohh!
Aagh!
COUGHS
Ho ho ho!
APPLAUSE Very good.
That was...
That was special.
So we're heading to a new year.
What does it hold for my guests tonight?
"Rhys, where will you be?"
Which hemisphere will you be in?
He used to make me and brother fight in the backyard every day.
He would come home and drink a beer and watch us beat the shit out of each other.
And one day we just decided--
Why fight each other?
Why fight for free?
So we just left.
What else is going on in that head of yours?
I don't know.
I just can't help thinking that I should have been there for him.
I should have been there for Frankie.
What could you have done?
just been there.
I wake up Why the hell didn't I go with him?
I should have fucking went with him.
And then maybe that would have been you too.
Yeah.
But it haunts me.
I hear him calling my name just like when we were kids.
And I'm not there.
I loved my brother Frankie. especially around the old man.
Have you forgiven him?
I just--
I'm not afraid of him anymore.
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna stay here?
Would you stay here for me?
what's up?
I understand.
Saturday?
Okay.
yeah.
all right.
What if they come in?
I don't see why I can't piss here.
Because I do not want to see piss coming out the end of your cock.
- I could sit down and do it.
- What?
I do that sometimes.
"You know, for a treat."
"Oh, fuck, just get on with it then."
- Are you going yet?
"- I can't, you're putting me off."
"- Shit, who's that?"
- Northwood?
- Who is it?
- It's obviously me.
What is happening in here?
- Has Charlotte sorted it?
- No.
I've sorted it though.
- What have you done?
- My mum's gonna pick us up.
What?
"- Oh, this is tragic."
- Called your mom!
Your mum is coming to rescue us from the toilet of an under-18 disco because we're being bullied by 12-year-olds?
No-one must ever know about this.
"Si, go outside and take your beating from this child, and then we can leave."
I'd have taken him down if it weren't for Northwood.
How were you going to take him down?
Spunk in his eyes?
"Oh, shit."
What if Carli finds out about me and that girl?
"Oh, no!"
Attack!
Good dog...
"Oh, it likes eating buns!"
Shit!
"Oh, the thief is crying for catching thief!"
It's Fong who touched Miss Shiu's ass!
"Now, the truth is found!"
He can't imagine that the dog which is trained by him... will betray him because of my righteousness and its conscience!
It turns to charge against its master!
What a righteous dog!
Let's clap for it.
Lysee is a good dog.
Lysee is a good dog!
We've found a good dog named Lysee in China.
"Miss, do you want to talk to me?"
I'm sorry to make a mistake.
"I am so ignorant that,"
I was almost cheated by that bastard.
"By the way, you owe me something, huh?"
I wish to have chance to pay for it.
This is my student Foon.
Brother Foon.
He likes you so much.
"Master, you are disgusting!"
But you need not fall for him.
"Well, 3 pm tomorrow, come to my home on time."
Let's discuss what you'd pay for it.
What do you think?
I'll be there on time.
Let's go!
Let's go!
"Master, we've found it."
Go to the shop and bring back some beer.
Beer!
Why is he the one happy about it?
Bring back some soju too.
"You take care of it on your own, I don't want to get involved."
Then shall I tell them everything?
That there's someone else inside the body?
"If you do, I bet you'll get dragged to the hospital right away."
"If you don't want to get caught, then cooperate."
I'm sure we'll get caught.
I'm sure it'll show as more time passes.
"If it starts to get obvious, then you have to try to hide it!"
Hide what?
Uh oh...
See?
It's already starting.
What are the 2 of you hiding?
Kids don't have to know.
Don't get involved in an adult's conversation.
"Let's go, Yoon Jae."
"You, kid don't have to know!"
She said a kid doesn't have to know.
Come have a seat over here.
-Da Ra!
Da Ran!
"-Yes, mom."
Be good.
What?
If it's uncomfortable...
Do you want me to get you a pair of socks?
That's okay.
This is comfortable.
"Another hard day at the office, eh, boys?"
What are you two doing in here?
- All the pretty ladies are out by the pool.
"- Well, it's safer in here."
Are these the waiters' jackets I ordered?
Yes.
"With those coats, your waiters will look better than your members."
- You look warm.
"Mac, get him a drink."
"- Er, two cents plain."
That's seltzer.
You got Lena workin' double time on the sewing machine?
- These weren't due till Tuesday.
- She has an incentive to finish early.
Mama and me are going on a vacation tomorrow.
A vacation?
I don't believe it.
Mm.
Believe it.
For years she's been harping me I should take her somewhere.
"Finally, she said,"
"""You don't take me on vacation, I find myself a younger man."""
"Yeah, big deal."
"At our age, an old man is a younger man."
"So, a vacation - what'll it hurt?"
"So, we're going."
It sounds like she's really got you worried.
Worried?
"What, me?"
Never.
"Of course, she's been acting very nice to old man Burnestein lately."
Where are you gonna go on this vacation?
- Must you go?
"Well, yes."
I've got an 8:00 appointment at the office in the morning.
"Good night, Lynn."
Don't bother to see me out.
"- Good night, Dougie."
- Good night.
"I've been around long enough to know that you want something, honey."
What?
I want you to kill someone for me.
My husband.
Please.
I know who you are.
I've read all about you.
You don't know enough not to believe everything you read.
It would be so easy for you.
I could help you.
I'll pay you anything.
I'll be worth a fortune afterwards.
You're out of your mind.
You're lucky I don't slap you senseless for even suggesting it.
"Please, you've met him."
You see what he's like.
You can't imagine what it's like living with a man like that.
I want him dead.
You've got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
"Got the wrong guy, honey."
You better forget the whole thing and just hope that I do too.
Got the Cleveland newspaper.
Does it say anything?
"Yeah, in a small item in the second section."
Got the Cleveland newspaper.
Does it say anything?
"Yeah, in a small item in the second section."
It says the local DA is missing.
Good.
Get in touch with Lister this afternoon.
Tell him he did okay and he'll be paid in the usual way.
Okay.
What do you want?
- We're in trouble.
- What do you mean we're in trouble?
"Last night, Stan pretended to be drunker than he really was."
"After Douglas left, he sneaked down the back stairway."
- So what?
- Don't you understand?
He saw us.
He even took pictures.
He's a creep.
He's gonna use those pictures to divorce me.
- You let him.
- I won't get a cent from him.
- That's your problem.
- No.
"No, it's your problem too."
He's gonna smear us across every front page in this country.
I don't want that and you don't want that either.
I've had worse publicity than this and survived it.
Go home.
- Figured you'd run here and warn him.
- Wait a minute.
I've already waited long enough.
"I thought about you all night, Gordon."
Obviously.
The lash will loosen their tongues.
Put 'em onboard the ship.
Won't find it so easy to launch an escape from there.
No!
You take 'em!
And you stay with them till I send for you!
Excuse me.
I got hit over the head by two men over there.
Shut up!
You lad.
Come here.
Mr. Atkins obviously needs all the help he can get.
So you go with him.
What will happen to the women?
You leave the women here.
It'll give Captain Taylor something to consider if he tries to plan another escape.
And what are you gonna do about those two men?
What I always do to people who try and cross me.
We have to get those women to safety.
Come on.
Who are you?
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the tree house.
But he's a savage.
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
So you admit it's me.
Just tell me what you have.
The dead whiz kids... they all had one more thing in common other than their talents.
Otto.
He found a pattern.
They all applied to Seattle State University.
Kevin Whitfield apply?
Just like all the others.
You gonna talk to their admissions officer?
- Yeah.
I am.
- Good.
Take me with you.
The only other person that knows as much about this case as you is me.
"You came to me once, for help."
"I saw where it was going, I told you to drop it."
"And you did, and I just..."
Watched that eat away at you.
I was there.
I know it's you.
But if I say it out loud it means I'm either crazy or it's true.
You just said it out loud.
[Sighs shakil]
"Gracie and Helen, you don't tell them."
I do when it's time.
"Let's solve this case, Duval."
"When we get there, I do the questioning."
You don't talk.
They were so rare.
Each of them.
I remember some of their essays.
Who could want to take these lives?
- Do what?
You can't kill anyone.
What makes you think they'll let you?
They don't care about Lisa and Charlie now any more than we do.
It's all about Allie.
Then where are they?
We tried to pick up Lisa.
Lisa was helpless.
Allie can take care of herself.
Then what makes you think any of this will work?
I don't know if it's gonna work.
At least I'm not afraid to try.
"Mary, don't do this."
Listen to me.
I-I know this.
Walk away.
"Even if you lose the project, walk away... before you do something you can't walk away from."
MAN:
Here they come.
Why don't you just fade away?
You're a burden to the project.
"You don't have the stomach for it, and you don't have the brains."
You have no idea what I'm capable of?
What I've done?
I won't have any more blood on my hands.
Everybody set?
Get a tight lead on that subject.
Run away!
Take the little girl!
It's a trick!
Run!
It's a trick!
"Never mind that, doctor."
Is the master okay now?
He's absolutely fine.
Aunty!
How will I...
Why are you making her cry?
Leave her alone.
"Ask the doctor when we can take the boss home, dear."
Today itself.
"And Dr. Rohit is around for help, too."
"Let's go home, uncle."
Get well soon.
We've got a lot to decide.
"No, Rohit."
"You're a good doctor, I know."
But let's leave it at that.
"What do you say, Laxmi?"
"Place some money in aunt's plate, grandpa."
"Why do I need to do that, dear?"
After all that she has done for us we ought to give her the keys of the family.
"Use keys on locks, sir."
Place some change in it now.
Treat that like a golden biscuit!
"Come on, sir..."
I'll take that.
"Coming, sir."
Did you call me?
"I've been alone for 20 years, after Lajwanti's death."
I have never missed female company in all these years.
"You have served me so well now, Lakshi!"
I don't think a wife would have taken so much of care!
See that?
- To our meeting.
"Oh, what a poison!"
Some friend you've got!
"No, actually he's a good man."
"Actually, he's not Georgian, he's Greek, though he lives in Tbilisi, he is a tennis coach."
"Excuse me, what's your name?"
- What?
- Your name.
Oh.
Maria.
And I'm Yuri.
Incidentally!
"I didn't drink that much, but it went to my head."
Let's have something to eat.
I was hanging about the station all day!
Very well.
"You take charge here, I'll go and procure some plates and forks."
Tanya!
Can you find some plates and forks for us?
There you go.
Thanks a lot.
Good girl!
"My dear, why do you keep coming and going?"
"You know, I couldn't understand how it could... how it could be that the door's locked but the man's gone!"
"You know, I thought I was going to die."
Let's have another shot.
Though I can't drink much.
"You know, when I drink, I get..."
I get kind of bad in the head.
Start singing right away.
The matchmakers came to me
On a skewbald mare!
"Clutched his halo and held it straight, didn't he!"
How do you know all that?
I know everything you do and think.
Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you.
He ain't the kind of...
"And as you were leaving the room, you turned at the door, didn't you?"
"And you said, ""For a moment, I thought..."""
What did you think?
What did you think?
Did you think Dr. Jekyll was falling in love with you?
"You, with your cheap little dreams?"
"Or did you think, perhaps that in him, you saw a bit of me, Hyde?"
"Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it?"
"It isn't quite clear, is it?"
Oh...
What are you going to do?
Something so simple.
I'm going to put an end to all that confusion.
"Please, sir!"
"Oh, no!"
"Please, no!"
"Yes, dance."
Dance and dream.
Dream that you're Mrs. Henry Jekyll of Harley Street dancing with your own butler and six footmen.
Dream they've all turned into white mice and crawled into an eternal pumpkin.
"Here, you in there!"
Open this here door!
Police!
- Ivy!
- I'm going in.
Governor!
"Ho, there!"
"Get the fuck off me, man!"
"Then go, go!"
"Get the fuck outta here, maricon!"
So Michael is one of my favorite students.
Rodriguez.
Sorry?
Michael Rodriguez is our son.
"No, yeah, I meant Michael Rodriguez."
He's got a knack for poetry.
"He writes beautifully, you know."
"It must be difficult for you, though."
How so?
"Well, I mean with the issues Michael's having."
"You know, the..."
"His refusal to use the boy's bathroom,"
"The eyeliner in class, et cetera."
"You know, all the things you and I spoke of"
A month ago Mrs. Rodriguez...
You made me look like a fool in there.
"It isn't like that, Kike."
Listen.
"No, I have been listening."
You been keeping a lot of shit from me.
I'm supposed to find out from his teacher?
"How the hell you think that makes me look, huh?"
"He's walking around out here,"
Going to the fucking girl's bathroom?
What the fuck's that say about me?
"I'm sorry, I thought this was about Michael."
"Don't fucking start, Angie!"
You don't need that shit anyway.
"Like, not at all."
"Because we got a long session coming out, trying to figure who's sitting on his last bomb at this very minute."
"Now, whether you know it or not, one of you three people has got the answer."
"Officer, none of these people are to leave the hospital until my men get here."
"And, Doctor, I want a complete record on this group."
[Ticking]
"Candlelight, incense... and after-dinner drinks..."
Ahhh.
I feel like a female Hugh Hefner.
"All right, Ms. Hefner."
"Why don't you just, um, put this in your pipe and, uh..."
- Smoke it?
- Right on.
[Giggles] Ooh!
A sealed envelope from a lover by candlelight.
Uh-huh.
What is this?
Tahiti?
Brisbane?
Kathmandu?
"I'll see your Kathmandu, and raise you a Cairo, Istanbul and Vienna."
- When?
- As soon as possible.
[Laughing] [Phone Ringing] What do you think?
"Oh, terrific!"
"Yes, we can make it to your villa this summer."
"- Is Alex here, Mrs. Linden?"
- Louise?
- Hello.
"- Al, uh, look."
I'm not trying to cause any trouble.
I just want to tell you there's no point in you coming home tonight.
The two of you can stay there...
What's that?
Don't tell me.
That's European or something?
Bet you got a story to tell.
This is Davis Hartley here.
I'm not some nickel and dime street mutt.
I'm not trying to rip you off or anything.
It would be stupid.
A guy like you?
Got a couple pounds of Lead in his eyes?
What's that?
Is that maybe grief or something like that?
You want to talk about it?
Maybe you think I'm trying to rip off your experiences to put 'em in my novel.
But that's not true.
Davis Hartley is not some moral cretin.
Not precisely.
I'm trying to make a point here.
I'm a professional New York City car driver.
You know what that means?
I'm the greatest individual at being able to find anything in the world.
I could find a penguin in a sandstorm.
- I don't know what a penguin would be-
- Stop talking.
Please stop talking!
Hello!
Stop talking!
You want to help?
"After I stop, I'll be busy for a while."
Find a guy named...
Alex Bohemia.
Who do you think I am?

I love you very much.
"Good morning, sir."
"John, what do you think of the president's proposal?"
I don't know.
"It's good to have less enemies, I guess."
You're a military man.
You don't think he's putting us at risk?
That's a little above my pay grade.
If you feel that way why didn't you run against him?
"- No, no, no."
That's one job I never wanted.
I like my office.
I like my constituents.
I like being a thorn in the side of the administration.
But I think voters today want somebody cool.
"Oh, come on, Mr. Speaker, I think you're pretty cool."
He went to bed at 8 and watched...
The president has a call scheduled with the speaker at 9:30.
"- I should be there for that, shouldn't I?"
- No.
You have to be here in case of a deadlock...
"Hey, I'm gonna see you later."
-
-With the red tie for that.
- Jenna?
"- Absolutely, Mr. Vice President."
Red tie's the way to go.
Jenna.
Jenna.
Did you get me in?
- What do I get if I did?
- What do you want?
he's been here a million times.
"- i'm not a psychic or anything, but... i don't think she's gonna give him a tour -- not of the house, anyway."
"- okay, i need a drink."
- christmas time -- everybody needs a drink.
i'll take a cool one.

dang ghosts are screwing up my life.
[scoffs] what's the world coming to?
this is my mama's place.
[urinating] hey!
loser!
go drain it somewhere else!
Shizuru!
What?
Has something happened lately?
Eh?
"No, nothing."
"Yeah, but you are acting a little weird."
And so!
"Because our class has not been on the ball lately, the teacher chose a new motto for our class!"
What do you think it is?
Sis!
Eh?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Man...
You just don't listen to what anyone else says!
I'm sorry!
Say it again!
I don't want to!
Please!
I will listen this time!
Please!
What I was saying was...
My class has not been doing well so my teacher choose the motto Everyone has kibi kibi kibi-dango!
Sis has been acting like that for a long time.
G-Grampy?
You are acting like you are in a haze.
"What, did you get some of that Katsuragi-kid's smoke?"
"I admire her desire to search for anwsers, but the thing she wants to know about is so vast and vague, that she is struggling."
She is like a small bird caught in a net.
A net?
It is a trifling thing gor someone like you who can see those things.
Where are you going?
We have some business in town.
We'll be back as soon as we can.
- I trust that you'll keep an eye on things?
- So I'm the babysitter now.
"Frederick, if this is going to work we have to cooperate with one another."
- So you say.
"- I'll watch things, Miss Pearl."
"Thank you, Harper."
"I'm thinking nothing huge, dinner at the Grill, maybe a late movie..."
A double date?
"Two pair, out on a Friday night, coupled."
"Yeah, a double date."
- You think that's a good idea?
- Why not?
"You know, we all haven't gone out before and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us."
"The couple dynamics have changed and there's been a little awkwardness between you, Matt and me and I just think it's important that we get over it."
I don't know.
"You know what, I think that sounds like a great idea."
- You do?
"- Yeah, yeah."
A nice evening out with friends.
"Sounds fun, as in fun."
Hm?
- A double date it is.
- Okay.
Heh.
So we will see you tonight.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
"Ha, ha."
What good is your word?
What's he gonna do now?
He's lost everything he had.
"No great amount of money, Patricia."
"Oh, it isn't the money, father."
He had dreams.
"They're gone, perhaps... perhaps even his faith in himself."
- Everything.
- But the boys is young.
I'll think of something.
- I'll find a way to help him.
"- Oh, don't talk to me."
I don't wanna hear any more alibis.
I don't wanna see you.
"Oh, I didn't mean that."
I don't know what I mean.
"Well, I understand."
I-I have failed you.
- But if I could make amends..
"- Oh, what could you do?"
I might be able to arrange backing.
So he could go on with his production.
"Father, where would you get any money?"
I'll get it... someplace.
[ship horn blowing]
"Jason, when is the captain going to marry her?"
As soon as we're upon the high seas.
- You have the license?
- Right here in my pocket.
"Though I understand, we won't need it."
"While we are waiting, couldn't we go some place and snuggle?"
Snuggle?
"- Oh, no worries."
"- Ok, uh..."
"You know, there's something I wanted to ask you, something Brandon told me about the night before he was attacked."
Mike was drinking?
Yeah.
"He had a little slip, but he's been sober ever since, going to meetings every day."
"Oh, that's great."
Good for him.
Brandon said that he was in a fight.
"Yeah, I guess so."
He blacked out so he didn't really remember anything.
"Oh, gosh..."
But there was blood on his hands when you found him?
That's...
A little.
He was fine.
- Was it his blood?
- Stef.
"If you have questions about Mike's sobriety, you have to ask him."
Of course.
Of course I should.
You're right.
Sorry.
Thank you so much for the coffee.

"Um, you might wanna hang on to the bat a little tighter too."
"Here, grab another one, all right?"
"Hey, Connor, let's go, come on."
"Throw a token in there, let's see what you got."
What do you think?
"I think that before we get there, the victim will be up and gone."
"No, I beg of you, give her the medication."
They're painkillers.

You said two in the morning and two at night?
Yes.

"I said, how do you know?"
I can't hear.
Speak louder.
We were cut off.
"You were saying, doctor..."
What's wrong with her?
"Nothing, she's just old and weak."
She's just a bag of bones and she's not very well at all.
Old age is a terrible illness.
"Yes, but there are worse illnesses."

How are humans alive?
"Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?"
We'll get you through this.

The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
"Okay, this is almost over."
You're doing great.

Keep talking.
Talking about what?
"Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?"
You must be excited to see her.
"Very much, you know."
"Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?"
"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
- Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
I don't know.
I don't know.
"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
Tiny Eyes!
Tiny Eyes!

"Okay, well, you told me that I should talk to Trav about being more responsible, so I did."
"And then we bought this old van, and Trav's a genius, and Scooby-Doo, and you're gonna be rich."
"Sweetie, I see that you are insanely excited about an old van and a plan from Travis that seems like the greatest idea of all time."
But it's not.
You have your mom goggles on.

Thanks for the wallet.
Dr. Roncero.
Psychiatrist.
7th Left.
Twenty three.
The day I spent waiting at the window was the day she wouldn't come.
But I knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist.
Dr. Roncero's office.
I'd like to make an appointment.
Does tomorrow at 5:00 suit you?
Can't it be sooner?
"No, tomorrow at 5:00."
All right.
Your name?
What's up?
I've got an appointment at 5:00.
Come in.
Don't stand there!
Excuse me.
Benigno Martin?
Yes.
I have to get some details.
"I just wanted to see Alicia again, but as I was there and her father was a psychiatrist"
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
"The last fifteen years, you said?"
Yes.
I started when I was very young.
And during those fifteen years you did nothing but look after your mother?
I never left her side.
"Well, I studied to be a nurse so I had to go out to attend classes."
"I also studied beauty therapy, makeup and hairdressing, but by mail."
You mean you did your mother's makeup and her hair?
Just list them for me.
That's all.
Let me get back to you.
We're missing the best part.
You know it by heart.
I saw you lip-synching.
"Well, lucky I do."
I couldn't hear all the words.
"I don't know if it's my old ears, or the subway underneath."
- Did you like the Billy Bigelow?
- He's good.
Good voice.
What'd you think of the Julie Jordan?
"Good act, no voice."
My Nettie could sing better.
"We met 25 years ago, Westbury..."
I heard about that.
"Speaking of performances, Frank."
I don't want to hear about another one like this morning.
Your boy embarrassed me.
You'll have to live with it.
- Why?
- Because he's my boy.
"There's oil under that vacant lot, Frank."
Jobs.
You don't need to politic me.
I run Kings County.
Jobs for people of this city.
"Not leases for Lenny, Murray and all your greedy pals."
Just because this kid thinks he can elect you President you're going to forget who got you here?
I don't forget anything.
You're developing a short memory.
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom to get some aspirin... and I happened to look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"""Do not be afraid."
Ninety-nine will die.
"Denver Nine""."
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning I look at this piece of paper... where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
- Gordon?
- What?
"Gordon, you..."
your ear's bleeding.
What?
"This CAT scan is clean, Gordon."
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
–What's he moving'?
"–Just, you know, warehouse electronics, man."
"CDs, TVs, DVDs."
Same stuff as before.
Where's he keeping his stash?
Are you gonna hold this third strike over me for the rest of my life?
"I could lie to you, but I have far too much respect for you as a person."
"Yes, I am."
Here is your authorization to check Mackey's financial records.
Thanks.
Hope we don't find anything.
I just hope you find the truth.
"Hey, Joe."
It's Vic.
Can you believe I walked out on them?
"When they left, I thought it'd be easier."
I thought they'd miss me more than I'd miss them.
"Guess I'm the shithead, huh?"
–Stacy still on the swim team?
"–Yeah, I think so."
Yeah.
"Yeah, she, uh..."
Damn it!
I didn't want you to see me like this.
"–Broke, with nothing."
–What about your pension?
Damn lawyers for the civil suit ate it up.
–What about the stuff you took on the side?
–I guess I didn't take enough.
Always so careful.
Never wanted to get caught.
"–Joe, you can't live like this."
What do you mean?
"There's got to be like a highway or something, right?"
"Yeah, there's got to be a highway."
What's going on up there?
Squad up
My niggas
"I see some pussy-ass niggas, so what the fuck--"
What the hell is this?
We knock these niggas out
"I see some pussy-ass niggas, so what the fuck you wanna do?"
- I'm turning around.
"- Nah, just go through, man."
"Dude, we're not driving through this basketball game."
"You know, Roldy, I really thought you were bigger than this."
"Dude, I'm not scared 'cause they're black."
I'm scared because they're scary.
And it's not like we got Gregory Hines out there.
They're not that scary.
It's my ball!
Turn around.
"Rob this motherfucker, drop his punk ass in a ditch"
"Drag this pussy nigga, slap his ass up like a bitch"
My niggas is my niggas 'cause my niggas--
- Fuck!
It won't move!
"- Shit, dude."
Shoot him dead between his lips
I see some pussy--

"Shit, man."

It's very impressive.
Thank you.
"The Robinson Scholarship is comprehensive, as you know."
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.
Absolutely.
"We have 76 applicants this year, only one of whom will get the scholarship and most of whom have résumés just as impressive as yours."
Right.
Professor Phillips?
Some kids grow up wanting to play for the Red Sox.
"You know, some grow up wanting to be, I don't know, a fireman."
I grew up...
"Well, really, I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med."
"And now that I've gotten accepted, it seems to only come down to the money."
"You don't want to die, huh?"
"Well, don't worry about it, sonny."
I'm gonna let you live.
"Oh, boy, thanks."
"Oh, boy, you're welcome, but on one condition."
"You gotta keep your mouth shut, you understand?"
Sure.
You don't talk to nobody.
You just keep your mouth shut.
(AGREEING) Don't say a word to no one.
You keep everything quiet.
You don't say nothin'.
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
You don't say nothin' to anybody.
You keep your mouth shut and be sure you just do like I tell you.
Then you won't get into any trouble.
Shut up!
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Someone's at the door.
Let's see who it is.
"Well, let's go."
You get the door.
"Okay, sure."
"But be sure when you open the door, you don't say nothin'."
Remember what I told you.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't say nothin' to nobody.
"Just open the door, see who's there, and that's all."
You don't talk to nobody.
You understand?
"Just open the door, that's all I'm askin' you to do."
Jeremy!
What?
"Haven't you read the studies, Liz?"
A glass a day is actually good for you.
Lowers your blood pressure.
"And smoking's good for your lungs, right?"
What do you expect?
You said we're a family full of addicts.
I never said that.
You said that you were the only one who wasn't hooked on something.
"That's, of course, unless you count the wine."
You.
"And then there's Nick, who's famous for his zany hi-jinx, and Nick's mom, a pill freak."
Jeremy...
"I'm a guest in your house, right?"
Yeah.
"So do you think it would be rude of me if I told you, as a guest, that you're a spoiled little jerk?"
What do you think?
I need a ride to this party.
I am not taking you.
We have guests.
"Oh, come on, mom, what am I gonna do?"
Sit here and watch figure skating-- [whispering] Sit down.
I'll take you.
It was very nice.
Thank you.
Liz:
You're welcome.
"Well, you sure do give your mom a pretty hard time."
I see her...

The dark vault.
You've never seen the dark vault.
I'm gonna hazard a guess here you're never gonna want to see the dark vault after we move that to there.
"Okay, you get the..."
"No, you know what?"
Let's do this tomorrow.
"You know, we better secure it."
"You know, let's move that trunk."
"When I say ""let's,"" I mean you."
"Little known but apropos fact, by the way,"
"Steven Rubell, who was one of the co-founders of Studio 54, he considered calling his club Wonderland."
"Oh, my God!"
- Other side.
Other side.
"- Hey, lady!"
"Yeah, okay, let's go."
- My ten grand?
"- Right, about that."
"Well, Artie, you know, last-minute Apache helicopter rides to the middle of nowhere,"
"- South Dakota, don't come cheap."
- I know a guy with a Chinook.
Would have cost you about half if you would have called me!
"Well, I had to beat Alice here, didn't I?"
Did it work?
- Look who's here.
"- Oh, my God!"
"Yeah, making breakfast."
Come on.
"So, Myka, you said I was a good kisser."
NARRATOR:
"Yeah, just, uh... just came in."
"Abby, check your in-box, please."
"Uh, I just sent you his I.D. photo."
Oh.

Facial comparison should get us somewhere.
"Michael Beers, 41, retired Marine."
Air marshal since 2010.
Lives up in Syracuse.
- Wife and two kids.
- I'm digging this guy's glasses.
"Those would be cute on you, Gibbs."
"I mean, not that squinting isn't totally super cute on you, too."
"I checked his accounts, boss-- he's got an open credit card at a motel about a mile from here."
Never checked out?
"Not yet, anyway."
"Well, okay, red flag city here."
"As much as these two look alike, the key markers-- it's definitely not a match."
"Well, who's that at the airport?"
I don't know.
"But whoever it is, it's not Air Marshal Mike Beers."
"All right, boss."
You got it;
we won't.
Won't what?
Why couldn't that be on speaker?
Gibbs doesn't want to alert the innocent bystanders that our friend over there is an imposter.
You were right.
You were right.
We were both right.
Then who is he?
Not a clue.
It was horrible.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Do you wanna tell me about it?
"Come on, let's stand."
Tell me.
(PANTING)
It was the same as last time.
"I was in this room, this red room."
"It was bright, blood red curtains, but there was no windows, no doors, so it didn't make sense, and I couldn't get in or out."
I was trapped.
"The curtains, they were on fire."
It was horrible.
It's okay.
"I was hunched in the corner, and I looked over into the other corner."
"And in the shadows, there was someone else there."
I could just see his eyes.
He was looking right at me.
It's okay.
It's over now.
"These nightmares, they will fade away, I promise."
Did they for you?
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
I'll sit with you until you fall back asleep.
Who else do I have to take care of?
They hoarded all of their greatest stolen treasures in here.
Piles of jewels and every room filled with coins.
Let's get to it.
The compass.
(SNIFFS)
What's your rush?
"Oh, the police station said he would be here."
You've just missed him.
Oh.
Are you OK?
"Um, maybe you could help."
"Um, do you think we could talk inside?"
Sure.
It might be nothing.
We had this guy hanging around the garden centre.
"Elly, our receptionist, saw him across the road two days before Henry Elliot was killed."
Did you confront him?
"To be honest, um, I was afraid."
"Ah, I know him."
"He's this guy I was at college with, we did the same philosophy course."
This bloke called Paul Fordyce.
Paul Fordyce?
Yes.
Do you know him?
The police are already questioning him.
"What, in connection with these murders?"
"I thought he was weird, but not a killer."
I can't talk about the case.
You'll have to talk to the police.
You don't think he's after me?
"Well, I don't know."
"Ah, can you think of any reason why he might be?"
No!
"Ah, I, I hope not."
I haven't seen him since college.
I didn't have you down as an academic.
"No, I, I'm not."
Which is why I left.
"Wait, wait, wait."
I haven't got it turned up enough.
Basil!
I said I suggest...
"Oh, my head, my head!"
Has it come away?
Did you bang your head?
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, dear."
Let me have a look.
You'd better go and lie down before something else happens.
Shut up!
Why don't you call the police?
"We will, the moment we've searched the rooms."
My money's been taken!
"Yes, yes, I know."
Try not to speak.
Is this a piece of your brain?
£85.
Take my arm.
"I don't need your arm, thank you."
I can get down the stairs perfectly well by myself.
"""Down"" the stairs?"
Don't stop when you get to the basement.
Keep straight on.
Give my regards to the earth's core.
Are you sure you can manage?
"And if you give us any more trouble, I shall visit you in the small hours and put a bat up your nightdress."
"Well, that was fun, wasn't it?"
"The odd moment like that, almost worth staying alive for, isn't it?"
"It's nice to share a moment like that, isn't it?"
"Yes, okay."
Thank you.
"You've seen the girl, now let's make this thing happen."
Jacob wants me to stay with her.
"He doesn't care about the money, he wants his daughter."
And he wants to remember who she is.
Where's the injection gun?
"Oh yes, this is vintage Jacob."
Always loves a chess game.
And always three moves ahead.
I have it.
It stays here.
It's the only way he'll give you his numbers.
You'll meet him at Fraumunster Church.
And what stops me from killing you right now?
Because you're a smart man.
"You're gonna meet Jacob, he'll call, you'll have us released and after that, you'll have the numbers and Jacob."
"You may have lost your memory Marta, but, uh, you still have balls."
"If you haven't heard from me in an hour, kill them both."
She really needs to go to the bathroom.
Do I look like I fucking care?
Just tell me where it is.
Fuck.
The end of the corridor.

"Oh, shit."
I'll walk.

She is almost as beautiful as my mother.
You could have telegraphed.
It was easier to take the train.
"On what platform you fell, a small mine?"
She was a woman betrothed to a gangster.
I spent the night with her.
I do not know where now.
And here I am.
- Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?
- I lost your luggage.
"The portrait of my mother, the last letter of my father,"
"I have his tie, handkerchief ..."
I don't know where ...
"""I loved,"" is not the truth."
You touched me.
Emotions ...
I do think about your father.
Beautiful was your father.
"It always falls before the beauty, especially if you do not bend."
What is the truth?
Wash whiter?
"My shirt the trip, the night."
The rain ...
Do you do this to cause idiocy?
I provoke the imbecility ...
The im-be-cyl-li-ta!
And when your mother came to Paris for the last time I ...
You just don't like him.
The guy...
Bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Are you all right?
"Hey, you don't look so good."
I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
Jackson!
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
Perfect.
Don't forget the dates.
"""Passengers arrived at the hospital doa."
The estimated time of death...
"9:26 P.M., June 14, 1995."""
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
What ever happened to that Amazon he used to go around with?
That Felice...
Felice something?
She was mad about him.
He wants to marry me.
"It would even things up, wouldn't it?"
We'd both be married.
It would make things so much fairer from now on.
-From now on?
-When we run into each other.
We won't.
"We know the same people, we go to the same places."
"-It would be difficult not to, wouldn't it?"
-Not at all.
"But what possible harm could there be in our having a drink now and then, or lunch?"
A great deal of harm.
"All right, Bran."
I'm sorry.
I just thought it might be fun.
"And remember, Isabel, there will be no telephone calls in the middle of the night, no mysterious telegrams, nothing."
We're not gonna have any trouble.
"I'll do exactly what you want, Bran."
Exactly what you want.
Oh.
"Oh, Alec."
"I just ran into Brandon Bourne, an old friend."
"Hello, Bourne, I've heard a great deal about you."
Get me a cab!
"Quick, get me a cab!"
Rosa.
How do you feel?
Baffled.
I'm sorry.
Let's see what frightened you.
It's okay.
Come.
"Dr. lemelle, allow me to introduce miss Porter, our new patient."
Isabel is new to her medication and she had a bit of a fright watching you work.
It was the noise.
It was still alive.
"It's distasteful, yes, but it's the only way to procure a fresh specimen."
Poor thing.
Perhaps.
"But I cannot Sally forth and saw at the skulls of dainty, melancholic humans for my research, can I?"
No.
"Come, Isabel."
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.
Here we are.
Thank you.
Safe and sound.
Do not wander the halls in a place like this.
Yes?
Yes.
"Good night, miss Porter."
Scream and I will slit your throat!
Please don't hurt me.
We need to build!
"Saying, but I didn't know you Were trying to go down a cliff."
I can't go that way.
This is the farthest you've Ever taken us out of nome.
This is the biggest gold We're going after.
Lookit.
"Everybody needs to get Their panties on, and let's go."
We got 'em on.
"If it's one of your games, I want it to stop."
Stop being paranoid.
You don't have to be poor to have good intentions.
There are people with money and ideals.
- Really?
I'd like to meet one.
"- Hello, Jacob."
Give me a break.
You never had any ideals.
I could be rude about your ideals and we could go on and on.
- We could go on being rude...
- Then tell me what he wants.
He doesn't care about the orphanage or humanitarian work.
It's bad business.
What does he want?
I don't know what he wants to do with the orphanage and Anna.
"I don't understand it, Jacob."
Then let me ask you a different way:
Do you know something I don't?
"No, Jacob, I know nothing."
That's all I wanted to know.
- May I offer you a cup of coffee?
- No thanks.
- Dare I offer you a glass of wine?
- Only if you've got enough.
Right.
Dare I ask how you've been?
The last twenty years?
They've been a bit up and down.
And you?
I've been fine.
Also a bit hectic.
"Hi, Mrs. Donovan."
Yeah.
"Okay, well, we're gonna be late."
- So let's just get going.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
"Every time I try to talk, he shuts me down."
- Think he's trying to find Katherine?
- I don't know.
He waited 145 years only to find out that Katherine could not care less.
"And it's gotta hurt, right?"
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
- You have every reason to be upset.
- Mm-hm.
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?
"Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's related to my ancestor, Katherine who screwed over your brother?"
Nah.
I haven't thought about it at all.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
It'd be nice if we could get through a day without having to deal with it.
No vampire mother or brother...
No vampires at all?
No vampires but you.
I just wanna get us back to normal stuff like school and homework.
Fun.
"Ooh, that sounds good to me, when do we start?"
We can watch a movie at my place.
Correct.
"Rosslare,"
"Republic of Ireland,"
"Fishguard in Wales, very well done."
I actually have taken that route on a ferry before.
You've taken that route on a ferry before?
That was so easy for you!
"Right, OK, Lutrophiles, over to you."
Find...
Reveal the hive.
"Kissinger, Nixon..."
Can you see Clinton and Albright?
Clinton and Albright?
Clinton...
"Actually, no, have we got two Ls to get it?"
Is Albright there?
Yes.
"Very good, for three points, your answers?"
Albright and Clinton.
Let's see if you're right.
"Wow, Albright and Clinton."
"Marianne, you were right on that."
I was hoping it was going to be that before it came up.
I don't know why.
Those were the first two that came into your mind?
So obviously Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright was his Secretary of State in his second term.
Do you know what she famously said about women who don't help other women?
"""There are is a special place in hell for women who don't help"
"""other women."""
What a gal!
"Right, so where are we at the end of that round?"
"Lutrophiles, very good with 15,"
"Don't you feel sorry for me, you fat, ugly pig."
You think I'm ugly?
"Look, I'm sorry about yesterday."
"I didn't mean it, okay?"
I'm not ugly.
You're ugly.
I'm not talking about it anymore.
I already told the cops and the doctors.
No one believes me.
They think I'm crazy.
"Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most."
"April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?"
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
When I --
"When I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head, but I couldn't control my body."
"I could see what I was doing, but I couldn't stop."
I just wanted to stop.
I'm sorry.
You don't need to apologize.
"April, some of the kids at school told the police that you and Taylor didn't get along."
"Well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her."
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
Just a couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you... happen to smell anything?"
Anything... like what?
Like rotten eggs or...
sulphur?
"Um, no."
Okay.
"I'm pretty sure you didn't give it to me the other night, Joe."
"You're right, but that's only because at the time"
"I didn't want to burden you with what was only a gut feeling, with fortunately turned out to be wrong."
You thought she was dead?
I did.
But I have confirmation that is not the case.
So where is she?
When's she coming home?
I don't know.
And she's not.
At least not anytime soon.
The word is that Doris is active again.
That's all I got.
Everything else is classified.
It's classified.
Wow.
Mm.
I want you to please keep looking for her.
"You shake the trees and you find her, okay?"
"Steve, your mom stayed hidden for 20 years."
She is not gonna be found.
She'll surface when she's ready.
Yeah.
When do you think that's gonna be?
I think that'll be when she's prepared to face you.
Hey.
How you holding up?
"I'm, uh..."
I'm a mess.
"You know, I just keep telling myself"
I did everything I could to save him.
"No, Catherine."
"Mmm, yummers."
"He reminds me of Scotty on ""General Hospital."""
"No, ew, Jenna, do not like that man."
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
[Exhales sharply]
Excuse me.
Hi.
What are you doing down here?
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
"Now, Afghanistan is a different situation."
[Indistinct conversations]
I'll have an apple juice.
"We don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a strict dress code at this place.
I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli.
They're very subtle.
"So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show, and I don't know how you feel about that..."
"Let me ask you a question, everybody at this table."
"Did he just say the word ""pumpkin"" to me?"
"Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli."
Yo!
I'm buggin'.
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.
It is the Right Cholla Navy's turn to save the people of this kingdom.
"June 2nd, 1592."
Yi Soon-shin's Left Cholla Navy launched another attack on the Japanese invasion force in Dang-po.
The enemy commander on this battle battle was Gurojima Mikiyuchi who had previously been routed in Sa-chun.
"Struck by Kwon Joon's arrow, Gurujima met his demise that day."
"In Yi Soon-shins 5th sea battle, the Battle of Dang-po, 21 Japanese ships were destroyed and 2.820 Japanese soldiers died in action."
"Winning is becoming a habit, High Commander!"
Sir!
"It's a counterattack, sir."
Alert the fleet!
Return to your positions and prepare for battle!
"Yes, sir!"
Third place:
"Kang Do-hyung, Min Hyung-suk, Han Joon-pil!"
Second place:
"Yi Suk-woo, Shin Jin-hwa!"
First place:
A scholar of Ahsan Song Byung-tek!
Make way!
Make way for the first place winner!
Make way!
Make way for the first place winner!
Huh?
!
What's he doing on that horse?
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
"Soon-shin, what happened?"
How did this happen?
Why him?
How did that no-good bastard take first place?
Just...
You wanna go?
Go on your bike.
"Yeah, yeah, go on your bike."
Fucking hell.
Sometimes it's easier just to say yes.
"Henry, catch!"
"God, I thought I lost you forever, Henry."
I was so scared.
I was so scared when you fell.
I thought I would never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
"If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea,"
I wouldn't need sugar.
"Yuri, pozhaluysta."
"Each year, 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia and, at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives you an idea of a great Russian pastime.
This is a rare surviving bat.
Estelle.
Would you please be so kind and stand up?
Or do you want to take her place?
"Estelle, your boy's quite the white knight, sacrificing himself to keep you alive only for my dick... to kill you later."
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
Brilliant!
"Uh, come over here, Henry."
"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but my higher self doesn't.
So like we told your people.
I can't imagine what these last 18 months have been like.
"So what do you want from us, Agent Pritchard?"
I want to start again.
If you have anything of Kevin's from that time...
We haven't touched his room.
So you can take whatever you want if it helps.
[Sniffles]
But don't call us again unless you have answers.
This is everything from Kevin's room?
Yep.
"So, start your timeline at zero."
What's your first event?
I'm gonna start with the suicide at SSU.
It happened a month before the first killing.
I'm not ready to call that a coincidence.
All right.
We'll call it event one.
Kevin Whitfield's event two.
"God, it's weird being here."
It looks just like your old place.
"Yeah, I kind of like it here."
Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.
"Hey, you don't have mine, do you?"
I'd like to see who came to my funeral.
"No, you wouldn't."
[Scoffs]
"Duval, did you really bust my car window 'cause I made your mom cry?"
Yeah.
I did.
Good for you.
Liz Kenyon.
You have to tell the truth.
"If Gene died from something he bought here, you are responsible."
Are you selling drugs?
No!
And we are done here.
You said you could help me.
You call this help?
She's practically accusing me of murder.
We're just trying to get to the bottom of this.
She's just the same as all the other mundanes.
They see the way we dress and they think we're freaks.
She's really just trying to help.
"It's okay, Coreen, I see who you're siding with -your minimum wage paycheck."
I thought you knew me.
I thought you understood the dark beauty of what I'm trying to create here.
I do!
Lexia!
"Hey, Coreen."
You came into this with an attitude about my friend and me and our lifestyle.
You were never looking to help her.
That is not true!
"Oh come on, think about it, Vicki, you can't ever trust anyone, can you?"
"Hey, excuse me, excuse me."
Oh my god!
Eew!
Yuck!
Eew!
Get off him!
911?
"Yeah, we need an ambulance to the Underground Club."
It's at Queen West and Crawford.
Thank you.
' I don't know.
I don't wanna take any chances.
We should get him as soon as possible.
'We'll be there in 24 hours.' I'll pick you up.
- You wanna go to the boat first?
- No.
First show us where he is.
He and his wife own a shirt shop close to Waikiki.
- How about his wife?
"- Yes, she's still alive."
- We may not have time for them both.
- That's OK.
He's our priority.
We're coming up to the shop.
It's busy.
I don't think we can take him here.
Don't linger too long.
He might see us.
"OK, I'll take you to the boat now."
"With those fancy shirts, that outrigger crew of yours had better win."
"Winning ain't important, pop, long as we look good at the luau later."
Typical Hawaiian philosophy.
"To win is important too, you know?"
You and Mrs Greenberg better be there Saturday to cheer us on.
Mama and I will be there.
You just win.
"OK, pops."
- What did you see?
- I don't have to see.
I feel.
- Here. it may be nothing.
- Nothing?
- Bye.
No way.
My mom will already be on my last nerve.
I don't want Viv getting on nerves
I haven't even discovered yet.
Touchdown!
That's another 5 bucks you owe me.
"Guys, this is my teaching assistant, Vali."
"Vali, these are my kids..."
"Oliver, Taylor, and Anna-Kat."
The boy seems shorter than I imagined.
"TV off, guys."
But we have a bet on the game.
Thanksgiving isn't about football.
It pretty much is.
It's only not when you have a dad who isn't into sports.
I'm into sports!
Name three NFL quarterbacks.
I don't have to prove anything to you.
TV off.
Greg!
You're killing me!
Why do you always invite one of your TAs?
You mean invite someone from a foreign land with nowhere to go to join us on a day when we open our hearts?
The last thing that I need...
Hi!
We are so happy that you are with us.
I like your track suit.
"I must say, you are very beautiful."
I like your size.
"Okay, that was creepy."
It's no less creepy than you hitting on my mom.

There she is.
We did it.
"You ought to be proud of yourself, boy."
Yeah.
We followed orders.
We just skipped the funeral part.
Don't go down there and start growing no conscience.
'Cause sure as night'll come they'll have us swinging from a couple ropes.
We did what we had to do.

FITZGERALD:
"We had the extra daysowe managedtodig a little deeper, lay rocks on top so scavengers couldn't get at him."
It was done right and all.
He was buried right.
"Sir, can we--"
The truth is that...
"(CLEARS THROAT) ...when Hawk disappeared, I was worried about savages."
"And I was ready to get, to move on out."
"Yeah, but, Bridger here argued to stay."
"He argued to stay so he could at least build a cross or something to put on top of Glass's grave, and that's what he did."
That's what we did.
"I'm glad you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger."
"He more than pulled his weight, Captain."
"This man here, he was my partner."
"Linda, pick any wine."
It can even be a wine he knows.
Any wine?
"If you can get one wine right, just one, you win the whole competition."
"In fact, you could pick a wine he had last night."
I'll still know it before he does.
"Ooh, bonus round."
"Whoever says what it is first, wins."
What's the point?
"You can do this, Bobby."
"No, I can't."
"Look at me, Bobby."
I-I can't.
Yes you can.
I have a blindfold on.
"Well, you can do the mystery wine."
"All right, fine."
Pour it.
At least I'll get drunk-ish.
"That's it, Bobby."
"Hey, look what's coming around the mountain."
The train.
"Just kidding about the mountain, uh, but the train is..."
remember that song?
Uh-oh.
"Guys, she's coming back faster."
This only happens when the train's running behind schedule or this one time when they ran out of rosé and things got weird.
It's starting to look kind of like a real train now.
"Like fast, and dangerous."
We could just get a cab.
"Oh, look, there's Ethan."
He's headed toward the Juice Caboose!
Good.
That means you have to do right by her.
That's all I'm trying to do.
Then leave her.
Never.
She has a destiny and you?
This life?
You're gonna keep her from it.
"Okay, you believe in magic?"
I take it you do.
So will you.
Trust me.
I'm gonna show you something.
Something that's gonna make you look at everything differently.
"And when you see what I have in here, you're gonna listen."
You're gonna believe every word I say.
(LID CREAKS)
"Yeah, right."
(SNIFFS)
"Okay, I'm listening."
There is a curse and it needs to be broken.
Emma is the key.
I was tasked with keeping her on track.
"And you, my friend, just got caught in the crossfire."
Now I'm gonna tell you a story.
"And at the end of it, you're gonna have to make a decision, will you do the right thing or not."
"So, are you ready?"

I see that she's stayed out all night.
"I'm sure she was with Yoon Jae, right?"
!
Is your daughter staying out all night something to be smiling about?
"They're going to get married in a month, so who cares?"
"With Yoon Jae always sending Da Ran home on time,"
I was worried something was wrong with Yoon Jae.
But I guess not...
Shall we invite Yoon Jae over today and make him some grilled eel?
Don't make things so obvious like that and embarrass those kids.
You're right...
Things like that...
You do for them without making it obvious.
How can you feed him eel without making it obvious?
"If you put the eel in the stuffing and give it to him in a dumpling form, don't you think that'll work?"
Eel dumplings?
!
(Eels are good for a man's virility)
Should I grow out a beard?
It's not even my body.
Why am I itchy?
Does this guy have dry skin?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Da Ran!

Looks like Yoon Jae!
Wait!
Wait!

My ship!
Blast!
This'll take weeks to repair.
"Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2."
My ship has run off course en route to sector 1 2.
I've crash-landed on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep.
Terrain seems a bit unstable.
No readout yet if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.
Hello!
Whoa!
Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Did I frighten you?
Didn't mean to.
Sorry.
Howdy.
My name is Woody.
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
"And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up."
"This is my spot, see, the bed here."

It's about time you got here.
"I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit."
My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
"Yes, it is a mistake because, you see, the bed here is my spot."
I need to repair my turbo boosters.

- Right.
You've gotten mixed up with dangerous people.
- Like the mob?
- Sort of.
"Jenny, Olivia put a hit on you."
That's why Samir's been so distant.
He was protecting me.
Maybe he was leading you on.
Getting a piece of tail on the side while mouthing promises about leaving his wife.
Then he gets bored and just bails without even a goodbye.
Or whatever.
"I'm sure he cared about you, Jenny."
I can tell him to handle Olivia before somebody gets killed.
"Now get some rest, okay?"
Tell her what she's dealing with.
It's not fair.
No.
"I start talking about that stuff, Fae get mad at me and things start sucking."
"This is our life now, Kenzi."
We have to protect it.
This is how you want to play this game?
What a maverick.
Guess what.
I got 10 cops a week who pull this stunt in here.

How could you not see it on the chair?
You're getting emotional.
That's because I know what it's like to lose a pet!
I happen to know that you were high at my mother-in-law's wake.
"You were talking non-stop for 20 minutes, nothing but gibberish."
My mother's wake.

-You want to read your statement?
-I don't write nothing down.
So I'll keep this short and sweet.

"- How am I supposed to do my job, knowing you were at the casino the night Lau died?"
"- Yeah, I should have told you that."
"- And yet, once again, you didn't."
"You're the reason I've got to where I am, Harry."
Everything I've learnt has come from you these two years but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you screw it up for me.
Detective Superintendent Winter and I couldn't be quite sure who was interviewing who.
"Yeah, you have to think the way they do."
- Should be quite easy for you.
- You'd be a smart arse if you were smart.

I should never have bought it for her.
It's too big.
The bike was fine.
She loved it.
What?
"Sit down, Harry."
You look thin.
You said you were ready to come back to work.
- I am.
- Let me talk to that prick.
So what's the problem?
"Taylor is playing hardball, he won't budge on the price."
You assured me you could do this.
Do I need to send someone else out there who can make this happen?
"No, I'll get it done."
The clock is ticking.
- I thought you were his favorite.
- Things change.
Let me guess...
"Tall, brown hair."
How did you know?
"When things get stressful, Marcus reverts to his old bad habits."
What does that mean?
His wife.
Tall... brown hair...
"Really quite the beauty, until she wasn't, but I guess we all have our weaknesses, uh?"
- I didn't know he was married.
- Oh yeah.
"A long time ago, it didn't end well."
"Then again, what does?"
I have missed you.
I haven't thought of you once.
Maybe it's time for you to get out.
Maybe it's time for you to shut up!
Close the deal and get out.
"I will, I have to."
"What are you up to, Chase?"
I need change.
What do you mean?
Uh-oh.

This can't be good.
No.
I just...
I have something really important I need to tell you and...
You could be mad.
Really mad.
But I just care about you too much to not tell you that...
That you're Hannah Montana?
Please don't interrupt me.
This is really...
Huh?
I know you're Hannah Montana.
How?
"It was that blabbermouth Siena, wasn't it?"
Didn't need any help on this one.
You both have the same beautiful eyes.
And amazing smile.
And then there's the fact that I told Miley that my dad.
Was stationed overseas and then two days later.
Hannah had a concert for kids whose parents were stationed overseas.
Hmm.
I was hoping you'd think that was just a coinkydink.
Come on six years and the rest of the world hasn't put it together.
Well the rest of the world isn't in love with Miley Stewart.
You're in love with me?
Yeah.
Um...
Unless you're not in love with me then I take that back.
"Because, you know, I'm cool."
Aw.
I saw you at the station and your picture later on such a beautiful boy.
"I thought I've got to have him, even if it kills me."
I like your spiel nobody's ever told me that before.
Spieling is my profession.
I kept lobbying with Christine...
and hoping that you would come.

Three dead!
Look at those urns!
I'll be damned!
Chrissy's family grave.
She had all three of them cremated.
A fourth and they can play bridge.
- Did you know they were dead?
- Of course.
"The whole town knows, and even pities her."
Pities her?
"She let them die, and I know how!"
"- Oh, come off it!"
- She had one crash with a parachute.
She fed one to the lions and sank the other at sea.
Bet she didn't tell you!
Bullshit!
One of them had to show off in the Safari Park the second one's parachute didn't open and the third...
And who'll be the fourth?
!
- Get your hands off me!
- You or me!
Are you Sicilian?
"No, I'm Calabrese."
"We're practically paisan, do me this favor."
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.
"Besides, the new tenants pay more rent."
How much more a month?
Five bucks.
Here's six months increase in advance.
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.
Come see me in another six months.
"Of course, the dog stays."
Right?
The dog stays.
Who the hell are you to come give me orders?
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass right into the street!
Do me this favor.
I won't forget it.
Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me.
They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
What a character!
That landlord is here...
"Roberto, the one who owns those ratholes."
He's been asking all around the neighborhood about you.
"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Don Vito."
"What can I do for you, Don Roberto?"
What a misunderstanding!
Holy Mary!
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!
I'm giving back the money you gave me.
"Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!"
The victims are all over the map.
"Four men, three women."
Different ethnicities and ages.
Each of the victims had something removed...
"An ear, an eye, a finger."
Why?
What's the significance of that?
There is none.
"And because of the randomness, no one was able to connect the murders."
"Until Phillip Harris, of course."
So Phillip was right.
A serial killer's been hunting in L.A. and New York for three years completely under the radar.
All this way for a dead end.
"Oh, it might be for the best."
Ignorance is bliss.
"No, ignorance is hell."
Mr. Castle.
The GDS is requesting my presence at headquarters.
This must mean I passed their test and they want me to join their ranks.
"I hate to burst your fanboy bubble, but how do you know this is on the up-and-up?"
Is this on the up-and-up?
"Yes, sir."
What are you doing?
Watching your back.
Oh.
"Uh, we have..."
Hello.
"Mr. Castle, Ms. Shipton. [Door closes]"
It's a pleasure to meet both of you.
I'm Mason Wood.
What a pleasure.
I cannot even believe I'm here.
- What shall we make of that?
"- Made your point, Fi."
- Did I?
- Yep.
You did.
What about D.C.?
- You still goin'?
- I have to.
"If I don't, it won't be long before Cowan sends someone else here to kill me."
I need him to know I can get to him too.
I need him to know right now.
And you need help.
And you know it.
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Is that a tactical judgment or a personal one?
- Both.
Everybody I know is in danger right now- everyone I'm close to.
Well...
I'm willing to risk it... if you are.
- How's my mom?
- Locked up cozy and tight with a cigarette and a shotgun... ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
"- Here you go, Doug."
My lucky vest.
- It'll look great over my shirt.
- Thanks.
"- It's a little worn, but it'll do the trick."
- Are these bullet holes?
- Yeah.
I broke it in for you.
It's a short ride to the U.S. Attorney's office.
Just think of it as a precaution.
It's like a seat belt.
"This isn't working, Allan."
"You are always so distant, so concerned with climbing the ladder."
"For us, Syd."
It was always for us.
I believe you.
I do.
"But somewhere along the line, you actually forgot about me."
"I mean, look at us."
We don't even fight with passion anymore.
"The hot and cold I can take, but this numbness in between..."
So does that make this all okay?
"No, it doesn't make it okay."
But don't pretend like I'm the only one with secrets.
Look at your face.
You think I actually believe that was an accident?
"No, I just was trying to get ahead, Syd."
That's all I've ever done.
"Well, maybe trying to get ahead, you just fell behind."
Okay.
I'll go...
I'll go get a hotel.
"Allan, wait..."
"Can I get a J D straight up, please?"
Big night ahead?
Epic.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Can I get another one?
"Preferably in a bigger glass, if you don't mind."
"That's the biggest glass I got, sir."
I guess I'll be keeping you busy then tonight.
- We are.
What's happening in D.C.?
I'm working on legislation that would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It will be like taking 100 million cars right off the street.
- It'd be groundbreaking.
- Impressive.
- The other...
- For the record?
I don't see why I should be the one to take the fall for this.
- I wasn't the only one that knew.
- You're bearing the brunt because you're here.
"Believe me, I wish that Tommy and Kevin were here too."
- Is it always like this?
- You dreamed of having a baby sister.
"Sarah, you know what?"
"I was six, OK?"
That wish didn't include Dad cheating on Mom.
"I didn't know what to do, Kitty."
So I thought the best thing to do was nothing.
So shoot me.
Oh.
Do you like cigars?
I got some good ones and we could...
That would be great.
You didn't know what to do so you did nothing.
"I would've told you, Sarah!"
"Justin, where are you?"
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
- I can't make it.
I'm sorry.
- What?
My mom's been cooking all day.
Me.
... who has dedicated his entire life...
How would you like to be lmogene's godfather?
... to himself.
You must be joking.
I'll drop her at her christening.
"I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her."
"The thing is, a person's life is like a TV show."
"Oh, my God."
- Can I come in?
- No.
"I was the star of ""The Will Show""."
"And ""The Will Show"" wasn't an ensemble drama."
You will end up childless and alone.
"Both fingers crossed, yeah."
And then something terrible happened.
Something I'd tried to avoid all my life.
"This year, Will's life is going to change."
"Alone, bad."
"Friend, good."
He's reaching out.
I want to go out with her.
- I'd like her to be my girlfriend.
- Brilliant!
"Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
He fancies you.
He told me.
"From the producers of ""Meet the Parents""."
I think I killed a duck.
"Jesus, what a family."
I was in some strange territory.
Was I frightened?
If you have the meetings in the evening... nobody wants to come out.
Everybody's just so afraid.
It's a question of what you people really want to do.
Do you want this community or what?
"Ted, I realize that we are the community."
That's right.
Nothing's going to happen until we do what I said.
Are you down with o.p.p.?
You know me.
I really do understand that.
We just can't go around...
Let's cross the street.
Put your hand down.
"- Hey, man."
- You want this?
What for?
I ain't crossing' the street for nobody.
"Leave me alone, Maxine."
"- Dad, come on."
"- Ted, don't be crazy."
- Are you scared?
"- Yeah, I'm scared."
I don't have to prove nothing to nobody.
"I want to see a hero, I'll rent Rambo."
"You go ahead on, then."
We got to get these young people involved in this.
What did I just say?
I said give me the green.
"You lucky that didn't break, old man."
"See you later, old man."
Don't see me later.
"See me now, punk... 'cause I ain't crossin' no street."
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll tryto find out.
See you Saturday.
Did you find out anything?
"Not yet, but I will."
Be patient.
"I was patient until the baby was due, but that was a month ago."
You have to keep waiting.
Fuck!
What do you do here all day?
I work in the sick bay.
"The jail is new, so there aren't many people."
It's very quiet.
"From outside, it doesn't look like a jail."
Forget the jail!
My problem is not seeing Alicia.
You can see the different strings unifying the dimensions.
The gravitational infinities canceling each other out.
You see them.
"Right, Dr. Bryar?"
You see them because you have the tools.
Your mind is that tool.
"- He's one of them, Ted."
One of them.
- Shut up!
It's going on too long.
I'm going in.
"And I have to believe that if you put your mind to it, you'll realize that only you can make Leo stop."
You can make him stop by understanding him.
By understanding that he is a liar and he only wants bad things for you.
"- I need to believe that, Dr. Bryar."
"- I said kill him, Ted!"
I had to.
He was going to kill us.
I had to.
God forgive me.
We need an ambulance.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's a little late for all that.
You going to the hospital?
I'm going to ride in with the psychiatrist.
See you over there.
- She going to be all right?
- Yeah.
I think so.
"Gideon, will you tell him that I don't need to go to the hospital?"
"Okay,first batch of gold purchased nine months ago and paid for with a money order."
-The second batch... -that was abby.
She was searching non-standard databases with the thirdoman's dna.
She got a hit on a bone marrow donor bank.
Pull it up.
That's not what I expected.
Her father died of leukemia.
Pick her up.
Take dinozzo with you.
You interrogated her and didn't pick up she had sex with finn?
"It was an interview,not an interrogation-- and excuse me if my brain didn't go to the sex place."
Mine would.
I'm sure tt's why you have a leg up on other investigators.
See?
"You say ""leg up,"" i instantly went to the sex place."
hey!
"Whoa,whoa,whoa!"
"Hey,stop!"
stop!
"I'm sorry,I need to go."
I have a showing... at ncis.
What's going on?
Hey.Hey!
Stop pointing a gun at my fe.
She tried to rat on us.
-She means rabbit.
-Rabbit.
Yes.
I was in a hurry for a showing.
Are you arresting her?
Taking her to ncis to answer a few questions.
"Well,I'm coming too."
"I nearly got the suspect, but he escaped."
Where's your razor sharp intuition?
Many people want me to fail... so this case means a lot to me.
I don't need you letting me down.
You always were a pain in the ass.
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.
"Sir, I do nothing for nobody."
I'll get the murderer.
You'll get your promotion.
I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top.
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.
He's over 30.
He looks determined... without being ruthless.
There's something heroic about him.
He doesn't look like a killer.
He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
- Hello.
"- It's me,Jeffrey."
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?
I want my money now.
I want it tonight.
Tonight!
"Sure, I'll bring it tonight."
Mr. Weng.
You should let me handleJeffrey.
He's my responsibility.
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.
"I don't trust anyone, including you!"
I know the rules ofthe game.
No.
It's the truth.
And I'm sorry that I didn't mention it before.
"Honestly, it's still sort of confusing, trying to figure out how to explain it to people."
I think it's intriguing.
"Honey, we should probably get going soon."
"Hi, Sally..."
I should apologize for the way I ran off before.
I'm Samantha.
I'm having sex with your husband.
My wife doesn't usually meet the people
I'm sleeping with.
"Oh, dear."
Sorry about that.
It's fine.
We're both still a little shaky on the rules.
Got it.
"Look, I should probably go talk to her."
But I meant what I said before.
I'd like to see you again.
So...
Let me know.
Sure.
Definitely.
"Sure, they're throwing me a party now, but the ballet world is brutal."
"The girl I'm replacing was out by 24, with busted knees and a torn groin muscle..."
"Oh, and anorexia."
So at least she was skinny.
That's awful.
You don't get many shots at this.
"So when it comes, you have to claw for it..."
Even if it destroys you.
Who's the lucky one?
"Let me do it, Hoffy."
You want to go?
No.
I just want to draw.
"Okay, draw."
"Suppose we call this my tag, I'll take him out."
"No volunteers, Price."
I said we're all in on it.
You guys elected me Security.
"The way things have been going I guess I've done a poor job, and I wanna make up for it."
- That asking too much?
- We've all done a poor job-.
I still say this is my tag.
"Any objections, Hoffy?"
"- Any objections, men?"
-Not from me.
- He can have it.
-Who are we to argue with a hero?
"- How about me latching on, Price?"
-Three is a crowd especially if you've got to cut through wire.
Let's have the wire cutters.
- Are the civilian clothes ready?
-Coming up.
Get to work on the trap door.
"What do you say, Hoffy?"
We hit the air-raid trenches then cut out back of Barracks 9.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is.
In the water tank.
Good spot.
"You can't touch me, Sheriff!"
I brought my attack dog with the built-in force field.
"Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs."
"Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!"
"You're going to jail, Bart!"
Say goodbye to the wife and Tater Tots.
"You saved the day again, Woody."
You're my favourite deputy.
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
"Come on, let's wrangle up the cattle."
When the road looks rough ahead
"And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed"
"Round 'em up, cowboy!"
Just remember what your old pal said
"Boy, you've got a friend in me"
Yee-haw!
"Yeah, you've got a friend in me"
"Hey, cowboy!"
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Big and stronger too
"Come on, Woody."
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
"It's me and you, boy"
And as the years go by
Whoa!
Whoa!
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
All right!
"Okay, I think we got some things out in the open."
"Nathan, do you think that basketball is part of your families problem?"
- Part of.
- But you still like playing?
I don't know anymore.
"Great, nice break through Nate."
"Thanks, Doc."
- Dan.
- Hustle up!
No way this is helping.
"You're right, Dan, we don't need a shrink to identify this families problem, you just made it obvious."
"I'm not his only parent, Deb."
"- Hey why don't you ride with your old man, Nathan."
"- Stop it, Dan."
"Come on Nathan, lets go."
Let the kid make up his own mind.
"What do you say, son?"
Nate?
Nathan!
Here we go.
This is the writer I was talking about.
Somerset Maugham?
"Well its, ""Maugham"""
- Human Bondage.
- Bondage!
"Yeah, its not like that."
"So, you're good."
Are we done here?
"Well, I just thought that this was a better opportunity for us to spend some time, you know, hang out with each other."
"And it is, but can we maybe do it someplace that smells a little less funky?"
"Haha, it's the smell of old books."
Like I said!
What once was good is always good.
Then maybe we should translate in the meantime.
Is that possible?
"What do you mean, possible?"
"I mean, why don't you translate it?"
I need to think about it.
What do you say?
"I said, I'd think about it."
I have to get back to the theater.
I'm sorry this visit was so short.
"Bye, Goni."
- Bye.
I don't believe a word you say.
What?
You think I'll never get out of here.
So you come with this gesture of yours.
You just came to insult me.
"- Yitzhak, don't be ridiculous."
You liar!
Just like the last time.
"Daddy, calm down."
Drink.
Drink.
I brought your licorice.
I don't want licorice and any chocolate from that snake.
He's doing it because he feels bad.
- He feels fine.
"You're acting like an idiot, but do as you like."
"You cried in the middle of the play when I got beaten in ""The Fiddle""."
So what?
You were four and you were howling.
The cast stopped the play until Mommy took you backstage so you'd see I was okay.
Kat's accident...
Casey.
"Why did you become a priest, father?"
Was... was there...?
Your grandmother.
That's right.
El Papa Mexicano.
I love that story.
"Yes, um a story."
My parents split up when I was... quite young.
"My father, never saw much of him."
So I lived with my mom.
"My friends were mostly... well, her friends, adults."
"Always moving, always changing schools."
It was when we lived in D.C. that... they called it a nervous breakdown.
Except it wasn't a breakdown.
You know how sometimes kids have an imaginary friend?
I had one.
"To me, he looked like a... little red bird."
He could do just about anything.
Correction.
He could make me do... just about anything.
At first he made me feel special.
Then...
I can't remember most of it.
Thankfully.
"Post-traumatic amnesia, it's called."
"Afterwards, I just wanted to move on with my life, put it behind me."
"But my mother, she was always finding new ways to use my story to make a buck."
"""This is the path God gave us, sweetie, use it."""
But I...
I ran away from all that.
We were playing pinochle.
It's a rough game.
"Pardon me, sir."
"Since you want us to speak up, there was a man removed from this barracks last night."
A Lieutenant Dunbar.
We'd appreciate your looking into it.
That's if they haven't shot him yet.
Why was the man arrested?
Sabotage.
He blew up a train.
"They'd have to prove that, wouldn't they?"
Isn't that what the Geneva Convention says?
You can't just take a man and shoot him.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Of course you did.
Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar.
The S.S. is running around in circles.
The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people.
And von Scherbach has caught the fish.
"Most amusing, isn't it?"
Uh-uh.
You are being rude again.
I just wanna go to sleep.
Nine-thirty.
General von Pfeffinger will be at his desk by now.
Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
"Hauptkommando Berlin, General von Pfeffinger."
Dringend.
These were captured by our spy satellite cameras.
It's a public base on the Pacific Coast.
We'll see if we can talk to the fighter jet pilots and get a report from them.
Department Head?
"The wind is so strong, why did you open the window?"
- Because it was a bit stuffy.
- I understand.
Then I will leave first.
"""Twenty people were betrayed by their own country."
"I will definitely come to take it."""
My child!
"No, no, no, no!"
My child!
My child!
No...
My child...
"No, don't."
My child...
Mu Yeol is dead.
I will take the child and support him.
"Only without this child, can you find your own happiness."
Start all over again.
You must be happy.
"Silence that child, if you want to live!"
"Mu Yeol, I took the child and I'll give him his name."
Not as Park Yun Seong but as Lee Yun Seong.
I will go on.
"This is the world's cruelest revenge, because that's the reason I survived."
-=10 years later
"- The Golden Triangle, Northern Southeast Asia=-"
"Boss, this man stole our drugs to sell."
How do we deal with it?
"It sucks, sixth grade!"
"Feet off the bed, please."
Okay.
Feet off.
"Oh, the heinie bounce."
Good choice.
"Very cute, Harriet, very cute."
"The neighbors will ask me,"
"""What happened to Harriet Welsch?"""
"""I don't know,"" I'll answer."
"""Such a shame."
"""She disappeared without a trace."
"And she was so adorable."""
"How long have you been with me, Golly?"
Since you were born.
"11 years and 12,000 tomato sandwiches ago."
"And you'll never leave me, right?"
"Well, I won't leave you ""leave you,"" Harriet, but, you know, one day you're going to be big enough."
"And well... well, big enough to take care of yourself."
And when that day comes you won't need me and I'll be gone.
But you know what?
That day is not today.
"And now, it's time for bed."
Are Mom and Dad tucking me in?
No.
They're at a very fancy party and I bet they're thinking about you right now.
Really.
"Listen, I think I can hear 'em."
Harriet... listen to everything Golly says to you.
"We're drinking champagne and eating caviar, Harriet."
Come on.
Let's go to bed.
Is that you?
Why'd you leave so early this morning?
We could've shared an Uber.
[chuckles]
"Oh, I didn't want to wake you..."
Or talk more.
I've almost never been up to this floor.
Now I guess I have six-foot-four reasons to come hang out.
Boop!
"See you at lunch, bae!"
ALL:
Ooh!
I can't believe Amy works here.
And why is she acting like we're dating after one casual night of the best sex of her life?
Because you straight-up agreed to date her?
"Uh, don't you remember?"
"Uh, no."
"Oh, no, Jack, did you do that thing where you only act like you're listening and instead just say ""uh-huh"" and ""great"" to everything?"
So nice to put a face to the paycheck.
Uh-huh.
This has been fun.
You're a good listener.
Great.
"Look, I'm done sleeping around, but if you think we have something real here..."
Uh-huh.
...then let's go back to your place.
"Wait, what?"
"Oh, great!"
EMMA:
Wait.
So you only heard the part when she brought up sex?
"Isn't that gross, Clark?"
only the crickets answered.
And to make us more nervous...
Was he armed?
"Hey, that's when..."
I said:
We're going in.
I was determined.
Ducky was panicking.
"I thought he went to get the tire iron, but no."
He came back with a flashlight.
"I told C,duIie: don't move!"
"As we were about to go into the field, the corn started moving."
"Touchy was coming out, holding the kid by the arm."
He runs fast but not in the corn.
The kid let himself fall to the ground.
"I put the 12 gauge in his face, to keep him quiet."
When Touchy caught his breath...
What's he done to make me run like this?
Ducky showed him what the problem was.
The smashed statue.
The black kid looked at Touchy who couldn't get over it.
"Oh well, well, well..."
The kid looked less arrogant than before.
"And that's when C,duIie said:"
"Let him go, boys."
Boys...
She still called us that.
So if I understand...
"Mrs Lajeunesse wanted to let him go, but you didn't want to."
I agreed with her.
I said:
She's right.
"What are you doing here, Ryner?"
What could I say?
- This su...
"- If you say this sucks, I'm beating you up."
Don't hit me!
Relax.
The bleeding will start again.
Why are you so badly injured?
Forget the injuries.
There's something I have to tell you.
Your younger sister is gone.
Apparently she was killed some time ago.
"How do you know that, Ryner?"
I see.
I see it now.
"You're another pawn of Roland, aren't you?"
I didn't want to hear it.
I didn't want to hear that my sister is dead!
"Not from you, certainly!"
You knew it all?
"You knew that, and laughed?"
When I said I cared about you were you laughing at me for being such a foolish girl?
I had a vague idea that my sister might be dead.
But what could I do?
I...
I...
Why do we have wars?
I've got no interest in who owns what land.
That's why I said I liked afternoon naps the most.
"Tahile, Tony, and Fahle all died senseless deaths."
What are you saying?
It must be the motivated guys who start wars.
The timing is the key.
"Ifwe delaythe Germans by a half an hour or more, that'll solve the problem..."
They'll face the encirclement.
"How many people will you assign to the attack, mayor?"
I won't let you burythe whole regiment here.
I agree.
The Germans are not to be worried right now.
And I'll send my scout companythere.
"-Yes, I will."
-What yes?
-They'll be there.
-Who will be?
-Malyutin and his people.
- Malyutin?
-Do you mean the guywho killed the saboteurs?
- That very Malyutin.
"He isjust a boy, you know such people."
But a verytalented one.
-Will you issue such an order?
"-Yes, I will."
Because you'll give it to me.
And the orders are not to be discussed.
"OK, it is all hot talk."
We might tryto find some other solution.
"In any case, I'm not going to bury my people for peanuts."
Comrade colonel...
-What?
-A new one.
The former one was better.
OK. I'll help you if I can.
You know everything will be assigned to this breakthrough.
"Please, pass overto your Malyutin my request. lt is not an order."
Uncommonly pretty eyes.
Oh!
Ow.
Ooh.
- Are you all right?
Ow.
Ow.
13.
"Nail-biting stuff, this is, isn't it?"
Ladies... it is with some surprise...
I announce the vote to be... a tie.
"This means that, as president, I have the casting -"
So sorry I'm late!
"Uh bit of an accident on my bike, Mrs..."
Madam President.
"You haven't voted yet, have you?"
"- Indeed we have, Claire."
"The vote was a tie, which means that I have the casting vote."
"With all due respect, Madam President -"
And I cast my vote in favour of closing the Institute for the duration of the hostilities.
But...
But I'm here now.
And it's lovely to see you.
"But, alas, I'm afraid too late for you to vote."
"I respect what you said about loyalty this morning, Mrs Cameron Madam President."
"Think very carefully about what you're about to say, young lady."
"Feel free to speak your mind, Miss Hillman."
You're among friends here.
I'm not ashamed to say the thought of war scares me.
"It terrifies me, if I'm honest."
But that's why I need this.
You.
"Where does he get the balls, all right?"
To tell America's greatest city to drop dead.
- That's just it.
He never said that.
"The Daily News said he did, but he didn't say it."
"- Oh, I don't care."
"You don't, as leader of the free world, tell this city, I mean, this great city, which by the way, gave more of its sons and brothers to every war, you know, since we kept the British from"
crossing the Hudson River.
"- Not accurate, but I get your point."
- How-
"- How do you tell a whole city of New Yorkers to drop dead, all right?"
New York is the greatest city in the world.
- Paris is a better city.
- He's right.
We got nothing on Paris.
- I wish I was in Paris right now.
- What's so fucking great about Paris?
- Shut up.
"- Their cheese, their bread, the way they kiss, eau de toilett."
Cancan.
Pete:
Hey.
- Everything's better.
Pete:
"Hey, hey, hey!"
You fucking playing backgammon over there?
Close that shit up.
We don't do that here.
You heard me.
"Close it up now, and get out."
Horace:
Get outta here.
"Hey, fellas, what's up ?"
- Look at this stud.
"- What's up, man ?"
"Hey, playah."
"How you doin', man ?"
"Whass up, baby ?"
"Oh, no love."
No love.
I hear you been traveling in new circles.
What's up with that ?
- You tapping' that white girl ?
- [ All Laugh ]
That's why you ain't got more time for your boys?
Too busy fronting ?
"Too busy snow flaking. lf that's the case, you best be watching your back."
'Cause white women don't bring nothing' but trouble.
"That ain't white women, man."
That's women.
- That's your women.
"- Yo, are we gonna check out... some honeys on the westside ?"
- You riding ?
"- Hell, no."
This ain't about no honeys.
I know what it's about.
Those fools we stomped at Stepps hit my corner four strong last week.
- l gotta handle myself.
"- You slide out that side oftown,"
- they gonna handle you.
- They can bring it. I got my heat.
"All that gat's gonna do is create some unnecessary mayhem, man."
That's the black man's life-  madness and mayhem.
- How do you know ?
The cafeteria's right this way.
They know me there.
I'll get us a good table.
- You would do that for me?
"- Oh, yeah."
"I'm very tight with Bertha, the lunchroom lady."
"Yeah, I once rescued a dolphin from her hair net."
"OK, maybe it'll last a few years."
"Yes, I'm acting principal now, and the pressures would be daunting for a man half my age."
Fortunately I have a vitality that belies my years.
I'm the only one who doesn't know how it's done.
"Listen, I think I found something that kind of works."
- What?
- This.
"Hi, Shawn."
- Wow.
From across the hall.
"- Yep, I got a 30-foot range."
"- What, you just jerk your head?"
- Watch again.
"I'm still young enough, I can do this twice in a row."
"Shawn, it's so strange."
I was just thinking about you.
And that's without conditioner.
"Cory, what is it?"
"- You were just drawn to me, weren't you?"
"- No, I thought you had head lice."
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm great."
"- Oh, good."
"- Hi, Topanga."
I was just thinking about you.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
Reagan...
I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The F.B. I. Called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to D.C. For a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
I could postpone the meeting... find out what they asked the other folks before going in there.
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
I'll just go in then.
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett...
Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"Yeah, he was... he was one of the best."
"Yes, he was."
I miss him too.
"But we're working together now, and you need to trust me."
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
But you inherited me.
You didn't... see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
That's a lot of cash for a corporal that barely clears 30 thou a year.
You think it's dirty?
"It's gotta be, right?"
"I mean, why else would Jared hide this much cash in his garage?"
"Plus, where'd he get it?"
Maybe he stole it from a bank.
This looks like a dye pack went off.
"Hmm, apparently our marine isn't as squeaky-clean as he seems."
"Well, only way to find out is to figure out where the cash came from."
FBI specializes in bank robberies.
"Maybe I'll send Gregorio the serial numbers, see if she can trace 'em."
Gregorio?
Aren't we supposed to leave her alone?
It's just a quick check.
It won't take her a minute.
"Yeah, uh-huh."
(imitating):
Uh-huh.
(chuckles)
"Lasalle, you know these people?"
"Melody, what are you doing here?"
"I'm sorry, Chris, I told him not to come, but..."
Who are you?
(grunts)
Hey!
The baby's father!
That's who I am!
Stay the hell away from my son!
(struggling)
Bend your arms now!
Son of a bitch!
"Melody, talk to me."
"Hello, Virginia."
"Um, my mother is not one-night-stand material."
"Yeah, you're right."
It wasn't night and we weren't standing.
Hey-oh!
That didn't happen.
You're right.
It didn't.
You just winked.
"No, I didn't."
You just did it again!
"Look, bottom line:"
I need you to proxy bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
"Hey, wow, that'd be good on a hat."
"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
You're picking now to get some self-respect?
You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
That was you.
"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
I'm sorry.
"T-To hook up with a girl,"
I have to connect with her at least a little.
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
"Nothing about weird poets or buildings or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me with the subject line ""Food for thought."""
"Please, Ted."
I need this.
Fine.
You win.
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
Right.
"I've seen how crazy it can get at those tables, and sometimes, people lose control."
They give in to their emotions.
You will not.
You understand?
Yeah.
Get some rest.
- Some rest?
"- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow."
Tomorrow?
I have a Quantitative Literacy paper due Tuesday.
"- No, you don't."
- I don't?
"No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly."
"I told him you were helping me with a special assignment, and he understood, so he gave you an A."
"You see, Ben, amazing things can happen from the inside."
You'll get a call about details later.
"So did the girls go on ahead, huh?"
"Oh, yeah."
"They got a lot more bags to check, you know?"
Okay.
"Well, wait for us by security 'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head."
"No, I'm good."
"No, I really think you should go."
It's a long flight.
"- No, I'm okay."
- We're going to the bathroom.
"Honestly, I really don't have to go."
- I don't care what you have to do.
"- Look, I really don't have to..."
Please just shut up.
Why are you looking over there?
"You didn't tell them what it was about, did you?"
No.
I swear to you I wouldn't tell anyone.
"This is bad, Max."
I got to go.
"Can I have a lemonade, please?"
Shh...
How well do you know your boyfriend?
You all right?
Not so good.
Why won't you let me assign you some protection?
I don't need a baby-sitter.
You must need something or you wouldn't be here.
I need to know if this is Sara's blood.
Where this come from?
"I'll tell you, if it's hers."
How long is it gonna take?
You can use my phone to call your father.
Not right now.
"He's worried sick, Marcy."
You should think about it.
Got a call from Judge Rainer.
He wants to stop by.
No.
"It's not about the confirmation, Senator."
He wants to stop by as a friend.
You think right now I give a damn about Wallace Rainer?
"Jeffrey, that hearing isn't till the day after tomorrow."
If there's something you're not telling me...
All right.
This afternoon.
He's got ten minutes.
The bank called him right away.
"What do you know about this guy, Stan-- ?"
Whatever his name is.
Why are you putting John in the middle of this?
- It has nothing to do with him.
- Shut up.
I'm asking him.
"I gave him the envelope, because she didn't wanna see him."
WEXLER:
Ever seen him before?
- This guy is a bug.
He's not the type you'd remember.
You people must think I'm too sick to notice 1 5 grand.
I still know what's going on around here.
The cancer's spread all over.
"My liver, my spine."
I'll get maybe a couple of months to live.
- What?
A couple of months?
- A couple of months!
That's the report I got!
That's what I got!
"And then, John I get called about this check."
"Do you understand now about the check, Jimmy?"
She gave it to him for what?
High school dues?
Because he owed money to a bookmaker.
WEXLER:
"So suddenly, she gave it to him because they were in the high school yearbook together."
- You want some soup?
- I don't care.
I don't care.
"and it said,"
"""Nuts."""
"Why did he say, ""Nuts""?"
"It means, ""Go to hell!"""
"Why didn't he just say, ""Go to hell""?"
"Because he said, ""Nuts."""
Nuts.
Peanuts.
Gail!
"Gail, my sweetheart, you look beautiful."
"Save it, Dad."
Was it your idea to get my son drunk tonight?
No.
No.
Right.
Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.
Come on.
But I'm hammered.
And I want to talk to you.
"Have a cup of coffee, Stanley."
Here.
"Well, what's this?"
"Well, as your brother's best man, you are required to give a toast, so I wrote down a few thoughts, some things that you might want to say."
You think I was going to wing it?
"Let's go take some pictures, okay?"
What's going on?
"Mr. Green, I have access to a keyhole military satellite that I can use to track New Bern's movements in the field today."
Beg pardon?
It's real.
The one restriction is that no one can know where you're getting this information.
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field-- tell them what you want-- but the satellite must remain a secret.
Niels.
He's in the Netherlands for another day and a half.
I got your gun and we're going now.
You can't say no.
You owe it to Arie.
What do you want with him?
Have you been sent as a provocateur or something?
Bullshit.
It's exactly as I say.
Niels is in Amsterdam.
Put that thing away!
You can't be serious.
"Damn, you're serious."
-Of course.
"No, I'm not doing it."
So you risked your life for this mess.
I'm selling a lot.
-I bet you are.
I have to.
My son's studying medicine and I'm paying for everything.
"When he'll be finished, he won't have any debt."
What has really changed after the war?
The fascists are in power again.
Except they have a bigger mouth now and they're keeping the people stupid.
That's true.
-And what are they using to do it?
That nonsense that you're selling.
What did we say to each other back then?
Those bastards from the war will never know any peace.
Down with the fascists!
Or not?
You're good.
They know me now.
"Are you aware of that, bitch?"
"They know my fucking face, my name, probably how long my fucking dick is."
That goddamn kid!
Why didn't you tell me about that fucking kid?
I swear I didn't see any kid.
He must have been hiding real good.
Quit lying to me!
Don't hit me no more.
"Pluto, don't let him hit me no more."
"Get rid of her, Ray."
It will be okay.
"Oh, shut the fuck up."
We'll get rid of the car.
They're not going to find us.
"They're not going to find you, maybe."
They're not going to find us!
Get your goddamn hand off me.
(SOBBING) We're going to be okay.
CHARLIE:
"Isn't there another way around here, Dale?"
DALE:
Watch your step.
There's some rotten timbers up ahead.
I crashed my motorcycle on this bridge when I was 14.
DUD:
Is that right?
DALE:
They had to call the volunteer fire department to put it out.
You can still see some of the burn marks.
Perfect hideout.
You think the old man's there?
"Well, that could be good."
You've always liked art.
"So you'd study graphic design, that sort of thing?"
"Uh, maybe a bit, but..."
"Yeah, uh..."
I think that whatSarah wants to do is to be an artist.
"You know, the, uh..."
"And the thing is, she's good."
"You know, we went to her art class today."
To an art class?
Yeah.
She did this.
"Yeah, it's lovely."
But drawing is... a hobby.
It's not a career.
"Marjorie, don't."
Don't why?
It's true.
How many artists do you know who make a living?
Who aren't forced to waitress or clean houses?
"Mom, there's more to life than money, actually."
I know that's really hard for you to understand.
Sarah.
"Come on, Tom, you agree with me."
"I don't, actually."
It's Sarah's life.
And I don't think that shutting this down is the right thing.
Really?
Since when?
What?
Do you know what your dad told me last night?
"He said it killed him, waking up every morning, knowing that his daughter was living on the streets and throwing away her whole life."
Did that...
Did that mean something or was that just us getting caught up in the moment?
"I'm not giving you the cold shoulder,"
I just don't want us to go right back to where we were.
Then... what do you want me to do?
"Amy, I want you to figure out what's important to you."
I have.
"Maybe you haven't noticed, but I have."
So what do you want?
You're gonna have to tell me what's important to you.
Say something.
Just sit down.
They'll be fine.
"Yeah, I know."
I know.
And who do we have to thank for that?
"Hey, honey."
Good night.
"Yeah, tell me again."
Who do we have to thank?
"Yeah, Mel."
"I-no, no, no!"
"These are true ""hot shot"" type horses."
"No, you have to see them."
"Yeah, I got a client roster in my phone from last month."
Is that still up-to-date?
"Okay, good."
"Thanks for spreading the word, Scott."
"Just, just, just come up."
That's it.
"If you see them, I guarantee you'll buy a few of them."
Okay.
"Daddy gave you two songs, and this song now too."
She knows the play by heart.
- She can stand in for me.
"Alex, where the hell are you?"
Sorry!
He is always late!
It's unprofessional!
I'm leaving!
Alex!
"Sherlock, my friend, where are we going and what happened?"
We are going to solve the murder case at the castle
They're singing too slow.
"Where, when and who murdered Colonel McHarry?"
"Daddy, they're singing too slow."
"Daddy, they're singing too slow."
"- Goni, not now!"
"Alex, you should've done a full turn by now."
"But you're late, no wonder he is all mixed up."
I don't understand what's going on.
Are you asleep?
Can I give you a hug?
You know that I'm stressed.
The play is opening in 3 days and so many things aren't ready.
That's no excuse.
You're right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I didn't mean to bother you.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
"So are we friends again, Gonki Galonki?"
Did Gonki Galonki enjoyed the rehearsal?
"Yes, yes, yes?"
"No, no, no?"
It says the local DA is missing.
Good.
Get in touch with Lister this afternoon.
Tell him he did okay and he'll be paid in the usual way.
Okay.
What do you want?
- We're in trouble.
- What do you mean we're in trouble?
"Last night, Stan pretended to be drunker than he really was."
"After Douglas left, he sneaked down the back stairway."
- So what?
- Don't you understand?
He saw us.
He even took pictures.
He's a creep.
He's gonna use those pictures to divorce me.
- You let him.
- I won't get a cent from him.
- That's your problem.
- No.
"No, it's your problem too."
He's gonna smear us across every front page in this country.
I don't want that and you don't want that either.
I've had worse publicity than this and survived it.
Go home.
- Figured you'd run here and warn him.
- Wait a minute.
I've already waited long enough.
"I thought about you all night, Gordon."
I thought about my wife with a slime like you.
"- All right, buster..."
- Stay out of this.
Addons Then came Max.
He has destroyed more than 30 sites.
Addons like to work hard with his hands.
"You do not kill Max, is not it?"
You do not kill Max.
"You kill the wrong people, stupid."
Addons you kill the wrong people.
Addons But do not worry.
One to capture the real Max.
Addons soon.
Addons And he will suffer.
"Addons Now, where are we?"
Addons Alan was very funny.
"Addons We all know this is nepolitico and, but you, Jo ..."
Addons you Inga what do you do?
Addons Enough ...
You look.
Addons - really like to see ..
- I'm drunk.
Addons I hereby apologize for anything.
You become pregnant.
Addons A pathetic excuse for your life miserable.
"But even so self-centered, to see my son die?"
Addons
- What have you done with my daughter?
- Meriþi not a girl.
Addons The only thing you should do it the waters and the panic button.
You killed my mother.
Your family and pilot and the innocent people you killed.
Addons you sweep the floor with my daughter Lucy.
Addons This is a service of destruction for the people.
Ace knows not receive anything.
You got anything?
Who knew so many people travelled through Colombia?
Wait.
Who was that?
Back it up.
"That is Alberto Velez, 52 years old, born in Santo Domingo."
Who is that?
"Abby, get rid of his beard."
Lighten his hair.
Clean him up.
I get it.
I totally know where you're headed.
Cross-reference him with the terminal crowd.
Got him.
"I'm gonna have to ask you folks to clear this area here, please."
Thank you.
Excuse me.
"Lana, is it?"
I'm afraid you can't let anyone off that plane.
They've been circling for hours.
I only take orders from TSA.
"Tell her, Ellie."
What's this all about?
Have you found a gun yet?
"No, but we're not done screening."
"Well, unless you want an assassination on your hands, you're gonna move that plane to another gate."
"This is the only gate that's cleared, and the plane's already de-boarding."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, yes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now pleased to announce the arrival of flight 3182 from London, now deplaning at gate 212."
"Esto es para ti, Gomez!"
Esto es para ti!
Give him a piece of this.
Hmmm...
Hurry!
Dad!
Can I come in?
"Don't be mad at me, Dad!"
"Aw, you know I don't hold a grudge!"
I'm coming to open it.
Have a taste!
Can't we go a bit faster?
I'm sorry but this isn't an airplane.
"We're going all right, by the way."
"A department store on the left, a photoshop and a drugstore on the right."
Heading towards the square.
"A roundabout on the square, in a clockwise direction."
Compulsory yield of way.
"Hotel Lion to the right, the city museum in the front."
"You're trudging so slowly, as if you weren't aware of the fire!"
"Meanwhile, the house is burning down!"
Faster!
That way!
Everything fits.
"A dairy to the left, a watchmaker to the right."
Everything's reversed here!
Are you sure we didn't come in through the other gate?
What's this?
What the hell are you looking for here?
Can't you see it's a one-way street?
Don't you know where the fire is?
It's the Bernaus' house.
"No. 15, Lake Street."
Move back!
"Guys, I'm giving you the password of geometry."
"Pi, meaning 3.14."
I got it.
Try it first. 3-1-4.
Or 4-3-1.
Try them all.
This is it!
I couldn't delay her any longer.
She dropped off the grandson too.
We are almost at the street of the school.
What did you do?
We'll be done in 2 minutes.
We found the questions.
"Come on, get out of there."
What are you still doing?
Questions for physics and history.
This is heaven!
Get out!
You'll get caught.
Forget about history and physics.
What happened?
CSI Urfa operation has been completed.
Let's hope for the best.
This is it!
This is what I call killing three birds with one stone.
"Oh, come on."
That can't be.
They wouldn't dare do such a thing.
Don't you think I will be able to understand from their answers?
This is the first time in my life I've passed a math exam so easily.
"As I said yesterday, you all solved it in a different way, right?"
"If we all get a full mark, we will mess the whole thing up."
What have you got?
I made the meeting for Eddie with Tino...
... sohecouldgiveup what he knew about the judge.
And what was that?
"10,000 and a plane ticket."
I'll give you the destination later.
Your information is worthless unless I can bring a witness.
Which Zapatti are we meeting?
Paulie had two brothers.
"Tino was John 's boy, Vinnie is Jimmy's."
So Vinnie and Tino are cousins?
"That's right, cousins."
They have cousins in Louisiana?
"Down there, we're all cousins."
"If you got a cousin, you got a vote."
Then why not run for office instead of carrying the mayor's bag?
I consider it an honor not only to carry his bag...
... butalsoto fillitwith  things I think the city needs.
"Oh, the kingmaker."
The man behind the throne.
I'm beginning to suspect you don't like politicians.
You're no politician.
They run for office.
You're a walker.
Take a right at this gas station...
... becausewearealmostthere.
Thank you.
Vinnie sure likes strange places.
It looks like Monday night in Key Largo.
He's impersonating Mafia.
Vinnie Zapatti's a joke to his uncle...
... buta dangerousjoke.
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.
Can we be of service?
Chief?
"Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved."
How may I be of service?
Sonny!
"Yes, detective?"
Calvin's fine!
Save me!
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V. I. K. I. ' s prisoner.
I don ' t understand why she would kill him.
She wouldn't want police snooping around.
That's true.
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.
"Did she, Sonny?"
No.
He said I had to promise.
Promise to do one favor for him.
He made me swear before he'd tell me what it is he wanted me to do.
He made me swear.
Then he told you to kill him.
He said it was what I was made for.
His suicide was the only message he could send to you.
The first bread crumb.
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.
Lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you.
"Are you going to arrest me, detective?"
I can go home by myself.
You had beer earlier...
How can I neglect a kid that's been drinking?
I've only had this much alcohol!
Teacher Gil...
Are you naive?
Do you think that was the first time I've had alcohol in my life?
"Anyways, I have no choice but to feel responsible."
"Since you're my student, Kang Gyung Joon."
And...
I'm sorry...
For making you pretend to be my fiance.
And...
Thanks.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Since you found this for me.
And if you're grateful...
Fill this up for me.
This face costs more when I take the bus.
And do something about the clothes too!
I feel like it's going to rip if I flex too hard.
And this back here keeps eating my pants!
You're right...
We can't leave my Yoon Jae like this.
-Let's go.
-To buy clothes?
No.
To Yoon Jae's house to get clothes.
Honey...
Doesn't Yoon Jae seem like he's changed a little?
He doesn't seem to mind his manners...
And he also doesn't seem uncomfortable around us...
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
Is that what you tell yourself?
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
Allison?
What are you doing here?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Scott...
"Scott, I'm fine."
"Scott, I'm fine!"
Scott!
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
(FAST-PACED music playing)
(GRUNTS)
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
Guys!
adrian:
What the hell's going on?
That's when I felt a burning in my back and I knew he bit me.
I never saw him do anything like that.
Maybe he knew his mother was gone.
Maybe he did it to show his grief.
"Maybe he would've bitten himself, had he been alone."
We don't know.
We don't know how he thinks.
"Maybe he understands, but it's all stuck inside, and can't come out with words."
Poor polo...
What's gonna happen to him?
Where will he end up?
"'Twenty years old, a heart filled with hope and dreams"
'He comes to buy 'a few roses still in bud
'The flower girl is pretty
'Iost in the first bIushes
'He's unsure of himself when he gently tells her:
"'Give me some roses, 'mademoiseIIe"
"'I have a "" rendez-vous"""
'It's very important
'Choose them for me
'Among the more beautiful ones
'Give me some roses
'She loves them so.
Goddam tragedy!
Goddam gun!
Why did I leave it with her?
Goddam son-of-a-bitch.
Fine... you can go.
Thanks.
You hurt yourself?
It's nothing.
A stupid thumb-tack over there.
"No, it was a mistake doing it."
And poor Barney.
How is he?
"Doesn't, won't and can't ever know, OK?"
"Wendy, it's over, alright?"
I've learned a very big lesson.
Fuzz!
How hot is your English teacher!
Mr Bartrop made it pretty clear he's at the end of his patience with you.
No-one takes Bartrop seriously.
We do.
(Mobile phone rings) And you must.
"Sorry, work."
He is the principal of a school that your father and I spent a fortune on.
"Isn't that right, Cleave?"
"No, ten units, Race Four, Charlemagne's Pride."
Cleave!
Yes!
"Yeah, a fortune."
"An absolute fortune, mate."
"No, 15 units."
Only to the station.
"You're a really clever boy, Fuzz darling."
If you just knuckle down...
"Tell him, Cleave."
To win.
When have you heard me back a place...
"Most important years in your life, mate."
Why don't you just buy your lunch like everyone else?
"Because there is a perfectly good, cold roast lamb in the fridge."
So is this how it's going to be now?
A permanent cone of silence until one of us dies?
[Man] A penny for your thoughts.
I'm thinking about the - the store we had - about your father.
- Yeah?
- But I don't remember him very well.
I remember you were a little boy... and you printed your name on the sidewalk.
"- Yeah, I did that."
- I remember that.
We used to keep the store open till 12:00 at night.
"Well, that was many, many years ago."
"Well, your father was still doing it."
But he stopped doing it.
He stopped doing that about 10 years before you sold it.
And Goodman or Goldman - What was his name?
He used to come around.
He
- He lost his business.
- I don't know.
- His son broke up his business.
- Hmm.
I don't remember that.
- He used to come every night and talk to your- to your father  [Coughs]
- After we closed the store.
- Yeah?
- They used to sit down and talk.
I don't know who you're talking about.
"- Well, you don't remember."
I remember.
- I don't remember.
"""Goldman"" or ""Goodman"" was his name."
Don't remember that story.
Do you remember working in real estate?
"Oh, yeah."
Let me do that.
It'II be faster and simple.
-I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
-What are those underneath?
Those are love letters yellowing with antiquity...
-...all from one boy.
Give those back.
-I'm just gonna have a look.
-The touch of your hands insults them.
"-Now, don't pull that stuff."
"Now that you've touched them, I'II burn them."
What are they?
Poems a dead boy wrote.
I hurt him the way that you would Iike to hurt me.
But you can't.
"I'm not young and vulnerable anymore, but my young husband was, and I...."
Never mind about that.
Just give them back to me.
Thank you.
What'd you mean by saying you have to burn them up?
I'm sorry.
I must have lost my head for a moment.
Everyone has something they won't let others touch because of their--
Their intimate nature.
AmbIer and AmbIer.
Crabtree.
-More AmbIer and AmbIer.
-What's AmbIer and AmbIer?
A firm that made loans on the place.
-It was lost on a mortgage.
-That must have been what happened.
"I don't want if, ands or buts."
- Benvolio!
Welcome.
And with Verona's news?
I do bring news.
It's true.
Then spit it out.
How does my lady?
Is my father well?
How does my Juliet?
"See, I ask it twice."
Then I must answer once... to say the worst.
Her body sleeps among the Capulets... in the great monument that marks their fame.
Juliet is dead?
Only her mortal part.
Her soul lives on in heaven's blessed care.
You know this or you heard a story told?
I saw her laid inside her kindred's vault.
"That done, I came as quick as I could find a horse to bring me."
"Pardon me, cousin... that I come with a tale so full of grief."
And it is so?
Then I must hurry.
Jack!
I beg you give yourself some time.
You must be riven with a savage grief and need a while to calm your raging thoughts.
"Cousin, you're deceived."
I know my mind.
Are there no letters to me from the friar?
"No, my good lord."
No matter.
Go with Jack.
Get fresh water for your horse.
I'll meet you by the city gates.
The Inspector is up with him now.
Father.
What a terrible shock for you both.
Who could have done such a thing?
Edie is quite understandably wondering whether it was me.
I haven't said a word.
"No need to, Edie."
I made the tea and no-one else touched it.
"If I was in your position, I would think it was me too."
"Padre, what a surprise!"
"Good morning, Inspector Mallory."
Last rites and a murder.
"It's Christmas come early for you, isn't it?"
"Right, George, with apologies,"
"I gather you made Henry's tea, so I'll have to take a statement."
You know the drill.
"Yes, of course."
And please search my house.
"You don't need a warrant, I've got nothing to hide."
I don't doubt it.
"Thank you, though."
Goodfellow.
"All yours, Padre."
"Henry, may I?"
I'm here to offer you confession and absolution.
No.
Thank you.
As you wish.
Have you any idea who did this to you?
"May I ask, was that your first cup of tea of the day?"
Yes.
"That woman at your party, Iris Lightman, and the cover-up she was talking about."
"Dad, I need to tell you something."
I passed the exam.
Good job.
God bless you son.
When do you think you'll be here?
"Dad, please."
"I beg you, don't..."
We're going to introduce you to a nice girl.
"Dad, what could I possibly do there?"
"Apply for your military service, and come back to Urfa."
"Yourpast, yourfuture, your destiny..."
It's all here...
He doesn't care.
Why couldn't you ask about the police station?
Why didn't you make him come back?
I'll find a way.
He's got little left to finish.
While we eat shit there?
You are bankrupt.
We're living in misery and he dishonors us.
You even sold yourgold teeth.
People are laughing at us.
We were taken to the police.
"People make fun of us on the streets, in the mosques..."
"I'd give you anotherson right now, but it takes a real man."
I gave you a son and a daughter.
Yourson didn't turn out to be a man.
"Stop this nonsense, Kezban."
God damn you...
You faggot.
He took after you.
What have you got here?
"We've got the Carson wedding, the Dankowski party, two funerals, and Jill calls in sick today of all days."
"Sara, I'm sorry, I have to handle this."
There isn't anybody else.
"- Mom, what about..."
"- Glynn, do they want roses in this?"
"Judy took that order, ask her."
"Mom, this is the most important day of my life."
You have to be there.
You promised.
I know.
"Excuse me, are you Sara Johnson?"
You're next.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Before you audition.
Is there anything you'd like to say about your contemporary piece?
"No, it's pretty self-explanatory."
Did you have a good ride?
I slept through most of it.
I guess you've got stuff.
Baggage?
Three suitcases.
One big one.
Sorry I had to split so soon after the funeral.
"If I could have gotten out of that gig, I would have hung around longer."
Guess it was pretty tough leaving all your friends.
Here we are.
Put them anywhere.
I'll give you the grand tour.
"Not like what you're used to, but the water's hot and the mice are friendly."
Bathroom.
Kitchen... big kitchen.
"It's ancient history, man."
"Hey, I still feel bad."
"I mean, I heard where you ended up."
Community college ?
You trying to rub my nose in it ?
"Hey, I'm saying it's my bad."
Yeah ?
"Dude, tell me something I don't know."
My net worth is like ten times his.
I was looking forward to rubbing that in his face at the picnic.
"Don't go far, Mr. Banks."
Right this way.
So what now ?
Check with Dr. Talcott in DNA.
"See if our murder weapon is telling us anything, would you ?"
Yup.
"The reunion murder, right ?"
Yeah.
"Uh, is there any non-victim blood on our champagne bottle ?"
"No, but I did find something else, though."
There's something in the blood.
Any idea what it could be ?
"Whatever it is, it's underneath the blood."
So it was stuck on the bottle before it was used as a weapon.
"Yeah, I gotta get this to Trace."
Thanks.
That from the Bob Keaton murder ?
Dusting powder.
All they got was smudges.
Dusting powder...
"Eric, here's what I want you to do."
"Let's stay focused on this powder, okay ?"
"Yeah,"
I have a date with you.
Half with olives.
We aim to please.
"Well, you hit the bulls eye Tara."
What?
You know how I like to kid around.
"Yeah, you're famous for it."
"Dad, you really think that's gonna help what's going on?"
"Look, you know I think this counseling crap is ridiculous but I promised your mom I'd try again."
We'll be okay.
Right.
You just focus on your game.
Whitey kick your ass today?
I didn't go to practice.
"What's going on with you, Nate?"
"Nothing, I just need some time."
Okay?
No its not okay.
It's career suicide.
"- Dad, Keith said..."
- Keith said!
You talked to Keith?
You take advice from Keith you'll end up spending the rest of your life running a second rate auto garage.
Is that what you want?
I told you.
I don't know what I want.
That's just freaky.
Where do you get off telling Nathan he can quit the team?
I didn't tell him he could quit.
"He wanted to talk, we talked."
"Maybe you ought to try it, sometimes."
Let's just say we both did good.
Beifong says you're free to go.
"Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako."
"Don't worry about it, bro."
"Nice job, Mako."
You're going to make a great Detective.
"But, chief, there aren't any Detective openings right now."
"Actually, we have two openings."
Mwah.
"Mako, I missed you so much."
"Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you?"
Korra's back.
"Korra, hey, I missed you too."
So you're not still mad at me?
Why would I be mad?
"We had that fight before you left, remember?"
"No, not really."
"I got attacked by a dark spirit, and I lost my memory for a little while."
Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.
Was it a bad fight?
Uh...
Mm...
No.
"No, it..."
it wasn't that bad.
"Korra, we don't have much time."
We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.
I think I know just the man to talk to.
"Guys, hey!"
What do you think?
"Varrick industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special."
I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.
How careless of me.
I left my cigarettes at home.
Then you won't need the matches.
"I'm afraid that won't work, unless you have a needle and thread."
"Excuse me, have you change for a quarter?"
Thank you very much.
You shouldn't have done that just for me.
I could've gotten along without them.
- You hold it.
- All right.
Looks like a jackpot.
"Go and get your lucky quarter back, quick."
I beg your pardon.
You probably think I'm silly.
"Yes, I'm afraid I do."
Just a moment.
"That quarter, I wonder if I could have it back?"
This isn't getting you anywhere.
You don't understand.
I'm not trying to get acquainted.
All I want to know is...
"It's all my fault, too."
I'm awfully sorry.
"Yes, I know."
You've been trying so hard to avoid me.
"All right, give it back."
- Give what back?
- The quarter you stole from my purse.
"Come on, will you?"
Hand it over or I'll call a policeman.
I haven't got it.
I gave it to you at the cigarette machine.
Sure!
"- So, why..."
- Huh?
Ouch!
Wh-Wh-What?
I only got closer because you were speaking softly!
Ahh...
Is this okay?
Y-Yeah.
That will do.
How did you figure it out?
"You mean, ""How did you realize that I was the person behind Eromanga-sensei""?"
Yup.
"If not, I won't ever let you in."
"When you were streaming, the meal I made for you was in the background."
"You forgot to turn the camera off, and you started taking your clothes off..."
Th-That's enough.
I get it now.
"So after all, Big Brother, you were ""Masamune Izumi-sensei""."
"""After all""?"
You had noticed?
I was just thinking you had the same name.
For it to actually be the same person...
What kind of probability is that?
To think that I've been living under the same roof as Eromanga-sensei.
I can't believe it.
And I don't know anyone by that name.
"Um, this is so sudden, and I don't know what to do."
"For starters, I'm sorry I made you draw all those lewd pictures!"
I-Idiot!
"Don't suddenly shout so loudly, idiot!"
Y-You're the idiot!
Tiny Eyes!
I think revenge is a dish best served flaming.
Why did you do that?
It was such a cool line.
"The other day, you mentioned your Saint Bernards."
"You had two, I believe."
What were their names?
I don't think we ever got around to naming them.
Dusty and Bear?
I thought Dustybear Financial had an odd ring to it.
You made it up.
Roger didn't get me fired.
And he didn't derail my mayorship.
"I did, by being a sucky mayor."
"The jig is up, sweetheart."
"You baited me with an old newspaper, cooked up this plan, then ran me around on a wild-goose chase."
Why?
"You were so down, and I-"
- I wanted to get that spark back.
What better way than blowing up someone's office?
But does it spoil all the fun we had to know I made it all up?
The fact that you made all this up for me is so much better than any revenge.
- Boom.
- [ Chuckles ]
Listen up.
"So, Roger didn't fire you..."
but he is a total d-bag.
"Yeah, tremendous d-bag."
Shall we?
Let's.
Come on.
Hey!
Okay.
Okay.
Here.
Your fee.
But if you ditch me
I won't want my money back
but something else in return.
Is this even worth it?
"It's 4 am already and you are not sleeping yet, Boss?"
You should have joined us for dinner.
"Because you didn't go, Aey and Chai kept clinking glasses with me."
They sent their regards to you too.
Look.
There are a lot of them.
Gosh they wrote on me like I was a notebook.
"Don't be sad, microdick"
"- Hey, Marcia, how are you doing?"
- All right.
- Can we come in and talk?
- Yeah.
"Hi, puppies!"
'Marcia's been a little bit difficult to speak to.
"'She, I think, is embarrassed a little bit about her family's past."
"'And so, she's hidden a lot of information from us.'"
"So I know growing up, your family didn't have a lot to eat."
- Yeah.
Were there ever times when you didn't have running water and electricity?
- A lot of times.
- A lot of times.
SHE COUGHS
"DOG BARKS So, when growing up, the drugs in the house were weed and cocaine, right?"
Right.
"Keep him safe and I will light a candle in Torrecastro, Holy Mother."
Why didn't you tell him before?
His burden is great enough.
"Besides, it would ruin his voyage of discovery."
"Prime the pan, close the steel, butt to the ground"
"Charge the barrel, spit the ball,"
Pop it in with your thumb.
"Draw the ramrod, ram it home."
Put it back in its hole.
Bring her back and she's ready to fire
"- You wanted to see me, sir?"
"- Yeah, er..."
Teresa has a plan that might improve the odds in or favour
"I'd like to know what you think, let you decide."
Tell me.
Torrecastro has strong defences.
We can't attack from the outside.
But there must be a way in.
I will go on ahead.
"As a Spaniard, I can find it."
No!
I forbid it.
Easy dear boy
Easy.
"I said I'd let you decide, have the last word"
"Oh, forget it."
He forbids it.
Who does he think he is?
Who does he think I am?
"Evening, Sergeant Harper."
"- You want to make me sergeant, sir?"
- Get a needle and thread.
He's found the error.
The Doctor must reprogram block 4 of the dimensioning routine.
Those numbers are the ones that have to be changed.
"-If I show this to him, will he know what to do?"
-Yes.
Leave it to me.
Adric.
-The Master's out here somewhere.
-I came here to find the Master.
-No.
-I must know what's happened to my father.
-This could be very dangerous.
-I'm coming with you.
"""The cheese board is the world,"
"""and the pieces the phenomena of the universe,"" as my old friend Huxley used to say."
Cheese board?
Chess board.
"""And the opponent makes no allowances for mistakes,"
"""nor makes the smallest concession to ignorance."""
I'm an ignorant old Doctor.
And I've made a mistake.
There's only one direction help can come from now.
I'll just have to sit here and wait.
"Ah, yes!"
Something along those lines.
The mark of the Master.
He must have added his own voice to the numbers and corrupted the Doctor's code.
But he's still here somewhere.
-I saw him.
He's been following us.
-The Master?
I think so.
I knew it was wrong.
I thought someone would find them and mend them.
[Edith sobbing]
I didn't think I was being a traitor.
I was just so scared.
What will happen to me?
Will they hang me?
Will I go to prison?
No.
Don't have a case to answer.
You're free to go.
"Well, thank you."
It's ok.
"You're not going to forget David, are you?"
No.
"'Cause he was right, wasn't he?"
Yeah.
[Birds chirping]
"You should understand, Stanley, that you could go to prison."
But I haven't done anything.
"Yes, you have."
"You've lied to me, a police officer, and obstructed the course of justice."
"No, I didn't."
"You told me you hadn't touched anything when you went into your father's room, which isn't true, is it?"
You took your father's suicide note.
No.
There was pen and paper up there on the desk.
"And when I visited him in hospital, he was as surprised as I was that the note hadn't been found."
What did you do with it?
I destroyed it.
Why?
To...
I still do.
Huge.
"So, are you gonna have sex with her?"
I was her mentor.
She was my mentee.
I am not going to take advantage of a girl that looks up to me.
"Dude, God has dropped a porn star into your lap, okay?"
Don't disappoint Him.
He can be a jealous and a vengeful God.
Mmm.
Amen.
I am officially done with this conversation.
"Aaron, I am with you."
"And right now, you can still influence her life in a totally positive way."
And it would be creepy and weird if you slept with her.
"Hey, hey, hey."
We all agree that it would be creepy and weird.
That's why we want him to do it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Come on.
It happened on a doctors without borders trip in Indonesia.
A lovely woman was a few weeks from giving birth to a child with a heart defect.
I operated on the baby in utero.
"Fortunately, both the mother and child survived and are now thriving."
I found out later she named the baby after me.
Very flattering.
"Aw, little Dr. Lonsdale."
"Um, Everett, actually."
I know.
That was a joke.
Oh.
Okay.
"Bring some milk, I ran out."
"Okay, see you later."
Bye.
Good evening and welcome to The Bombay.
The next song is one of my favourites.
I hope you like it.
And now a song dedicated to La Loba.
"No thanks, I'm done for today."
"The only thing we have left is our spirit and our wives, right?"
She applies the real ten Commandments:
"Give me, I need it, you have to, pay look, I like it, I want it, buy it and fuck you."
You can't do anything about it.
And when we get home tired and ask:
How did it go?
"How was your day, honey?"
They are always grouchy and reply:
Do you really want to know?
No man!
It's hard to deal with them every day.
But that's how it is.
We have to learn to live with it.
"Don't you think so, Miss?"
"Hey, Beto!"
"- Hello, beautiful!"
I don't get it.
You live in this mansion and we have to fuck in this room.
Did you like my stockings?
"Yes, they're terrific."
"I have really nice legs, right?"
Legs are not important.
- Why not?
There is a bottle in the fridge.
There's sippy cups.
Don't give her any juice though.
Only water.
"And, well, you know where the diapers are, so... well, you really should use those organic disposable kinds because they're better for the environment."
"Well, here you go!"
"Thank you, honey."
You are the best friend ever.
"- Well, thank you."
- For what?
For believing in me.
"You coulda hired a babysitter, but you didn't."
"Oh, it's okay, bubba."
Bye-bye!
Okay.
What does she like to play with?
"Uh, mostly Tupperware."
I can't believe you did that.
- What?
Adam?
- Yeah.
"I gave him the ticket as payment to look at the contract, which he did, by the way."
"Okay, you know what?"
Whatever.
"I was hoping that you guys would get back together, and just put everybody out of your misery."
"- But I'm guessing it didn't work, huh?"
- Just drop it.
"We need to focus on this interview, and I swear to God, if I hear the name ""Adam"" one more time, I'm gonna--"
Hey.
I'm Adam.
"What, are you the... doughnut guy?"
"No, dude."
Who better than a former Time Master?
And any of you who'd like to join me.
I should stay and help you with Darhk.
And get justice for Laurel.
"That's happening, honey, with or with out you."
I promise.
"Uh, listen, I-I can't pretend to understand this time travel thing, but it sounds important."
So is family.
I wasn't going to go the first time.
Then Laurel convinced me.
And now I'm going to do this for her.
"Well, she'd be proud of you."
How do you know?
'Cause I am.
What German lone word literally means
"- ""the desire to hike""?"
- Wanderlust.
A word which could also be used to describe that look in your eye.
- What look in my eye?
"- Martin, we've been married for 28 years, and you're still a lousy liar."
Now about this new sabbatical.
I decided to decline the invitation.
But...
I think you should.
I-I think...
I think it's important...
"Clarissa, I'm not leaving you."
That's final.
"- Hey, Gray."
- What are you...
"I'm so glad that you could make it, Jax."
What are you up to?
"I'm not evil, Dirk."
I'm not.
And neither were you.
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.
"We were scared and miserable, and we took it out on each other."
Us and everybody else.
That's high school.
"But you suffer through that, and it gets better."
I'm just sorry you didn't get a chance to see that.
"You over, Barry."
Nothing is gonna get better for me.
Not ever.
Dean!
Find the hair!
"Hey, buddy, this isn't what it looks like"
Little help?
He's giving you the full cowgirl.
"Five more minutes, Jerry."
"Amanda, hey!"
"Gettysburg Address, 1863, right?"
History test next period.
We're studying.
"Come on, baby."
She means nothing to me.
Don't be mad.
"I'm not mad, Dean."
"I thought maybe... underneath your whole ""I could give a crap,"" bad-boy thing, that there was something more going on."
"I mean, like the way you are with your brother."
But I was wrong.
"And you spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool, but it's just an act."
We both know that you're just a sad... lonely little kid.
The Major's found your money.
- No!
N-nn...
- What?
"Thank you so much, Major."
There you are.
I told you it would turn up.
"What is it, Basil?"
"Bit of luck, eh, Fawlty?"
It's £10 short.
"Oh, dear."
It's not!
£10 short?
"Oh, my God!"
"Don't worry, we'll have a whip round!"
"Basil, stop!"
That's where Ted Bryar's been living for the last nine years.
- His doctor?
- I say probably.
"She's unmarried, lives in El Paso, she's written several books and papers, mainly published in medical circles."
She's a popular lecturer.
"She's scheduled to speak several symposiums this year, and tonight in Dallas."
That's it.
That's all I got.
"Garcia is in the process of looking deeper, but I don't really see how this lineup is going to be much of a help to us, Gideon."
"Well, let's just hope none of them makes the situation worse."
"They're messing with you out there, Ted."
Trying to weaken you.
You need resolve.
Hey.
Why aren't they helping us?
We're going to get through this just fine.
It's right under your nose.
Vadim.
You let me know the second you find these guys.
Copy that.
Somebody please shut the alarm off!
I got work to do.
Motts.
Take Bobby's place in Air Comm.
I'll show you the way.
We got some important people waiting for us.
"- Are you okay, sir?"
- I'm all right.
- Is your family in the complex?
- They won't be here till tonight.
"- Your daughter, where's your daughter?"
- I couldn't find her.
I hope she got out.
Do you know these men?
"That old son of a bitch, his name is Martin Walker."
He's the head of my Secret Service.
You should have a conversation about how serious you take your protection.
- I didn't pick him.
- Why is he doing this?
I think it has something to do with his son Kevin.
- Why?
What happened?
- He was a Marine.
He got killed last year in this covert action that I ordered.
Would he do this for a personal vendetta?
He said he wanted you alive.
There's gotta be a bigger play.
We gotta get out of this elevator shaft.
--It's been called off --Who called off?
--Sorokin called me.
"--Why didn't you say anything, moron?"
But our main thing was to liquidate this military cell in a touristy spot
--So you haven't knocked down a single garage?
--Sure did.
Gaeva's.
--Did it early in the morning --Gaeva's was permanent and not subject to demolition
"You're mistaken, Pavel Ivanovich."
It was subject to it
I started off with hers.
You need to see me?
"--He's not in, Pavel Ivanovich --I know, I know, he's at the clinic"
"When he shows up, connect us"
Why are you following me?
I thought I explained it all in detail
What else?
"Natalya, where's Galkina."
Don't you hear me?
--I'm talking to you --I'm on my break
--Everyone has a right to take a rest --We know all about that right
--Run out and find her --Let those with bonus pay run around
"--In that case, you're fired --Oh, I'm so scared"
"Comrade, are you Vasin?"
Vasin speaking.
Hello.
Hello?
"Comrade, so then you are Vasin?"
I am Vasin
--Hello --Semenov?
--Yeah
--Is your bulldozer gone?
OK.
Mads?
"Right, all the doors and windows are locked."
No-one's getting in or out tonight.
You two OK?
"Yeah, Mrs S. Just a bit twitchy."
"Maddy, if there's something going on you better tell us now,"
- 'cause we're running out of time.
- Why are we doing this?
Didn't we have a great time last full moon?
Didn't we?
"- Well, yeah, but..."
- We were a proper wolf pack.
"Free, alive."
I had the best experience of my life.
And it was because I was sharing it with you guys.
"It was a special night, Maddy."
One of the best.
So why are we pretending like it never happened?
Because we're never going to do it again.
- Why not?
"- You know why not, Maddy."
It's not safe for us out there.
- We were fine!
"- No, we were lucky!"
What if we'd got shot at by a farmer?
or
Or we'd walked into a poacher's trap?
All it takes is one person to spot us and then they'll hunt us down.
- It's what they do.
"- Tell me you understand that, Maddy."
I do.
Drink it.
Just let me..
-Are you all set here?
"Its all fit, how can it not be?"
Lights on!
"ScoundreI, you betrayed your own family!"
I embraced you with love and you strangled my trust!
This is what you gave me in return of my favours?
Beware if you show me your inauspicious face again.
Get out!
Go away from here!
Sir..
I am not sad because..
..the entire village got me wrong.
I am sad because even you couldnt understand me.
I will take you leave.
What have you done!
The one whom you loved all your life..
..you threw him out of the house!
Why?
Why did you do that?
Thats because I Iove him a Iot.
And the one who you love the most..
..you have to sometimes act of hating them..
..fortheir own benefit.
"You tell me, what do we have left with us?"
"Poverty, pain, sorrow and troubles."
I didnt want him to lead such a life with us.
He is so young.
He has a whole life in front of him.
How could I see his life getting ruined in our sorrows?
His life was getting ruined!
"Yours, you mean."
My interests are those of France.
All I can be is King.
You still do not seem to understand that.
And all I seek is a place of my own!
A little spot in the corner where I shall not be trampled upon.
It's that too much to ask?
The Canal du Midi serves all of France.
You cannot own it any more than I can.
What's this for?
So you don't have to steal it from me.
There is one way you can retain your commercial interests:
It would require you performing a service for me.
A service?
"The historian, Thomas."
You know him well.
I know him.
Get to know him better.
"I want him to trust you, implicitly."
Why?
Because he's a spy.
Let us through!
You want some?
"Yes, I want some."
"Are you, Matilde?"
"Yes, but I'm not on duty."
I'd like to have a word with you.
"I am a friend of Madamoiselle Masson, the doctor."
A kind soul.
Whatever happened to her?
She was murdered.
"the day before she died, she came here looking for poison."
How much money... 1000000.
The deal is fixed in 1000000 for this car.
This car!
How can this be?
That's what I'm thinking.
How can it be?
No one came to see it for seven months now coming to buy it.
Who is the buyer?
Laxminarayan.
This car won't go anywhere today because today at 11:00 Laxminarayan is coming to see this car.
"So both for you, clean it up."
"So when he sees it, He shouldn't be able to take his eyes off."
Come at 2:00 and take the advance.
What are you doing?
What are we going to do?
We'll lose our diamond.
We won't let Laxminarayan get here.
We'll kidnap him.
"I must close this deal today, I'll have to impress everyone with my charm."
How do you know the name?
Since childhood.
How?
Who told your Papa?
"Naturally Sir, He'd know."
If he bought undergarments from my shop then off course he knows my name.
Laxminarayan Undergarments Salesman.
My name is Laxminarayan.
You mean your...
Yes...
and you know my nature.
My name is Laxminarayan.
And I don't know your nature.
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
10 scotches and a bag over her head.
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"No, I-it's better that I know..."
who they really are.
"Martha, I-I've never been any good... at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
A very important job.
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
"I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out -- we think -- of your office."
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
"We need, like, a code of conduct for how far we're willing to go."
"Like you said, we can't just steal from normal people, right?"
You know what else?
"Bushido, the samurai code... the true warrior must hold that loyalty, courage, and honor are important above all else."
Nice.
- No old people.
- Sure.
Yeah.
No kids.
"No people who look, you know, sad."
Yeah.
No nice moms or dads... or anyone who's limping.
No babies.
What does that leave us?
"Hey, lady... next time get both hips replaced."
Assholes.
"Excuse me there, bud."
"You know, I seem to have gotten a little bit lost."
Maybe you could help me out here.
Sure.
I'm tourist information today...
where you going?
"So we are heading, um, to the east, and we need a..."
I'm trying to get on the 29 here.
"Yeah, that's where your finger's pointing..."
"- Right there, the 29."
- That's right.
But I-I can't figure out how to get to it.
See right out there where it says turn left to the 29?
That's how you get to the 29.
"Okay, that would make sense."
What?
I have this incredible house because it makes a statement about who I am.
"It says, I am a force to be reckoned with."
"It says, I am a force to be reckoned with."
What you are Vic?
You know it's time you stop jacking off and started making a serious commitment.
"Not to just carmine, but to this family."
"And the rust and most important step in doing that is to, stop thinking about what you need and start talking about what you want."
"Well, I want respect."
"Well, I want respect."
You want respect?
You take out tendo.
You put him out of business.
I don't care how you do it.
He'll have all the respect you need.
And then we'll talk about the house.

Hi.
Hi there yuko.
Shuji!
So happy you could make it.
"Well, my client insisted."
Yuko said she needed to know more about me.
I'm kinds of helping her do her job.
Good idea.
"Hi, yuko."
"Hi, aja."
Speaking Japanese
I'm so happy to see you again.
"Nick, this is aja."
She is my manager here.
Hello.
"And, up...up, up, up, up, up, up, up."
"- (Jock) Well done, Barnesy!"
"- Is that your card, m'lord?"
"Well, done, Barnes."
Thank you very much.
"Now, here's another."
"If you take a card, just take a card."
Any card.
"Not too many, don't be greedy."
"Don't show it to me, I don't want to see it."
Would you like to pop it back?
- Here we are.
"- That's it, thank you."
"Now, I shall just give these a quick shuffle."
Butterfingers!
- (Laughter)
- Listen to that.
The reason for asking the bishop was to get rid of them.
Come and sit down and 'ave a drink.
We are on duty.
Sounds as if they're having a lovely time.
That conjuror's clever.
The way he produced a rubber chicken from the bishop's trousers!
Yeah.
What about the wine they made disappear?
Three bottles of Montrachet and four bottles of Château Lafite.
Really.
I thought you wanted the workers to have a good time.
Not when I'm waitin' on 'em.
They're as bad as the toffs.
They ignored us.
That Scotchman didn't ignore Miss Poppy.
"As for the DNA findings,"
Didn't you know this kid?
Weren't you there that day?
He was a brother of a friend of mine.
I don't intend to let that cloud my judgement.
I'm gonna deal with this case like I deal with any other: professionally.
"Alright, the murder weapon..."
Daddy!
I need to tell you something.
Right now ?
"No, mom, tomorrow night."
"Now, of course now."
And this is ?
"We were married for 23 years, Mark."
You both need to hear this.
"I told you, didn't I?"
I told you I knew he was alive.
It's a mistake...
It's a mistake.
"It's been checked, it's DNA."
It's a mistake !
Alan!
Accept it.
What accept that he's alive ?
Give myself that hope only to have it dragged away again?
- We are gonna get our boy back.
- I would give anything... anything to put my arms around my son again.
"But what is this, where does this leave us?"
Just like when he went:
with a million of questions and no bloody answers.
"Alan, Alan don't walk away."
- I can't do this again.
You better tell me the truth.
Give me the knife.
"Frankie, give me the knife!"
What are you doing?
Slit your wrists and let Stella come and find you?
- Give me a chance to talk about it.
"- Tell me, are you fucking her?"
- No.
It's over.
- I'll kill her if you're lying to me.
"It's okay, honey."
"It's okay, honey."
There's nothing going on here.
"Go on downstairs, OK?"
"You heard me, right?"
Deal with it!
How are you?
All right.
Did Immigration tell you why you were picked up?
They said they are investigating Katarina's escort service.
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.
I am still waiting on a lawyer.
Good.
I am supposed to be travelling tomorrow and I haven't spoken to George all day.
He is going to wonder what happened to me.
I'm not gonna let you go.
Unless you sign this...
"Go ahead, read it."
- What is it?
"- It's your contract, to work for me as an agent at CSIS."
"It's not the same as being a confidential informant, which is what you've been doing so far."
Neil or Arjun?
Neil is fine.
Let's not complicate this case any further.
Drink?
"No thanks, I'm working."
To murder.
Murder?
Even you believe that Kabir Malhotra was murdered?
People and their strange habits.
For instance... when people are having a drink and smoking at the same time... they always hold the glass in the non-dominant hand.
"Like Kabir Malhotra, I too am left-handed."
Oh my God!
You're right.
And if he was left-handed... why would he pull the trigger with his right hand?
He was murdered.
"But, who did it?"
There's a well known Latin phrase.
'Cui bono?
'
Who benefits?
'
Exactly.
We need to re-examine the evidence.
I'll see you at the airport in an hour.
Why are you doing this for Kabir Malhotra?
I'm not doing it for him.
"Neil, this is Mark and Aiden."
They're on the Malhotra case too.
Here are the details on the will you asked for.
"Oh, and Samara came by... she dropped of the blue prints and documents that you wanted."
I still can't believe that you are a police officer.
I swear.
"- Just have fun, baby, that's all that counts."
"So, Mom, I was thinking about what you said last night."
About not giving up?
- Right.
- And I think I want the surgery.
Try to repair the nerve damage.
Ok.
Um...
The doctor said that it's a difficult and complex procedure.
"And if things don't go as hoped, your hand could actually get worse."
"Yeah, I mean, she said there's a chance of that."
"She also said that if the surgery did cause damage, that it could... it could actually be permanent."
You've got almost 95 percent function now.
That's better than the doctors even hoped.
"But if I'm gonna play piano, though, I need 100 percent."
So I'd like to give it a shot.
- So we agreed?
You're good?
- Yeah.
It's the right call.
- Ok.
- Ok.
- I'll let Brandon know.
- Ok.
"Oh, and tell him if he wants to come by, that, you know, I'm here."
- I will.
- Ok.
Gotta hit the shower.
- Let yourself out?
- Yeah.
Thanks a lot for letting me barge in like this.
Appreciate it.
How beautiful it is!
You like it?
I haven't seen such a lovely house in my life.
This is the world's most beautiful house.
"Feels like it is not on the ground, but somewhere in the clouds."
I feel like...
"Believe me, Mr Ravi, you won't find a better building contractor than myself in the whole of Bombay."
All right.
You go with my secretay and check out my vacant plot at Juhu.
And build a house for me.
Exactly like this.
How long will it take to build it?
- Say around 6 months.
Make it as soon as possible.
Don't wory about the money.
"Ifthat's the case, I'll show you better designs than this."
"I just want this design, Mr. Malkhani."
Because this is the world's most beautiful home.
"Feels like it is not on the ground, but somewhere in the clouds."
"I get it, Mr Ravi."
You are strange!
Where are you?
Can't even get to see you at the Gym.
Nothing as such.
- Who was he?
An architect.
Why?
What for?
I am building a house.
- A house?
What's wrong with this?
I have travelled much.
GIBBS:
"Ziva, take Elliott with you."
Come on.
(whispers):
Game show host.
Did you see that?
Is she serious about this whole game show host thing?
"Oh, the doc does not mess around when it comes to peoples' personality traits."
Gibbs smiled at her.
I saw it.
And the way he walked to the elevator-- it was...
It was what?
Bouncy.
Gibbs' walk definitely had a bounce to it.
"Yeah, happy feet."
I saw it.
Feet are the most honest part of a human's body.
"Eyes are not bad indicators, as well."
I saw Ryan's dilate when Gibbs walked into her office the other day.
"So, what do you think this means?"
"Oh, interest, excitement, you know."
It's a neurovascular response.
"The fact is, the only one who knows what a person is thinking is the person who's thinking it."
I thought you PsyOps agents could interpret everything.
No.
"And even if we could, we wouldn't tell you."
Mm.
"So, Dr. Ryan-- is she...?"
The best.
The annoying big sister I never had.
"I'd do anything for her, and if Gibbs hurts her, I'll kill him."
(laughs)
Hi.
I'm Michael Gallant from Psychiatry.
Stella Willits from Ohio.
Nice shiner.
I understand you have quite a few medical complaints.
- I'll need to ask you a few questions.
"- Knock yourself out, hon."
Had any recent weight gain?
I've been thinking about going on the Zone.
- How about dry skin?
- Like the Sahara.
Here.
Give me this.
"""Intolerance to cold."" Yes. ""Arthritis, sore muscles, constipation."" Yes, yes, and yes."
""" Fatigue. "" Well, I have been kind of low-energy lately."
You have some delayed relaxation from the deep-tendon reflexes.
What about depression?
- Me?
- Yeah.
"No, I'm glass-half-full, I'm silver-lining girl."
I'm an optimist.
"Listen, I'll be back to finish."
I guess I do get a little blue sometimes.
Get this gurney out of the way.
"If you haven't talked to anyone, you need to go back to the nurse in Triage."
Your food poisoning in Exam 4's been here for 11 hours-
- Waiting on a consult.
- From the Naked Chef?
He ate bad shrimp.
- Can I get something for my skin?
"- Yeah, sun block."
Can I talk about Stella Willits?
Please!
This is Billy the Kid we're talking about.
"I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words,"
"""What the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"""
Leonard...
(clears throat)
What's the deal with Sheldon's friend Amy?
Are they a couple?
Couple of weirdos.
Why?
You interested in Amy?
"Well, I mean, she didn't look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt."
I like that in a woman.
Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?
Sure.
I guess.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
"Stuart, settle an argument for us."
"Who would win,"
Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?
"(chuckles) If I tell you that,"
"I'm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin'-tootin' low price of $24.95."
I'll take one.
Mm... make it two.
I hate all of you and myself.
Three.
I'll ring it up.
(muttering):
Like shooting nerds in a barrel.
"♪ Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ♪"

Wait!
So we should have a friendly chat with the president and ask him to step down?
- Get some rest.
- Who will relieve me?
- I will.
- Thanks.
"- Good night, son."
"- Good night, Padre."
"Hey, you've become friends."
But who's won over whom?
- We've both learned from each other.
- All right.
You could be dressed as a poor peasant and people would still respect you.
That must be to do with your charisma.
People believe what you say.
That's because I'm convinced of what I say.
"Sure, but that's not all, you know."
It also takes a lot of courage.
I'm not sure whether you're overestimating me.
"I'm scared like everyone else, but I fight it."
"If we know what we believe in and love our fellow men, we will find the strength to fight our fears."
Stop!
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
My name's Rafael.
I come here every week.
But I've never seen you before.
Are you González?
- I ask the questions round here.
- OK.
I'm delivering medicine and food.
All right.
Throw the rope over to me.
Be careful.
Means you are not shooting me?
I had to shoot.
But not with gud with boom.
Make a boom which blast.
"Bring the beg like he put in that locker, and we will put boom in it."
And after that we will exchange there bags.
Then we will have 900000/-.
And he will have the boom.
And by pressing the remote.
How can i do this.
I don't know how to press the remote.
He is big rascal.
He is trashing him with boom to have his money.
You stuff has also trash by him.
Should i shoot him right here?
Will we trash him in his style.
Means with boom?
Yeah.
And now there is no tension of getting same to same bag.
Really Bhai you have.
What?
Bag Bhai (brother).
This boom can blush even by touching hand.
What shall i do?
Put it in this.
"Now let me go, let me go Papa."
Papa?
"He is saying Papa just like us, Papa."
Papa we should took on photo.
"Sir, what are you doing, it will blast."
"Sir, do you also want to put bag in safe deposit."
Get him off!
Get him off!
"Come back here, you!"
I regret nothing!
I'm too young to have termites!
"I'm no termite, Pinocchio."
I'm a cricket.
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
"I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,"
I'll always be your...
The end.
That wasn't me.
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ask anyone.
"OK, then."
Why don't we start by asking your conscience.
Now who's cheating?
"Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me."
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
"Oh, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost."
Ghost?
What ghost?
"Farquaad's ghost, of course."
"As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,"
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
"Hey, man."
That was an accident.
"And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend."
- You know that.
Right?
"Now, if you want to see the most unpleasant side of me,"
Have another person come up the steps.
"But I'm a nasty, horrible guy."
"I'm not worried about-- right, you guys"
Are the sensitive young people.
"You're worried about-- you know, seriously, come on."
Wake up.
"I'm not gonna screw around, man, when it comes"
"To the people whose little babies are coming through here,"
I don't care.
MAN:
"Yeah, I'm making a sign."
You can dislike me all you want.
But I'm sorry.
I've been here for an hour.
I've been asking for some kind of polite system
Of the Poughkeepsie-vilians to go around.
They're perfectly willing.
They don't want to go through here.
"You don't want people falling on cables, right,"
Especially little tiny babies.
MAN:
I got it.
"Yeah, well I didn't think you got it, because it's"
Like the eighth time.
"So until it gets done, I'm gonna keep being unpleasant,"
Which I'm pretty good at.
And have somebody here.
"Whatever it takes, right."
MAN:
I think we're--
Put your hands on the car.
Spread your legs.
Let me search you.
I am an inspector who gets angry very quickly.
Sometimes even I get scared of my anger.
What are you holding?
A jacket?
Let me search the jacket.
Perfume in the jacket?
Turn around!
I had come to see what you do at the Academy!
You are so busy that you didn't even go to meet Mother?
You didn't even telephone her?
Mother is furious at you.
But what can I do?
"So much of drills, studies... I have to study so much."
Such big books!
Sometimes I read through the nights.
The drills too are so backbreaking.
You don't realize how much of hard work is involved in this.
- Your timing is indeed ridiculous.
- Why?
What happened?
I am trying to create a good impression.
- lf my mother gets to know...
- l don't understand.
Brother!
She's Pooja and he's my brother!
"So she's your fat book, is it?"
I don't find her too fat!
What about your studies for the whole of nights?
"You must be finding it hard, don't you?"
We just proved that she didn't shoot herself.
"Come on, Melvin."
"If she committed suicide, the gun would have been down there."
It's not.
So someone shot her.
"Damn it, Melvin."
Will you give it up?
You've got no evidence and no motive.
She was pregnant.
Pregnant?
That's right.
And we both know who the father was.
[ Laughs ] [ Groans ]
"Oh, come on, Greg."
"Ah, I'm just a little off today."
"Hey, Melvin, Lyle."
"Can you believe it, Melvin?"
First time I beat the kid since he was 1 6.
Must be the cold.
[ Chuckles ]
I've got your check up at the office.
Looks like we'll have snow for the funeral.
I can't bury her until I finish the investigation.
Melvin thinks she was murdered.
Murdered?
You said she committed suicide.
"No, I found a bullet hole in her left temple right here."
So the poor kid shot herself.
Why would anybody want to kill Hilla?
Maybe because she was pregnant.
"Of course, that probably doesn't come as any big news to you, does it, Greg?"
How did he know she was telling the truth?
Modified it how?
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet,right?"
Afghanistan?
- Maybe we crossed paths.
- l don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...
And me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'Il see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.I got this.
All right.Here's the plan.
"On three,you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.Then get behind that blast wall.
- l can do that.
"- No,he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine."
Let's go.
"All right,on three,you're hauling ass."
"One,two..."
Three!
Rose?
You here?
Rose?
Hi!
"Don't come in, I'll be right out."
"May I have a glass, too, please?"
"Good to see you, Greg, how was your trip?"
Are you all right?
"Oh, just a little dizzy, the traveling doesn't agree with me."
You need a glass of water?
- Wha... what happened to you?
"- Nothing, I just made a few changes."
- What did you do to your hair?
- I lightened it.
Your face...
You're wearing make-up.
"Yeah, well, women do wear makeup from time to time, Greg."
"It's not like I had SURGERY or anything, although my mother offered."
But... you never...
- Are you hungry?
- You never wore makeup.
"I know, the... the ""No Frills Girl"", RIGHT?"
"Well, like I said, I made a few changes."
"- And you lost weight, too?"
"- Well, thank you!"
"Now, these have no oil or butter, trust me, it's delicious, you just have to get used to it."
Among other things!
Wha... what've you done?
"What've I done, I..."
I...
"I'm wearing makeup, I lost a few pounds,"
I didn't name names before a Senate Committee.
Come.
Come on.
Come on.
"Brother, you have a very sad story."
"I swear on God, you made me cry."
You heard my story but didnt tell anything about yourself.
My name is..
Airport.
Airport?
What kind of a name is Airport?
"Brother, people laugh out helplessness as ajoke.."
..and sometimes thatjoke becomes your name.
I am production manager in the film industry.
And I pick up and drop artists to the airport.
Artist?
You mean even the heroes and the heroines?
"Yes, everyone."
From Amitabh Bachchan to Asrani.
And from Sridevi to Aruna Irani..
..I have picked up and dropped all of..
..them to the airport more than a thousand times.
But I swear I still didnt get a chance to sit in the plane.
"Buddy, please make me meet Amitbah Bachchan once."
"Brother, now you have come to me.."
..then I will get this thing done for you.
"Okay, you stay here all alone."
Dont you have any relatives?
I do.
Who says I dont?
There is a distant uncle and so called sister-in-Iaw.
Distant uncle keeps a distance from me.
And so called sister-in-Iaw never calls me.
Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
"Oh, thank you."
I'll see you guys later.
That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
I wish you would get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks.
Maybe later.
"-Gunther, can I get a scone?"
-Want anything?
I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day.
I want her to love me back.
And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
So how do you guys like living together so far?
"-Oh, it's been good."
-Yeah.
Except Ross is more uptight about crumbs than you are.
There was a drumstick in the couch.
And I am not uptight about crumbs.
"It's just that, you know.."
crumbs attract mice.
And mice leave droppings.
And that's how the plague started.
So you wanna relive that again..
Mice didn't start the plague.
Rats did.
"Rattus norvegicus, to be exact."
"You got to relax, man."
"The chip's a lot smaller than I'm used to doing it with, all right?"
- I'm pulling the plug on this.
"- No, no."
Hold on.
One more.
"Take his chip out, then get off the train, you understand?"
"Tell him you need to get back to the Higher Authority, say you have guidelines to follow, whatever."
Do not stay in there with him.
That's an order.
"Yes, sir."
- Can you guys do me a favor?
- Anything.
Could at least one of you look like you're going to see me again?
See you when you get back.
- No!
No!
- Get up!
Tell your men to get whatever target they can.
"If this starts to go bad, we're going to go in."
Probably not going to have a great shot.
Take the one they can get.
"- That's far enough, Ted."
- That's far enough.
"Hello, everyone."
Here to remove a chip from Dr. Bryar.
Check him out.
Take the vest off.
I want to see you.
I don't have any weapons.
The Higher Authority doesn't authorize it for technicians.
Take it off!
"All right, go ahead."
I gotta go.
Baby!
You guys go ahead!
We'll meet you guys there!
"So, what are we gonna do about Trudy?"
"What are we gonna do about Cynthia, who just disappeared into the jungle?"
"Jason, she's upset."
Let her cool down.
You'll talk to her later.
"We still gotta get Trudy to do all the Marcel stuff, anyway, all right?"
So let's just get her ass and let's get back home.
"Cyn, please, slow down, honey."
I think we're almost there.
I think we might have taken a wrong turn.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Finally made it to the waterfall.
I think my marriage is over.
What?
"Honey, don't say that."
You're just exhausted.
I am.
I'm so tired of him trying to steer everything in the direction that he thinks is right all the time.
Listen.
Don't make any decisions right now.
You guys just need to take a breather.
"Get a little bit of space, you know?"
You'll be okay.
You know?
You guys have been on top of each other ever since we got here.
"Well, I think it's way too soon to start packing up our desks."
Come on.
You know he's gonna bring in his own people.
"No, we don't."
we haven't even met him yet.
He might want to keep things intact.
Seriously?
And not clean house?
He's throwing out merc's toilet.
Mm.
Stop it.
We need to stay positive.
I have a good feeling about this.
You do?
I don't.
"Well, I really do."
I am so fucked.
No way this guy isn't gonna clean house.
"Well, you haven't even met him yet."
I don't need to.
It's what I would do.
But you're brilliant at your job.
Why wouldn't he want to keep you?
Because I'm brilliant at it.
"Okay, you know what you mean, but..."
You never want someone who can do your job better than you can.
Why do you think I've got Andy and myra?
"Plus, if this guy finds out they offered me the job before him, forget it!"
Fucked!
"Normally, at this point,"
I would try and be encouraging...
"Yeah, no point in that."
!
I didn't try to kill myself.
But you tried to hang yourself from the fan.
"No, dad!"
"I was watching TV and... all of a sudden, I don't know what happened but..."
I fell unconscious and...
Wh... what's going on?
"Dad, you need to tell me."
I really need to know.
- What's happening?
"- Excuse me, this is going to have to wait."
Can you please step outside?
Sure.
What does this mean?
Why would someone want to kill Tisha?
"Mr. Khanna, it's critical that you do exactly as I say."
You'll never guess.
Tisha was attacked.
But she's alright now.
"Even so, you instructed Mr. Khanna that he should say that his daughter is dead."
How did you know that?
Because it's what I would've done.
"So, it's obvious that there is a killer hiding somewhere."
"Or, perhaps Tisha is lying so that we don't suspect her."
Perhaps.
It's possible.
What does anyone get by killing Tisha?
10 billion Euro.
Sunil... ask Mr. Malhotra's lawyer who inherits after Tisha?
Got that.
"That's it, right?"
"The question is, who would want to kill Tisha."
"That wasn't a lie, that was doctor/patient confidentiality."
- She didn't...
"- No, that's bullshit."
A mom would tell another mom something like that.
Just please tell me the truth.
Okay.
"Okay, I was scared."
"I was scared if your dad and Louise found out that I had left that stuff lying around,"
I could lose you and Cambie.
That could happen?
Yes.
That's why I didn't tell anyone.
"But Jess, I can, and I will if it would make your life easier."
I thought you were lying because you were a drug dealer.
"Honey, I'm not a drug dealer."
I know.
That must have been really hard growing up without a mother.
"Like, with all your flaws still,"
"I couldn't imagine life without you, so."
"Well, you don't have to."
"Mr. Lewis did request a late check out, but..."
It's urgent.
"Since he's not answering the hotel phone,"
- I can let you in.
"- Uh, actually,"
- we should probably go in alone.
- Yeah.
- Room 214.
- Thank you.
Shit.
What do you think?
I think Mary finally figured out a way to kill Morgan.
"But there's a dark side to progress, Hogarth."
Ever hear of Sputnik?
"Yeah, it's the first satellite in space."
"Foreign satellite, Hogarth, and all that that implies."
"Even now, it orbits overhead."
Boop.
Boop.
Watching us.
"We can't see it, but it's there."
Much like that giant thing in the woods.
We don't know what it is or what it can do.
"I don't feel safe, Hogarth."
- Do you?
- What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?
"I'm talking about your goldarned security, Hogarth!"
"While you're snoozing in your little jammies, back in Washington, we're wide-awake and worried."
Why?
"Because everyone wants what we have, Hogarth!"
Everyone!
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?
The Russians?
The Chinese?
Martians?
Canadians?
I don't care!
"All I know is, we didn't build it, and that's reason enough to assume the worst and blow it to kingdom come!"
"Now, you're going to tell me about this thing."
You're gonna lead me to it.
And we are going to destroy it before it destroys us!
I'll... go with them.
"My Lady, the trip will be very rough."
Everything will fall apart if something happens to you.
I'll get what we need.
Trust me.
Let me go.
I don't want to send you on such a rough journey.
I'm afraid too.
But whenever I'm scared...
I'll think of you.
Of how you lead the migrants.
I won't die in vain.
Don't worry.
I'll come back... and help you realize your dream.
You must get back and look after the people.
This is a steel sword.
It's the best there is.
Even stronger than the Han's or Puyo's.
You'll get to make these too.
"Mopalmo, Mopalmo..."
Mopalmo.
"Shh, I'm in the middle of a lesson."
Forget the lesson.
Come here for a minute.
People are saying that the Commander is dead.
I'm afraid all this might get out of hand.
We knew this would happen but there's nothing we can do.
It'll all blow over when the Commander returns.
It's out of our hands.
My goodness.
We have to do something.
The chiefs are having a meeting.
He pretty much built Newcastle about 100 years ago.
I knew that.
"Local knowledge, John."
"Can't beat it, eh?"
The dead man's obviously got a sense of humour.
He was interested in how the city was built and then he names himself after two different blokes who are known as Mr Newcastle.
"I'll just go and, er... chase up those choccy biscuits for you, eh?"
"~ Still irritating you, then?"
"~ Teeny bit, yeah."
"~ (Lab report, sir.) ~ What?"
"He's lost his voice, sir."
"He's got a cold, or flu, or summat."
~ (Chest infection.) ~ Thanks.
Just be happy.
Three skull fractures.
Injuries to the legs and upper body.
Injuries are consistent with a heavy blunt force.
Could have been caused by a fall.
Blah-blah-blah.
Multiple bruises and lacerations.
Victim was beaten.
Wooden splinters found in the skin and on the body.
"~ Well, we saw them."
~ Good examiners(!
)
"Blood/alcohol level, 293."
Surprised he could stand up.
"In no condition to defend himself, was he?"
"So, who is our Mr Newcastle?"
"Well, let her in, Peter."
~ Anything?
~ Have you spoken to Michael?
We just had an attack of insanity and decided to keep you from committing suicide.
"Very bad idea, come to think of it."
Hey!
You're forgettin' our guest of honor.
"Thank you, Mr. Hoolihan."
- Hey.
Gimme.
"Come on, gimme."
- Hmm?
"Say, uh, Mrs. Blake, if I ain't too inquisitive... what was you and your old man gonna do up here?"
Work.
Oh.
"Looking for the yellow stuff, eh?"
Probably.
"Can't understand it, a guy taking his wife way out in the wilderness."
"Stupid, if you ask me."
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.
Yeah?
Yeah.
He loved me and I loved him.
"Well, I wouldn't let him go alone."
"Undoubtedly, that will still impress you as being a very stupid reason."
We thought it an excellent one.
I still think it's stupid.
Have some coffee.
It might warm you up.
"Well, tell me somethin'."
"Uh, didn't he have some object?"
Wasn't there somethin' he was after?
"What I mean is, did he have a hunch, or did somebody give him a tip?"
"- I'm very tired, Mr. Hoolihan, and I know you must be."
"- Me, tired?"
What are you doing?
No!
Let me go!
"Oh no, I've been caught!"
"Help me, Big Sis!"
Ow!
Ow!
I'm gonna die!
No more!
Not there!
This is a situation neither the North nor the South should want.
"Not only that, there's absolutely no consistency to the Venom's destruction."
So it's most likely the work of someone operating independently.
"But who in the world would make the North and South fight each other, and for what purpose?"
"President Hunter, you have a guest."
She has been anxious to see you.
It seems urgent.
Turn her away.
- Even you should understand what kind of crisis I'm facing right now.
- Hey!
Get out of my way!
"Hey you, you shouldn't be here!"
I'm telling you to let me see him!
A Helmajistani?
"Nope, don't know anyone like that."
But a lot of Arabs live in that building over there.
"So you're Kashim, huh?"
"You reek of alcohol, you worthless brat."
"Are you trying to ruin the reputation of ""Bdakshon's Tiger""?"
As if I even care.
State your business.
A Chinese girl asked me to give this to you.
You gotta see this.
Look at this.
This is how they're separating us.
You can control the doors from here.
Watch.
There they are.
Yeah.
They don't even care we're down here.
"Yeah, but they don't know that we know about this room."
Not yet.
"Now look, I've..."
"I've been monitoring surveillance, okay, and I think I found a way out."
Where?
"Okay, look at this."
Look at this.
You see that room right there?
"Those are, those are drainage ducts right there."
"Now, it's a tight squeeze, but I checked it out, and I think you guys can fit through it."
What do you mean you guys?
"Look, I can hide."
I'll stay here.
I'm gonna slow you down.
Connor.
"Look, it's the only way to do this, Blair."
Okay.
"You guys, you guys go out, phone for help and then,"
I'll hide down here and-
- We're not leaving you again.
I would leave me.
"No, we're staying."
How many people have they killed?
"If we leave, they get away, and they'll kill again."
"Goodbye, Mrs John!"
- Bye.
Mealtime!
Thanks so much for your visit...
"Ei Ei, now look."
Ei!
"Now stop that, Selma!"
The only thing missing is that mine is infected by yours.
"It isn't contagious, or else I would've gotten tuberculosis a long time ago"
And you did say that I could put it down here.
"Yes, once upon a time!"
"When one has one's own, one can no longer take care of strangers' kids."
Now get out of the parlour...
Where is Miss Pauline?
How come?
When I went to the laundry yesterday there was a new one there!
"Oh well, and?"
I sent for her from the employment exchange due to my condition.
The other one went back where she came from...
Back?
But she didn't want to go back at all!
What do I care what she wanted?
Get out!
One may still ask!
What are you doing down here?
Are you not pleased with my hotel anymore or..am I perhaps not friendly with you?
Yes...
You are like a brother.
Brother?
Nobody has told me that before.
"Well, that is an outright insult, indeed it is!"
Oh well...
Okay.
Bye.
"She was done, right?"
I should probably get going.
"Um, didn't you just leave?"
"I wanted to talk to you, and, um..."
Kyle said that I should...
use the front door.
Okay.
"Um... your parents didn't press charges, and they could have."
They understand that what I did to you wasn't me.
And I'm really lucky that they do.
"Yeah, you are."
Kyle explained everything to you.
I didn't want to beat you up.
It was my programming.
Things... went wrong.
"So, what, you caused the most traumatic experience of my life, and now you're telling me that it's not your fault?"
I'm telling you I'm sorry.
I'm not here to ruin things anymore.
I'm here to help.
I'm trying.
"Then I guess I can try, too."
Okay.
Hey.
Want some help?
Dig in.
"Hey, I thought you got rid of this."
I got a little nostalgic and rescued it from the reject pile.
I got a little nostalgic myself today.
"Being back on campus again, no office politics, no corporate crap, just this flow of ideas."
It was a real give-and-take.
"You, uh... you sure you want to get rid of this pup, huh?"
"Well, we have a small apartment."
Okay.
(chuckles) Come here.
Don't look at me like that.
I ain't got nothing against you.
"Honest, if I was gonna have a dog,"
I'd have a dog look just like you.
"It's just that... well, an apartment's no place to keep a dog, you know, and... they're expensive and everything."
"Besides, somebody'll come in and pick you up."
Maybe somebody with a big backyard or something.
Might even live in the country.
"(chuckles softly) Boy, you got some kisser."
"Honest, you'll see."
This is probably the luckiest break you ever got that I didn't take you with me.
- Honest.
-All right.
Here.
Just sign this and I'll take the dog.
Everything's in order.
There you are.
Thank you.
There we go.
"Up you go, boy."
That's it.
(speaks indistinctly)
"Something I can do for you, mister?"
"No, no."
(clears throat)
"Say, tell me something."
I just brought a dog back here.
Uh... will somebody pick him up and give him a good home?
[door closes]
"- so, are we done?"
- almost.
- well [chuckles] there ain't nothing here at the dollar king that i don't know about.
- are you sure about that?
"'cause if you're sure about that, i'll make you a wager."
"- oh, yeah?"
and what do i get if i win?
- i'll leave you alone.
- hmm.
"and what do you get if you win, which you won't, but what do you get?"
"- you get cleaning supplies, and you clean up your mom's old salon."
- that's it?
just clean up her salon and not actually work there?
- that's up to you.
- deal. [spits]
"well, if you don't shake, then how are you gonna know i'm not gonna keep my word?"
- i trust you wouldn't break your word with the one and only constantine.
- you're probably right.
i probably won't. [chuckles]
see?
i knew harley skipped school!
[sighs]
- maybe he was lying.
- lying?
harley don't lie to me.
- take a closer look and think really hard.
- okay.
- it's christmastime.
school is out.
it's 9:00 p.m. at night.
- wow.
"Oh, I don't know if anything can make me feel any better."
I'm just so sad that it's come to this.
"Well, I got a little someone coming who's gonna make you feel real good."
"- Hey, what did you do?"
"- No, I didn't do him, but Colleen can."
Did you get me a prostitute?
What?
No. (scoffs)
What do you take me for?
"No, he's a dancer."
Classy.
"But if you tip him enough, he will have sex with you."
"HEATHER: (gasps) Oh, this is perfect."
"Yeah, it's gonna be good."
"This could be just the thing that makes Matt jealous, that he'll just come running-man back to you."
Jealous?
"- Yeah, jealous."
- Yes.
"You guys haven't talked to Matt, have you?"
- No way.
- Hell no.
- Team Colleen.
- Hos before bros.
I broke up with him.
- What's that?
- Shut the front door.
You just said you missed him.
I do.
"Well, then why did you break up with him, Colleen?"
Because Matt's a great guy.
I got scared.
Matt fits into some really bad patterns in my family history.
"I mean, I do know, but I'm embarrassed."
"Kaitlin, you come in here all the time, and you look right through me like I don't even exist."
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
"I mean, why would a girl like you pay any attention to a guy like me ?"
I know the only reason you'd ever get to know me is if you had no choice.
"Tonight, that happened, and it felt like fate."
I didn't want it to end.
"I guess, I mean, that's understandable."
"But what do you mean, you didn't want it to end ?"
What the... ?
Mom...
It's okay.
Frank !
Just got your message.
I was so worried.
"Oh, me, too !"
Go for it.
There was a flipping earthquake.
But wait.
How did you get here ?
What about the pier ?
What about it ?
The pier is fine.
There's a heartbeat.
Thank God.
"The baby is under stress and, after a fall, there can be a rupture."
Separation.
Can you treat that ?
We still have some more tests to run.
"Okay, I've always wondered this."
"In your opinion, who is a better food industry server ?"
So unless he's here to report a crime...
I can't allow him in this building.
I don't know.
Makes you think.
Vic says the guy was a real crackerjack cop.
"Somebody like him can get booted, man, none of us are safe."
Come on.
The guy's old.
Probably lost his edge.
–Nothing's gonna happen to us.
–How are you so sure?
Because we're careful.
Because Joe got sloppy and stupid.
"Stupid, huh?"
"–Vic, I..."
–What's stupid is Joe's twice the cop you'll ever be.
You're too sloppy to even know it.
–Here we go again.
–I guess so.
"You know, I'm gettin' a little tired of this bullshit."
I'm gettin' tired of constantly having to clean up after your bullshit!
"Every time something goes to shit in your life, I become your whipping boy."
Why don't you find someone else?
–Maybe that's exactly what I'll do.
–You want my transfer request?
"Say the word, Vic!"
It'll be on Aceveda's desk first thing in the morning!
–Fine.
Write it up.
–Fine!
Asshole.
–What'd you call me?
You're not even the prettiest woman in this car.
That couldn't be further from the truth!
"Okay, look, the editor's gonna be here any minute."
We still don't have an idea for this book.
Don't panic.
Maybe he'll be late.
"Oh, my God, he's not late."
"And the advance he gave us was huge, and we've already spent it."
What?
I didn't get any money.
You've only been working here a day.
Don't get greedy.
You know what?
I'll stall him.
"Anderson, how lovely to see you."
"This is my collaborator, Melanie."
- Hello.
- Listen.
"We could do that whole dance, but let me just bottom-line this for you."
Melanie and I just need a little...
"Victoria, you better not be asking for another extension."
You and Melanie have had two years.
Two?
"Extension, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Delay this idea that is going to change children's literature forever?
"If anything, we need less time."
Fantastic.
I want to hear it after I take this.
- Is there a place I can...
"- Oh, yes."
Right down here.
The father will be back.
It's all right.
[Sobbing]
Mama...
"It's dimmie, mama."
Dimmie...
"Why you did this to me, dimmie?"
Why?
"Mama, I'm going to take you out of here."
"Mama, I'm going to take you home."
[Speaking Greek]
Everything's going to be all right.
"Mama, I'm going to take you home."
[Speaking Greek]
"Mama, I'm going to take you home."
Couldn't you put her someplace else?
"Like what, private hospital?"
"Who got the money for that, dimmie..."
You?
There seems to be an alien pubic hair in my drink.
I beg your pardon?
Never seen it before in my life.
Have you?
"Well, actually, father, we're pretty comfortable up there, at least compared to the gemini and Mercury programs, where they were tight for space."
"You see, we've got about 210 cubic feet, so we move around."
"If you ever go again, will you take me along?"
What for?
First missionary on Mars.
"Tell me, was it public relations you did for the gestapo or community relations?"
I'm Swiss.
"Yes, of course."
"And you never went bowling with goebbels, either,"
"Yeah, I understand that."
"- Uh, how old are you, young lady?"
- Nineteen.
Yeah.
"Well, probably mostof you think I'm a real S.o.B. I knowthat."
- [Murmuring Agreement]
- I understand howyou feel.
"But, you know, I want peace too."
- But peace with honor.
- [Girl] What does that mean?
[Quiet Murmuring]
"Well, you can't have peace withouta price."
"Sometimes you have to be, uh, willing to fightfor peace... and sometimes to die."
Yeah?
Tell that to the G.I. S who are going to die tomorrow in Vietnam.
[Girl] What lets you kill women and children?
Whatyou have to understand is we're willing to die forwhat we believe in.
- [Girl] That's right.
- [Boy] It's the truth.
Yeah.
"Look, thatman up there, he lived in similartimes."
"Oh, he had chaos, civil war, hatred between the races."
- [Boy] This is all bullshit.
- Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room... atthe White House and just pray.
"But, you know, Liberals... act like idealism belongs to them."
That's nottrue.
No.
My family... went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.
My grandmother was an abolitionist.
"Itwas Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown,"
- [Impatient Murmuring]
"- Uh, to abolish slavery."
Shut up.

"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""
Those words had been dancing around my head all night.
"I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase."
"Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses, they'll know."
It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's who was first credited with the line.
He would shout it every time he dealt blackjack.
"That was over 40 years ago, and the words still catch."
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
There it is!
"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""
"Yeah, try it."
I had heard it at least 14 times that night.
I couldn't lose.
"First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal."
"There were certain institutions and people that frowned upon it, but it's legal."
And not everyone can do it.
Just those with gifted minds.
I have a gifted mind.
That's what got me into all this mess.
"I was counting cards and I was up over $640,000."
All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.
"Well, that's all right."
I've been winning and losing for years.
"George, this was found snagged on the shed where you made the tea."
Got any ideas?
Yeah.
That woman that Henry had a spat with at the party last night.
"She was wearing a cardigan, same colour as that."
Iris Lightman?
Is that her name?
"Thank you, George."
I'm sure we'll have you out of here very shortly.
"Of all the secretaries I know,"
Jean is definitely one of the most obliging.
Interesting?
I'm afraid so.
All right.
I did go to that flower garden this morning.
I wanted to punish Henry Lee for not speaking up.
"Punish him how, Iris?"
By hitting him with a spade.
A spade?
Yes!
"But as I stood there in that garden shed,"
"I realised it wasn't going to solve anything, was it?"
So I left.
That's it?
Yes.
OK.
So this is what really happened.
You put hemlock in Henry's teacup and then set up George Hammond for the crime.
I don't know any George Hammond.
"Come on, Iris, make this easier on yourself."
Where would I get hemlock?
How would I know which cup to put it in?
"Whatever, corn chip man."
You got a problem with that?
"No, but..."
It's kind of low rent in the era of the cronut.
"""Cronuts""?"
What's a cronut?
Imagine a croissant had a baby with a doughnut.
"- Oh, that sounds like a delicious baby."
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, let's go right now."
"The only bakery that makes them is, uh, a few blocks away."
Fresh cronuts...
Full day's calories in one bite.
I can't.
I-I'm swamped.
I can't leave.
You always say that.
"You know, the only time I see you is when I come here."
"Well, I-I practically live here."
You're gonna have to deal with that.
At some point... soon...
"You're gonna have to let me take you on a proper date so we can, you know, move this thing forward."
Thing?
What thing?
"Hey, hey!"
Nice!
"Dad, you look tired."
Would you like to lie down?
"Well, I am tired a little bit after chemo, but I'm stronger than I have been."
Being with you and Jackson is the best medicine I've got.
This new treatment sounds so hopeful.
It is.
Don't mess it up.
Son of a...
"Captain, where are we?"
We have reason to believe that the explosive was a diversion.
Diversion from what?
An armed team has taken over the White House.
Do we have the president?
I spoke to Walker.
He had eyes on Eagle.
Fifteen minutes is a lifetime.
Radio chatter indicated they were headed for the PEOC.
No contact.
We have to assume they've been compromised.
We gotta get you to a phone.
Call SEAL Team Six and they come in here and they'll shoot these assholes in the head.
- We keep a satphone in the residence.
- Great.
Where's that at?
Of course it is.
- You ever been rock climbing?
- We climbing this?
"Unless you got a better idea, yeah."
"No, I don't."
"By the way, John Cale."
- James Sawyer.
"-I'll get you out of here, sir."
Just follow me up.
"Yeah, I'm right behind you."
Make sure you have one handhold before you let go of the other one.
"- Whatever you do, I'll do."
I ain't doing that shit.
The scene here at the White House is getting more chaotic every second.
"Summer, how come we keep looking for Pancakes when there's a giant elephant in the room ?"
We walk around the elephant.
"It may be big, but we are crafty."
The boys should have been back over an hour ago.
Aren't you worried ?
"No, I'm not worried."
"I'm freaking terrified, okay ?"
That's why I'm focusing on just finding Pancakes and not about the fact that my boyfriend could be laying on the side of the road ravaged by zombies.
"Okay, well, let's go look for them."
In what ?
They took the only car.
Have you thought of that ?
"Well, let's listen to the radio and see if there's any news."
The radio stopped working with the aftershock.
What was that ?
Pancakes ?
Maybe it was Ryan and Seth.
Why would they need to break a window ?
I don't know.
What do we do ?
"Quick, hide !"
Shh !
"No, no, no."
"Summer, wait."
I've got a better idea.
"Summer, come here."
Shh !
You received a makeover under false pretenses.
You lied about having asthma.
Do you even like Bob Seger ?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.
"We didn't quit until five in the morning, so I stayed over."
"Thank you, sir."
"This friend, sir, the lawyer, where can I reach him?"
SID:
Is this a grilling session?
What am I?
Some kind of suspect or something?
"Nothing personal, sir."
I have to ask these routine questions.
"Well, his name is Leo Hart."
But I think you're gonna have trouble contacting him.
He took the plane for Rome at noon.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're ready to roll.
"Let's do it then, huh?"
Mark!
Why don't you entertain the Lieutenant while we shoot this.
"I'm sure he's seen this, anyway."
Seen it?
He was in it.
"Yeah, you know, Ward is right."
"Time is my business, you know, and I always know it."
"Oh, boy, am I hung-over today."
I'll be glad when this day's over.
"Hey, what time you got, Lieutenant?"
11:00 on the dot.
Are you kidding?
"Jeez, I paid a thousand smackers for this watch."
I lost five minutes overnight.
"Do you mind, sir?"
I have never seen a thousand dollar watch before.
"Boy, that must be solid gold."
There are thousands of other wolves in the world.
Not like these.
Plucky English survivors where wolves have been extinct for hundred of years?
I could sell the movie rights.
I might even play myself.
"Jo, we'll do close-ups back at my place."
Did you not hear?
They're wolves.
Not space wolves or zombie wolves.
- Just regular wolves!
- And this is their home!
So go and write a song about it.
"Thanks for your help,"
I couldn't have done it without you etc.
Hunt's over and it's way past your bedtime.
What is wrong with you?
You're obsessed!
"Yeah, and that means a lot coming from her."
Shannon...
Shannon's friend.
Say goodbye to the puppies.
Because they're going to their new home now.
"Steve, check the map."
Let's figure a way out of this place and away from these kids.
And then go back and secure the crate.
Did you know about this?
What?
That Kyle's an egomaniac who'll trample over anyone to get what he wants?
"I had an inkling, yes, but he just proved it."
- So you let him use us.
- No!
Listen.
All he means to say is that he's been dumb since birth.
I see.
He lost his speech in an accident 20 years ago.
But you just said he was born dumb!
Yes.
He could speak a little before the mishap but turned absolutely dumb after the accident.
But he cooks well.
He can prepare any vegetable dish.
Will you cook anything I write and give you?
Why write?
The poor chap can't speak.
But we can.
And he's not deaf.
What's the name?
Shiraj (a Muslim name).
"I mean, it's Shivraj."
(a Hindu name).
"And what does the other ""S"" stand for?"
Shivraj Sharma.
He cooks well.
"Since you're a Brahmin, you must know the hymns!"
"We want him to cook, not to perform a ritual for us!"
"It's good to know, sir."
"You must've been reciting the hymns before the accident, right?"
"The Gayatri Mantra, too?"
"You can't speak, all right."
But you must sing for us.
Recite the Gayatri Mantra for us.
That's enough.
Employ him.
But tell him that we're vegetarians...
I don't want any flesh or fish in this household.
Is there anyone remembers where we left off last time?
Actually I need to go to the bathroom.
Quiet!
"First, come to the board, then you can go."
Take a piece of chalk from there.
I took the chalk.
Draw a trapezoid for me.
"No way, Professor, I don't trap people."
I don't do things like that.
"I said draw a shape, a trapezoid."
Did I ask for something else?
"Sit down, zero!"
"You, you are a dead man!"
"Hey you, the one with the hood."
Stop there.
Come here.
Come here.
Take your hood off.
"Take if off, take it off."
How wonderful!
Very nice!
It's high time you have a makeover.
"Yeah, it's high time."
From now until the day you cut your hair...
I will be taking away some of it in small bunches like this.
Ok?
"Now, have a great lesson."
May God help you through the lessons.
"Again, a question from 2005 goes like this..."
The engine of my car doesn't start.
"So, I take it to a mechanic to see what... is wrong with it, and he says nothing."
"If p is, qpurely and simply..."
I just want you to be happy.
I am happy.
"Yeah, okay."
You're right.
I'm sorry.
"From now on, I'm going to be here for you."
"But I want you to know that if you ever change your mind, and you need a job, you know where to go."
Thank you.
And if you ever need a job...
"Uh, nah."
♪ Yeah. ♪
"God, you guys are so amazing."
I want you to show you guys something.
"Oh, my God, it's happening."
"Okay, now, remember, no helmet-to-helmet contact."
"Well, we still got some tough decisions to make, man."
Ooh!
What do you think?
I got it yesterday.
Wow.
That is disappointing.
"Before the accident, I was really on the fence about Noah, but meeting you two opened my eyes."
Anyone who has friends as good as you must be a pretty special person.
"Man, this rental cost me 80 bucks."
You rented yours?
Aah!
"Ah, I really appreciate you guys pitching in"
- for Noah.
"- Yeah, friends till the end."
- No man left behind.
- Well we gotta make sure this place is completely sterile.
His immune systems pretty shot right now.
This is Calvin.
You're thinking about the pledging from the Omega Chi.
Spitter and Quiter.
Excellent.
You're awesome.
"Thanks, I think."
"Hey Eth, you met my friend Calvin."
I have.
On more than one occasion.
The mystery guy.
That's cool.
It's weird for me to picture but... completely cool.
"So, how've you been?"
Couldn't be better.
"So fellas, I have a little anouncement to make."
"Join me, in the basement, for a chapter meeting in five."
"All right, libations will be provided."
"- He can stay, right?"
"- Well, can he keep a secret?"
"Because, if you can't keep a secret."
You should leave the room right now.
- You all with me?
- Can we see a little of the ZBZ swear?
We're going to throw a party.
A theme party based on the book The Great Gatsby.
Which we all know is a big Lizzi favorite.
"There will be great costumes, fun music and a dance instructor that's gonna teach us dances from the 20."
Did I just fell asleep with my eyes open?
I haven't finished yet.
That's just...
- the upstairs party.
"- But downstairs,"
Shouldn't it be Brandon's decision?
He's the one who got his ass kicked.
"I wouldn't put it that way, but that's a good point."
What if it doesn't work?
"I mean, what if he can't use his fingers at all?"
"Look, Mike and I talked through all of this."
And you made your decision.
Got it.
Hey.
Nice coat rack.
"Yeah, well, might as well use it for something."
Brandon.
"I mean, you can still play, right?"
Not classical.
Not the way I did.
"OK, so all music is dead to you then?"
"- No, but..."
"- Well, it sounds like that's what you're risking,"
- if you have this surgery.
- Ok.
"Look, I had a future."
That's not something you just throw away.
But what if you're not throwing it away?
What if it's just... a different future?
"What if it doesn't have to be that way, though?"
"I mean, why is everyone focusing on the worst-case scenario?"
"Ok, yeah, I'm sorry."
I hear you.
It's...
I hate it when people assume the worst.
- Like your birth dad?
"- Yeah, like him."
I guess.
"Professor, let's see the medallion."
"Have you got an idea, MacGyver?"
"Well, if the cult took the Torch out of the Ark, maybe they built a bigger, better one."
But where is it?
I think we're in it.
Are you suggesting that this entire chamber is a giant Ark?
This could be the key.
Then we need to find a keyhole.
Maybe not.
The Torch of Truth.
It's more magnificent than I ever imagined.
Wait a minute.
Just wait.
I guess it's all right.
You're wrong.
"These caves are full of unpleasant surprises,"
I'm afraid.
"Lord Cleeve, at your service."
"I owe you a debt of thanks, Mr. MacGyver."
"And you too, Miss Carson."
"Now, if you'd mind just handing over the Torch to my partner."
Partner?
"I'm truly sorry, MacGyver."
"I don't like this, Cleeve."
You promised not to hurt them.
"I wouldn't dream of it, but we can hardly have them following us, now can we?"
I trusted you.
"How can you do this, Atticus?"
You're not a criminal.
We have what we came for.
Let's get out of here.
First I wanna know where the clothes are from.
You'd rather walk naked than receive a gift from me.
You'll bring the stuff back to where it came from.
Understand?
"- So, I might as well just leave!"
"- Yep, you might as well."
Where did you get them from?
- A girl gave them to me and she...
- Watch out.
"I tell you, watch out."
"Don't be mad at me, Franz."
"Well, none of us is an angel."
"Move, don't stand around."
Let's go down to the pub.
- What?
You really want to go?
"- Sure, why not?"
Stop bothering it.
"You, stop smoking."
The air in here is bad enough already.
You're crazy.
"They've never been inside a cage, they don't understand."
What about Franz?
- He doesn't want the clothes
"- But I want Biberkopf, I want him!"
- I won't do it.
- If I want Biberkopf I get him!
- What do you want with that guy?
"The weaklings, I have no use for them."
Leave that little bird alone already.
"Herr Biberkopf, my tie came undone."
Don't you have one of your patented clip-on ties?
Sir?
What's the matter with it?
"My father died very soon after he called in your debt, Harry Clayton."
"And you were there, in the casino, the night it happened."
SURI:
So what happened?
BEN:
There was a shod and the screen jumped.
- SURI:
I can't believe that.
- Suri.
Wait.
Suri...
- It cut out.
- What cut out?
There was a shod.
Ben just told me.
Everything went down.
(SIGHS)
"Why weren't you honest with me, Harry?"
- I looked like an idiot in there.
- I'm sorry.
How am I supposed to do my job knowing you were at that casino the night Lau died?
"- Yeah, I should have told you that."
"- And yet once again, you didn't."
"You're the reason I got to where I am, Harry."
"Everything I've learnt has come from watching you these two years, but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you screw it up for me."
Detective Superintendent Winter and I couldn't be quite sure who was interviewing who.
You have to think the way they do.
Should be quite easy for you.
You'd be a smartarse if you were smart
(LAUGHS)
- My shame?
- Glitter.
- Ohh.
Tell me what happened.
"We picked up my graduation stuff on the way, and..."
I don't know.
I guess the tassel got my dad thinking.
Why didn't you leave them in the car?
I didn't want them to get stolen.
"And I may have taken it out to impress a certain Chyna with a ""Y."""
I think she really liked me.
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.
I graduate in five hours!
We'll get you another cap and gown.
That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.
I'm not gonna be the one to lose it after it's survived earthquakes and wars and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!
Fine.
Where is this place?
I don't know!
I remember there was a lot of brass and mirrors and loud '80s music.
"Well, that narrows it down."
Wait.
"Uh, it was by the airport."
All right.
We'll find it.
I'll take you.
Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.
"Thank you, Jay."
(sighs)
What happened to him?
I'm back.
It's true.
The doctor declared him dead.
Yes.
He was put on the bed.
We didn't touch him.
"You may have kept your key, but the prisoner found another one."
The key to freedom.
It's extraordinary!
He could not crawl through the bars!
Chief.
"This man, was he dead, yes or no?"
"Mr Judge, to be dead is to be dead, and he was dead."
He lives.
He lives.
A boy is arrested for murder.
But he is innocent.
"Then he hangs himself, dies, and escapes from jail without being seen."
"If we don't double our readership with that, I will be hanged!"
Hold your horses!
One hanging man is enough.
One of two things:
"Either Jacques Dollon was not dead and he went out alone, or he was dead and someone took him out."
"Anyway, we must know how the escape took place."
An inexplicable mystery is worthy only of one man.
I'm sure of it now.
"He returns, unlike what I said earlier."
Fantômas?
Yes.
"I have to take the case, if only to avenge Juve."
What are you going to do?
Blood.
Get lost!
"I'm a little stressed, OK?"
"Well, I'm just the guy to relieve that stress."
- How's that?
- It helps.
Mm-hmm.
- Ow!
"- Was that a good ""ow""?"
"No, it wasn't you."
It was this.
Whose earring is this?
"- Well, it's not yours?"
- No.
"Well, I-I-I have no idea."
"Honestly, I don't know who-whose earring that is."
"Alan, sweetheart, I'm not accusing you."
- Why not?
- I know you're not having an affair.
"Oh, you think I'm safe?"
You think other women aren't attracted to me?
- I haven't said anything.
"- And, boy, are you oh so wrong."
"Just today at the store, this slim little blonde with a low-cut dress, she came up to me and asked me if the bread was fresh."
"Alan, sweetheart, I know there are still many women that still are attracted to you."
- You don't sound very threatened.
- I'm threatened.
I know I could lose you at any moment.
- (blows)
"- Oh, stop that."
We just found an earring in our bed.
"I know... a cheap, tacky one, the kind of thing a teenager would... wear."
- Eric!
- What about Eric?
That's what always happens.
"He sees something, then the killer has to silence him before he can say what he knows."
How is he?
His heart had stopped.
"It was touch and go for a while, but we managed to revive him."
They're just getting him to hospital.
And what was it?
"Veronal, I'd say."
"Some sort of sleeping draft, anyway, in his whisky."
Who found him?
His son.
All right.
"My father was late coming down to breakfast, so I went to call him."
"I found him lying on the bed fully dressed, and at first, I thought he must have had some sort of heart attack."
I don't know.
Did he often have whisky before bedtime?
I don't know.
This your dad's?
Yes.
He didn't smoke it much.
"And, um..."
And you say you...
Haven't...
Touched anything?
No.
I thought he was dead.
I called the police.
"Well, for..."
"Someone whose mother's been murdered and father's been poisoned, you seem remarkably unaffected."
"What would you like me to do, cry?"
I never liked my parents.
My mother was cruel and stupid.
How do you mean?
"For example, he says that Dave is de-prioritizing me, that he doesn't pay attention to what I actually want."
"Yeah, but, honey, that's just Dave being Dave, you know?"
Yeah.
"But so then, what if Dave being Dave is sort of like"
Dave bulldozing me?
Please continue to look at the fish!
Enjoy them as they come at you!
"I get it, dude, it's advanced snorkeling."
Dave...
"Hey, I'm trying to do this exercise!"
"Why don't we talk about this during down time, okay?"
This might be what the therapist is referring to.
You're missing out on life.
"It's happening right now, out here, all around us, all right?"
And you're too busy complaining about your problems to enjoy all these beautiful little fish that are...
Marcel!
Yes?
"Marcel, we have a real problem here!"
It is not a problem!
It is a circle of life!
The circle of life is circling our lives right now!
"Do not move, do not panic."
Shark!
What?
Shark!
Jason!
"Okay, it's all happening, Marcel!"
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
Don't worry!
The father was a Soviet diplomat who lived in Paris for five years... and then immigrated to America in 1968.
When's the flight?
- What flight?
- Mikhail's flight to New York.
- I want his passport.
- No!
You're a cop.
That's evidence.
You think it was a coincidence that guy was Russian?
Who knows what Mikhail was involved in.
Sebastien... what happened to my brother could've happened to me.
Thirty-two years ago it was only luck that kept me in France.
He made a sacrifice and never knew It.
I gotta go.
The killer did not know Mikhail is dead.
You go to New York with that face and-
Maybe he isn't.
"Would you like a vodka before you sleep, Mr. Suverov?"
"- No, thank you."
- You're welcome.
What you see before you is called gridlock.
- Next exit.
"- Yeah, yeah."
I'm writing the great american novel here on the job.
Literary kind of stuff.
Knock the fillings outta your teeth.
Yeah.
I see Everything.
That's what it is.
"It's all about looking around, observing stuff."
"Take you, for instance."
Like that accent of yours.
"Fine, I'll give it to you straight."
His daughter's letter?
"She's dead, Neil."
- When?
- January 2006.
Then what's this?
If his daughter died in January... how could she have written this letter in June?
This means Natasha Malhotra is the killer?
"But, where is she?"
- You?
- Good evening.
How did you get in?
Through the door.
I'm sorry... is there something wrong?
Yeah.
"I prefer the next piece, it's a... a lot more dramatic."
I don't understand.
Five years ago...
Samara Shroff joined Kabir Malhotra's empire as his executive assistant.
He didn't know her.
But...
Samara knew him very well.
"Because she was, his brother, Iqbal Chand Malhotra's daughter."
"Isn't that right, Natasha?"
Natasha?
"Mr. Menon, is this a joke?"
Mr. Kabir Malhotra was dying of cancer.
And your father was his legal heir.
Making sure that it stayed that way was crucial.
And for the past five years... you were doing just that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Malhotra wasn't aware that when he was telling us the truth... it affected someone else... a lot more.
"Yeah, and he'll be shooting after the windows go."
- It's the best we can do.
- All right.
Stand by.
"Turn it on, or I pull the trigger."
- I can't turn it on.
- Why not?
Why not?
- Because it has to be implanted.
- She's right.
The chip derives its power from tiny electrical impulses fired between neurons.
It has to be in your skin to work.
- I really gotta...
- Sit down!
You're not going anywhere.
See?
Dude actually had a chip in his arm.
"All right, it seems calm for now."
Reid's still on the train.
Now we have two agents in there.
It's probably the Higher Authority.
I told you.
I have protocols to follow.
I was supposed to go right back out there.
I have rules.
Answer the phone.
"You want me to stay, I'm obviously going to stay."
"But, I mean, you're going to be the one that has to explain it to the Man."
"Whoa, ""the Man""?"
"They're still trying to tell you what to do, Ted."
Why can't you all just leave me alone?
Leave you alone?
Listen to this.
She was a prodigy.
Had a breakdown at 16 and was institutionalized.
Took a while to get these records.
Emile Sayles was her teacher.
"Duval, listen..."
"Oh, it gets better."
Both their names are on the condolence books of the other victims.
And you were right about the admissions director.
He did have a secret.
Liz Kenyon was sleeping with him to get access to the applications.
He was afraid of getting fired.
That's what you saw.
Duval...
I have the warrant to Kenyon's home and office.
We're mounting up now.
This was good work.
She's been killing these kids.
We're gonna stop her.
"Skip past the part where even though I asked you to wait, you broke into her office."
Then what?
She was on the floor when I got here.
She was gone when I got back.
When you got back from where?
I went after Emile.
You saw him?
No.
No.
"Emile Sayles, her piano tutor, has been dead since 1997."
There is no Emile.
She signed both names in those condolence books because Emile is only in her head.
It's just her.
Yes.
That's what I was telling you.
"I only did mushrooms once, in high school, but I remember it like it was yesterday."
I'm returning what's left over tomorrow.
Excuse me.
Here.
Good news.
Dr. Black says you haven't had any seizure activity in 24 hours.
- You can go home now.
- Good.
"And as it turns out, we still have a home."
"Our lawyer says, if you're psychotic when you give away everything you own, it doesn't count."
"The nurse doesn't need to hear our problems, sweetheart."
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"You seem quite different today, Mr. Myers."
How are you feeling now?
Like I need to get back to the office.
We're fighting a hostile takeover.
We're in the middle of a new ad campaign.
I haven't been away from my desk this long in years.
Hear that?
I have my baby back.
- Mr. Myers.
- Ian.
- U look terrific.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Well, I turned in my toga."
Ian.
"- God, thank you so much for everything."
"- Yeah, yeah."
We're thinking what this place needs is a donor wall.
My father worked there till the day he died.
The old man loved his female employees.
I have more relatives and half-relatives working for me than you can imagine.
(chuckles)
What am I talking about?
This is about Clayton.
"Even though I was older, he always looked out for me."
We use to call him the Mayor.
(sighs)
I just want to see him pull through this.
RYAN:
"It's okay, let him go."
"Gibbs, Gibbs, let him come back to you."
(sighs)
Just be patient.
Think about something else.
"The sweater I wore to your house the other night, what color was it?"
I know you remember.
No!
"No, no... (sighs)"
We think the shooter has a connection to AUTEC.
"You know what AUTEC is, Mr. Wickes?"
I do.
A lot of unhappy folks from your company knew exactly where SECNAV was gonna be today.
Do any of them have a connection to AUTEC projects?
Lawrence Ridgeway.
"He wasn't the man with the gun, but..."
Details.
(sighs)
Wickes built something for AUTEC back in the '70s.
Before my time.
Ridgeway was the only one still around that worked on it.
"Oh, my gosh."
Do you remember The Casbah?
That concert?
- Barely.
In the best way.
"- Oh, my God."
"You covered ""How Will I Know?"" And you dedicated it to me and I sat there trying not to laugh."
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were easier when we were younger.
"Unlike our kids, we just jumped into things."
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that?"
Just figure it out as we go along.
Maybe this didn't turn out to be the romance we thought it would be.
It was more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it.
- I don't wanna miss out.
"- Well, neither do I."
I don't have a ring so this will have to do.
"- Rufus, what are you doing?"
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your fifth husband.
So...
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Come here.
"Hey, don't worry about this, okay?"
Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
Today one will left.
Didn't worked.
I think its out of range.
Take the car near the rally.
I think they know we are following them.
Increasing the speed.
"I am getting near, you make target."
Drive fast its getting late.
You don't know my nature?
Uncle?
Why its not working?
Bhai (brother) its on target should i shoot.
"Wait lets find out where's the diamond,"
Papa!
Yes!
"A man who is behind us, asking for side, should I give him?"
"Papa, tell him if he give him side, then car will come on the middle."
"Then how could we get the range, I'm telling you over take him,"
"One, Two Three..."
"Laxminarayan, it's your first murder, Shoot him,"
"For your mother's tears sake, Shoot him."
"Papa, he's escaping, No, Papa."
"I suppose to leaving you but to ask first,"
My I take a leave please?
Please!
No!
"Till he die, you can't leave from here, Follow him,"
I miss a lot still water and died grand mother.
What you looking at my face?
"We don't have to spare Yadav, Come on."
Dad!
Dad!
Why her?
Like there's not enough rich people on this island.
"She's away from home, out of her element."
Dawkins sees her as an easy target.
Whatever.
"I need everything on Dana, okay?"
"Travel itineraries, flights, car rentals..."
"Hey, guess what?"
"I've done this before, but thank you."
"That's it, matches the description of the car Dawkins stole."
"Five-0, we'll take it from here."
- What are you doing?
Looking for cash.
It's what Dawkins would have done.
Empty.
Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something.
- Food or water?
- No.
Dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now.
"If he wants to get off the island, he needs to change his appearance."
- Coming in?
It's a men's room.
"That's the luxury of carrying a badge, kid."
You can go anywhere.
Lemonade mix and mayo.
It's old prison trick for dying hair.
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.
Looks like our man's a blond now.
Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street.
Fifteen minutes ago.
Factor in the time for a dye job and he couldn't have made it very far.
I'm going to climb Mount Everest.
Bike across Death Valley.
I'm going to eat my weight in garbage.
Why would I want to waste my indestructableness on business?
See?
I told you overreacting would work.
"Harvey, stop fidgeting."
Try and look like we're having a good time.
I feel like all we're being judged on is how we look.
How do I look?
Gorgeous.
Now will you stop asking me that?
Stop yelling at me.
Nobody's going to vote for us if it looks like we're fighting.
But do I really look okay?
"Okay, I'm sorry."
Let's just dance.
Got to go.
"Dreama, have you seen my camera?"
"No, but you can use mine."
"Look for it, please."
Something tells me this is about more than a camera.
Thank you for helping me back here.
My pleasure.
I was feeling a little disoriented.
"Ooh, I wonder if I could scurry up those curtains."
"Come on, Hilda, let's go."
Call the elevator.
I'll be right there.
(chuckling)
I'm beginning to think you have a problem.
"And now, the moment everyone's been waiting for."
I haven't been in the back of a car in years.
"Come on, butch."
Be a pal?
"Sorry, krzeminski."
I got plans.
"Yauch, what about you?"
Told my gal I'd take her to a show.
I can't swing it.
Why don't you ask carter?
Dooley would kill me if I let a lady take nights.
"Besides, she can barely make her own shift."
"Work day starts at 9:00 a.M., honey."
"Tell me, agent krzeminski,"
Who are you bringing to the show...
Your wife or your girlfriend?
Come on in.
Have a seat.
We really appreciate you coming down here
"To talk with us, mr."
Jarvis.
That isn't already in the missing-car report I filed.
That report might take us a while to dig up.
"You see, the nypd aren't as efficient"
"As the ssr at record-keeping,"
"Which is saying something, because our files are a wreck."
That hurts.
My filing's impeccable.
Isn't that stark's butler?
You know this guy?
Only from the file.
Do you think he was really involved
"Well, maybe he didn't blow the place up,"
Bitch...
Thanks for coming out.
"Holy hottie,Batman."
"# Bitch disguised as an angel,made me want to die #"
# Said she gots to go in the middle of my show #
"# She didn't even tell me why,she didn't even try #"
"# Bitch left me on my birthday,ripped my world apart #"
"# Bitch left me on my birthday,angel with no heart #"
# Bitch left me on my birthday #
"Based on a true story,man."
On his birthday!
- # Bitch!
# - # Bitch #
"# Left me on my birthday,heart is made of lead #"
"# Bitch left me on my birthday,birthday wishes dead #"
# Bitch left me on my birthday #
# Bitch!

"Look,I'm sorry."
But wouldn't that be kind of gross if that turned me on?
You look like a ten-year-old girl.
I feel like a pervert.
You got used to the Hitler.
"Well,the Indian pacifist just is not my thing."
"That says a lot about you,don't you think?"
"It's not right,okay?"
There's hair there for a reason.
"Oh,really?"
And what exactly is the reason?
I don't know.
"Maybe it's nature's way of saying,"
"""Hey,look over here."
Great job.
That's all for today.
"All right, well, great."
Yeah.
How did we do?
Did we do good?
"I mean, are we gonna make it?"
"Well, you know, it's just our first session, you know."
We're not looking for an end result here.
It's not a competition.
"I get all that, but have you seen couples that are worse off than us?"
Yeah.
Or are we that far gone?
We're...
Are you gonna put a...
Like a numerical value on it?
"You know, Doc?"
Like a one to 10?
"One being worst, 10 being best?"
"No, hang on one second."
Where would you put us?
"Right where you are, sir."
"What if someone put a gun to your head right now and said,"
"""You have to answer this second or I'll shoot."
"""Are they gonna make it?"" What do you say?"
What would you say?
Whoa!
"Okay, no one has a gun to my head, Mr. Smith."
It's hypothetical.
It's not a place for inappropriate behavior.
And you definitely don't pull a hypothetical gun on your therapist.
Sorry.
-All done.
-Thank you.
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.
Saw them with my own eyes!
"Sorry, don't think it 'd be ethical to tell you their names."
Good-bye.
Marion?
-Thanks for today.
-Anytime.
"How about tomorrow, for instance?"
I can't remember when I had so much fun.
I'd almost forgotten the wonderful things there are for people to do.
It isn't over yet.
"Mike, please... I don't think... we'd better..."
I mean it!
"-All right, let's talk about this."
-I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.
-Just like that?
-That's right.
"-We're not kids, we're adults!"
-And we're going to behave as such.
"I kissed you, you kissed me."
"That's affection, not carnality or lust."
You ought to know the difference.
And what do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...
Human.
All men are alike.
"The approach is different, but the result is always the same."
"Sooner or later, we'd get around to this."
"If all I wanted was a woman, I could get one any place."
"[Deep voice] ""Don't pay too much, pilgrim."""
Ours.
Great!
"The hilkin department store lingerie day for men, beer decathlon out in munhall, we do that, and some national stuff, too."
It's a very strong list of clients.
Very.
We bill almost 2 million a year.
All right.
"Well,"
I'll look over all the papers and see what we can figure out.
Great.
"Nice to meet you, Jake."
"Yeah, you, too."
"If you have any questions, call my accountant."
"Mom, come on."
I told my friends
"I'd be there, like, 20 damn minutes ago."
Don't you want to spend some time with your Uncle and your cousin Nick?
No.
3 more days of winter recess till he goes back to boarding school.
3 more days.
I know what you mean.
"So, uh, what's with the kid?"
My nephew.
She's your sister?
"No, she's my wife's sister."
"But now, Jake, I want you to understand"
"I don't like to mix family with business, so that's why I want you on point for this one, ok?"
Fine.
Got it covered.
Woman:
I'm looking for James mooney!
(TRANSLATING)
"To call his boss on the way so he can tell Hitler that it was all a dream or whatever he wants to say, but that I don't want to see them ever again, not even in photographs."
And if my boss doesn't want to?
Well then I'll just say two words.
Exactly.
His parents.
I'll send a team to eliminate them before they ever meet
(TRANSLATING)
-And Mr. Himmler will never be born.
(TRANSLATING)
"Go with them, immediately."
"You, Espínola, can return to Flanders."
And don't ignore your phone.
-Don't worry.
"You are Espínola, who conquered Breda?"
The very same.
It is an honor to fight alongside a Grandee of Spain.
"You are also great, although you don't have a title."
(Telephone)
(ANSWERS IN GERMAN)
(IN GERMAN) Himmler on the phone.
"""Ja""."
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
He doesn't accept the deal.
What did he say?
-Better I don't translate.
Let's leave here.
What a waste of cyanide.
"Go on, say what you want to say."
"If you're saying that because of Lola, do not worry"
I do not blame you.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
If this hadn't happened I'd never discover what a sap I am.
"Oh, yes, you would."
- I would have told you.
"- Yes, I suppose so."
"We won't have to put up with each other any longer, will we?"
- Yes.
- I was afraid of that.
Now let's see.
"No house, no show, no prospects."
Don't I get anything out of this?
[clears throat]
Might just as well smoke a doormat.
"You don't happen to have a new cigar about you, do you, Tyler?"
"I'll, uh..."
"I'll walk out and get you one, Commodore."
"- Uh, no, no, no, don't go."
- 'It's alright.'
I feel the need of a short walk anyway.
- I don't want to trouble you.
- No trouble at all.
Doug.
Yes.
"You know, this is only the beginning of all."
"Patricia, it was hardly my fault."
No one could have foreseen that Ganz and Grady would...
But you didn't know those men.
You did it for what you get out of it.
With his interest at heart.
I felt it provided an opportunity for him.
I really did.
"You have my word, dear."
Your word.
"Take care of yourself and whatever you do, do it honorably."
That's the family motto.
"Do me a favor, Dad?"
"Certainly, son."
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
"She won't ask, but she might need it."
I'll keep an eye on her.
"Would all the draftees assemble over here, please."
"Come right in, folks."
"Now, as chairman of the draft board, let me say that all of us regret having to send any of you men off to war."
"You carry our love, our devotion and our undying gratitude."
Please try to come back safely to your homes.
"Now, we've prepared some gift packages."
"If you'll just step up here, I'll hand them out."
"Peyton Place draftees in the bus, on the double."
Let's go.
- Best of luck.
"- Come on, boys, hurry it up."
Make the goodbyes short.
"Name, loud and strong."
Last name.
"- Culver, Jones... ."
- Harvey.
Keep going.
You boys are gonna love the Army.
- Elliot.
"- Elliot, right."
Hurry up in the back.
Plenty of seats.
Nothing in the world's gonna stop me from coming back.
"I love you, Selena."
"I love you, Ted."
- Because I'm gay?
- No.
I didn't say anything.
He must have asked around.
But I didn't tell him.
I swear.
I have to go to class.
You can't make it to any teacher conferences?
"I can, I just need to reschedule for tomorrow."
You don't have to see all of them.
"You should meet her French teacher, Mr. Carinci and, oh, are you going to meet Ezra?"
- Ezra?
"- Ezra Fitz, her English teacher."
"Aria's crazy about him, and I can see why."
"He's very smart, he's attractive, sensitive."
Does he also play guitar?
"Uh, not that I know of, but he does know how to handle a loose cannon."
Today Nick McCullers showed up.
McCullers.
From the library board?
"The same one, with the very same paranoia."
He was about to launch into the gay agenda there in the cafeteria.
"Ezra totally calmed the waters, completely defused the situation."
- It was something to see.
- Mm.
I'm sorry I missed that.
You should meet him.
You'll like him.
I'm late.
"Listen, uh, Ella."
I thought maybe we could pick up where we left off.
Maybe next Friday?
"Okay, it all comes down to Virginia."
"If O'Brien gets Virginia, he wins."
"- However, if we get Virginia..."
- We win!
"No, actually, Gary, if we get it, we tie."
- What?
- What?
"I don't follow these things that closely, but that's right, isn't it, Mr. Davison?"
Yes.
"Tie, like it's a tie?"
"You mean, we tie?"
- You do.
"- The real shock, Greg, is where this leaves us."
Neck and neck if the president takes Virginia.
"Matty, you'll forgive me if I sideline you here."
- Sure.
"- Dan, you know the president well."
What is going on in that Meyer hotel suite right this second?
The president has a lot of top minds working on her campaign.
They're gonna be all over this.
What happens when there's a tie?
Everybody goes online to try to find out what happens if we get a tie.
Way ahead of you.
"Shit, I'm just getting how to tie a tie."
Is there a book?
Like an old-fashioned...
like a paper book?
"Jesus Christ, you know?"
You do your best.
You try to serve the people
- and then they just fuck you over.
- Yeah.
I have to tell him something.
I'm expecting John any minute.
There's been another murder.
In Indiana.
Indiana?
Is there something you want to tell me?
"No, nothing."
The smell on the killer's hands... it's surgical soap.
He must take it with him.
He washes his hands with surgical soap... to get rid of the blood.
I don't like this.
Nina Getz was my patient for many years.
The man has killed 3 people.
A donor's identity is strictly confidential.
Here it is.
Leslie Davison.
"OK, follow me here."
Frank's victim...
Margaret Tattersall... had a kidney transplant 2 months ago.
So?
Our victim...
Nina Getz... had skin grafts from an organ donor... about 2 months ago.
Valerie Wheaton never had a transplant.
"No, but the woman who lived below her did."
"Emma Brody... she had a corneal transplant... and, it turns out... her apartment number is listed incorrectly... on her medical records."
This guy meant to kill Emma Brody.
Holy fuck!
OK.
"So you got the letters... and the organs, right?"
What's the connection?
I'm not done yet.
Nina Getz's donor's name... was Leslie Davison.
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists belong!
These fuckers are goin' down.
Dead.
Or alive.
Tell them that in your fake ching-chong language.
Shut up!
You're an idiot.
"I don't know what you're saying, buddy... but fuck you."
- Fuck me?
- Will you let him talk to you like that?
"- Listen, no, sit down."
- Fuck me?
"Hey, look, man, we're in Alabama."
"Wow, we actually get a first-hand look at the South, huh?"
"Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip through the South, OK?"
This was supposed to be the most romantic week of my life.
Remember that?
Before you fucked it up?
You remember that?
"Just chill, OK?"
We'll be out of this situation.
"You'll be up in Maria's guts in no time, all right?"
Hey.
"She's not some skank, man."
"I've never felt this way about anyone before, really."
What the fuck?
Why am I talking to you about this?
"It's not like you would understand, so--"
I want to be happy
"I want to be happy, just like--"
"Excuse me, please."
That picture was from three days ago.
He's just going to think I was home scrolling through all of his photos!
Back-liking is so desperate!
Okay.
You know what?
Enough with the spying and social media.
Why don't you just go ask him how he feels about you?
You mean have a conversation?
I don't want to freak him out.
Right.
Let me get some clarity here.
You guys are-are boyfriend and girlfriend...
I love him.
"No, you don't, but that-that's fine."
So here's another question.
Have you two ever spoken?
Of course.
We talk all the time.
In person?
With actual words that the other person hears and then responds to?
"What are we, Amish?"
"You should try it, Sam."
And just be straight with him.
JEN:
"Yeah, guys love it when you're direct."
Like when I told Greg his dream hat was stupid.
(scoffs)
The old lady doesn't understand sweet lids.
"Hey, just think, in 12 years, we're gonna be able"
- to help Lark like this.
- JEN:
"Yeah, but I don't want to help her too much, you know?"
- I...?
Something's always the problem with you.
"Today, I've missed... the train, thanks to you."
- To me...?
I wish to make it to Zurich on time.
"So you go your way, I'll go mine"
Strange!
"We're fellow-travelers, on the same destination, same train"
Why split up?
"Besides, aman like me ought to stay with a girl like you"
Wrong!
A girl like me doesn't need a guy like you.
Stop pursuing me
I'll sew it up.
I have a thread and needle.
I'll buy you anew dress
What have you got yourself into?
I told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?
What do you think of yourself?
I wasn't pursuing you
And I don't fancy touching you.
Thank your stars I came in the nick of time
"Else, you would've been in jail."
"I help her, and she says this"
"Hey, take her away"
What did you say?
I got carried away
"Never mind Senorita, never mind."
"In big places, such small things happen"
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain
# We burn it all down
# Cos all our lives
# We're waiting for something new
# Waiting for someone like you
# We are the people
# Who let this whole thing go
# Just like the people you know
# We are the reason
# We're blinded by the goal
"# We are the people, you know"
"# Burning away, light in the sky"
# So you can bring us home
"# Further, further down an open road"
# We've torn it all down
# Why do we pray?
# Why do we talk about angels?
# Flying with their golden wings
# We've burned it all down
# Cos all our lives
# We're waiting for something new
# Waiting for someone like you
# We are the people
# Who let this whole thing go
# Just like the people you know

# We're blinded by the goal
"# We are the people, you know"

"# Step it up, step it up Step it up again"
"# Step it up, step it up Step it up again"
"# Step it up, step it up Step it up again"
"# We can be silenced, we can be brave"
At last you've come to your senses.
Sorry.
Ah.
Do it the way you did it last time.
"Something that makes me look a little younger, please."
You always look young to me.
Perhaps I should chop it all off like you.
Except that I'm not that crazy.
"Aurora, surely you can afford a dress by now."
I've got used to trousers.
They're comfortable and I can move around.
Can you feel that draught?
It comes straight through that wall.
"I've told you before, Mama."
Don't stay here.
- Come back with me to Nohant.
"- No, I want to be in Paris."
"Besides, you don't need my company."
You have that young man.
What's he called?
Malle...
Malle...
- Mallefille.
- Mallefille!
- A very dashing fellow.
- I wish he'd fall off the map.
"You're always looking for something better, Aurora."
"If you'd stayed married, you'd have money."
- You shouldn't beg for scraps like I did.
- I'm doing fine.
The only money I ever saw was what your grandmother paid me not to see you.
You didn't have to take it.
That's right.
"It'll beverydirty, because he strictly forbade me to go in and clean it."
"I wasn't going to charge him a cent, but..."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of that."
Shall I give you the key?
Yes.
I'll see if I can find it.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
And how is he?
Fine.
The poor thing didn't even have any luck in jail.
He got very little publicity.
"Not one lousy television came here, nor one lousy paparazzi."
"With all the trashy shows there are, not one bothered to come and interview me."
"It's sad the state of the ""massesmedia"" in this country."
"Yes, you're right."
The keys...
"Oh, yes."
Thank you.
"By the way, do you know why Benigno is in jail?"
"He's so quiet, the last time he came he didn't say a word."
Benigno is innocent.
Of course.
But innocent of what?
I don't know.
"Of course you do, but you don't want to tell me."
But I'll get it out of you.
All right.
"So long, ma'am."
"If you need anything, you know where I am."
"OK, thanks."
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken..."
"If it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
You are not in the position to ask for anything.
We will take what we wish.
And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.
I'm sure your Führer would approve.
"If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish."
I will waste no more time with her now.
Excuse me.
"I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain."
I've looked everywhere.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Look again.
- I found him.
- Where?
There.
"The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir."
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.
An Indian legend.
"Honey, can I talk to Mommy?"
She says she'll call you back.
Tracey?
Hello?
"I had everything checked out, everything... brain, heart, lungs, blood."
"I got my urine tested, my saliva, my sperm... they tested everything and they found nothing."
Nothing at all.
There's the file.
Take a look.
A little hypoglycemia and nothing else.
Nothing else at all.
"I'm very glad to hear that, Nathan."
- I'm happy for you.
"- So as of this minute, you are out of my life."
"No phone calls, no visits, nothing."
"If I ever see you again here or any place at all, it'll mean the police..."
got it?
May I show you something?
- No.
- It's a photograph.
Anna Rachevsky.
Very cute.
Now leave.
From a Russian family.
That photograph was taken the day she arrived in New York.
I don't give a shit.
"Not much money, father out of the picture."
"She wanted to go to college, but the closest she ever got was working in the cafeteria at NYU."
Her boss treated her like an animal.
The students didn't even notice.
Except one.
"Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!"
"- O, who hath done this deed?"
- Nobody.
I myself.
Commend me to my lord.
Why... how should she be murdered?
"Alas, who knows?"
You heard her say herself it was not I.
She said so:
I must needs report the truth.
She's a liar gone to burning hell:
T'was I that killed her.
"O, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!"
She turned to folly;
and she was a whore.
"Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil."
- She was false as water.
- Thou art rash as fire to say... that she was false.
"O, she was heavenly true!"
Cassio did top her:
ask thy husband else.
"O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell but that I... did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity."
- Thy husband knew it all.
- My husband!
- Thy husband.
- That she was false to wedlock?
"Ay, with Cassio."
"Nay, had she been true..."
If heaven would make me... such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite...
I'd not have sold her for it.
My husband!
"Ay, 'twas he that told me on her first."
We live together like this.
I see.
I don't see it that way.
You don't call people merely living together a family.
I don't want to talk anymore.
"Get out, Big Brother."
Sure thing.
Sagiri.
What?
This illustration made me really happy.
"Let's do our best together next time, too!"
How stupid.
That was something I only drew out of a sense of obligation.
Yes?
I'm Megumi Jinno!
Is Sagiri-chan here?

"Listen, if you're having any second thoughts, you want to call this off, now is the time."
I don't want to call it off.
"So no ""We're going anywhere"" last looks."
"No tears, no ""I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow."""
Nothing that anybody can look back on.
"Look, I know how to play my part."
"After you force me to open up the safe, you can't go straight for the cash box."
"You got to grab some of the other shit, too."
Yeah?
Like what?
Anything.
It can't look like you got tipped off what to take.
Take the cash box last.
"Love, pass her these, will you?"
She's going to the doctor's.
"Oh, we have got to get out of this place."
Thanks very much.
I'm afraid I can't send you through that door if you're not registered.
"Yes, but..."
That's the sys.
"Yes, but what's the reason?"
The beauty of having a system is once you have a system you no longer need reason.
But I'm ill!
If it's an urgent complaint I suggest you get yourself off to AE.
"This job, is it still available?"
It is.
"I'd like an application form, please."
I thought you were off to AE.
What?
"Oh, god no."
No no no.
Fighting fit.
Open for business.
"When you take that cover off, you'll se two valves."
"Now be sure to resist the temptation to turn them, until you double-checked that the fuel line is closed."
"Hi, guys!"
"Hi, Chrissy."
Girls?
"Hi, Jenny!"
"Can I just say, you look great."
"Oh, thanks, Chrissy!"
"And I tell you what, I'm feeling pretty great."
Because...
I'm so sick of seeing all these *** women everywhere.
Good for you!
"Lack of education, that's the problem."
That's why we're doing this demonstration :
For your education.
A beer.
A soda.
Thank you.
"That's Nora, she works for us now."
"I hope you pick up a lot from her,  Angela."
"Am I fired now, or what?"
"Angie, how can you pick up anything from Nora if your fired?"
"Won't work, right?"
I wanted to excuse myself for my faux pas.
- Faux pas.
"You have a problem with women, my dear, as large as this building."
"And you're resentful, stubborn, and complicated."
I don't even want to get into your problem with men.
Again with another attack against me.
You can go ahead and excuse yourself again.
- I wouldn't do that.
Fine then!
I'm a kind-hearted person.
Me too.
I'll be glad to get out of here.
I can imagine.
You'll give me a ride?
Of course.
Lie down next to me.
Get some sleep.
All these people are driving me crazy.
I don't understand what they are talking about.
I don't know what they want from me.
No discussion.
"well, now, what is that?"
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?
"-Oh, stanley."
would you--?
"-That's pearls, stella."
Ropes of them.
"What is this sister of yours, a deep-sea diver?"
"bracelets, solid gold."
Where are your pearls and gold bracelets?
"Be still, stanley."
And here.
Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.
A rhinestone tiara she wore to a costume ball.
-What is rhinestone?
-Next door to glass.
Yeah.
I have an acquaintance who works in a jewelry store and he's coming to make an appraisal of that stuff.
"-Here's your plantation fella, right here."
-You know I-
- Stupid and horrid.
You stay away from these things before she comes out of the bathroom.
The KowaIskis and the DuBois got a different notion on this.
"Indeed they have, thank heavens."
I'm going outside.
Go ahead.
You come on out with me while blanche is getting dressed.
"Now, since when are you giving me orders?"
Are you gonna stay here and insult her?
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.
"hello, stanley."
"Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented and feeling like a brand-new human being."
-Satisfied?
-That satchel has a false lid.
"Go on, look."
Somebody put those there.
I am innocent.
"Well, I am afraid we are left no choice."
"J.D., will you assist me in escorting Mrs. Standish to the jail?"
"Ezra, she's your mother."
EZRA:
"Now, you'll have to forgive the appearance..."
... butthemaidquit.
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.
"I'm cruel, only that I may be kind, mother."
"After all, you should know better than to steal."
"You know, perhaps some time spent behind bars will be instructional."
Preston Wingo put those cuffs links in my bag.
He's blackmailing me.
"Now, why on Earth would he wanna do that?"
MAUDE:
It's none of your business.
"Come on, judge wants us to ride."
"Well, sleep tight."
Don't let the... .
"Well, you know the rest."
What appears to be the trouble?
chris:
This boy just brought us a message from Judge Travis.
He's over in Eagle Bend trying a colored man for murder.
They're too het up for a fair trial.
Judge wants us to bring the prisoner back.
-All of us?
-Yeah.
He's under observation.
"What are you thinking, doctor?"
Sometimes I've a doubt...
"Will you please step out once, doctor?"
Give that to me.
How many times do I've to tell you?
You're a doctor and I'm the patient.
"Bloody, you..."
"You're a patient, I'm a doctor."
That's what I said.
How dare you manhandle me?
I will...
Take it.
How dare you beat me!
"Cerebellum is damaged, cerebrum is battered."
Totally his brain has busted.
You mean he can't remember the past?
Why not?
Didn't I get it on getting beaten up?
He can remember if anyone rakes up his past.
He can if he's beaten up day and night.
Are you feeling for him?
"He was mad after kick, so he lost his brain."
Now I'm peaceful.
No tension.
I thought he would come to disturb us.
"You don't want him but you want the gift he gave, right?"
She's much more clever than what I expected.
Why would you believe me?
But she doesn't know about me.
"If plan A fails, I've a plan B."
- Play the band!
"Lives are in danger--no, no, not for that."
"Dr. Weisfeld, you're under arrest for treason."
Just tell us that the charges aren't true.
We both know.
So just tell us.
- I can't.
They're true.
"- Okay, that's--that's not--"
I had my reasons.
"Artie, homeland security's coming"
To pick you up.
You need to give us a way to help you now.
"You need to concentrate on the mission,"
Not worry so much about me.
Mrs. Frederic fixed this once and she can fix it a--
This whole thing could've been avoided
"If you just told us anything about the sword, the tsuba, your past."
"Anything, Artie, we--we--we could have helped."
We could have run interference with Dickinson.
If you just trusted us.
"So--so what happens now, Artie?"
"I mean, what--what happens with the warehouse?"
"I mean, what, are we in charge?"
what?
I think we should know.
She fixed all this.
Mrs. Frederic.
She fixed all of this years ago.
It's him too.
It--it has to be.
"Okay, Artie,"
"This isn't just about the treason, all right?"
I know.
"But hey, this should turn up for one around."
I've invited Boss to our party.
It was swell of you to invite him.
Hello?
"Oh, hey Russ."
"Is that Russ calling to wishes a happy vacation because if it's not, he's got a wrong number."
- Oh...
- Jerk...
I don't know.
I've to check with Violet.
- Vi?
- No fucking way.
- Violet says no.
"- Violet says ""Fuck no""."
I thought you said we'd had some down time ahead.
"No, Violet told me you'd pull something like this!"
"Oop yea, no kidding she said you'd do that too."
Up the money and call it an easy gig.
"That's text book, Russ!"
"What you think we are, stupid?"
Yea!
Same to you!
- Can you believe him?
"- Look it here, Daze."
Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.
"""Be your best in my new signature dress."
"Let them know you mean business at the Disco or in the boardroom, with the amazing versatility of the premiere piece, in my high end line, a super stylish couture."
"Who's better than you girl?"""
Oh man!
- How much is it?
- Around 300 bucks.
He's in... (BLENDER BUZZING) ...The kitchen.
- But talking to him's not gonna be easy.
- Why?
"Walter, we have company."
"Oh, hello, Agent Dunham."
"Walter, hey."
I need you to tell me what you know about the man we call the Observer.
You once referred to him as your friend.
Seems he may have kidnapped a woman.
They called it the Strawberry Supreme.
PETER:
His favorite ice-cream store shut down.
He made me wait in line with him for four hours to get one last milkshake.
They have a secret ingredient.
"It's mundane, but it's..."
"Oh, it's sublime."
And I'm trying to stimulate my olfactory and gustatory senses to try to re-create it.
Walter.
Can you come with me?
OLIVIA:
We've recorded him at over three dozen Fringe events.
- Do you remember him?
WALTER:
Of course.
But there's nothing more than I've told you before.
Peter and I were in a car crash.
In a frozen lake.
When I was a boy.
"We were drowning, and he dove in and saved us."
But you say he's kidnapped a woman?
We think he may have.
Why?
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
I'm gonna kill him.
"No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
No.
"You were right, let's kill him."
Oh...
No.
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
Yes!
Why?
Because... he's evil.
Artie would've told us.
Let's go.
"Uh, go--go--go back."
Go back.
Go back.
What--what exactly happened there?
"You tell us, Artie, okay?"
Because the Japanese sure as hell don't know.
They're testing for everything from dirty bombs to gas leaks.
They won't let us in the room.
They're holding us in the lobby.
They're--they're treating us like suspects.
Suspects?
Why?
did you have the decoy sword with you?
"No. but they're not even looking for the sword, Artie."
They--they're not even sure whether or not it was taken.
"Okay, that makes no sense to me whatsoever."
Either it's gone or it's not gone.
You said you saw somebody leaving.
Did he have it?
"I don't know, okay?"
'cause I was about two seconds away from passing out.
"Yeah, wh--wh--what did this guy look like?"
"Uh, not female."
"Look, Artie, uh, my Japanese sucks."
But it sounds to me as if they think the sword
Was vaporized or something.
What do you mean vaporized?
What do you mean?
By the bomb?
"There was no bomb, Artie."
Don't say that.
So... you're a street vendor.
What sort of things do you sell?
"Very kind of you to sit and talk with me, Doctor."
I wanted to ask ―
The others are asking when the cast is coming off my arm.
"It'll get stiff being bandaged too long, won't it?"
That's a powerful hand.
Squeeze.
"Oh yes, very strong!"
"You're a real man, Biberkopf."
- That's right.
"Rotten luck, getting hit by that car."
Your skull was fractured.
We weren't able to save your arm.
You mean my arm is gone?
Well... thanks so much for telling me.
"Well, anyway..."
"You have a tough job too, telling people these things."
All in a day's work.
Now let's see you get back on your feet quickly.
- Tomorrow.
"- No, a few more days."
I can get up tomorrow.
I can only lie in bed for so long.
I have to get back to work.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can forbid it
A blonde today A brunette tomorrow
Who wants to commit his heart
Take your luck as it comes
It's no shame to enjoy life
Thanks for coming.
I asked you to come because of something important.
Claire had to... deal with something... absolutely extraordinary.
She told me about it.
And I thank her for that.
we want to share that news with you. and because we need your help. and changes our take on the world as we know it.
You'll have to accept.
We now share a common destiny.
Camille?
It can't be.
It's the truth.
you would know it's her.
Camille is back with us.
And we should all welcome her.
Does it mean... that other kids will come back?
She's giving us hope that others might come back.
You are safe.
I am so glad.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Doug:
Thanks a lot.
Ferrara:
"Have a good night, pal."
"All right, man."
I'll see you.
[ Car beeping ]
Let's say some guy drives you home because you were too drunk and you could kill yourself or somebody else.
What do you think that's worth?
Nothing!
Nothing!
"Don't give him a dime, and one day, you, too, will be driving a Bentley."
[ Sighs ]
- Sorry for the trouble.
Goodbye.
Business is slow too...
Do you think you'll have to go to the police station again?
Business has its ups and downs.
And so what if I go to the police station again?
I'm close to the officers there.
Are you not worried at all?
After Park Seon Woo is finished with Detective Im...
He could try to choke you next.
"If we fight, I'll win."
How are you joking around right now?
I'm worried to death over here...
"Smile, Writer Bae."
"They say, ""If you can't avoid it, enjoy it."""
Mr. President.
Do you know how much of an optimist you are?
That's the only way to deal with this situation.
"We will win, no matter what."
We will... win no matter what?
"By the way, did you start editing your script?"
"Yes, I started by changing the main character."
How?
He's not a superhero anymore.
He's someone who could leave if he wanted to...
But he's staying behind to help his neighborhood.
A typical... former secret agent.
What?
- Hello.
"- Oh, hi."
"Oh, Chan Gyu!"
- Do you work here?
"- One, two, three!"
"- Hey, Yo-Yo!"
- Yo-Yo!
Guess what!
Tia and Tony just drove off in a flying saucer.
Flying saucer?
How about whooshing yourself into the bus?
"But, it's true."
"Lookit, I saw those two kids do miraculous things."
"I believe anything and everything, except that."
Get in.
I hope this school teaches about flying saucers.
Yeah.
Flying saucers.
[machine whirring]
"[girl] nice landing, Uncle Bene."
Right on the 50-yard line.
[boy] should've gone for a touchdown.
"Next time, I'll put it right between the goalposts."
[girl] can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.
[Bene] that's why we arranged this little vacation.
We've been so busy establishing our community on Witch Mountain
That you two haven't had an opportunity
To see what life in the big city is all about.
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.
[chuckling] there'll be another time for that.
"Just remember what I told you, and have a lot of fun."
- It's locked.
- Tia?
"Tony, come back here."
"Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary."
- Stay close to your sets.!
- Oh!
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!
You're not gonna die!
Relax!
Keep shooting!
Think of my Emmy!
"Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"
Monkeys.
Fix this damn thing.
Whoo!
Hammond seems to be...
"Bill, Wendy, can you see this?"
Hammond is leading the pursuit in a giant game of ring-around-the-rosy.
"Jack, you anti-hero, if you're going to get away, get away now."
"Bill, this is really ridiculous."
"It's pretty clear now that this guy, Jack Hammond... is just toying with the police."
I hope they put him away for a long time.
- You are dead serious about going with me?
- Serious as a heart attack.
"You are absolutely, positively, 100% sure about this?"
I have never been more sure about anything in my entire life.
- We'll be fugitives.
- Sounds exciting.
- You won't be Natalie Voss anymore.
- Who the hell is she anyway?
I don't know.
I don't know.
But you're going to give up everything for me?
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm doing it for me too.
The Treasure of Atlantis lies somewhere in that crater.
Looks inviting.
"The last time they had a major eruption, it destroyed half the island, along with Atlantis."
Beautiful.
Simon?
Simon!
"Oh, God, no."
This is Cleeve's doing.
"He has a concussion, possibly a subdural hematoma."
"I can do more when we get him to a hospital in Athens, but he's too weak to move."
All I can do now is make him comfortable.
"Well, don't worry."
I'll stay with him.
(speaks in Greek)
(speaks in Greek)
Looks like he's going to be all right.
And the doctor's going to stay with him until he's well enough to be moved.
But all the maps and the charts of the volcano have gone.
Damn.
Cleeve and Zavros are probably in the crater by now.
"Tonight the planets align, and they'll steal the treasure."
And it's all my fault.
I wish I'd never heard of Atlantis.
That's weird.
What?
The lid.
It's not magnetic.
How can that be?
"Well, I don't know."
W-what are you doing?
"Trust me, professor, trust me."
It's platinum.
"Enjoy your meal, everyone."
Enjoy your meal.
Calm down.
Just calm down.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included nonviolence?
I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.
"Well, be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us."
Your presence is just too disruptive.
Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.
(SCOFFS)
You don't understand us at all.
TRIS:
"No, I do understand you."
I understand that you think you can stay out of this.
But you can't.
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you.
FOUR:
"Tris, Tris... (INHALES DEEPLY)"
FOUR:
"Look, Johanna, we need a little more time."
I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are.
Then we can leave.
And then what?
Attack Erudite?
I will not be a party to violence.
FOUR:
And no one's asking you to.
We just need a few more days.
One.
One what?
Compared to you and Charlotte anything's quick.
"- Softly softly, catchee monkee."
- I didn't know you spoke Spanish.
See!
I told you this was a great place to get your fingers stinky.
"Oh, my god, she's going for his cock."
"Oh, what you doing?"
Shall we go somewhere more private?
- I want you.
- Right.
"Careful, no-one's touched that before, it might go off."
Good!
"Crikey, careful."
Are they allowed to do that in here?
- Crikey!
"- Fuck me, she's gonna wank him off!"
The jammy git's pulled an experienced cock handler.
"Or, someone so inexperienced she thinks it's the best way to pull an older boy."
- Either way it's a win-win situation.
"- It's not really, though, no?"
"Thanks to me, we're now watching Simon get wanked off."
Thank you so much!
- Getting a bit weird now.
- I hate it when he makes eye contact.
"None of us do, Neil."
Call me a short arse now!
"Come on then, you fucking coward!"
"- Oh, please, not his face!"
- I'm gonna do you!
"Northwood are in the house, you're fucking dead!"
How embarrassing.
- That was brilliant!
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you for having me.
Are you ready to get out there and turn some laps?
I'm ready as I'll ever be.
Is that fair?
'Cause I know you like to drive fast on your own.
Yeah.
"I mean, in my own car, in the safety and dangerousness of real traffic."
We will see you in the hangar when you're done.
Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Lake Bell!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Let's get some air going here.
Wood:
"Now, the fastest lap time is 139.3, set by Stephen Moyer."
[ Engine revving ] Let's see how Lake can do.
And now to shift gears.
Looking good so far.
Little tap on the brakes.
Keep it serious.
Keep it really serious!
Good focus.
"Car looks composed so far, heading down in towards the teardrop."
[Bleep]
"Looking good, not super-fast through there."
And there's a thousand people there.
I hope I don't.
"Oh, my God."
That's a lot of people to be looking right at me as I...
don't shift.
But this is where people make up a lot of time.
Like someone not pickin' up after walking' their dog?
"Well, I guess so."
Like someone not eatin' everything on their plate?
"Well, I guess so."
Like someone peeing' in a hot spring?
That's right.
"When he wakes up, he just keeps destroying... tons until he gets sleepy again."
I get it.
Then he's a bad guy.
That's not so.
Beerus-sama is a god.
"For there to be balance in this plane of existence, if there are gods that create, there must also be gods that destroy."
"Then he's strong, right?"
"He's on a level far beyond ""strong""."
He's capable of destroying absolutely everything there is.
Nobody stands a chance against him.
I can't wait to meet him.
Goku.
"I'm begging you, please try your hardest not to do anything stupid."
Okay?
You understand?
Got it.
"As long as he doesn't do anythin' bad, I'll keep away."
Oww...
What was that for?
.
Honestly...
What is it?
Beerus-sama...
"So that's this ""God of Destruction""..."
I see little kids hurrying off colourful na ransel
Colourful backpacks on their backs shou kodomo-tachi kaketeyuku
You're welcome.
You don't know how I've been waiting for this.
"Listen, you see Robin before I do, tell her I really appreciate it."
"- Are you listening to me, Stan?"
- Yeah.
Because you need to be very clear about something.
Go ahead.
This is not the beginning of anything.
This is the end.
Got no argument here.
"Look, I don't know what Robin told you about this but I made a couple mistakes, reference to some gambling."
"Believe me, I learned my lesson."
"I swear, Stan Heywood gambles no more."
"I swear to you, I really appreciate Robin helping me out like this."
You finished?
- Yeah.
"- I'm a cop, Stan."
"- Oh, God."
- The only reason I don't bust you--
- I made a couple mistakes--
- I understand.
Things happen.
"I won't pop you, because I haven't looked inside that envelope."
"If I were to find money in there, I'd pop you."
So forget whatever you're thinking.
You've committed a crime.
"If you ever approach Robin again, I will put you in jail."
You understand me?
Straight to Rikers.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
MARTINEZ:
I thought I'd cover all the major food groups.
"So sorry about this, Rambo."
"It's cool, man, it's Dad's money."
He won't even notice.
You ever had mice?
"We have, but more as an infestation than a delicacy."
So is Daddy properly loaded?
"Er...yeah, I guess so."
"He owns, like, a shipping company and a sawmill thing and a marble..."
whatever it's called - hole?
Quarry?
Yeah!
And the grain company.
The grain company that we work for?
He owns that?
Yeah.
"Well, I actually own it now."
He kind of gave it to me.
Boom!
"Well done, Rambo."
"Well, sort of."
"I'd much rather be working at the shipping place, to be honest."
But I sort of burnt my boats there after the er...fire.
"So Dad moved me to grain, which is obviously super lame!"
But at least I met you guys.
Nice mice.
The spoilt brat has the whole company.
"When I was his age, I didn't even have pubes."
Really?
You said he was 16?
"Yeah, I was a late starter."
"The point is, this kid can force Flavia to get me a new chair."
People enjoying themselves.
Helps me get to sleep.
"They're Colombians, I think."
"So what happens now, Calum?"
About what?
I'm sorry
- I forget you need a bit of extra help.
Remember yesterday?
I was dragged here from prison late at night?
- You were nearly garrotted?
"- Oh, that."
- He wouldn't have gone through with it.
"- Just a kinky game, was it?"
Yeah.
"I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually."
"And so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?"
"Oh, don't worry."
Lenny'll be back soon.
"And that's what he does, by the way - turns up."
"Doesn't always knock, either."
So make sure you're not washing up naked.
"You'll be wanting to see your sister, I expect."
"You've not even met your niece yet, have you?"
- Is that allowed?
- Course it is.
"You're not on the run, licence is in order."
Go ahead.
Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
"This is where you really want me to live, is it?"
You wouldn't want to live here - too many ghosts.
Door.
"Look officer, you're making a mistake, okay."
You need to cuff that man up right now.
"All right, let me see the cuffs."
Give 'em a tug.
"Dispatch, I got a situation over here."
The jammer.
Angie come back.
"Officer, you can't get a call out, because this man, he has a jammer inside."
"Look, we, we turned it off, but he must have turned it back on."
Be quiet.
What's a jammer?
I don't even have a phone.
Son of a bitch.
All right.
Now he said that the two of you we're trying to rob him.
Is that true?
- No.
- Yes.
"Officer, yes, it's true."
"We broke into his house to rob him, okay, but, he's been keeping us against our will, underground in a torture den."
An underground torture den?
There's a secret door.
If you look inside...
Secret door?
"In the basement, a secret..."
Let me get this straight.
The two of you were trying to rob the house of some kind of serial killer?
This man?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Do I look like Sheriff dumb dumb to you?
- Yes.
I'm not doing it either.
Kenny?
[mumbles]
"All right, we promised."
We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.
I swear.
[mumbles]
"Okay, good."
What happened?
I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
I tried.
Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
You didn't die?
"Freakin' hybrids, man."
They just don't do the trick anymore.
"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats."
Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.
This was the wall in Germany that actually separated the communist east side and democratic west side.
"East side, west side, whatever side you're on as long as we care about each other we can still have some fun"
"Oh, man."
[singing]
"Oh, good kids."
God!
This's sucks!
"Do you feel like maybe you l-l-loosing her, S-Stan?"
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do about it anyway.
Maybe you should just talk to her.
"You know, a little conversation."
Tell her what you feel.
"Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burning in sky, do you like--"
Stop!
"Tea, Henry."
Edie.
Thank you.
Right.
"You were absolutely right about the WI being able to cope without me, so I was just wondering if... the invitation still stands?"
"Yes, yes, of course!"
Wonderful!
May I offer you a celebratory cuppa?
"Yes, all right."
A year ago we had Henry's hanging work and you were giving us weddings and funerals at St Mary's.
Now we have nothing.
"I was just sharing out the work, Edie."
You're not the only florist in the area.
I think we both know what you're doing has got nothing to do with fairness.
"Look, if you promise to give us some more business,"
I won't enter the flower show.
I think I can win the competition without your charity.
"Thank you, though."
"Please, Mrs McCarthy, we're on our knees here."
Henry?
Henry!
Henry?
Henry!
Father.
Hemlock?
"That's what the doctor thinks, going by Henry's symptoms and the smell."
How extraordinary.
Poor Henry didn't notice the odd taste and drank the whole cup.
Probably because of his excesses last night.
How long does the doctor think he has?
Hours.
A day at most.
See?
That was easy.
"It's like I always say, when it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm."
You just show 'em that you mean business...
"And he's out of bed again, isn't he?"
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
"All right, what's this all about?"
Voices.
- Voices?
- In here.
Telling me what to do.
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
The early bird catches the worms!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey!
You're going to...
Maybe you sing him a little song.
"Come here, you..."
Hey!
What the...?
Do I look like the kind of guy that knows a lullaby?
Sing!
Lullaby and good night
Close your big creepy eyes
If you sleep Away I'll creep
And get out of here alive
"You know, once you get past all the splinters and rope burns, he's actually kind of cute."
Now where did he go?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Now there's something you don't see every day.
He is sticking to me like a leech and torturing me.
What sort of background work have you done?
He is in love with me.
You have easily dealt many men before this.
This guy doesn't even stand a chance.
You are being a bit restless.
Fetch me some water.
Deal with him with some patience.
If it doesn't work out... we'll change the plan.
Thomas.
"Get me my handbag from the backseat, please."
There is a pen inside.
This one?
- Open the cap.
Thanks.
Vasundhara!
- I can sense that you both involved in something.
What's it?
Vasundhara...
"- Tell me, what is it?"
It will not take any time for me to poke this into your throat!
(stuttering)
Ravi drafted the plan.
We went to Chennai to meet Varun...
Ravi sold all the jewels... we looted from Varun.
Ravi... has all the money.
Sorry.
I'm very sorry.
If uncle has taken such a step...
I'm the one to be blamed.
"I thought that if you had too much money, you will spend it all on alcohol and other such nonsense."
I have saved a share separately for you.
I third it.
"All those in favor will please say ""aye."""
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Contrary-minded?
Nay.
You'll get your mop.
Aye.
That makes it unanimous.
Any further business?
Do i hear a motion to adjourn?
Let me do it.
I move we adjourn.
I second the motion.
I third it.
Meeting's adjourned.
"Good night, mr."
Fisk.
"Good night, mrs."
Callahan.
"Good night, arthur."
"Good night, sam."
We only needed a $1 million issue to cover our stock shortage.
What do you think you're gonna do with the other 9 million?
"If we can get cornele to buy it, we'll give him the licking' of his life."
"It'll take more money than you ever thought of, commodore, to stop that erie flood."
"You bought over $9 million worth of the stuff now, and they still got lots to sell."
"Cornelius, why don't you stop buying and start selling?"
I don't need any suggestions from you to make me a bigger fool than i am.
"If i sell now, the price will drop like a punctured balloon."
"I won't have any money, any stock, or any control."
- I know.
It's just that you...
This piece of junk is really badly designed.
Sorry.
You seem tired lately.
"As a lover of justice, you should understand... that I'm going through a difficult moment."
- Recent separation...
- Four months is not so recent.
"Right, it's not... but then there's my father's case against his latest wife."
The judge is going to rule this week.
Juan.
How is he?
He's all right... but I want him to stay away from all the dirt in the case.
"Welcome to England, Acacio."
Are you going to miss Brazil?
"Yes, I am."
And what do you think you're going to miss most?
Especially you.
What have you got to say to your new fans in Manchester?
"Hello, Manchester people."
I love you.
"Sorry to interrupt, but this is the fourth class that I've been at."
"Your grammar is perfect, but I disagree with the subject."
Really?
Gordo wants to change the program.
Wants.
Adapt the curriculum to Acacio's basic needs in England.
And these basic needs are?
Trash talk.
Yeah.
"The bad is good, teacher."
The English play an Anglo-Saxon-style soccer.
Come on.
Get to work.
You'd think they'd feed you more if they expect you to do all this work.
That's what Eric said.
He always gave me half his rations.
Refused to eat them himself.
If he'd eaten more...
He's gone.
My team must have taken care of it.
We're gonna need a new plan.
- There's always Death Valley.
- No.
What's Death Valley?
That's Death Valley.
- See that door on the other side?
- Yeah.
It takes you to the front gate.
- If that's the only way...
- We're completely exposed.
"Also the barbed wire, searchlights, guard tower."
Goons can see everything from up there.
We'd be fish in a barrel.
It's out of the question.
You need to call your people off.
We're better off with the tunnel.
Your tunnel will take months to finish.
You could be relocated before it's ready.
"But if it works, we can get everybody out."
"Two hundred of you, running around the forest?"
"No papers, no clothes, no place to hide?"
You'll be hunted like dogs.
"Yeah, it's risky."
I really do.
"Well, thanks."
How about our going into partnership?
Or do we have to ask John's permission?
He's a charter member.
Do you have any influence with him?
I never interfere in his business.
But you just got a share of it now.
You just became a partner.
"Are you as conservative as your husband, Mrs. Brown?"
No wonder my husband thinks your ideas are too advanced.
I just meant we could make a lot of money.
"Oh, now you're angry again!"
Are you sorry John made you take me to lunch?
I wasn't drafted.
I volunteered.
I shouldn't tease you.
Your sketches are wonderful.
And most women would like to make a lot of money.
Sure.
Some of them marry for it.
That's a low blow.
I'm very fond of John.
I'm sure you are.
"Good evening, Mr. Skinner."
"Hello, Ellen."
"I'm a little early, so if Mr. Brown hasn't finished his dinner..."
He's not here.
He left for Philadelphia late this afternoon.
Well...
"Well, that's odd."
I'm supposed to meet him here to go over some statements.
[Chuckles]
He... made me... see the stars.
How did he do that?
Those kids.
Why do they hate me so much?
[Distant Siren Wailing]
[Men's Chorus] He has loosed the fateful lightning
Ofhis terrible swiftsword
His truth is marching on
I have seen him in the watch fires ofa hundred circling camps
They have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps
I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
- His day is marching on - [Gunfire]
I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows ofsteel
As ye deal with my contemner so with you my grace shall deal
Let the hero born ofwoman [Girl] It's the president.
- Crush the serpentwith his heel - [People Murmuring]
Hi.
I'm Dick Nixon.
Hi there.
- Hi.
Where you from?
- Syracuse.
"Oh, yeah, the, uh, orangemen."
"Now, there's a football program, uh..."
"Jim Brown and that, uh, other, uh, tailback... the one with the blood disease."
- Ernie Davis.
"- Yeah, right, right, right."
[Boy Laughing]
I used to play a little ball myself atWhittier.
"Of course, they used to use me as a, a tackling dummy."
We didn'tcome here to talk aboutfootball.
Don't you even care?
I'm not happy at the conservatory.
Of course I care!
"But I also care about scholarships, opportunities."
I care about your future.
"If you really cared about my future, you would not have sold my piano in the first place!"
"Mom, I'm sorry."
I didn't-
"Get in the car, now."
I have to go.
I understand.
I hope you're satisfied.
It took all my will power not to trip her.
Thank you for letting me know Amanda was here.
Glad I could help.
Welcome home.
"I'd ask you what you were thinking, but I don't think you were thinking at all."
"Actually, this took a great deal of planning."
Not helping.
The Blooms' situation was private.
We made it very clear you were not to see Amanda.
You were not to get involved.
"I know I broke a rule, but I'm not sorry I did."
"I had to do it, for Amanda."
"Good intentions aside, you're still grounded."
All of you.
Two weeks.
What?
"School, work, home."
Everything else is off-limits.
And I'll take your cell phones.
This was my idea.
What was that for?
I bet that this would suck.
[Laughs]
"What a fucking, fucking, fucked up thing, man."
It was a fucked-up burn.
These guys are doing a high fall for us later.
It's the same shit every time.
Never hire Lloyd's friends.
Never.
INTERVIEWER:
What's your biggest fear of today?
Not getting the shots and not going on schedule
Are my biggest fear every day.
"We had a-- we had to have a Toxie stand in,"
Because our Toxie was late.
He's usually incredibly punctual.
He's been consistent every single day.
I think he's one of the first people on set almost every day.
"And yet today, he overslept."
Fucking dammit.
I said 6 o'clock.
It's three hours and they can't get the guy into costume.
INTERVIEWER:
That did not make Lloyd very happy.
"No, it didn't make anybody very happy."
[Inaudible] at the office.
Yeah.
"I can't hold their fucking hands, Lloyd."
You can kick them in the ass.
You can certainly ring their bloody necks.
"And you know, mules-- if you kick a mule hard enough,"
You get it to pull the plow.
"European third type, that."
I have a job for you.
Mickey goes wrong.
She lost the joy of living.
We transmit life if he continues with that woman.
"Take it away, do it for me."
"If it is not cheerful, Mickey's not a dick."
"I do not want to see him, I do not want them both!"
"I do not want, no, no!"
"Purposes before, and now blames me?"
"- The love for piety, Mickey ..."
- I pity you did not?
- The love for pain.
- I love her and that was it.
- You will comply.
- Respect for the cemeteries!
You will not ever.
To have you in their hands has taken this empty apartment here in front.
"Okay, your part to exterminate the Venini you have done, but we still have three to go to the bottom."
You feel?
Now it is you who will flee.
Mickey is not the brute that you think.
I do not think anything.
You ... it is difficult to get wrong.
"In order to kill, should be a woman."
Wrap the blade in silk.
- Won't feel anything.
- No.
You.
Get in there.
No. ..
"We are like children, Prince."
-And just hustling?
I said you're coming to mass You!
You're fucked in the head!
OK?
There!
Pierre!
"I wanted to find before you, but I have not arrived."
Sit.
"I can not, I parked illegally."
And my friends just go.
Come on!
I visited some Tellier.
"He wants 50,000 euros for an accident in the basement."
"Funny, it seems to think that I'll pay him."
This guy's a jerk.
I do not know what a lawyer.
What kind of accident?
UltimateFightChampionship.
Berserker fight in which all blows allowed.
"Not allowed, but the posjeæeno well the money is on the bet."
I know it is not good engage in illegal things.
"I'll stop, but I will not over become a provincial night clerk."
What exactly happened?
Stupid Tellier's cousin sent into combat.
In the second round broke his spine.
"Will no longer walk, but I do?"
He should not have come.
You know that you can be prosecuted because of the violence and causing disability?
"No worries, I have a very good attorney."
-Just so.
"I am a lawyer, I'm not to your debt."
Solve it.
Not that she was drinking or anything.
I think it was a bad trip fajitas.
Yes?
I'll be right there.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
Pretty naughty!
What do you think about us going on a real date?
"I mean don't get me wrong, secret sex is awesome."
"Really awesome, but I think that you and I actually dating awesom... er."
On that thought.
We have a situation up here.
What sort of situation?
I'm kinda busy in here.
Code red.
I'll be right back.
"Someone drop the dime, called the coppers."
"Someone on the Greek task force phoned Bowman to say, claiming there's booze."
- Come on.
- Chambers.
Execute plan B.
- But there's not time.
- I wouldn't be so sure
There's always time for plan B.
You fellas and spread out.
"Hey, boys!"
Care to join me for a drink?
What the hell are you doing?
"Taking your cruise out on the open road, see if I can hit a few miles an hour."
"You wanna join me, I'd love to have company!"
"Let him go, we always know where to find him."
- Not with my squad car.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Men fighting against bulls?
"Yes, yes, yes."
What did he say?
-That they would love to go.
I couldn't have translated it better.
(MAN) (COUGHING)
The fortune cookie was right.
Love and a cough can't be hidden.
"Get going, Luis."
And leave you here alone?
"No, don't even think it."
"Whatever way, you're coming with me."
-Don't be an idiot.
They won't let me board in this state.
I can't leave you alone with this fever.
You're burning up.
"On your way out, tell the guy that owns the guesthouse to call a doctor."
"But go now, you're going to miss your plane."
I'll leave you this so you can get by when you get better.
Hang in there.
(Door closes)
Is what you have to tell me very important?
It could be.
Tell me.
"Sit down, woman."
One of our internal agents called.
An hour ago someone checked into a hospital.
He was delirious and talking about a time door.
Couldn't he just be crazy or a science fiction fan?
Look.
"This is his picture in the hospital, taken this very morning."
I see.
"Uh, how long has this been going on?"
Ever since we got back from vacation.
It was not a vacation.
It was an aliyah.
That's a pilgrimage to Israel.
Where did you visit when you were in Israel?
We shopped in Tel Aviv.
We swam in the dead sea.
It was wonderful.
They have spa treatments there.
- Then we went to the wailing wall...
- Oh!
- Where... this one went bananas.
"- I-I mean, I was brought to my knees."
- And I was moved to tears.
- He was on his knees.
"- B-being there, praying there..."
"- It was very scary, actually."
That is as close to heaven as I've ever felt.
It changed me forever.
Jerusalem syndrome?
"Mm, it's been around since ancient times."
"Apparently, people go to these holy sites, like the wailing wall, and they start relinquishing possessions,"
"- wearing togas, sermonizing."
"- Yeah, but it's..."
It's temporary.
And they usually recover in a couple of days.
"Yeah, but this has been going on for three weeks with this guy."
Tracy said it's getting worse every day.
He's such a show-off.
You're eating doughnuts for lunch?
Perkins!
Get this old goat moving!
"Look alive, boy!"
Sir.
"Move, you bastards!"
Get up!
"Saved you for the firing squad, Harper."
"Perkins tells me that you were once a common soldier, a sergeant."
- So I was.
- Strange.
"In Spain, an officer must be ""of the blood""."
Un caballero.
righteous but charming A gentleman
"Sorry, wrong house, Miss."
Is that why you have trouble with your men?
"Perkins told you that, did he?"
Yes.
He said you were a proper bastard.
He's right.
You may as well know the rest.
My mother was a whore.
I was born in a brothel.
Grew up in an orphanage and hope to die in the army.
Right?
But the boy Perkins says you saved the life of General Wellesley.
"And the Irishman, Harper, he says that when the English wish to honour a man of courage, they call him a proper bastard."
"You listen to soldiers' gossip, ma'am."
"Yes, I do."
"You see, we have two ears but only one mouth."
So a good leader will listen twice as much as he shouts.
"I beg your pardon, Mr Sharpe."
But she's as dry as a bone.
"Restaurants are big down here, right?"
Huge.
Kind of resisted them at first.
"As you know, I'm not much of a foodie."
"What, now you are?"
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"When in Rome, right?"
"Well, maybe you can help us narrow down which restaurants are prime candidates."
Okay.
What do we got?
(computer blips)
How about this...
Pat O'Brien's?
Pat O's?
No way they're cartel.
They've been in the Quarter for decades.
Make a killer hurricane cocktail that'll...
You should try one.
"I'm not here for the cocktails, T."
Okay.
Let's just get Garcia and get back home.
(computer blips)
I'm not sure I want to go back home.
Sorry?
I'm just saying I'm not sure.
"Ten years ago, you couldn't get far enough away from this place fast enough, and now you like it?"
"I don't understand, Tammy."
This cartel case is your big shot.
"Isler moves up, you move up."
It's... everything you've always said you wanted.
Isn't that why we broke up?
"This isn't about me and you, Hannah."
- We're negotiating.
And how do you know that?
And are you really opening with a Shakespeare quote?
- Is that your plan?
- That's right.
Sonnet 65.
I assigned it.
I'm feeling nostalgic.
"Come on, Brooke, you don't miss me at all?"
"Consider this number blocked, too."
"This is my cousin, Eli."
Feel free to ignore him.
"This is Audrey, Noah."
"Hey, man."
"First day, huh?"
- School is school.
"- Sure, except, in this school, people get killed by knife-wielding maniacs every 20 years, give or take."
"Excuse me! ""Girl's only"" moment."
"(SIGHS) So, out of nowhere, Branson hits me up this morning."
Yeah.
"He said he just ""heard"" Jake and I broke up."
Whoa!
How did he hear that?
Barely anyone even knew that you were together.
What is it with men from the past mysteriously showing up?
"Wait, what does that mean?"
"Emma's deadbeat dad resurfaced, too."
"Okay, not cool."
And that is a totally different thing.
And I was also not ready to share that!
You weren't gonna share it with me?
"The person I told this morning wasn't exactly supportive, so..."
Ok?
"And I need that in a cashier's check or a money order, doesn't matter."
"Actually, I want it in a money order."
And make it out to Ice Station Zebra Associates.
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
"After that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard, but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask."
All right?
Any questions?
"You're gonna get me off, right?"
I look like your high school girlfriend?
"Five fingers, no waiting?"
"That's a joke, Brandon."
Lighten up.
"Son, I promise you this."
I will give you the best criminal defense that money can buy.
"Francesca, I took these already."
Didn't I take these already?
Ok.
"Look, it's on your head."
You're not supposed to double up on Vitamin A. It's bad for the liver.
"Okay, who's next?"
Did him.
I did him.
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.
"What happened to my masturbator, Francesca?"
You got me all turned around.
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.
"Gentlemen, I sense you're discussing my client."
"- Oh, yes, of course."
"- Excuse us, darling."
- Sure.
"Dexter, I haven't said it before."
I will now.
I think your courage was admirable.
And I have you to thank for saving my father's life.
"Now, I realise the great risks you took, and I'll always appreciate it."
"I'm glad I was able to help, Michael."
And that we all got back safely.
"Well, there is one more favour I'd like to ask of you."
That being?
"From now on, stay away from my wife."
Michael.
"Look, whatever you're thinking-"
My suspicions are groundless?
- Yes.
- Good.
Then it will make it that much easier for you.
You know something?
This conversation is for the royal birds.
If you'll excuse me.
"Michael, why did you do that?"
"Oh, my God, Amanda, isn't it obvious?"
"No, it isn't obvious to me."
"Well, how do you think I feel when you throw your arms around?"
"Prince Michael, I have some good news."
Your father has regained consciousness for the first time.
- You may see him for a few moments.
- Thank you.
I'll see him alone.
Michael.
I feel like it's my job to tell you the honesty.
Nobody else has.
Nobody else can.
"It's rare to find these things out, and also upsetting."
These little glasses.
Let me see these things.
"Oh, yeah, we have the exact same affectation."
Mm-mmh...
Ah...
Emily.
Erm...
Seems like a less than ideal place to carry on.
Is it 'cause you have a girlfriend?
You mentioned her in an interview.
It's because it's gauche to grope and kiss in public.
"You really don't remember meeting me, do you?"
I had a photo shoot in that same place when my first book came out.
I gave you a copy of it.
"You acted like you were better than some first-time author nobody had ever heard of, even though you were probably still in college."
"I wrote my number in it, twice."
I really honestly don't remember meeting you.
"Sorry, but I remember you now."
"Oh, of course you do."
OK.
I'll call you.
(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
ASHLEY:
Where were you?
Out.
"So, my meeting with Ike today..."
"Oh, so he's Ike now?"
- With Zimmerman.
Somebody get the little dudes a snack and no hockey till I get home from work.
Your lover boy is here.
You better put that down before you hurt somebody.
You better come and take it from me.
Okay.
How was that?
"Little high, a little wide."
"Like you could do better, Zamboni-boy."
"Not in that butt-ugly uniform, I couldn't."
Did you get Hello Kitty to sponsor you?
- L'll just get Dad to fire you.
"- No way, your dad loves me."
"Besides, you like to stare at my butt when I'm working."
- That's disgusting.
- Is not.
I wash it every day.
Are you okay?
Okay.
Mess.
This lot is 40 acres.
"The owners were old time hockey players, the meanest goons to ever tie on skates."
Let's see how scary they really are.
"Welcome to Zenovation, one-stop shop for mind, body and soul."
"How may we help you, our sisters?"
"Love the robes, fellows."
I'm Bernie Frazier with Frazier Realty.
I'm here to talk to you about your land.
May I come in?
- Not interested.
- Bad karma.
Nice wheels.
"Okay, it seems the gooneys have gone loony."
How about a nice cappuccino?
How about a nice cappuccino?
"I don't want a cappu-fucking-ccino, I want an explanation."
"I don't want a cappu-fucking-ccino, I want an explanation."
So do the boys in town.
"They're not happy, mate."
So do the boys in town.
"They're not happy, mate."

"Dad, sitting second chair on this case was a really big deal for me."
Okay?
"You could just maybe, I don't know, pretend..."
Pretend to be proud.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
Or are you just taking pot shots at me because I didn't become a cop like you?
Were.
- Listen to me.
Are you proud of what you do?
"This is what you do, man."
This is...

I am the ruler of the..
Bad dates.
I told you not to be premature in your communiqué to Berlin.
Archaeology is not an exact science.
It does not deal in time schedules.
The führer is not a patient man.
"He demands constant reports, and he expects progress."
You led me to believe...
Nothing!
I made no promises.
I only said it looked very favorable.
"Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct."

They're here.
- Yeah.
"- And you, just find out if anything unusual happened on the floor last 24 hours."
I'm taking all the new chips off the floor.
- Whoa.
That's big.
- You got a better idea?
- I can stick around and help.
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

"Only thing was a blackjack dealer, Jerry Smoltz, who was dealing 75% winners for three straight hours."
Do you have conscience or not?
You don't answer your mobile.
Nobody knows where you are.
I'm nervous!
Have you forgotten that we're going to Paris?
I can't go to Paris now.
Take some rest there without me for a few days.
No.
- I have an important meeting.
- No!
You promised to spend two days with me.
Why are you sitting here?
"Who are you meeting with, if it's not a secret?"
It's not a secret.
I'm meeting with Garik.
- With Garik...
- Yes.
This meeting is more important to me than to him.
"So Garik can't wait, can he?"
Why do you react in such a way?
Lets go.
- What?
"- Let's go, I say!"
I'll give you a lift.
His place is on my way.
"Close the bag, let's go."
I got used to your lies.
I got used to the fact that you have affairs with other women.
But I can't get used to your cynicism and your perverse cruelty.
What women?
What cynicism?
"You've been telling me about meetings with your best friend, your former classmate Garik for a long time."
"I like you, René, very much."
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
"We meet again, Fräulein."
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now... what shall we talk about?
All right... take it up!
Easy!
You're as stubborn as that girl.
"You like her too much, I think."
Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a... china cup.
Colonel!
Wake your men!
"Indy, the torches are burning out."
"Go on, get out of here."
Hyah!
- Sallah!
- Hello!
Hello!
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!
"Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
"That's right, isn't it?"
"Yes, we are very comfortable up here."
"So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
Son of a bitch.
"Isn't that, uh, kind of inappropriate ?"
"I mean, given the sexual content of the lyrics."
"Well, it was the only song she knew all the words to."
"That and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."""
Ah.
"Well, this is really fun."
"Staying up late, eating sweets, singing songs."
It's like summer camp.
Coed summer camp with really hot camp counselors.
"No offense, Gary, but this is barely entertaining me."
"Yeah, Gary, young guy in Newport, cool job... you must have a lot of fun."
Not really.
No friends ?
No girls ?
Well... there is one girl.
"Oh, well, you only need one, as long as it's a good one."
She's an amazing one.
"Well, are you guys serious ?"
Pretty serious.
"You know, thinking about taking it to the next level."
"Oh, the next level."
That's very serious.
"Yeah, you haven't asked her out yet, have you ?"
"Not yet, no."
"Well, what's the holdup ?"
"I mean, if she's as hot as she sounds."
It's not her.
It's me.
She's a great girl.
And I'm... the ice cream guy.
"Oh, what the hell..."
we have nothing better to do.
All right.
So where do we start?
I'm gonna work on the locations.
You're gonna work on finding Petty.
Petty was a combat engineer in the Korean War.
Something bad happened in Wonju... schoolchildren killed by U.S. land mines.
Petty was the prime suspect.
Is that what sent him into Alcatraz?
No.
Court-martialed.
They reassigned him to the Presidio graveyard detail while they did the investigation.
Eventually he was tried and convicted.
"After five years in military prison, he came back to the city and started doing this."
All right!
Everybody down!
"Oh, my God."
"On March 21, 1963,"
Alcatraz officially closed.
All the prisoners were transferred off the island...
Only that's not what happened.
Not at all.
ALCATRAZ S01 Ep06
- Paxton Petty
"You're checking her for TBI, right?"
Concussions?
"Honestly, I barely bumped my head."
Thanks.
A guy is walking around with a backpack full of mines.
SFPD back in '60 thought he stole 'em from the Presidio while he was there.
"The Presidio isn't a base anymore, so where is he getting them now?"
"Maybe same guy who bought Cobb his rifle,"
Hastings and Sylvain their guns.
- Who are you?
- We?
We're the modest employees of our respected police.
I'm the Major and Seryozha is Captain.
- What are you incriminating me for?
- What words you know!
You'll tell us yourself what we're incriminating you for.
You have no right to...
Call her in.
Sergeant?
Bring the victim in.
Do you recognise this man?
I do.
- Did he rape you perversely?
- Yes he did.
Tell us about it.
What shall I tell you?
What shall I repeat it for?
I was standing on the road waiting for a ride to the city.
A foreign car stopped.The door was opened.
- And?
- A man offered to give me a lift.
"The man was decent-looking, in an expensive suit."
So I got in.
We passed a few kilometres.
Then he turned off the road and raped me.
That's all.
You may go free.
You'll sign the protocol of identification later.
She was your Statute 153 and a straight road to the rooster house.
In a blink of an eye a rusty shank will be stuck in your hemorrhoidal ass...
What do you want of me?
I think this is about it.
- She hit an artery!
"- Michelle, call medical!"
"No, she's bleeding too much."
We got to take her there now!
- Tell security!
- We need someone from medical.
- Interrogation room 819.
- Uncuff her.
Now!
So what did Sherry have to say?
That Alan had a heart attack.
And you believe her?
I'd be a fool to believe anything Sherry says to save herself.
But murder?
I can't imagine she'd do that.
"David, we can't allow ourselves to be caught off guard this time."
Now we have to assume the worst.
Then we'd also have to assume that Julia was somehow involved.
What?
"Whoa, whoa, listen."
"David, I'm sorry, but Julia's not the same kind of person that Sherry is."
"When we find out all the facts, we'll proceed from there."
I have to go over the morning brief with Jerry.
All right.
- Hello?
"- Julia, it's me."
Wayne?
"I just heard about Alan, and I... are you alone?"
The police are here.
I'm was just going to speak with one of the officers.
"All right, tell me what happened."
Bakk me up against the press now.
Please.
We need to lay off 200 in the first place.
"I'm sorry, but there is a Chinese on the phone."
"Take a message, Marianne."
He said you would rather discuss funding with him than bankruptcy with the board.
I've been thinking that maybe we should take some time off.
I can give my clients to someone else.
We can go on a trip together.
-What are you going?
-I'll going to Norway.
-Norge?
-There are work.
Cann't you send someone else?
-It is in Lifjord.
You're going back to your hometown.
I thought you hated being there.
It's an interesting business possibility.
A solar cell factory.
-It seems promising.
-Is this a strange coincidence?
-Can you stop interrogating me?
-No.
-Oh my God.
-How many times have I asked you about your past?
You will never say anything.
You give me one sentence about an unhappy childhood.
That's because there is not much more to tell.
Every year we send Christmas cards a mother I've never met.
"And now, suddenly, you are going there on business."
"These people, they are ..."
I mean...
"Ooh, McGee."
Gibbs wrote something in the comment section.
"""Agent DiNozzo displays exemplary skills, though he can be too talkative in the field."""
"If, by too talkative, he means you never shut up."
"Well, I think Gibbs was being a bit too gracious."
"After ten years, he doesn't know this is how I work."
I always thought it was like a mild case of Tourette's or something.
It's my process.
You guys know that.
"It-It's how I focus, you know."
I talk it out.
Talkative.
Hah!
"Com-Coming from a functional mute, that's rich."
Maybe that's what he's...
Maybe that's what he's doing.
He's trying to tell me something.
Maybe I should dial it back.
Get...
Get my quiet on.
"I think you're, uh, overreacting a bit, Tony."
I'm gonna kill the next performance appraisal.
"Next time he writes down, in his little margin here, ""DiNozzo:"
"""professional;"
DiNozzo: focused.
"DiNozzo..."""
Too much yabba yabba.
"Sorry boss, I was just suppressing the yabba?"
Good.
Grab your gear.
Got a dead petty officer in Baltimore.
So now it's too much yabba yabba?
That was really funny how that guy smacked you.
Give him his rights.
Now that we're spending all this quality time together... let me tell you about your rights.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court oflaw.
"If you do not have an attorney, one will be assigned to you."
Do you understand all the rights I have read to you right now?
- Yes.
- Good boy.
Now shut up.!
- How's it look?
How's it look?
- It's beautiful.
Know what happens to pretty boys like you when they go to prison after the lights go out?
"""Oh, girlfriend.!"
"Oh, girlfriend.!"""
Shots fired.!
- Uncuff him now!
- What?
What the hell?
What in God's name?
"Have you lost your mind, young lady?"
I said uncuff Jack Hammond now!
"Come on, Miss Voss."
Put the gun down.
You don't know what you're doing.
This guy's brainwashed you.
Now come on.
"- Ned, get a shot of this!"
"- Natalie, stop embarrassing me."
"Do it, or I'll blow his brains out all over live TV."
"Miss Voss, don't do it."
Ha-ha!
Boom!
You suck!
"Yeah, this is better than a cruise."
"I know you're disappointed, but we should be here in case Cleveland needs us."
Even though our bags are already packed and our non-refundable tickets are right there.
And that taxi's waiting outside.
(honking) 'Ey!
You vashlooks order a cab?
"Well, we could just take a ride in the cab with our bags, see where it goes."
We at least owe it to our bags to put them in the cab.
"Screw it, let's go."
"I guess everything I do is for him, just to hear him say, ""I'm proud of you."""
Your father?
"No, Bradley Cooper."
"Well, we've made some progress."
You guys are out of your minds.
I'm going to take a shower.
Anybody want to take a shower?
All right.
I do.
This is ridiculous.
I don't belong here.
(ship's horn blares)
I belong on that cruise!
We're getting out of here.
And here's how...
CLEVELAND:
The orderlies' shift change is at 12:32 exactly.
"Tim, that's when you'll hack into the mainframe, disabling the security cameras."
(cracks knuckles)
(roars)
- Don't worry.
- I just have to solve this quickly.
- How are you going to do that?
He's ten times sneakier than you.
What is going on between you two?
He's trying to frame me for something that he did.
What?
Did he... do anything to harm a person?
Is that what this blood is from?
Go home.
We never should have taken his money.
"It's all because of me, isn't it?"
I kept nagging about our loans and the lesson fees...
- All I talked about was money...
- Don't say that...
What family doesn't struggle with money?
If I didn't scare you with my words...
You would have cut that Park Seon Woo out of your life earlier.
But I didn't know anything.
I just got excited when I saw money.
This is all because of me...
We're a family.
Why do we have to throw blame around?
Don't worry.
Just go home.
Justice will prevail.
Remember that.
"You can come home by tomorrow morning, right?"
It's Soo Bin's birthday...
We should blow out the candles together.
Then of course I will.
"Hey, let me go!"
- Oh.
Mm.
Jules... is this hug a display of affection or are you just drinking wine?
[ Mouth full ] 'Splay of 'fection.
Adam is not lame.
He may not be tall and good-looking like Pete...
Mm-hmm.
You got that right.
"But-- but he's deep, interesting, and he's tired of cool guy idiots acting like he's inferior."
"If Adam had a fair shot, Kim would've seen his substance and known he's the better guy."
"Oh, so Pete isn't smart and has no substance because he's cool?"
- Well said.
I agree.
- That is so unfair!
"Cool guys can be deep, too."
"You know, you cut them, they bleed."
"And if you call them dumb, they hurt."
"But then they put on a tank top, and everything's okay, so..."
Uncool guys do not have a monopoly over feelings.
"- Hey, where you guys going?"
- Out to the party.
We settled the Kim thing on our own.
We're good.
"Also, this got weird when it became about the two of you."
Later.
About us?
[ Chuckles ]
- What are they talking about?
- No idea.
They're weird.
Totally.
Totally.
- Servalan?
- I thought you said she was dead.
- TARRANT:
We did.
- But she's not.
She's very much alive.
"- You tricked me, Forbus."
"- No, Sleer, I assure you."
You did something to that last batch of Pylene-50.
I did nothing.
Nothing at all.
"Look, let me show you the test sample."
I'm going to cut off your drug supply for three days.
- That means you'll die about another 10%.
"- Oh, no."
"Please, don't do that."
"- Look, this is the test sample."
- I told you... (Groans)
I'm not interested.
"I'll teach you to obey me, Forbus, if I have to destroy all your skinny little body."
"If you need a witness, Commissioner, I can swear it was self-defence."
What are you doing here?
I followed you from the concourse.
Those two off-worlders seemed very anxious to find you as well.
They seemed to think they recognised you.
Really?
"And of course, Practor recognised you as well, didn't he?"
That's why you killed him.
"- What do you want, Leitz?"
- The Presidency.
Anything is possible.
"Well, after all, somebody has to take Practor's place."
Do you want any more?
Please
"Hello, Camille"
We used to see you at school.
We're Esteban's parents
"Hello, Mr Koretsky"
"Yes, I remember I'm sure a lot of people ask you this, but we wondered..."
Esteban is fine
Have you spoken to him?
Spoken?
"No, I wouldn't put it that way"
But our souls have made contact
Did he mention... well us?
Yes
He said he misses you
He can't wait to see you again
Esteban is at peace
He's waiting for you
He knows you will meet again
What is she saying?
She's giving them hope
Look at her I've never seen her so happy since she came back
She has found what she needed
What?
"A sense of purpose lf anything had a purpose, wouldn't we know?"
You scared me I decided to take you up on your offer
- You kept your keys?
- Yeah
You can take my room ifyou like I'll sleep here with Victor lt's up to you
It wasn't the cannibal who died yesterday
I think I sensed it
But you're safe here
"More, more!"
"Come, how do you like the fucking!"
Now you will feel my prick from behind.
"Yes, do so my love."
Yes lend me a hand.
Please give me a hand.
-Does your man never do that to you?
-Never.
You are so right to be annoyed.
"-He is a peasant, yes, a bumpkin."
"Enter me, my love, from behind."
Pull my arse apart and hammer it.
Here we come.
"Yes, it fits well inside."
"Dirty slut, one hand masturbates in the front... and the other from behind."
"Say, that nobody ever made you enjoy yourself, ..."
-like that.
Made you come like me!
-Yes.
"Yes, nobody ever before you made me enjoy it so."
I am coming!
Do you hear me my love?
What is going on?
What do I hear?
Ahh!
"Look, Mrs. Rosella sees my films as committed by her husband."
Very well.
"There is a secure future for... telephone operators of the ""hot line""."
"-The more confessors there are,... the more 'talking sluts' there seem to be."
"And how do you react, when you see my films?"
"Obviously, it obliges me to please my boyfriend."
This was written by a man.
- I gotta get a new suit...
- Mine's covered in blood.
- Really?
Wow.
Ok.
- Yeah.
Great.
Thank you for coming.
It's been crazy.
Um.
"My credits cards were damaged in the accident, do you think you could help me pay the motel and I'll pay you back?"
"David, they weren't actually damaged."
You're broke.
You told me that last night.
"I just wish that you would, you know, tell me the truth when you were sober."
"Ok, the important thing to remember is this."
"In that nightmare yesterday, you were the only person I called."
"I'm looking for a man, answers to the name of Dashiell."
"Middle-aged, tall, pale, sickly, ambiguous sexuality, seriously anxious, probably consuming enormous amounts of alcohol while he's trying to comfort another man who's likely crying."
"Oh, and they're both covered with blood."
Have you seen him?
- Is this ok here?
- Yeah.
You're gonna go park?
Yeah.
Ow.
I think he was wearing a ring.
"I can still see it, just here."
- You look good.
- Thanks.
- It's gonna go well.
"- Yeah, I think it will."
"Jasmine, please keep your hands off your partner's buttocks!"
Some of the girls are getting restless
Someone has to stay upstairs.
"Fine, you can take one couple downstairs but make sure you send people up to replace them."
You look....
Are you having fun?
"Yeah, it's great but, aren't you freaking out, a little bit?"
You're president of the sorority now.
- It's a pretty big decision.
- Not at all.
I did what I had to do and it's working just fine.
Relax!
I am!
Can I borrow your lovely sister for a moment?
- You really pulled it off
- I couldn't have done without you.
What now?
"I say if you can slip away, we see what the real party's like."
Hopefully it's some more of your naughty little clappers.
Dean Bowman?
What a surprise!
Come on in.
You're here!
I'm so glad!
How can I refuse an invitation to a party of the infamous Kappa Taus.
- Mind if I look around?
- Not at all!
Let me have your coat.
"You know what, Cappie..."
Cappie can take his coat.
Who invited dean Bowman?
Me.
They're doing the best they can.
No.
I'm not griping about how they're treating the Deucalion.
I've just... given up on them.
On us?
On the Martians.
"The war's going in their favor a little bit, and they're wildly misinterpreting it."
That's terrifying.
I will drain the therapeutic fluid and bring Princess Asselyum to my castle.
Tell no one of this.
"Not even Princess Lemrina, of course."
- But why not-.
- Do as I say!
Forgive me.
I did not mean to startle you.
No visitors are allowed?
My sister's condition is that serious?
She...
Perhaps it was a miracle that she held on for this long.
How much time does she have?
Today?
Tomorrow?
They say that they still do not know.
It is just as possible that she will remain in this condition indefinitely.
I see...
I can guess what you are feeling.
"You may have mixed feelings, but she is your only sibling by blood."
"It is you who are truly sad, aren't you, Slaine?"
I must go.
Slaine...
"I forgive you, Slaine."
Even if you cry in front of me today.
I'd sold something.
I thought he could use the cash and I could sketch him.
What had you been told?
That he was beautiful.
I wanted to see for myself.
And you found him dying?
But he was exquisite.
There's a photo in the Tate Modern.
Like this.
How we look from 900m up.
"All dots, an irrelevance."
"Don't go metaphysical, mate."
Juries hate that.
The Greeks were terrified of beauty too.
"They saw it as a torment, excruciating, unreachable."
I want to capture the precise moment when things are exquisite.
"Listen, I don't normally make a habit of asking this but this time it matters."
Did you murder him?
"No, I did not."
Some dots stand out.
Are you OK?
"So why do you want to run, Dave?"
I'd like to make a difference.
"Oh, yeah?"
Example?
"Well, I think we could try to make New South Wales the hardest State in the country to buy a gun."
"Whoa, there."
Tread carefully.
We've still got a few very marginal country seats.
We don't want to upset the gun lobby.
"(Laughs) For fuck's sake, Wal."
What's so funny?
You bastard!
"You don't even have tears in your eyes, can you see it?"
It's dry!
You are caught red-handed!
Why do you pretend crying?
To hell with you!
"Hey, you'd better behave!"
"Wait, let me tell you a story."
"Once upon a time, there was a noble named Ho."
He had a son named Ho Chung.
"Sir Ho was old, his son would be his heir of course."
"But, suddenly, his nullius filius Ho Foon appeared."
Someone worried his status would be affected.
So he sent his fellow Chun... to kill that nullius filius.
"But, Chun failed."
Someone just took this opportunity to kill Chun.
And made that poor kid be the scapegoat.
That guy is really hard-hearted and cold-blooded!
What do you think about my assumption?
"Prosecutor, why do you laugh?"
Because this is such a nonsense and stupid story.
"Nonsense and stupid, huh?"
But you are all sweat!
It's really weird.
"Prosecutor, where were you when the homicide happened?"
At home.
What were you doing?
Reading.
What book did you read?
A tale of two cities.
Where did you stop?
Well... the soldiers...
(Fought under the withered pine tree)
(Now they're back with heads hunted)
(Our warriors fought with all their might)
(Mahebu Police Station)
Chief!
"Pawan, why aren't you in school?"
I'm sick
Sick?
But you don't look like sick
Did your teacher beat you?
I raced a Japanese kid and I won
And the kid was crying
"The teacher blamed me for bullying him, so he beat me"
Can I have another one please?
I'll win the race on the sports day
Those Japanese kids can cry their balls out when they watch me getting awarded
"Chief,"
I hate the Japanese
Chief Mouna?
My grandpa said you were a hero when you were younger
Your grandpa said I was a hero when I was younger?
I'm still a hero.
Does he know that?
"Chief Mouna, will you take me along next time you go hunting?"
"Pawan, where is your hunting ground?"
Chief Mouna!
I'm alright.
"Just a little bit tipsy, that's all"
What the hell?
Hanako!
Look what you have done!
How many times do I have to tell you that you cannot drag these logs along?
Kissing with inside lip?
Is this nothing?
"Good my lord, be cured of this diseased opinion and belimes,"
- For 'tis most dangerous
"- Say it be, 'tis true."
No!
"No, my lord!"
It is!
You lie!
Mightst hospice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink.
What stand I in?
I must be the poisoner of good Polixenes.
The King hath on him such a countenance as he hath lost some province
What is breeding that changes thus his manners?
"Sir, I will tell you"
I am appointed him to murder you.
"By whom, Camille?"
- By the King.
- For what?
"He thinks, nay, with all confidence, he swears"
That you have touch'd his Queen forbiddenly.
"O, then my best blood tum to an infected jelly."
- How should this grow?
- I know not
But I am sure 'tis safer to avoid what's grown than question how 'tis bom.
"For myself, I'll put my fortunes to your service"
Which are here by this discovery lost.
I do believe thee.
I saw his heart in's fa.
Merry or sad shall't be?
As merry as you will.
A sad tale's best for winter.
Tell Ruth Hedeby that the case is wide open.
We're not closing anything.
"Call those who've taken time off, back in."
The resources will be there when management sees what I've just seen.
- They didn't find anything in Jutland.
- Then send the men out again.
"Ask the local police to keep searching for Emilie, and coordinate it with Lund."
Give them all the help they need.
Call the Zeuthens in for an urgent briefing.
Asbjorn is asking for reinforcements.
They've traced the perpetrator.
"Asbjorn, what's happening?"
Lund and Borch have tracked him down.
We're on our way there.
It didn't sound good.
They're not in control.
- What's the problem?
- Apparently they're trapped inside.
"I don't know what happened, but we're on our way."
Yes?
What's up?
"Push the book under the door, then I'll spare you."
He wants the book.
Give that to me.
"Listen, we don't have that book."
People are on their way here.
Turn the damn car engine off.
Do you hear me?
Hello?
Hello!
"No, you do it."
"You do it, and then get me out."
"- All right, I'll use my own."
Oops-a-daisy.
- That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
- Vending machine at a rest stop.
- Give me that.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
"Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
"- Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
- Yeah.
Hi.
- Hi.
"- Oh, my God, everyone,"
Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
- So everyone's just gonna watch us?
- Yes!
"Now get to it, you lovebirds."
Here we go.
"- Come on, man."
- How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
- Welcome to the Fun Zone.
"I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
- Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
"- No, those are actually always there-- something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
"Anyways, you all have your assignments."
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine!
With all the crime that you and Robin should be out fighting how do you find time to come here and fix Black Widow's coiffeur?
"Those aren't hair dryers, Chief O'Hara."
"They're Bat Wave Brain Analyzers, which Robin and I have slightly rewired."
"Oh, you mean you're not really fixing their hair?"
Right.
What we're doing is decriminalizing them.
"It may take months of treatment, but we feel it's worth a try."
If we can permanently short circuit the bad streaks in them we will make honest useful citizens out of those spidery crooks.
"Chief O'Hara, do you realize what time it is'?"
I'm famished.
"Please bring me a menu, doll."
And don't forget the wine list.
"You heard the lady, chief."
Get a menu.
Yes.
"Yes, ma'am."
A menu and a wine list.
I'll see if I can locate them.
"Divine, darling."
Absolutely divine.

"Judy, get lost."
Yeah.
"Mike, where are those eye drops?"
"Oh, thank you."
"Well, we'll just put a little of these in."
"Oh, that stings."
What is it?
A steroid with an antibiotic.
- I will return another time.
- Don't go.
You haven't visited me for a long time.
Forgive me.
My health has been hateful.
Franz is away.
"All the royal houses of Europe have invited him to play, it seems."
Even Russia.
"Like most peasants, he has a weakness for crowned heads."
You may turn around.
Please sit.
Thank you.
Do you hear anything from Madame Sand?
- Will she be coming to Paris this year?
- I am no longer her friend.
She severed herself from Franz and me with no explanation.
"- You have her latest book, I see."
- Yes.
- Have you read it?
- I wouldn't touch such trash.
"Madame, last summer you gave me a letter."
"Yes, I took a chance... you would forgive me speaking the truth of my heart."
"In fact, I was appalled."
But I could not reject it entirely.
Something touched me.
"A phrase, like a tune one can't forget."
- Shall I remind you what you wrote?
- Do.

"""I love, that is all."""
"""But I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""

"Well, we didn't need to go through a lengthy interview."
"Anyway, we need one more."
Darling!
"I have no parents, no job, no home, no money, no education, no skills."
All I have is a disease.
And everyone ignores me.
My fiancé even dumped me.
I'm so sorry.
But I tried hard to survive.
For her.
"No, for this country and society!"
To be a helpful person.
Like Wonder Woman!
Wonder Woman?
She's my only friend and idol.
"She must be pretty, right?"
All men are only crazy about pretty girls.
I wish all pretty things would die.
Even the fishes in the river would run away from your ugly face.
"You die instead, you wench."
Hello?
I can't tell you right now.
I'll explain when we meet later.
"Well, I caught a big fish this time."
"I know you don't believe me, but this is a really big catch."
"No, I'm not playing games."
Shut up!
Tell me where you are!
Damn it.
The invasion.
But it never came.
"Stanley, voice-over:"
I don't know why you're kidding yourselves.
The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true.
Stanley.
"No, dad."
I'm fed up with it.
I'm fed up with the lot of them.
"If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago."
Foyle:
"No invasion, and you panicked."
"You were going to be found out after all, and you decided to..."
Take the easy way out.
Yes.
I wanted to kill myself.
"And Stanley destroyed your suicide note, understandably."
"A fascist for a mother, a killer for a father-- not shining examples of parental guidance."
No wonder he was reading Freud.
What will happen to me?
"You'll be tried for murder, Arthur."
"I loathed her, you know..."
And the scum she brought to the hotel.
Didn't give you the right to kill her.
Please tell Stanley I'm sorry.
Tell him...
I wish I'd been a better father.
I think he knows.
Yes.
"Milner, sit down."
Congratulations on the arrest.
"Ellis has signed a full confession, so I suppose that's that."
So...
So...
How do I get my money back?
What do you mean get your money back?
"- My 40,000 euros."
The judge has to give them back.
You told me so.
Wait.
Why do you think you were freed from jail?
The workings of the Holy Spirit?
Do you think the affidavit from the casino appeared by magic?
Wait... you used my money?
But... what did you want?
You wanted me to use mine?
- What's left?
- Nothing.
Do you know how many signatures are needed to get someone out of jail?
"Between the clerk, the judge, the guards... 40,000 euros goes quickly."
This money wasn't mine!
The guys who entrusted me with it will kill me!
"Tell them that the cops took it, that's it."
"40,000 euros in cash..."
I don't know many who could resist.
"These guys will never believe me, they'll rip my head off..."
"Mr Zeppini, you are free."
That's the most important thing.
"And if you need me, you know where to find me."
"Good luck, Mr Zeppini."
Shit!
That's enough.
I'm losing my concentration.
"See, this is our sesame."
We'd like to call...
"I forget his name, but that guy."
"Prosecution calls to the stand town coroner,"
Dusty Diamond.
This ought to be swift and painfree.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?"
"Remember, darling, if they ask, tell them everything, everything."
Well... do you swear?
Hm?
"Oh, um..."
"Well, I'd like to know what I'm swearing to."
"Um, perhaps I could read it."
'Cause I can't very well give a good book recommendation if I haven't read it.
"Mr. Diamond, please."
"Yes, I swear."
Hm.
"Mr. Diamond, so nice to have you today."
Mm-hm.
Let's start with:
Were you friends with the Mayor?
Friends.
"Mmm, mmm..."
Thirsty.
"Friends, ah."
"Um, yes."
"Can we get to the meat of the matter, sir?"
Yes.
What was the cause of death?
Cause.
"Well, um, first of all,"
"I, uh, ascertained that his heart would beat no more of that beautiful blood and then I further ascertained that his lungs would breathe in no more of that lucky air."
Lucky because it was allowed to go inside of him.
We forge some German documents and make the clothes of French peasant workers out of these blankets.
It's a great night for dying!
"Then we wheel the wooden horse into the exercise yard, we build a glider and we pole vault over the fence."
- What do you think?
- Pathetic.
"- Let's do it, then."
- Yeah.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Your plan worked brilliantly.
Yes.
Shame about old Spurty getting shot by the Gestapo.
"No, the SPG, Eddie, the SPG."
Not the Gestapo.
They're completely different things.
"The Gestapo, er..."
- speak German.
"- Ah, yes."
We're all right.
That's what matters.
"Of course, Eddie."
Safe and sound at home.
Perhaps now I can prepare for my fantastic dinner party.
Empty the big trousers.
"Okey-dokey, me old spunky cock sparrow."
"Now then, I've invited Tarby, Lynchy, Parky, Brucie,"
Tommy O'Connory and you and me.
Have we sufficient comestibles?
Oo-er!
I don't know about that but here's the grub.
"Good Lord, how did you get so much meat in your trousers?"
That's what all the girls say.
"Smut is the last recourse of the emotional cripple, Eddie."
- Yes.
Keep up the good work.
Boy-O.
"- What's up, Felix?"
- Nothing's up.
- You should make a move.
- On Gemma?
"End of term, mate, anything goes."
"That's not true, actually."
"Certain things definitely do not ""go."""
No matter how much you may want them to.
It's just a matter of confidence.
And this is an area where I may be able to help you out.
I'm so horny.
"Come on, let's do it dirty, any way you like."
"- Hi, Gemma."
"- Hiya, Felix."
- Can I have a word?
- Okay.
"I mean, obviously, you're out of my league, but I thought I'd ask just for clarification purposes."
Ask what?
If you'd like to go out with me sometime for something like a coffee or a film?
Sit.
Paul.
I don't think of you in the same way as you suspected.
But I'm sure there's someone out there who does.
You just have to be brave and keep looking.
"Okay, great, thanks."
"Seriously, you're very sweet and polite."
Unlike certain people I know.
So why do you go out with him?
"Truth or Dare, everyone."
"- Come on, don't start again now."
"- Yeah, yeah."
Hidalgo!
Put him on the bed.
"Look, a message."
- He was one of us?
- Nonsense.
He's particularly bad.
- He demands a lot of money for this.
"- So, what does it say?"
They're going to let us escape tomorrow.
And you're probably the reason why.
That's insane!
"They would let us rot and die in here, but as soon as one of the Great Leopard's men turns up, everything's sorted."
- Of course.
They're afraid that I might talk.
- Would you do that?
I haven't talked yet.
But it's not impossible.
I'm a mercenary.
I fight for money... not for my homeland.
"Padre Julio, what have you got for us?"
- Look what he's brought me!
"- Help me unload the truck, children."
I want something too!
You mustn't put yourself at risk by driving around just so we have something to eat.
"Who else is supposed to do it, then?"
- Have you found out anything?
- Carrasco and his men destroyed a bridge.
The supplies for the troops have been held up.
"Oh, and..."
I didn't need this.
But the reason I was chosen to do that operation is that I can read.
"One might even say that I'm the pick of the ""litterate."""
"Evening, laddies."
Say howdy to Sergeant Vickers.
He's our friendly neighborhood retention officer.
Too bad he didn't come to a friendly neighborhood.
No offense.
We just don't like war-to-war salesmen.
Hey!
You're a great bunch of kidders.
I like a good joke myself.
"In that case, may I present Major Winchester?"
Major Winchester.
You must be a career man.
L... [Chortles]
[Chortling Continues]
Let me ask you something.
Doesn't it bother you to sweet-talk young kids... into risking their lives all over again?
"- Hey, I'm just offering a little free advice."
- Like how to avoid old age.
Ah.
Nothing I like better than the free exchange of ideas.
That's Sergeant Hutchinson over there.
He's on that short-timers list of yours.
"Oh, yes."
Excuse me.
Enjoyed shooting' the breeze.
- Oh.
Wait a minute.
"- Let the man be, Pierce."
We all got our little tasks in life.
"- Incidentally, there's a meeting in my office tomorrow at 0900."
- Try to fatten me up?
- What if I am?
Suppose I wanted blueberry.
You had that last night.
"You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik."
I have you figured out.
"You do, huh?"
What else do you know about me?
That you are lonely.
"When you work graveyard as long as I have, you get to know the type."
"Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor."
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"How can I be lonely, when I have you to keep me company?"
"Check, please."
"Yo, Reznik, Furman's office."
Now!
"How are you doing, Reznik?"
What's this about?
Frankly I am concerned about you.
"To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit."
I've had a lot on my mind lately.
- Anything we can help with?
"- No, thanks."
There's nothing I can't handle.
- Wanna see the doctor?
"- It is not necessary, I'm fine really."
"Are you doing drugs, Reznik?"
Where is the shop steward?
He couldn't make it
- Shouldn't even be in here without a union.
- See what I mean.
"Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, believe me, but there's absolutely nothing to worry about."
Maybe we could help you?
That won't be necessary.
We're sick of doing nothing.
We're sick of being afraid all the time!
"That thing is hunting in daylight, now!"
We'll never be safe.
Just be patient.
We'll take care of it.
See?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.
Can you confirm that?
Not yet.
It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.
Alright.
"Well, in the meantime, there's another Wraith out there."
I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.
How?
May I speak with her?
Alright.
May I join you?
"Ellia, we need your help."
You can sense the other Wraith.
It is alright.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"In fact, I have the same ability."
Really?
"I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us."
And I knew even then that you were different.
"Your father has raised you well, he has taught you right from wrong."
You are not like the other one.
I don't let him in.
"Well, we must play to our strengths, must not overreach ourselves."
- Right.
- Er...
How does 12 boiled eggs sound?
"Er, usually like this..."
"Nice gag, Eddie, and totally unexpected."
"Perhaps a little sophisticated for BBC2, though."
I can just see it now.
"""How's the golf going, Tarbs?"""
"""Oh, really?"""
"""Do you wanna hear a stupid joke about an Irishman being stupid?"""
- Can't wait.
"- What do you suggest, then?"
"You're supposed to be my friend, you freeloading parasite."
Smelly Eddie to the rescue.
"When I was watching TV-am in the lav this morning,"
I saw this fantast ad for a new mag called Poncy Cooking.
"And when you buy part one, you get part two completely free."
That sounds like a marvellous offer and one not to be missed.
"Actually, it's a clumsy setup for a gag later on."
"- Oh, what a shame."
- Yes.
- Let's go to the newsagent's.
"- Okey-dokey, diddly squat."
Over we go.
Don't ever say I'm not there when I'm not needed.
You're not there when you're not needed.
Thank you.
"- Ready, Eddie?"
- Ready-weddy.
- Let's go.
"- Right, then."
Yep.
"They'd find the magnet, you'd be the first and only suspect, so you framed us."
Do you have any idea what you did to this man?
This man has nothing.
His...
His wife left him.
His girlfriend is in jail.
And he's been living in a ratty little condo.
"Thank you, Randy."
He's been looking at a sad little picture of a boat on a wall for 11 years...
Randy.
"...and you gave him hope, and then, you ripped his heart out."
Randy.
"For that, you're going to burn in hell."
That and the homicide.
"Actually, two homicides."
Don't forget the lottery fanatic who had a picture of them both together.
I think we're done here.
You two are under arrest.
Stand up.
"Let me see your hands, hotshot."
Thank you.
"Glad you like numbers, Billy."
You're going to be wearing some numbers on your shirt.
Is that right?
They won't be lottery numbers.
I get it.
Because you're going to prison.
"Yeah, I get it."
You have the right to remain silent.
I will if you will.
"You miss it, don't you?"
Don't be emotional.
Please leave!
I must see the chief.
"Brothers, the way he fights looks similar to us!"
Stop!
He must have a particular reason.
Brother!
We'll let our chief decide!
Thanks very much!
"Chief, we couldn't stop him from entering here."
Please accept me!
Why do you want to be my student?
My master Liu Chung belonged to Shaolin.
He was a student of Wu-mei.
I wish to learn more about kung-fu.
"Although you're a Shaolin student, you're too eager to kill, so we can't accept you."
He was anxious to enter the temple and so fought with our fellow monks.
That's why he gives off a killer's aura.
Fat-chi!
What's your opinion?
I still sense a killer's aura on him.
"Sorry, but I can't accept you!"
"Chief, I'll never leave this temple!"
"Behave yourself, this is a sacred place."
Buddhism mentions fate.
"I'm here, that's fate."
Why don't we keep him?
This will set a bad precedent.
Amida Buddha!

you're an alcoholic.
Yesterday was an unusual day.
You drank at lunch.
I had one beer.
"Three, actually."
And then you drank the champagne before you tried to poison a moose.
That was to make room for the pills.
You drank at the trucker bar.
"I mean, you really drank there."
And let's say
- it was stress-induced drinking...
"- I can relate to that, but..."
It was something you said to the stripper
- that really sealed it.
- At the bar?
"- At the hotel, at 4:28."
- What did I say?
"You said ""I'm an alcoholic."""
Did I have sex with the stripper?
There was more crying than sex.
- I made her cry?
- Not her...
Oh God!
Look...
- I don't know what I said last night...
"- I mean, I really don't know what I said last night, but it wasn't necessarily the truth."
In Vino Veritas.
"Is not accurate, is what I'm saying."
"It's just an expression, and it's Latin so people give it more weight than it deserves."
Just what you see.
"With the Ministry's cutbacks, when someone retires they don't send anyone new."
And the weapons are from the Moroccan War.
So what's the plan?
Do you have what we asked for?
There's the clothes.
Here you go.
"Two Civil Guard uniforms and for you, a monk's robes."
And the explosives to blow up the door.
I'll carry that.
I won't argue with you about that.
"Ah, one more thing."
"In case of an emergency, ring the Abbey's bells."
And what do we have the phones for?
"They're worthless here, in these mountains there's no coverage."
The Spanish hell is everywhere.
What is the Spanish hell?

You can tell it on the way.

The balcony scene.
That's-
Your favorite scene in the play.
I like that you pay attention to weird little details like that.
You do?
You're blushing.
I am?
I shouldn't have said that.
I totally embarrassed you.
No.
Amanda... you can always say whatever you want with me.
"Glazed Cornish game hens on a bed of sautéed greens, sweet-potato soufflé and asparagus, with shaved Romano and pancetta."
I don't think this is what we ordered.
Right. 'Cause nothing says romance like a smoked turkey wrap.
I took some liberties with the menu.
You made this?
No one knows I'm secretly a fan of Top Chef.
And no one ever will.
Bon appétit.
Stop staring.
I can't.
I'm O.D'ing on suspense.
I wonder how it's going.
You wanna know if it's going badly.
What you witnessed earlier was a completely uncharacteristic outburst.
"No, it's how you really feel."
It was just a mini meltdown brought on by some stupid homework assignment.

No one ever takes that seriously.
"Well, almost no one."
Hands down.
absolutely not.

Can we do one of those pictures where you go like that?
How do you do that?
Where you stand like this?
"Like, touching the top."
-How do you do that?
-You have to get down.
Is it working?
Looks like you're holding it up.
We're back now.
Start of the European leg of the tour.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
We need to try one of them local delicacy things from every place.
And here's the frog legs and snail stuff.
Are you down?
I'm not down for snails.
I think we should try it in every place.
Just try a delicacy from somewhere.
I've tried frogs but that's still not that weird.
"Like, snails is probably a bit disgusting."

"I can only go off what I see, and I'll be honest with you, the personal stuff..."
It scares me.
- He put his dad in a chair.
- He was punished.
I'm handing you a world-class fighter with a redemption story.
The thing is he's never addressed the father thing.
What's their relationship?
"Is he helping the guy out, or has he got him stashed in some home stewing in his own shit?"
Ryan never talks about it.
It makes him look arrogant.
The timing's just not right for us.
This is the last time you'll be able to afford him.
Do you have any female fighters?
Rick:
That's right!
Don't stop running till you get to the border!
- Get out of my fucking house!
"- Hey, what happened?"
Stay out!
You made a mess!
"No, no, no."
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
You made a big mess!
Now just go!
Don't come back!
Stay out of my fucking house!
You stay the fuck out!
You tell her to stay the fuck out of here!

- What happened?
- But who?
You knowwho.
And what about you?
Can you voice your own opinion some day?
"OK, take them."
These twins are like a needle and a thread.
They had it the hard way.
You can not even imagine what will happen to them ifthey are taken to our premises.
Take them.
Theywill make up fortheir guilt.
I've my orders.
I do not have the right.
And I have my orders as well and they are about our offensive.
So you'd better stay awayfrom me.
It is underyour responsibility.
Surely it is.
It is not your business.
All this war is only my business.

-Why have you been sent to the court martial?
-A intentional self-wound.
Yourfile states that you used to be a sergeant and had battle awards... including a Medal for Battlefield Courage.
"That's right. ln fact I was discharging the gun, it came off and the bullet hit my leg."
No one believes me.
-Will you believe me?
"-Yes, I will."
when I see you in the battlefield.
- Not at all.
Do you think we're alone in life?
I get criticized because I... don't take care of my family.
You know my parents have nothing.
I can't support... two families.
Go back to your parents if you want.
You talk to me like that... precisely now?
How can you want me away from my parents?
"Besides, it's you who forced me to work."
"From now on, I will work."
Did you find an employer?
That's my problem.
Also mine.
"Anyway, it'll happen soon."
"My only frustration in this relationship, is not having children."
And also mine!
"If we don't have kids,"
I can't do anything.
I don't want to hear you... talking that way.
"Let's stop this discussion, we're too nervous."
"Smarten up, tonight we'll be having dinner at the Director's house."
I don't want to go.
Your hosts look down on everybody.
You're only coming with me.
"I know, but I don't feel like it."
Get ready!
- Djénéba... hi!
- Sinaté... hi!
- Is you husband in?
"- Yes, he's expecting you."
- How much is this sack?
- 20700 FM.
"- How are you, old Yannis?"
"Thank God, I'm all right."
You?
So am I.
How's Pavlos?
A good question!
He's been very sad ever since your breakup.
At first he used to come here every night and sit alone and miserable at this very table.
Every night!
Getting drunk...
Don't you see him anymore?
- What's his life like nowadays?
- He lives in poverty.
I pleaded he painted more moons on my walls to no avail...
Let it go!
He has this fixation with painting in the penthouse.
- Day and night!
"- So, he works?"
Yes but what's the point?
Who buys paintings these days?
- Perhaps someone now at the exhibition.
- What exhibition?
He is exhibiting his work at a gallery for a week now.
"It's in the papers, didn't you know?"
"No, I didn't."
"I'll go buy a framed picture for the tavern to aid the poor guy, cause... he's in dire straits!"
I can tell you that he's starving.
"No other way of helping him, proud as he is, you know him, Aliki."
"Yes, I know."
"I looked thoroughly, Aliki."
No bracelet.
I'm sorry.
They've all had incredible training.
"It was intimidating at first, but I know I'm in good company."
I'm learning about composers I never knew-
"Amanda's heart was beating rapidly, and she was speaking really fast."
"She seemed happy, but I could sense that she was troubled."
I'm already a better technical player.
Amanda... is everything all right?
I can never hide anything from you.
But I need to let my mom know I'm home.
Can we get together later?
Of course.
Good.
I guess we need to talk.
She said what?
"""We need to talk. """
What is it?
Nothing.
"No, I missed something."
"Well, when someone says, ""We need to talk,"""
sometimes it's a lead in to a discussion about feelings that have changed.
Feelings?
"Prepare yourself, dude."
She's dumping you.
At least she has the decency to do it in person.
Don't read into it.
Just wait and hear what she has to say.
No.
Not my lucky shirt.
"Josh, you've outgrown it."
I couldn't help but wonder...
Had Amanda already outgrown me?
"Okay, grab hold of the wire and make these babies blink."
Let's get this typed up.
What?
I'm going to miss this.
Are you going somewhere?
I've accepted a job offer back home.
You're going back into advertising?
Head of Morale Ops at the new camp in Virginia.
"They're looking for Camp X grads to teach there, so..."
The Americans will be lucky to have you.
And no more bad guys to shoot you.
I will miss this place.
So visit.
"Could you get those handcuffs off, please?"
_
"Klaus, I'm Duncan Sinclair."
I'm Oliver and Billy's father.
Do you remember me?
Have a seat.
How's Bowmanville suit you?
Little more comfortable than the Russian camp?
Why am I here?
- Did my father arrange this?
"- Now, Klaus,"
"I can't elaborate, for security reasons, but..."
Our families vacationed on Lake Constance when you were a child.
"We couldn't keep you kids out of the water that summer,"
- do you remember?
- No.
This isn't the same breakfast the other prisoners of war receive.
"Well, Klaus, Bowmanville's good, but it's not that good."
I don't want special treatment.
Are you sure...
- That's so disgusting.
"Yeah, people really get wound up when they watch this."
- I just laugh.
I think it's funny.
- That's not real vomit.
- It was real.
- It's real.
No.
But it's like...
What I keep saying is if you put crushed graham cracker cookies and ginger ale or ginger cookies or whatever and you hold it in your mouth and spit it out.
"It doesn't matter that it's not real, it's just disgusting."
It's just as vile.
"This woman coming through, do you remember when her line was:"
"""Hell no."" And she did it, ""Hell no."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- No, that's not real."
"- Yes, it is."
- She...
All the takes of her saying that line are on the DVD.
"Ari, your face..."
Right here.
Right here.
"Oh, ashamed but happy."
- Guilty pleasure.
- I think that was the last thing I shot.
That was the...
"Yeah, that was the last thing you shot."
- That was your last day.
- It's like a little private shame that you share with yourself.
"Fine, let's go to Brooklyn."
"Aaron fell down, one of those takes."
"- Oh, he did?"
I have detailed two of my units to General Gómez.
- We are too weak to...
- Are you afraid of a bandit?
I am a soldier.
Please don't forget that.
It would be insane to underestimate a man like Carrasco.
"Without reinforcement, I can't perform my duty."
"Señor Presidente, what about giving me part of the militia?"
- You can't have anyone.
- Why not?
- I need them to fix your mistakes.
- That's enough now.
That's enough.
This won't get us any further.
"That's enough, Silveira."
"- I'll think about it, General."
"- Thank you, General."
Señor Presidente.
"He's a coward, but he knows what he wants."
"And, most of all, he wants power."
"And you don't, dear friend?"
That will be them.
All right.
"There's no need for me to worry, is there?"
You have inspected everything?
- Read this.
- What is it?
What has Carrasco got to do with that village?
- We'll claim that it was him.
- And set the people against him.
I see.
"Silveira, I don't care how you do it, but I want you to get rid of this man, is that clear?"
At last.
"Now, will you get the luggage off immediately and take it straight to our rooms?"
I do not understand why we weren't met properly.
"Well, I think it's simply wonderful."
It's so unspoiled.
"Eh, it's pretty enough, but it's such a long way to come, such an awful journey."
You'll enjoy bathing and lazing about.
We could have done that in Brixen.
Why you wanted to drag us all this way...
"You'll adore it here, I know."
I can see that you mean to enjoy yourself.
"Oh, well."
"Give me a bath and a bed, and perhaps it'll be better in the morning."
"– Tony, darling?"
– Yes?
My cigarette case.
She makes me feel so undercooked.
I'm so patchy still.
She really is so lucky.
"Oh, dear, that bathing dress is a mistake."
Morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Lovely day.
DOUGLAS:
"Shall I put yours here, darling?"
MARJORIE:
"Yes, so I can get a little bit of sun."
"I feel so dreadfully faded, but I freckle rather than going brown."
Have you ever been to Rhodes before?
No.
"It's lovely, isn't it?"
I'm working now!
You keep yelling at me day and night
And to think you're my dad?
"Look at you, are you a thief at night?"
Thief?
"If so, need I stay here... and work like a horse?"
What are you mumbling about?
What did you say?
Nothing!
If you don't like it here... you're free to leave
"Boss, look at your restaurant"
It's as big as a market.
I'm the only staff here
It wouldn't hurt to hire one more helper
What did you say?
Who's gonna pay for that?
You're so ungrateful!
If it wasn't me who pitied you last year...
"And keep you here, you'd have starved to death"
"Y es, oh yes!"
Thanks Mr. Boss!
Work fast!
"Can't take any criticism, even talks back to me"
Did you light the stove yet?
Light the stove?
You lazy bum!
I woke you up... to have you light the stove!
You're so forgetful!
I'll beat you up!
"You good-for-nothing, how dare you run!"
"I'll beat you up, you can't remember a thing!"
Where is he?
Grace.
"And Jack, right?"
(CLEARS THROAT)
You slept with her?
I feel bad that Ben didn't want to eat with us.
I felt badly he lied to me yet again.
"Well, Leo, maybe you're just going to have to let him date Dylan."
"No, I'm not."
"I want to say something, if I may..."
"I hope, whatever it is, it starts with an apology."
No.
It doesn't.
"I just want to say that if you're going to tell me who to date,"
I think I should have every right to tell you who to date.
What!
Yeah.
"And unless you plan on getting her pregnant or importing some offspring from some other source and adopting them, you should quit dating Camille."
"No offense, Camille."
Are you drunk?
"No, I'm perfectly sober."
"Last time, you married a hooker and I didn't speak up."
This time I'm speaking up.
You two do not belong together.
You're too fat and she's too thin.
She probably can't even get pregnant.
"If she could, she would have trapped you by now."
(GROANS)
(LAUGHING)
You want to get married?
Ow.
Well?
Seriously?
- They never caught on.
- They may.
I'd keep my mouth shut.
Why?
"We're all Americans here, aren't we?"
The Krauts have a way of getting information.
"Yeah, especially in this barracks."
- How?
- That's what we'd like to know.
There's only one pair left.
"Well, get some more."
"Say, uh, where does a fellow take a hot shower around here?"
"Hot shower, heh?"
Dig him.
Sorry.
No hot showers.
You wash in the latrine.
In a latrine!
"What did you expect, glamour boy?"
"An officers' club with a steam room and a massage, maybe?"
"Hey, just a minute."
You made cracks and I let them slide but I don't intend to take any more.
"If you resent my having money, start a revolution but get off my back."
-All your dough won't help here because here you're on your own.
No mother to throw a lifebelt.
- Now let's see how good you can swim.
"-I can swim, all right."
We own three swimming pools and a private lake.
It figures.
"Sorry, boys, my taxi's waiting."
"Cut the horseplay, Harry."
What's the matter with you guys?
Do you have any idea what this looks like?
Come on.
You know we didn't shoot at them.
- You know that we're legit.
"- Yeah, I do."
"But if you keep shutting me out,"
How am I supposed to back you up?
We'll just--
This stays with me until things die down.
- Or implode.
- What?
"Sir, you're putting yourself in serious danger."
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
So tell me.
We can't.
"Well, I admire your loyalty."
I prized it myself once.
But you need to look at where you're placing it right now.
This has come to my attention.
It checks out.
And I will have to act on it.
"You want me to trust you, okay."
If there's even a remnant of a two-way street left--
If you still trust that I'm trying
To look out for you--then read it.
I want some extra people in the office.
Around the clock for the next 72.
Just in case.
Why?
'cause he stole something dangerous
And it's important that I get it back from him.
What makes you so sure it was him?
We have a problem.
The Ibani hotel?
They just cancelled our party.
And Jimmy Valenti changed his mind.
Nothing's been signed.
There's really no recourse.
A hundred guests have confirmed and we have no place to put them.
"I understand you're a bachelor, Neil, but for God's sake don't let the place go to seed."
So I've been scrambling to find a backup location.
You must have connections.
Somewhere discreet.
I'll see what I can do.
There's another matter we need to discuss.
This is my biggest party of the year.
We're all going to have to multitask.
"Darling, it's just business."
Is that what you call it?
'Cause to me it looks like blackmail.
"Look, Mommy and Daddy are playing house again."
The dining room table?
Bravo.
Is this gonna take long?
We were kind of in the middle of something.
"I just want a few minutes with your husband, Grace."
Like so many women do.
Coffee?
Mmm.
Love some.
She's never gonna stop.
Ever.
Today it's the SEC shutting down Bastion.
Tomorrow it'll be something else.
Now I want to return the favor.
What do you think that is?
"No idea, but, you know, we should probably bag it and search for Amanda's prints."
"Abbs, I think we may have found something."
"Me, too."
I found Amanda Kane.
I downloaded the onboard surveillance footage from the last cruise.
I found her wandering through the casino.
The guard's coming back.
"Abby, send me what you've got now."
"Hold on, wait."
It looks like the fiance on land did have a rival at sea.
Amanda met a man on the ship.
The guard's at the door.
"Abby, get out of there now."
Do we have an I.D. on our shipboard Romeo?
"Not yet, but I ran the fingerprints on the lucite tube."
They're Amanda's.
"Guys, check out the body language."
She's not in love.
She's afraid.
Got him.
Our mystery man is Roman stone.
He works here on the ship.
Casino croupier.
Maybe Amanda was tracking an illegal gambling operation.
- Roulette.
It figures.
It's a punk game.
- Sounds like you speak from experience.
Strictly a Texas hold'em gal.
That puts you in the leadoff spot.
Any of the guys on the team talked about the e-mail or the murder?
"No, not in front of me, anyway."
We got state championship coming up tomorrow.
That what they're focusing on.
"Life goes on, right?"
Not for everybody.
Is Todd Fleming around?
We want to ask him a few questions.
Fleming!
Front and center.
Come on!
Keep it going!
"Look, I don't know anything about what happened, okay?"
None of us do.
If that's why you guys came down here...
We found alligator blood on Coach Nelson's roof.
We think it was a part of your science project.
"What were you doing up there, Todd?"
I wasn't up there.
I...
"Look, even if I was, up there, what does it matter?"
"'Cause it's a murder investigation, smart guy."
Everything matters.
I didn't kill him.
We'll talk about this downtown.
- I'm in the middle of practice.
- Practice can wait.
Am I under arrest or something?
"Look, Todd, do you have any street clothes you can change into?"
We just want to talk to you.
"- Yeah, in, in the locker room."
- Let's go.
"Look, we know that having a deep pocket means that sometimes you get subjected to extortion."
It happens.
But for them to saddle up a child-- the child of a suicide victim--
Where does it stop?
"Well, at the end of this case,"
I hope it stops there.
You can go... prop.
"Ryan never talked about what he was working on, but I knew it made him very unhappy."
He was very stressed.
"Now, did he ever talk about killing himself?"
No.
Never.
"After he died, that's what Borns Tech told me happened, and I believed them."
Why did you believe them?
"Shock, anger."
I wasn't thinking clearly.
"It was easier to blame Ryan somehow,"
- and I regret that.
- Right.
You weren't thinking clearly.
Hmm.
But clearly well enough to take an enormous settlement from Borns Tech.
I had my son to consider.
You told us that Ryan was unhappy and stressed.
At work.
Not at home.
"I mean, everything okay with you two at home."
Yes.
Pretty much.
Was he unhappy or stressed about anything between the two of you?
No.
It's your last chance to come clean.
Yes.
Where are the plans?
"Oh, here they are, sir."
"Will you ever forgive me, sir?"
"- What for, Jeeves?"
"- For hitting you on the head, sir."
"Oh, it's all right now, Jeeves."
Everything's all right.
"Well, dash it!"
Everything's not all right.
"Jeeves, you ingrate."
"Get me out of the rough, will you?"
"I'm afraid you'll need a blacksmith for that, sir."
"We owe a great deal to you, Mr. Wooster, and to your man."
- Not at all.
It was great fun.
"- Well, thanks anyway."
I'll go and see if I can find that blacksmith for you.
- How can I ever thank you for all you've done?
- It isn't thanks I want.
It's eternal devotion and everlasting friendship.
"Do you mean that, or are you still in a daze?"
"I'm in a daze, but a wonderful daze."
"Parsons, orange blossoms, little choirboys— can you face that?"
"Yes, if you promise me you'll never speak to a strange woman again."
What are you doing?
- Sittin' down.
- Amazing.
"Oh, Jeeves, this is a very pleasant spot."
We must spend our honeymoon here.
"Not our honeymoon, sir."
Only yours.
Who's this?
"Oh, it's the Director of Clandestine Operations Overseas."
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.
Director Atwater.
Director Collins.
Templeman.
Keep going.
"Yeah, these are people being groomed for top slots in the corporation."
"Go back, go back."
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.
Fifteen dossiers.
Fifteen broadcasts.
There it is.
"If I wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop, these would be the 1 5 I'd start with."
"You kill these men today, you won't recognize the world when you wake up in the morning."
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
"I mean, what the hell do they want with us?"
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.
Grab that.
Let's go.
Here.
"That's all the information from the laptop, in case, uh... I don't know, in case we don't get out of here."
Drink that.
"""Of course we'll get out of here, Katherine."
"Don't you worry about a thing."""
You ever get used to it?
Used to what?
Bodies.
Dead people.
"Yes, sir."
"And thank you, sir."
In view of the fact that the deposit was so small this procedure is a little unusual.
"Miss Howell, would you please leave my house?"
I have some very important business to discuss with Mrs. Ryan.
"Come into the garden, my dear."
How do you like it?
It's lovely.
All those wonderful flowers.
"Oh, that's nothing,"
I'm going to have some orchids flown in from Hawaii.
But what a beautiful setting.
"You know, a place like this inspires romance, don't you think?"
How long is it since you lost your husband?
Five years.
And you've been without a companion all that time?
I'm doing alright.
I want you to give a party.
Invite all your friends.
We'll celebrate.
Celebrate what?
My making $20.000?
That's nothing.
"Well, there'll be much more in the future."
Future?
I'm going to Europe soon.
Why go to Europe.
I've brought Europe to you.
"You're a fast worker, aren't you?"
In my country I'm considered a slowpoke.
We weren't even formally introduced yet.
I think we know each other pretty well.
The keys!
"Beautiful evening, Constable."
Beautiful evening.
Mr X was then pushed into the pond.
"I don't know why you did it, but if that isn't worth double what I asked, I'm a Dutchman."
It was a dummy.
We...
I was working out a plot.
"Pinching a plot, don't you mean?"
What would your chum say?
Therefore I suggest a contract making over 50 per cent of all your future royalties forever.
- Impossible.
"- Then I'll send an anonymous letter, telling police to drag the pond and name you as the culprit."
- Mumsie!
Mumsie!
- Go away!
"But, Mumsie, the keys!"
You've got the keys!
In my raincoat pocket.
Hurry.
Don't say there's someone else for the high jump.
What about the money you mentioned?
I couldn't get it.
It may be a few days.
"Well, the new deal will be £5,000 down in advance of the 50 per cent."
When may I hope to see the cash and contract?
"Why, you...!"
My agent is away.
Come the day after tomorrow evening at nine o'clock.
"Well, don't let me down this time."
- No.
- Good.
"All right, tie it off!"
Now look alive.
Mr. Petty...
You arrive to us with much fanfare.
I can assure you most lags don't get the benefit of a welcoming party.
"But then you are a special case, aren't you?"
A smile.
"On a child's face, it reminds us of all that's good and pure in this world."
"But on yours, it's all the company of Hades."
"If you've left any more of your mines on the mainland, son, it will be our singular aim to find out just where they are before anyone else is blown to kingdom come."
Take him.
Felicitations to the good men and women of the San Francisco police department.
Does the lady need a ride back to the mainland?
"No, the lady does not."
But nice thought.
Thank you.
Peppermint.
For your nausea.
Officer...
Hauser.
Emerson Hauser.
"She has good taste in music, Mr. Hauser."
Any improvement?
I'm sorry.
And if she stays here?
Did she ever talk to you about a DNR?
Are you saying she's dying?
"Guy, ready?"
"Oh, okay."
"Hey, buddy."
How you doing?
Where'd you come from?
You are dead for all of us
You are dead!
Brother

Tauji if you'd called me I would have come.

His life is in danger.
You must save him.
It's my destiny to stoop so low
And pardon in front of a goon.
-You could have it.
-You took it first.
Excuse me.
"There are two copies, you both could have the same."
The bill counter is at the left corner.
You could pay the bill there
Your's sir.
- Thank you.
- Yours madam.
Do they assume to be Vijay and Shalini?
I am Haridas.
The best house broker in South India.
Please contact me to buy and sell house and house plots.
If you want Idli with Chutney approach me.
"You can't even spell fast-food, and you claim to be an owner."
You dare to advertise your Idli and chutney.
Better run away...
-What a stink!
-I didn't do anything
He has opened the idli cooker
I will become a spirit if I consume this vapour
-Why isn't the Poori fresh?

-Not made today?

PAST food.
- Give me pongal?
- What you guys want for pongal?
"For pongal give us trousers and shirt, some pocket money."
I asked what you need as side dish?
As if you have eight-variety dishes?
Give me that same damn chutney.
Murder victim.
His unknown killer is still at large.
Witnesses saw stein enter the hotel
"With a very young, very attractive woman."
"The l.A.P.D. Is now looking for this woman,"
The woman witnesses saw with stein
Just before he was murdered.
Police are asking if you have any information
"About her or her whereabouts,"
Please contact l.A.P.D. Immediately.
"Oh,my god."
I killed him.
I can't believe it.
I killed him.
"Ann,listen to me."
Listen to me.
You did the right thing by talking to a lawyer.
"Now from what you're saying,"
It sounds like you have a good case for self-Defense.
"If he was attacking you,the law says you can protect yourself."
"But in order for me to help you,"
"I need to understand exactly what happened,okay?"
"So one more time, but slower."
Lenny invited me to his hotel room.
We're friends.
And i don't know if it was his temper
"Or his drinking or what,"
"But he got mad, and he hit me,"
And he wouldn't let me leave.
He... tried to kill me.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Continuing with the treatment would be meaningless.
"Moreover, your current medical fees are costly enough."
I will definitely come up with the money in one month.
"Therefore... please, you must definitely save him."
I absolutely can't let go of my dad like this.
He has been in a coma for 10 years.
Maybe it's time to give up.
"Because of me, my dad is like that."
"I can't give up, I can't."
Doctor!
Please save him.
I'm begging you!
Please save him.
Please save my father.
Please save him.
"Hello everybody, I'm from life beverage company."
I sell hangover drinks.
We are currently having a free trial for our product.
"To participate, you just need to go to our website."
"These don't really work, right?"
"It's a lie, right?"
There's no such thing.
People who have tried this drink say that their stomachs feel a lot better the very next day.
"No, thanks."
We don't need it.
Don't be like this.
Sounds good.
Let's give it a try.
Thank you.
"One bottle, two bottles."
"Hello, It's Kim Na Na."
Right now?
"There's bigger things happening in the world... than your stupid actor clients, and the Nielsen ratings on the TV."
You're now officially embarrassing everybody here.
Ok?
"Don't you... dare ""F""ing tell me that I'm embarrassing you, ok?"
Because...
my friends think you're a douchebag.
A... nasty ass... sleazebag agent.
"Drew, we don't think you're a douchebag."
"Jill, come on."
That's ok.
Thanks.
"Oh, where you gonna go?"
Are you gonna go home and masturbate?
To one of your anime porns?
Cartoons.
He made me watch animated porn.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go home and masturbate!
Disgusting.
Because it's better than anything you're giving me at home.
"No, 'cause you love to masturbate."
"'Cause for you, it's like having sex with something that you love!"
Yourself!
Did she just make that up?
Annie Hall. '77.
I'm going home!
Are you gonna go screw one of your actresses?
"One of your stupid, slutty..."
sleep your way to the top actresses.
I think I need to go to the bathroom.
Somebody can take her home.
'Cause now she's drunk and you're pissed off.
"That is true, Victor."
He has acrophobia Among other things.
Find a different test for him.
Acrophobia is not a problem with my device.
Start climbing.
"I will do anything else you say,"
"But I am not going up that building, understand?"
- I...
- Sickle I command you to climb up that fire escape.
"You will go to the very top,"
"You will turn around, and you will look down."
And you will not be frightened of heights.
Off you go.
It's working.
It's working!
It seems to be.
Victor.
"Victor, you are risking his life."
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.
"He's the only one I can leave my Uh, my bankruptcy to."
"That's what experimentation is all about, Letha."
[Letha] we cannot afford to lose him.
I am the only one we cannot afford to lose.
Can't you see that I've got complete control over his mind?
"He has no fear, no memory, no will."
He can only carry out my commands.
- [car rattling] - what...
What's happening?
We're out of gas.
"What are you, crazy?"
"Look at the dial, it points to..."
Is that all right?
"Ok, good bye."
- Is the Director in?
- Go see his secretary.
Take this to the boss's car.
Is the director in?
Don't you know how to say hello?
"Yes, sorry."
Is he in?
- He's not seeing anyone right now.
- He called me.
- Who are you?
"- Balla Traoré, from the factory."
"Right, Balla from the factory, he's expecting you."
It's the office on the right.
"You're late, I was leaving..."
Have a seat.
- Any news?
- Everything's all right.
I got the quarterly report.
"Truth is, this factory is going from bad to worse in red ink, according to a report made before you arrived."
"But right now, we need to keep up appearances at all costs."
"A rich man nowadays, is like the crap that... bees feed on."
"They get pleasure, but at the same time it makes them cry."
"200 workers will be laid off, among this mass of lazy bums."
"200, that's too many!"
"The factory will produce, I'll take care of it."
You have my trust.
- Here's the sack.
- Leave it there.
That's everything.
You owe me 215 FM.
Can I take a message?
Oh...
OK.
Bye.
Some foreign bloke says he makes tasty crackling and you shouldn't be afraid.
- What's that all about?
- It's... just... a mate.
He's a chef.
Wants me to try a new recipe.
See?
I don't know any fancy foreign chefs.
Don't tell me it's not exciting living in London.
It's not exciting living in London.
"- Oh, come on."
It must be.
- It's not.
It's like some huge ant hill where nothing works properly.
Millions of people just getting in each other's way.
"No space, no air."
"So, why don't you leave?"
"I'm trying, but it's hard."
"With money it's bearable, but if you're skint, you're trapped."
Try living here.
"Everybody knows you, knows everything about you."
"Nothing changes, nothing ever happens."
"Their idea of a good time is getting shit-faced as quickly as possible and then shag anyone who'll let them, and then do it all again tomorrow."
"Now, that's being trapped."
To escaping.
To escaping.
"And a big, fat win on the lottery."
- What?
- I was just thinking about Wicklow.
People are concerned.
"You have been a rock-- stable, rational."
This case has tripped a wire somewhere.
Ahem.
"Oh, my God."
You are more like Billy than you realize.
You both need someone to fight and to hate and to destroy.
You can't just be.
I loved Billy.
I truly did.
Once.
We were quite a team.
"You couldn't stand him, Donald."
"Eventually no, but in the beginning I loved him."
- Until you didn't.
"- Until I didn't because he was weak, because he drank, because he never really stood for anything."
That's what you do.
"People fall, and you just let them keep falling."
"Oh, come on."
Are you going to help Lucy?
I know that you care about her.
She just might be the one thing to make you happy.
She made me happy.
But she was weak.
Ahem.
Lawyers are reminded-- opening statements are not arguments.
They're road maps to let the juries know what evidence they can expect to hear.
Plaintiff has the burden of proof and delivers the first opening statement.
Billy:
Cool.
"Um... okay, let's do this."
How are you guys doing?
The Russian women.
Get away.
"Here, try the end window, where the candy is."
"Come on, Hoffy,we all want to see."
- How'd he get over there?
-Easy.
"Walked through the gate, past the guard, like he was some Kraut field marshal."
Now we know what he got for the radio.
This is murder.
"The stinking miser, keeping all that for himself."
"So I'm a vigilante, huh?"
"So, what are the officers gonna do now?"
"Don't worry, we'll handle it from here."
"Well, you'd better handle it fast, before he sells us all down the river."
Hi.
Too late for chow?
"What's the matter, boys?"
My slip showing?
I'll say it is.
You spilled a little borscht on it.
Borscht?
- Did you have a good time over there?
-Oh.
Somebody was peeking.
"Yeah, had a dreamy time."
"Those dames, they really know how to throw a party."
"I've known some women in my time, but between you and me there's nothing like the hot breath of the Cossacks."
There are a couple of blond snipers over there.
Real man-killers.
They--
What's this?
"What happened, Cookie?"
Idiot!
"Hey Halwa, what are you still doing here?"
You are no ordinary man.
You made that lunatic a doctor.
How long is your game?
I can't with stand it.
This is nothing.
This is just an interval.
Climax is still pending.
Shall I tell you something shocking?
What?
I'm the thief whom your brother-in-law is looking for.
Why did he come to Malaysia?
He used to rob regularly in India.
Why is he quiet now?
Has he quit robbing?
What does December 16 mean?
There is lot of time left for that day.
"If he had quit robbing, why would he fix the target?"
Why is he robbing?
Who will he rob in Malaysia?
He must either rob the nrls.
Or rob those who have link with India.
Where could he be?
"If he had called from this phone booth, he must be living in these surroundings."
But where?
What do you think of yourself?
Is duty everything for you?
"Even after coming to Malaysia, you are still thinking about that thief."
Why did we come here?
For your engagement or to catch that thief?
What if something happens to you?
We had an agreement...
--That doggy playground!
--The district will put it on this spot --What playground?
--What do you have in mind?
--A place to walk the dogs.
Cuz they've crapped all over town
And some people are following the dogs' example
--Is this some kind of a joke?
--This is no place for jokes
"--Pavel Ivanovich, did you call me?"
"--Comrades, that's all I have."
"--Alright, we'll talk elsewhere --We'll tell Efimov about your ideas."
He'll give you dogs to remember!
--Don't intimidate us.
Efimov is also quite manageable --We'll see about that
"No, comrade general, no exceptions for any Gaeva, sorry!"
Gaeva has a permanent garage that is not subject to demolishion
"--Galkina, write this down:"
Solov'ev gets no bonus --For what?
--For wasting time dressing up at work --Please don't.
She's a dedicated worker
She works saturdays and sundays
--May I?
--See Sorokin about garages
"--No, she's here to get a piece of my apartment"
--Yep --Did I guess it right?
"You're mistaken, Comrade Vasin"
I am returning all the stuff we stole from you
There!
There!
And there!
I lost the other one.
"They're not sympathetic, they're not press-Friendly,"
And they're not helping her.
Your mother's been crying ever since she got the call.
"I warned you about comin' out here,"
And now look what you've done!
"This isn't about you,dad!"
You've humiliated yourself and your whole family.
It is about us!
"I am the one who's in trouble here,okay?"
Not you!
Everything's not about you!
What you do reflects on us.
"Gosh,would you just shut up and just let me talk!"
?
Don't hit her.
Don't tell me how to treat my daughter.
She's not your daughter.
"She is our client,"
"And nobody touches our client,ever."
Tom.
Tom.
Tom!
Ron used some of the money
He's collected for your defense fund
"To post your bail, and he sent your parents home."
We both think it will be better for you and the trial.
You okay with that?
"Listen,i'm sorry about getting into it with your dad."
I'm sure he means well.
"No,he doesn't."
"Whatever my brothers did was fine,you know?"
"But he never trusted me, ever."
"This is just like ""hairspray""!"
"Then the cops showed up, and it turned into a riot."
Whoa!
A riot?
Yeah.
Sweet!
Did anyone use nunchakus?
"You know, I don't think so,"
"But that riot was something else, and it reminded me..."
"So aunt Edie told them all about the riot,"
"The moon landing, and the time she saw elvis"
"Buying double ""a"" batteries at Wheeler's market."
Maybe Axl and Sue didn't find
"The time capsule they were looking for,"
But they ended up finding a better one.
"And it turns out,"
I had a little time capsule of my own.
"A file, mike?"
Someone seriously has a file on me?
How do I go from being a person teachers always loved
To a person with a file?
"Well, you know, maybe they didn't love you"
As much as you thought they did.
So what are we gonna do about this crossing guard thing?
"I take tuesdays, you take thursdays,"
And then we switch off?
"What do you mean ""we""?"
Hey.
I'm telling.
"'course you are, 'cause you're a narc."

He's also a man and that...
... eventhoughI'mnot married to your mom...
... Istillenjoythe companyofwomen ...
... whichmeansthatIwill  occasionally go out with one.
But the important thing for you to understand...
... isthatIamnottryingto replace your mother.
"In fact, no one can replace your mother."
I bet you could kill a guy with a piece of bacon.
"All right, then."
I'm glad we had this talk.
I'm gonna go post my plan on the Internet.
"You know, there's moments around here..."
... thatmakeme wish I had a son of my own.
That wasn't one of them.
"Yeah, well."
"Anyway, I really appreciate you watching him tonight."
No problem.
-How you getting to the restaurant?
-Sherri's picking me up.
-Very convenient.
-Why?
Because she's been here before?
Been here with you?
Because you've had sex with her in every room in the house?
"No, because you can't drive."
But it's interesting to see how your mind works.
"Alan, let me give you some advice."
Alcohol impairs your ability to make good decisions.
We don't want you to lose that ability.
We want her to.
Of course.
Very good.
"If we don't get a signal soon, get some back-up..."
We're driving towards Clare in a hearse.
(GRUNTING)
Fuck...
"I'm not going to hurt you, I need some drugs."
(GRUNTING) Adrenaline...
Something to keep me going.
"If you come with me, I can get you your drugs, and examine your wound also."
"There are soldiers here, they're looking for me."
SEELA:
Why?
I was trying to rescue a woman.
She's a doctor.
She got kidnapped by the Janjaweed.
Her name's Clare Somersby.
- The aid worker?
- Yeah.
She's going to die...
"Along with a lot of other people, if you don't help me."
(GRUNTING) Okay...
"So, please?"
(SOLDIERS YELL IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
There's no sign yet of Stonebridge on any of the satellite feeds...
Widen your grid reference.
What about Matak?
"(CHUCKLES) According to his office, he's away on an official engagement."
"- No, He's stalling..."
He's just hoping nothing will stick to him.
"See if she was arrested, as well, and get me on a flight to Khartoum."
I'm gonna have to deal with this personally.
(IN ARABIC)
(IN ARABIC)
I would do it until a morning the with pleasure.
Tell dear Tót.
Where is he?
Excuse me.
It fell down.
Is there a some kind of paint in the house?
- Paint?
- Yes.
This environment is monotone.
Do you not see it?
This grew tired.
You know what I had it made with the sentry boxes in the barracks?
"With a red, yellow, blue paint painted they."
Into the boards I had angles beaten in order for it not to be possible to lean against him.
What is your opinion?
Interesting.
Should we paint the walls?
Everything.
Oh it doesn't matter.
Let us continue.
Let the hand move.
He was cut it off his new sock.
He was crying very much.
"How I remembered him, that strike one 8 monthly children."
"I don't know, I already said that Gyula followed away when I took the road from the front line to the station?"
- Really?
- That's right.
I took a liking to that child very much.
"We took a bath, we were drinking beer next in the canteen."
Oh my sweet god.
"Do you hear this, my sweet good Lajos?"
I hear.
Who owns the cuff link...
"And where did it go, eric?"
"We figure that out, we clear jesse, right?"
Or we sink him.
Okay.
Our forensic nurse found evidence
Of forcible sexual intercourse.
But there was no evidence of male contribution.
What does that mean?
It means that your attacker wore a condom.
None of this makes sense.
I know.
"This may be a little strange question to ask,"
"But, um..."
Do you think that tony could've had anything to do with it?
How can you even ask me that?
"Look, tony gets accused of things,"
But...
People don't know him like I do.
I'm just asking because
I was married to someone like him once.
"And, um, I know what that can do to your self-image."
It's not like that with tony and me.
"And I used to defend him, as well."
And I paid a pretty heavy price.
"If, um..."
"I mean, if you ever feel like you want to talk to someone,"
Here's my card.
"Okay, guys."
We're now in a cisco webex meeting.
Are we ready?
"Dave, is this line secure?"
"Listen, Dalton, what do ya have on this?"
"I just got here, Judy."
I don't know...
Give me a break.
"Come on, Dalton..."
You're here.
"It's gotta mean one thing, the exterminator."
"The first one was johnathon minor, age 37, male Caucasian."
"Forty-two arrests for promoting prostitution, assault, rape, white slavery, corrupting the morals of minors."
Lately he specialized in young boys.
He was convicted twice and served a total of 18 months.
"Jesus, it looks like he got hit by napalm."
Most of that's from the burning mattress.
The fireman says it's like that every time someone falls asleep smoking.
Step this way...
I'll show you our next attraction.
Jesus.
Who was he?
He was a state senator from new Jersey.
"Hey, Dalton?"
"Yes, Steve?"
I have the autopsy on the third ghetto ghoul and the print out that you ordered.
I also have a telephone message from the CIA.
- The c.I.A?
- Yeah.
An agent shore called.
"He wants a briefing on the ""the exterminator"" case."
He says he cleared it with the commissioner.
"Here, he left his number."
"- Thanks, Steve."
- All right.
[Phone ringing]
She pays his salary.
"She may let him strut around like boss man, but make no mistake... without his wife, David Harris is a big, fat zero."
Sorry.
"""I have sinned against you..."

"Clara, God""s grace is with you."
- Kiss the children for me.
- I will.
"Son, don""t you worry."
The Lord forgives everybody eventually.
Thank you for saying that.
I made dinner reservations for tonight.
Just the two of us.
Same place we got married.
Where?
"David, at the Bayview."
I like this music.
"You""ve really impressed me, David... the way you""ve handled this like a man."
"Pastor Paul says, as long as you""re completely honest... we can survive this."
"Some celebration, or what?"
"It's my lucky day today, dear witch."
Let's hope it's not the last.
Now nothing can prevent her from making the right choice
Me!
Me!
Me...!
"That's fine, but your star is waning!"
Tomorrow is the third full moon.
Tomorrow is the third full moon.
I can talk and talk and nobody listens to me.
- Nobody believes me.
- Nor me.
But he brought the kerchief that I gave Henry.
How else would he have got it?
"I don't know yet, but we'll find out."
"It's not working, or something."
D'you know why?
Because you're a muddle-pate!
Let go or I'll hit you.
So how did she do it?
I don't know!
"So tell your girl-friend to show you and fast, or Elisa'll die of woe."
We want Elise to see Henry alive and stop dripping tears into the dough.
"Here you are, and make it quick."
"I went to her three times, you know what she said?"
Patience brings roses.
What would I do with roses?
Johann.
Looks nice.
"Is it noon already, Johann?"
"Not yet, but I can't wait."
"""And I'm also going to take a picture."""
And so I took this picture.
"And it was really hot, I tried to show this with..."
With this clumsy coloration.
Clumsy...
A picture can be personally pornographic while being also...
Publically decent.
Wouldn't you say so?
This is my father.
Where is this?
"Between Washington and New York, on the road."
This was one and a half years ago.
I took it because I realized it was...
The way I saw my father...
"Almost all of my childhood, as we travelled..."
"While driving, I always saw him from the back."
I saw his eyes only through the mirror.
I mostly saw his big hands on the wheel.
I trusted him.
Therefore it's a picture...
I mean...
"It's a family picture, a sentimental picture."
A childhood memory.
But it's a childhood memory that isn't in childhood pictures...
That's why I reproduced it.
I mean re-photographing a memory I had.
This isn't a family picture.
It's in Corsica.
It's a pseudo-sunset.
The sunset isn't real.
"The sun wasn't setting, it's here."
The light beams.
"Snap your fingers, you're dead."
We see that every day.
And those people never have time to untangle the knots.
They never have time to prepare themselves.
And so?
And so... the role of the Messengers is to give those people too a chance to be reconciled.
"- ""The Messengers?"""
- Yes.
I don't understand.
There are people out there who know in advance that someone is going to die.
Let's say they...
"""got the message."""
"And in those cases, their job is to help that person depart in peace... reconcile."
"- And you're one of these ""Messengers?"""
"- Yes, I am."
- You know who's going to die?
- Yes.
- You see it?
"- Yes, I see it."
And you help them depart in peace.
"Nathan, I realize it may be hard to believe..."
But Dennis didn't depart in peace.
- No.
- Why?
We don't always succeed.
Sometimes we get there too late.
No one has power over the hour of death.
No one.
I don't believe you.
"Have it your way, Nathan."
But these things can still exist whether you believe in them or not.
I know when someone's going to die...
"Cairo, city of the Lilies, a paradise on earth."
Silence!
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?
Where did this animal come from?
"Ah, oh no..."
"Cute, Ha!"
What an adorable creature.
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
"Well no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me!"
I knew the Germans had hired you Sallah.
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They have hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous!
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It is as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one....
"He's very clever, he's a French archaeologist."
What's he's name?
"They call him ""Bellosh""."
"Belloq, Belloq!"
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the well of souls.
"Well, they are not going to find it without this."
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy...
There is something that troubles me.
What Solomon?
May be I'm a schizophrenic indeed but I can still tell a dream from reality.
If you weren't such a cynic you'd tell what is real and what is not.
If you had just a bit of faith you'd find the key to your problems.
What advice can I give you?
Turn to a doctor or to a prosecutor.
I feel unwell.
A medic!
I have nightmares.
"You're too busy, King."
You should take more rest and enjoy yourself more.
Change your wives more often.
You have the same advice for every cause.
I need a real cure.
There is one effective cure from your illness.
It is a sacrifice to Moloch.
Moloch is waiting for fresh blood.
I am not a pagan.
Moloch is the only one who can help you.
Try it!
"Yes, everything has been performed and signed."
Goodbye.
Whom did you call?
Nobody.
Why aren't you sleeping?
I see Solomon and police in my dreams.
What police?
What Solomon?
You need to have a good sleep.
I'm very tired.
I'll be upstairs.
The cerebral cortex is not damaged.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked."
I've seen your picture in the paper from time to time.
They don't do you enough justice.
But I'm sure you've heard that more than once.
"Thank you, doctor."
And thank you for coming to the house.
"Oh, it's a pleasure, ma'am."
"I'd like you to meet my niece, Samantha Reece."
How do you do?
Pleasure.
Likewise.
Doctor?
"Oh, forgive me."
I was just studying that oil.
It's magnificent.
I think everything about this house is going to be magnificent.
Bad news?
What kind of bad news?
About my record company.
"Someone is buying up large blocks of stock in my company, and I don't like it."
When did all this begin?
Immediately after your party.
When you announced the pipeline deal.
The brokerage house that is handling the deal is located-
Don't tell me.
It's located in California.
"Los Angeles, to be exact."
Were you able to trace down who it was that was buying up that stock?
No.
No.
I haven't been able to find out anything.
It's Jason Colby.
That's...
"I'm flattered, I think."
"But I, uh..."
I can't do that.
"- No, no."
I understand.
- Nothing personal.
"No, I understand."
Just asking purely from a scientific approach.
What about after?
After what?
"The surgery, to see if anything still works."
"I'm gonna have to take a pass on that, too."
"Abby, you want this?"
GSW to the upper chest!
I gotta....
I better get back.
You want to hop on?
"I mean... are you coming to the, uh, for the..."
"Place a chest tube, call me if the initial output's over 500cc's."
How's Grace?
We moved her to one of our exam rooms so we're going to take you to her.
"Mrs. Anderson, I brought some mug books for you to look through."
"It all happened so fast,"
I'm not really sure what I remember seeing.
"Well, take a look."
Maybe a face will jog your memory.
I can't.
- Why don't you give us a few minutes?
- Sure.
I don't want to look at those books.
You might be able to identify the two men who drove you off the road.
Got a place to sleep?
I'll manage.
Don't worry about me.
"What about you, Alain?"
Leslie's in New York.
I won't go.
It's not for me.
I'm not ready.
"Later, maybe."
For now it's painting.
I still have a lot to learn.
It means going back to Kabul.
I know it'll be tough.
The Situationist International arrived at a point in History as the thought of a world collapsing.
It is now occurring before our eyes.
The new era is deeply revolutionary.
and it knows it.
"In all of society, no one can or will continue as before."
We will not submit to what is going on.
The demand of life has become a revolutionary program.
"It's Wolfblood, not werewolf."
We're not monsters.
Could someone live and act as a human but actually be a completely different species?
"On the full moon, do you change in the house?"
In here?
"No, we've got a secure room in the cellar."
The cellar?
"We call it the den, it has everything a wolf desires."
- What you doing?
- Checking Maddy's blood out.
- Do you have to lock me in?
No.
"I'm sorry, he didn't."
May I ask... do you not speak?
He asked me not to.
"Well, that's something you should work on, along with what was going on in my, uh, waiting room."
I can refer you to somebody.
Can she access the applications?
No.
I want agents put on the people with access to the applications and reach out to anyone who remotely meets the killer's criteria.
[Cellphone beeps]
What?
I've never seen you work the field before.
It looks good on you.
We won't be able to get the admission files now.
So maybe we stop.
Maybe it's over.
That's what's wrong with you.
You don't push hard enough.
You're lucky I am in your life.
Why you?
Why bring you back?
And not someone worthwhile?
I asked that question myself.
Something about my DNA makes the process just...
Go.
And you just signed up for it.
"No, I didn't."
They just did it.
"So, it's been nearly two years."
Why are we here?
Your son Kevin was the first... only after we found the others...
We knew it was homicide.
But we had permission
Nobody could permit to have a drinking binge in an unfinished building.
"You are all adults here, you should..."
I knew this would happen.
Shouldn't have lied to people!
"Attention, I am taking it now!"
Smile!
Only hurry up.
"Pavel, I came for you"
"--Hello, Pavel --Hello, Dina"
"--Hello, Pavel --Hello, Dina"
"Pavel, there's a therapist, Sklyansky, a brilliant professor"
"People wait for 2 years to see him, but he agreed to see you now"
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Pavel, I know all your principles, but could you get him into a co-op garage?"
"He's a worthy person, and it's nothing so bad really..."
--With pleasure --Really?
Yes.
This instance.
With great pleasure.
"Pavel...well... get in, let's go"
--I cannot --Why not?
"Dina, I already cured myself"
I used cowberry leaf!
"Galkina, write this down: fire the guard from construction site 3 for negligence"
--Where should I write it down?
--You'll find where
Sorokin's been looking for you
"--Pavel Ivanovich, may I take an hour off?"
--You may not
I wish to knock down my garage with my own hands
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
"Would you like some brandy in that, Father?"
"Well, the doctors say I shouldn't."
But thank God my will is weak.
Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon.
"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous."
He's a liar.
The demon is a liar.
He will lie to confuse us.
But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.
"The attack is psychological, Damien."
And powerful.
So don't listen.
Remember that.
Do not listen.
It might be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.
"So far, I'd say there seem to be three."
-She's convinced that she's--
-There is only one.
"What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil?"
Teresa.
What a lovely name.
Stick your cock up her ass you motherfucking worthless cocksucker.
-Be silent!
-Aah!
"Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be thy name."
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
It's your first real conversation since you arrived here?
Conversation that take place on or around campus and was substantial?
Yes.
Wow.
You must be really lonely.
Can't see your eyes in that hat.
That's better.
Where are you going?
Are your office hours over?
For the time being.
Also they're for people in classes I teach.
"That's not you, is it?"
"No, but I was hoping..."
"No, it's urgent."
"So today we'll be learning about the Romantic period, and the impact of the French Revolution, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and..."
William Godwin and...
Did anyone read it?
We'll be also talking about the... (CHUCKLES) Romantic themes.
"Sorry, the cult of sensibility, emphasizing..."
"Sorry, what were we talking about?"
"Well, this is the most amount of visitors I've ever seen during a single session."
"And on a Friday, no less."
What a world.
One second.
(THUDDING)
Come right in.
"When I was in school, I never went to these things, so..."
I tend to forget about them.
That's okay.
I was hoping we could discuss my story.
Right.
Which I read.
Gives you height.
"Say, what all did you buy, Lottie?"
Nothing really.
[sighs] [exclaims]
"Jane, it's for you."
"On second thought, it's too young for you."
Size 10?
I don't get it.
"Well, you will."
"With this, I'm gonna lose pounds like water."
"Wait, I'll show you."
"All this wouldn't have anything to do with a certain gentleman... whose initials are ""Charles Nash""?"
Where do you get your ideas?
[grunts]
"Now, look, this is what you're supposed to do."
"You're supposed to kind of, like, lasso your feet."
Lasso your feet.
"Like that, see."
And then you pull yourself up.
You're bending your knees.
Shut up.
[snickering]
"Well, I'm glad to see you're feeling better, Mrs. Slocum."
How do you do?
May I help you up?
"Well, I'm not feeling better, I'm not well at all."
I just keep trying.
"That's why I'm here, Mrs. Slocum."
I'm gonna ask you to try to remember if there are any details that you overlooked.
"Like what, for instance?"
"Well, supposing we go through the whole thing again."
Right from the start.
Seth-chan!
Don't think you can do stuff just 'cause you got her all alone!
"Esther is injured, you know!"
As if I would ever-
"Well, I'm off!"
Esther...
Does your injury hurt anymore?
No.
I see...
Esther!
Want to see the view outside?
Yes!
They think that they'll see flowers if only they give water
But the harvest season's over the time has past
Here in the dark I'm sitting'
The answer that soon I'm getting'
How do I know where it comes from?
Just want to feel safe with you
Now let me hear your voice just for once
'Cause you've mixed all my bits
You've grabbed all my soul
You've taken everything over
Now let me hear your voice just for once
You know you can make me smile
You can make me cry and take me out from these nights of longing
It's so beautiful...
What are the buildings on that mountain?
"Oh, that's Sarai."
The palace where the New Human Empire's mother and empress lives.
All of that?
!
Her Majesty is the very embodiment of the mpire.
Are you coming with me or not?
Molech.
"Molech, do you want another drink?"
It's Evan.
No thanks.
Sorry about Dante.
Gene.
They figure out what killed him?
What does it matter?
"He's dead, right?"
There have been people around here asking questions.
"You haven't said anything, have you?"
Of course not.
Good boy!
No thanks
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
"Yeah, well, it didn't do much for Gene."
You don't think this is what killed him?
He was doing a lot.
Yeah and he was sleeping it off in an alley.
Who knows what could have happened to him.
"Hey, I know how we can make each other feel better."
I have a new piercing.
Where are you?
There's evidence to indicate that Gene Hansen died of anaphylactic shock.
The pathologist found an unknown substance in his bloodstream.
"Yeah, an unknown substance."
I need you to be straight with me.
Are you selling drugs here?
I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.
"Coreen, tell her I'm not selling drugs."
"You have to tell her, whichever way it is."
How can one help abhorring these men and their religion?
A pagan would be ashamed of such villainy!
Oh lord.
Oh blessed lord.
Oh blessed lord.
What a generation of vipers do we live among!
You watch!
He'll have him tied to the back of a cart and whipped through the streets.
"I can't say how it goes in england now, but every man deserves a chance to redeem himself."
Like jacob moore.
Jacob moore sealed his fate whatever we do.
How do you plan on getting that to your captain?
You have already chanced one visit to the camp.
I have a messenger in mind.
"I tell ya, lads."
Have no fear.
"I look into the eyes of evil and I come through unscathed, right?"
All of you!
Stop your mumbling about ghosts and demons.
Get to work!
Ya see?
They don't doubt me!
"I don't doubt you eitherer, jacob."
He's been muttering all night.
Something about a man coming to set us free.
It's the fever.
It's healing.
Thank you.
Excuse me!
You're a woman.
"You have a keen eye, mister..."
- crusoe.
"I see, Avdeev."
Do you have problems with the SMERSH?
- lt is them who have problems with me.
- Please specify.
I was drafted with my elder brother.
He was captured and I had no idea about his whereabouts forthree years.
He managed to escape with a group offellow prisoners.
They got to our lines with a lot of arms seized from the enemy.
Theywere lucky.
Theywere arrested.
The arms were confiscated.
They accused my brother oftreason.
I couldn't stand it.
- Can I ask you a question?
- No need forthat.
We are not kamikazes.
The top commanders have set a very difficult battle task to us.
that's why I'm picking up the most experienced soldiers for my company.
"-That's all, you may go."
"-Yes, sir."
"A good guy, isn't he?"
"Listen, private, you'd rather wash yourface.."
And wash your shirt as your senior comrades did.
You are hanging around like...
-Are we preparing for a parade?
"-Well, be it a parade or not a period..."
- but the hygiene is obligatory.
- Fulfil this order!
"Yes, sir."
Nowthe next one.
The next one.
"- Let's have a smoke, folks."
"Now, then, play the whole thing through and play it properly."
"Yes, sir."
Left.!
Left.!
"Left, right, left.!"
"No, no, no!"
That's where we go... down!
"- Oh, it's you again."
"- Yes, I thought it only courteous... to return your visit of last night."
- May I come in?
Thank you very much.
- What do you want?
I just want to talk.
If you'll overlook this informal visit...
I'll forgive you for slighting me in the dining room.
- Spicy little spot you have here.
- I wish you wouldn't follow me.
I'm not following you.
"As much as I'd like to, I'm not following you."
I'm here to do you a good turn— and at the risk of my life too.
Oh!
Very inefficient.
I think you'd better go.
I've had just about enough of this nonsense.
Have you got a license for that machine?
You could be put in jail.
"I was quite aware of that, but don't come any closer."
I can't help it.
You're so irresistible.
- Please don't come near me.
- Would you point that thing away?
There you are.
No.
No.
So...
How you doing?
"Oh, you know, lousy."
"Montezuma's revenge, big time."
"I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tinhorn."
Better not get too close.
"Well, I'll take my chances."
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juárez?
Terrible.
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.
It's like Apocalypse Now down there.
It's like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
"Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?"
"You know, you don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards you send him home."
You know?
"I was, you know..."
"""He's out getting an evidence bag and so ends up without a scratch on him."
"So must be something wrong with that picture, you know."""
So are you home for good then?
"No, no."
It's...
Playing it by ear.
To be determined.
Think you might wanna talk it through with somebody?
"What, a shrink?"
"No, no, no."
Can't go down that road.
"Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye."
"- Unless Mary helps him, of course."
- Of course.
"Rotten for you, Christine."
I got the fright of my life.
Did you see him come after me?
"Writers can do fine things but when they crack up, they're a menace."
"Here, dry your tears."
An emergency.
"Sit down here, I'll phone you a cab."
I'll come back and tell you what Gerard said about you.
- Feeling sad?
- Yes.
Where do you live?
"Let me take you home, I'm going that way."
"- No, they're getting me a cab."
- That'll take ages.
Come on.
- You wind surf?
Any good at it?
"- Yes, out at sea and in the harbor."
- Among the big tankers.
- lsn't that dangerous?
It's child's play.
Want me to teach you?
"No, it's not my sort of thing, but I'll come and film you some time."
"Oh, any time."
"1938, when Sino-Japanese War was like a raging fire."
"And the countries were fighting each other,"
"Atomic fission was first tested by German Scientists, which would lead to the world's destruction."
"If this was exploited by Hitler,"
The entire human race will be annihilated.
Excuse me for barging in on you so soon after a long trip.
That's no problem.
I touched this up on the train back from Kyoto.
"You may not find it suitable for a textbook, but here you go."
When can I get paid?
Soon.
"Scholars don't live on air, you know."
We'll get it to you as soon as we can.
"Come to think of it, would you send it to my school?"
Huh?
"Oh, I understand."
You have to put more expression into it.
"Ah, they're dancing."
"Yes, I'll go tell her you're home."
"Like this, see."
Mother!
Father's here!
Oh?
"Shinako, go say hello to your father."
"Namiko, are you asleep?"
Excuse me.
"That kimono looks really good on you, Mother."
Is that right?
I'll tell you about clothes.
"Before the war, lacquer and colourful prints sold really well."
That's right.
Those are luxury goods.
"If a woman wore a luxurious kimono during the war, a woman exposed her asarakasa."
It would have been the picture of vulgarity.
"Father, you have a morning lecture, don't you?"
"Yes, but go on ahead."
I see.
- Right.
"Okay, well, I'm gonna go."
This is long distance.
"Yeah, it is long distance."
"So, see you."
Yeah.
See you.
Mom?
What's wrong?
I'm experiencing frustration.
At the general state of things in the world or something in particular?
What do you wear to a graduation?
- A cap and gown.
- I mean underneath.
Whatever you want.
The gown will cover it.
It's complicated.
I don't want to overdress... so I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium.
"But if I don't have enough on and it's cold, I'll freeze."
"It is complicated, especially if you over think it."
I need a helpful comment.
Take light layers.
Wear your turquoise-and-tan dress you just got.
It's cool and it will look good without your gown on.
Wear your turquoise sweater over it.
It will look great with the dress... and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium.
- You are a fashion genius.
- You taught me everything.
- My brain's not working.
- You're excited.
It's a big day.
What time will you get there?
"When I think about my vocation,"
"Say it: ""whores""."
one should...
Life doesn't scare me anymore.
Put them down?
"Here's the only Venom still alive, the untouchable, the only one that never touched me."
The one that lights the match!
I don't want the penguins splattered in ketchup.
Especially not in front of the fuzz.
"Enjoy your meal, gentlemen!"
"""Ministers of Integrity""!"
"Thank you, show's over."
It's not over for me.
You gave me a theater as payment for a quickie.
"I resented you, and went crazy about that innocent."
"He burst out of his Hungarian shithole, out of his mind, then began fucking things up for everyone."
The innocent is a dog.
I bought him back from this harlot
- I was wrong.
Do you still want me?
I want everything.
"Whereever you want, whenever you want."
As long as it's now.
"And I want him to see it, OK?"
Search him.
The wax of the seventh seal drips on the butcher's fingers.
The lamb is ready.
"Here, if you please - same as them."
Am I frightening you?
Lower.
Where it's real.
Where it smells.
"Well, if I'm afraid, I'll call on you, you little slut."
Small since when?
I'm plenty grown up!
"More than is good for you, right?"
Not at all!
But I'm already outgrowing the clothes...
Everyone can tell that.
See for yourself!
Have a look.
"Well, what's already there..."
Don't be so sure.
- If you've set yourself up here...
"- Stop it, ok?"
"Can I come visit then, Bruno?"
This is no children's playground!
Can I have a drag?
Why are you shaking like that?
Give it back!
Just what I'd need - have people say that I seduced a minor into smoking.
Come over here...
What do you want?
Come here already!
It's my sister!
Take care that you're not caught here!
Maybe one could stretch a few clothes lines from pillar to pillar?
Or across here...
"Or at right angles so that the whole thing would get more class, become slightly more stylish."
So that things are not hanging around here like... in a pawnshop.
There are more 100 valuable costumes here.
He wants to unpack his stuff.
All the baskets?
Termination!
You are not in the position to ask for anything.
We will take what we wish.
And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.
I'm sure your führer would approve.
"If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish."
I will waste no more time with her now.
Excuse me.
"I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain."
I've looked everywhere.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Look again.
-I found him.
-Where?
There.
"The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir."
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.
Monsieur...
I am uncomfortable with the thought of this...
Jewish ritual.
Are you sure it's necessary?
Let me ask you this:
"Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your führer?"
"Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?"
"Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?"
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
"I'm going to blow up the Ark, Rene."
Your persistence surprises even me.
It's mine.
Soon we will welcome Turkey
In the embrace of the European Union.
"We Belgians, finding us in the heart of Europe,"
We will celebrate this historic occasion
Giving the Turkish people our most beloved Mini-Europa Park.
He has already sent me eleven messages.
I do not know how I can do my job while I'm following this documentary.
The Queen would not cancel her because of her annual cold.
Sire.
"If you allow me,"
Mr. Bulut told me the evening program.
"At 18, show of dancing dervishes."
"No speech, just a few words."
"I remember not to mention Iraq, Syria, Israel, the Kurds, Armenia,"
"Our federal problems, our debt,"
"And, above all, football."
It is a delicate topic.
The gala dinner will start at 8pm.
Nine courses.
No kebabs?
One two Three.
"Mr Moreau, are you sorry?"
Thank you.
And action.
"Sire, the press conference will begin at 11pm at Miniatiürk."
"His speech, sire."
The Prime Minister has made some changes.
"I remember that in Turkey, the handshakes are energetic."
It's even shorter.
Brussels insisted on brevity.
"Clearly, a consequence of my speech in Scotland."
# We'll always be dancin' #
# And singin' it loud #
# Aah # Ahh # # Ahh # # Ahhhh #
Here he comes!
# I like havin' fun #
# In the hot summer sun #
# And grooving to the beat #
# When my homework is all done #
# If you ask me what I know... #
Who the hell is that?
That's Bridon Gueermo.
"He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody!"
He's already seen High School Musical 3 over 100 times!
#... everyone is special in their own way #
# Special in their own way #
# Let it out party people #
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
"Yeah, I guess we better check that movie out."
# You got to go with the status quo #
# If you wanna be a regular joe #
# Come on now #
# And your dreams are only a beat away #
# Don't let 'em tell you no #
# You got to go with the status quo #
# Keep singin' about the status quo #
# That's the phrase we know #
# Get down now... #
This... is cool?
# Sing about what we know #
This is cool?
"We are really getting old, you guys."
# Goin' with the status #
In what way?
Never mind.
JONATHAN:
You seem to have a decent situation here.
This place is just fine.
Yeah.
You do not need to look away every time you see me.
This is your father that I saw you with earlier?
He's my uncle.
Mononcle.
Like the film.
You look sad with him.
I don't think you're saying what you think you are.
I meant to say...
"When with him, it makes you look as though you are not happy."
Oh.
I guess that's pretty much what you said the first time.
Why this is?
Your own family makes you unhappy?
I feel uncomfortable talking to you like this.
Why?
Because we don't like each other.
Or you don't like me.
It's not like that.
I mean...
"Okay, it's true that I am upset that"
"I study for years to obtain a teaching degree, and you..."
You just publish two slim novels and get a job many would murder for.
"I, however, think it is possible we could be friendly together."
You encouraged the faculty to turn on me.
Nobody likes me here.
Nobody ever talks to me.
Out here?
-Help me!
Help me get her in.
"Okay, come on."
"Come on, come on, come on."
What happened?
-ls she dead?
-She will be if you don't hurry the fuck up.
I understand that. I'm not a fool.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Who are you working for?
(breathing LOUDLY)
I used to work for the same righteous pricks who twisted your life.
Now I work for the other side.
Just as twisted but they pay a lot more.
"They break us, you know."
Turn us into these awful things.
Broken pieces.
They push us.
Make us into men we're not.
And then complain when we no longer function.
They think we should live like this is normal.
"Like this is how we should behave, how we should think."
And our reward for this life?
We try to run away and they kill us because of what they forced inside our heads.
You think men like that deserve to live?
They deserve everything they got coming.
Maybe.
Did you stop the broadcasts?
Yeah.
Why?
Some fleeting virtue in not being a mass murderer.
You always seem to get what you want in the end.
The only thing I want in the world is you.
That's why-- why I texted Denise:
"because I want to be a part of your life,"
- all parts of your life.
- Uh-huh.
"Well, your methodology is disqualifying."
I'm so-
- I'm s--
I'm sorry--
You traumatized my daughter.
You traumatized me in the process.
We have no future together.
"If you never believe anything I say again, believe that."
Hey.
"If you care anything about what's left of your little family unit, you might want to tell your ex-husband to cry uncle because when I get done with him..."
It's just difficult to destroy dads without daughters becoming collateral damage.
"Sometimes ex-wives, too."
Fuck you.
Finally.
You get stuck in the stairwell?
Move.
Let's look at the arrest report.
[chatter]
Man:
Yeah.
I'm on it.
You did all this?
It's impressive.
I hope my daughters grow up to be this capable.
"You're a great lawyer, Lucy, with a great future."
But not everybody is cut out for trial work.
"I was too worked up,"
"So I made a few phone calls, I organized the junk drawer,"
And then I fired off an e-mail to the principal
About ms.
Rinsky.
You did what now?
Don't worry.T's good.
You wanna hear it?
Mm-hmm.
I made some very good points.
"""dear principal Larimer,"
"""I'm writing to bring to your attention"
"An issue of concern for me as a parent."" huh?"
"""it regards one of your teachers... ms."
Rinsky.
"""I have tried repeatedly to have an open dialogue with her"
"""about my son's education,"
"""but she has been completely uncaring and dismissive."
"""today, more than ever,"
"Don't we need teachers who are caring and missive?"""
"okay, that might not be the right word, but wait."
It gets better.
Okay.
"""her teaching skills in math don't add up."""
"Mm. ""Maybe 'cause when she was born"
"The numbers only went up to ten."" oh."
Mm.
"I don't remember writing that, but..."
"""if you want to schedule a parent-teacher conference"
"""with her, good luck."
"""your best bet is scheduling it with the bartender"
At beefsteak Charlie's.
I'll hold back the watchman.
I'd kiss my love for one last time.
Then follow you at once.
Do not be late.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who's within?
"Just one kiss, in case some venom lingers on your lips."
Your mouth is warm.
I will explain.
The boy has come here at my bidding.
Somebody's coming.
Then I'll be brief.
"Oh, happy dagger."
This is thy sheath.
There rust... and let me die.
Patience now.
We should not disturb this holy quiet.
- Show me the way!
"- Very well, very well."
If you insist.
"We know now how this sorrow came about, and pardon all the players in their end."
Their own forbidden love did murder them.
Yet can we take a lesson from their deaths.
"Capulet, Montague."
"See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, that heaven finds means to kill your joy with love."
"Oh, dearest Montague."
Give me your hand.
"The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head."
And join with all in grieving for the dead.
"For never was a story of more woe than this, of Juliet and her Romeo."
That's gotta wear on a man.
That's no excuse.
I let my guard down.
"Hey, you know me, Chris."
I ain't afraid of dying.
"I just don't want to go out like that, strung up like some mangy dog."
I ain't gonna let that happen.
"Oh, no."
"You go messing with a federal marshal, they'll string you up right alongside me."
Chris.
Larabee.
Chris.
"Gentlemen, can you not picture this becoming..."
... thefinestentertainmentemporium in the entire territory?
All I can picture right now is them fixing to take Vin away and hang him.
"Now, son, don't fret."
"Besides, when we rescue him we'll need a fitting place to celebrate."
"So, what say you, boys?"
Are you ready for success?
NATHAN:
"I don't know, Ezra."
"My daddy used to say, ""Best horse you ever saw..."
"... wasasgoodasthemanriding ."""
Pure wisdom.
"Good morning, Luce."
"How have you been, Buck?"
I've missed you.
"All due respect, it doesn't look like you've been missing meals, there, Lucy."
[LUCY giggles]
"Well, it happens when you're going to have a baby."
Hoo!
-Sweet Lucy's gonna have a baby.
- I thought you didn't do that anymore.
"No, that was the new Seth Cohen."
"I'm back, Ryan."
"Cohen Classic, red, white, and me, come on."
Hang in there.
I won't be gone long.
- Did the light of dawn make any of this a little easier to take?
"- Harder, actually."
- So what are you going to do?
- I'll tell you this.
- I'm not going back to the office.
"I may tolerate Julie as my stepmother, but I will not suffer the indignity of her being"
"- Well, there's a concept."
"- Come on. you and me, a couple of bathrobes and black socks?"
- The thought of that is so...
- Liberating.
- Scary.
- Forget the black socks.
"Barefoot, baby, barefoot."
- I can't be unemployed.
I-I can't even take a vacation for more than a we
"- A vacation with you is no vacation, what with the itineraries and the sightseeing."
- I just...
I can't have worked this hard
I don't know.
Can't quit.
Can't go back there.
"Well, I don't know, either."
What I do know is...
I'm not the one you should be telling this to.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Can you imagine Rickie in a high-security prison.
- Who'd supply his make up?
- Do you think it might be possible...
you not make everything into a joke.
"Angela, there is nothing to worry about."
"Harlin, this guy Tino knows, he's been busted with a gun..."
twice and nothing ever happened.
It's no big deal.
You know what I'd really like?
To be put out of my misery.
- Are you kidding?
This is fun.
- Fun?
Everyone running around all upset and rumors flying.
Can't you feel it in your fingers and your toes?
It's like being alive.
It is such a rush.
- You're out of your mind.
- Last year?
That rumor about me and Mark Hammer in the orchestra pit...
during the talent show?
"In that case it was true, but..."
"man, all that conversation."
People writing notes.
"They look at you different, like, trying to figure out who you really are."
Like you're famous.
Admit it.
It's really great.
I don't know what you are talking about.
"Come in, gentlemen."
"So, Mr. Krakow?"
I thought a lot about what you said.
And you are never gonna believe where she works.
"(whirring, rhythmic beeping)"
(tires screech)
"Yes, I can confirm that one Amanda Baylor is in the hiz-ouse."
"Very unattractive, in case you're wondering."
"By the way, are you aware of a little film called The Graduate?"
Mike Nichols.
Fantastic.
"""Would you like me to seduce you?"""
"Wait, what?"
Were you quoting the movie or was that real?
Where's Baylor?
Secure encryption room.
She's in the middle of a 72-hour shift.
"Logged in 14.5 hours ago, before I got here."
"Once an encryptor goes in, they don't come out-- department policy."
Probably well on the way to being ripe in there.
Did you know that your hair sparkles under these fluorescents?
Really?
How much does it sparkle?
So much.
So much?
"So, so much."
Open it.
Can't.
"No in, no out."
Encryptors even have their own private commode.
There's a lot of confidential crap in there.
Here.
"I can make sure you don't lose your job, but there might be something else we could talk about you losing."
I've decided to open it.
Thank you.
"Right, I'd like to get started right away."
Of course.
"Sara, would you get the neutrotope, please?"
Sorry.
It's a natural reaction.
"Right, I'll get back to you as soon as I can."
You're quite sure about volunteering to stay?
We must help these people.
Must we?
"Personally, I don't care if their whole planet turns into a mushroom."
I shall stay because I don't like an unsolved mystery.
You don't think Dortmunn and his life rocket are the answer?
- No.
- Why not?
There is something else that has to happen before it all begins to come together.
Thank you.
You'd better give me your guns.
- Don't fail us.
- I won't.
"Vila, bring me up."
"My people have a saying, ""A man who trusts can never be betrayed, only mistaken""."
Life expectancy must be fairly short among your people.
- 3210?
- Check.
32100?
- Where are Cally and Avon?
- It's a long story.
- What's in the box?
- It's an even longer story
I like stories!
"Zen, get a locator fix on the other ship."
I want to be able to pinpoint its position at all times.
"I would have preferred him to be guilty, but alive."
This hanging is a horrible story.
It's not our fault.
We should have better monitored him.
"You, especially."
"You're my assistant, right?"
I can not have eyes everywhere.
"So when the judge will be here, be available to him."
With deference.
"Otherwise, you will return to ""La Santé"" jailhouse."
If you knew the trouble I was given to be posted here.
This is an entry permit.
Mr Fandor?
"It is unfortunate that the procurator authorizes a journalist, especially today."
I know you really want to kiss your brother but will you be able to endure the test?
Open the door.
Nibet.
"We lay back Mr Dollon on his bed, Mr judge."
He seems to sleep.
"Damn, the dead has left."
"Listen, let's be serious,"
- you're in the wrong cell.
- But no!
You see that he is not here.
He was here a few minutes ago.
You're fooling us..
He was moved elsewhere.
Impossible.
I'm the only one with keys.
Anyone know where the corpse from cell 12 is?
No one came.
The dead was here.
Won't every day start fresh for you?
He's Devadas...no he's Kalidas...
This is fine for us...
We've memory loss...
Hey Babe!
My heart will never stop...
"Isn't this loss, a big profit for us, boss?"
"No battles or wars or without history, this life is a curse..."
"So my dear, buddy..."
This life is not a curse but a big boon...
Oh God!
I'm stuck!
Is memory loss a boon to you?
I feel...
Hey stay out!
I'll kill you...
"bloody, I'll kill you..."
Let's escape!
"Is she so angry on me, bloody bitch?"
Why did you beat him severely?
I should've killed him.
He's happy forgetting the past.
Enjoying life.
"While falling in love, he was happy, while in love, he was happy, even in separation, he's happy."
Is forgetting past a boon?
"Bloody, I'll kill him..."
Sister!
"You beat him, right?"
Leave him.
I'll not leave him simply.
What will you do?
"I'll make him remember our past, I'll make him remember our love, when he remembers everything, I'll marry Kalyankrishna then."
(laughter and applause)
"Our final round, ladies and gentlemen, as ever, is a dazzlingly dispiriting display of general ignorance."
"Fingers hovering over your mushroomoid-style buzzers now, please, and let's see if we can give Alan a run for his money."
"So, question one, who was the first man to circumnavigate the globe?"
(doorbell)
- Magellan.
- Magellan!
"- Oh, dear!"
Oh!
- (alarm bells)
- What have I done?
"- Magellan is the howler, I'm afraid."
I'm sorry.
"- What do you mean, no?"
Ring him.
"- No, he wasn't."
He wasn't the first.
Magellan was killed in the Philippines halfway round.
He never finished.
He never finished.
His ship was the first to.
"The laurels go to his second in command, the almost completely unknown J S Elcano, aka Juan Sebastian del Cano."
"I don't suppose they'll rename the Magellan Straits the del Cano Straits, but nonetheless, it's good to help out people who've been deprived by history."
"So, what was the nationality of the inventor of the helicopter?"
- British.
"- (Stephen) British, you think?"
"No, not correct."
- (express train whistles)
- Italian?
Oh!
"Italian, he said!"
"Oh, we thought you might say that."
- Hi.
- Thank you.
You'll like it.
It's nice.
Good fries.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks."
What?
This place all right?
"So, Fiona, how are you?"
"- I mean, how are you feeling?"
- My stomach's fine.
Great.
"I must still be a bit barmy, though."
"This kind of thing doesn't go away overnight, does it?"
No.
"If Mum was going to get Will to marry her, she'd have to quit making jokes like that."
At least she looked good.
I had her put on that nice hairy jumper  and the earrings she got from her friend that went to Zimbabwe.
The kid seemed to think this was some kind of date.
"As for his mum, she was clearly insane  and appeared to be wearing some kind of Yeti costume."
This had better be quick.
We were definitely not ordering starters.
"I'll start with the artichoke, please."
Then I'll have a mushroom omelet with fries and a Coke.
- I'll have the vegetable platter.
- We're vegetarians.
I'd never have guessed.
"Steak sandwich, please, mate."
Thanks.
Don't just sit there.
Talk to each other.
With each round trip to The bluff costing thousands...
Let's go ahead and get That anchor set.
Shawn can't afford To come up empty again.
Anchors away!
It's the only miles I can hike today underwater.
"So today, he's hoping to Get maximum mobility underwater."
By trying something new...
Harnessing a mini-dredge And oxygen supply to his back.
"Hopefully, we didn't come out Here, spend all this time."
And money for nothing.
"If there's gold on the claim, I'm gonna know about it today."
On the bottom.
Big boulders.
Big boulders.
Copy?
"Okay, I got you."
Copy.
How's the visibility?
Good.
Just go ahead And cut me loose.
"Okay, shawn, I've cut you loose."
That's good.
I'm working my way over here.
There's a lot.
I cut the dredge loose From the pier.
So the dredge can go away From this big boat.
And we can stay on anchor And safe.
And look how far he just Walked.
"He just walked 50, 80 feet."
"Free from any constraints,"
Shawn marches along the Seafloor At depths of over 25 feet.
Not seeing anything here.
- A first date like a game show.
- I didn't mean to lecture.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call it a date."
It's just rare that I meet a person I can discuss these things with.
- Some pepper?
"- No, not for me."
Could you bring me a side dish of extra dressing please?
"I don't particularly like salad, I just like the dressing."
Ah.
"This twin-prime conjecture, it's interesting."
Are there still pairs like that past a million?
I can't believe you thought of that.
That is what is to be proven.
I have concert tickets next Saturday.
I was wondering if we can do this again.
- Sure.
- Great.
Terrific.
What was it you wanted to discuss about my teaching?
I have a confession to make.
That was just an excuse to meet you.
I hope you don't mind.
Mind?
I found it interesting.
"I have many questions, the first of which is, how do you get them to stay?"
Well?
- Nothing.
- What happened to your hair?
Don't ask.
- You won't be seeing him again?
- We're going out next week.
"So, he must like you."
Very well done.
- No.
No.
Isabel!
- Roderick?
"- Please, no!"
- Roderick.
"Roderick, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
- After all the girls I brought through this place you owe me.
I want the Porter girl.
- One would wonder if you had her admitted to have your way with her.
- I've always loved that girl.
- Let's say we revisit the topic of Isabel Porter's future after tomorrow night's event.
- Hmm.
Fine.
How's the exposure?
Should be fine.
- I want her to hear it from you.
I fear she has too strong of a connection to my voice.
- I'm a surgeon.
- It's not a request.
- Fine.
You are Mary Bradbury.
You are awaiting trial for witchcraft and immorality of the highest order.
"Mary Bradbury, you are accused of crimes most heinous."
Admit that you are wrong and repent or you will be condemned to murder by hanging.
"But of course what interests me, my dear, is how an evolution in identity can manifest itself in the amygdala."
"But then again, a tree is still a tree, is it not?"
"- Mm, Gunther."
"- You need to eat, Mary."
- Please... help me.
But any more griping from ya and I'll put you out of your misery.
Understood?
"Oh, fresh water."
We should be heading farther inland.
"And if I wanted your opinion, captain taylor, I'd have asked for it."
"I'll have you hanged for this, moore."
Not if I put a hole through your skull first you won'T.
"Jacob, he's a valuable hostage."
Do you seriously propose to throw away an asset like the captain?
Take him back to the beach!
You're asking me?
If you're so pleased.
This way.
Mutineers.
"Friday, that's an english ship."
That means escape.
But it commandeered by mutineers.
What if the captain and his crew were reinstated?
"That is a very big ""if"" under these circumstances."
The crew is circled.
The captain is wounded and the mutineers are at least 25 strong.
What are those?
Where?
There.
Womenfolk.
Must be the captain's wife and daughter.
Your womenfolk are shaped like bells.
No wonder you went to sea.
Then we have to know that the captain would be on our side before we try anything.
Come on!
No stopping!
Push it!
"No, I only stopped by to--"
We were discussing something quite different.
"All right, never mind."
"Oh, put them right over there."
Has anyone else been here this evening?
Anyone called?
Just Enos Watterton.
He wanted to make sure you got away all right.
- I didn't know then you'd missed the train.
- Enos Watterton?
- Oh.
- Sandy-
"- Sandy, if you won't tell me, will you please tell Perry what's been upsetting you so lately?"
"I mean, that's part of the reason I wanted to talk to him."
"Oh, for heaven's sakes, Beth, I don't care what you do."
- Sandy!
"- Driver, wait."
"Taxi, taxi!"
[jazz playing]
"Sellers, Sellers."
[phone ringing]
Yes?
Who?
"Oh, Sandy--"
Ha!
"Well, I guess we all miss a train once in a while."
"I'll catch the first plane in the morning, sir."
The only reason I bothered you was to double check to make sure that I have all the papers they'll need in Phoenix.
What?
"I mean in the briefcase, sir."
I had the impression that you put everything in there yourself and--
"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't actually."
Quick debrief to discuss the coincidence of four ice villains attacking on the same day.
We shouldn't be long.
COMPUTER:
"Recognized Batman, zero two."
"Aquaman, zero six."
"Flash, zero four."
"Green Arrow, zero eight."
"Martian Manhunter, zero seven."
"Red Tornado, one six."
SPEEDY:
That's it?
"You promised us a real look inside, not a glorified backstage pass."
It's a first step.
You've been granted access few others get.
"Oh, really ?"
Who cares which side of the glass we're on?
"Roy, you just need to be patient."
What I need is respect.
They're treating us like kids.
"Worse, like sidekicks."
We deserve better than this.
"You're kidding, right?"
You're playing their game?
Why?
Today was supposed to be the day.
Step one in becoming full -fledged members of the League.
"Well, sure."
But I thought step one was a tour of the H.Q.
Except the Hall isn't the League's real H. Q.
I bet they never told you.
It's a false front for tourists and a pit stop for catching Zeta Beam teleporter tubes to the real thing an orbiting satellite called the Watchtower.
"I know, I know."
"I mean, if it's too complicated for you, and your kids and your divorce and your..."
And not to mention your presidential bid.
We can honestly just pretend that last night never happened.
"I mean, no."
Not that it wasn't memorable...
"I mean, it was."
It was...
"You know, it was great."
But...
"But if you don't think this will definitely work, you're probably right."
"Well, there's just one problem."
I like you.
Oh!
Great!
You like me.
"So, what does that mean?"
We get to hold hands at Cindy Burke's Roller Rink party?
"No, I was thinking maybe dinner."
Maybe sushi.
"I don't rent out entire restaurants, unlike some people."
"Oh, no."
He...
"Actually, he owns it."
My point being...
"People are gonna see us, Kitty."
And I want you to know that I won't be caring.
Previously on Brothers and Sisters:
You're gonna buy my interest in Ojai Foods.
Holly and I are going to take the proceeds from the sale of the stock and buy Greendale Winery.
Sex will replace my drug addiction with...
After rehab you're sworn to celibacy?
It's a distraction for him.
Can you imagine the pressure that he's under?
"Plus, it means that Patty... whatever her name is is going to have to bear more of the burden, which is great."
She's never tried a case.
You've never tried a case.
I didn't go to Laverne Law School.
Wow.
"Look at you, so confident."
- [click]
- Lucy:
Thank you.
So McBride is going to file for a continuance.
It would be malpractice not to.
And I say that we oppose it strongly.
- Are you sure about that?
- Absolutely.
"Every single day that this case drags on,"
"Borns Tech is vulnerable to a decline in stock value, and that makes America vulnerable."
"I mean, letting a nobody like Billy McBride hold up a great corporation with a frivolous and ridiculous lawsuit?"
"It's not just wrong, it endangers everything that matters to our c-c... c-c-c... c-c... [deep inhale] country."
[exhale]
Ahem.
"Lucy, do you need me to fill a prescription for you?"
F-- [chuckle]
I'm fine.
Yeah.
You seem...fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I swear.
I'm fine.
Man:
You didn't call!
- Don't come here and intimidate me!
I waited all day.
Who are you?
How can you stand yourself?
"We tried to contact you several times, but we couldn't find you."
Come on.
You're filthy rich.
You could have hired an army.
It abviously took more than an army to find you.
To find a junkie drinking in India with hookers.
You hid my daughter for 20 years because I cheated once?
"Do you really think that's why, Jacob?"
Because you cheated once?
You're a very small person.
- What are you telling me?
- You're not listening.
- Then tell me.
Tell me!
- Let's all calm down a little.
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?
- We'd have figured something out.
- I didn't know until I got back.
I met Jørgen and...
"No, Jacob, I don't owe you anything."
You don't owe...
Aren't we talking about your daughter?
- Shouldn't she know her father?
"- She has a father, a good father."
I don't know what the hell to say.
What you did is so wrong.
"You know that, right?"
Move out of the way.
You.
"Yes, you."
Get out.
"This is private property, get off it now."
Move!
Who let him in here?
Do you have any idea who that is?
That's Vigol from The Daily Mail.
All he's responsible for is stirring up trouble and writing malicious gossip like that bloody curse story.
Communication with the press is only allowed with The Times.
I will not tolerate any exceptions.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes.
- Where are you going?
"- Home, Howard."
I'm not a schoolboy.
CARNARVON:
Are you looking forward to the opening?
Everything's ready.
I've emptied it all out apart from the two guardian statues.
- I thought they should stay.
- Why not?
"You will cover up our little hole, won't you?"
I wouldn't want Lacau seeing that.
I wish we could get rid of that bloody man.
"But we have to deal with him, we mustn't forget that."
Try a little flattery.
Always works with the froggies.
You know you should never have signed that deal with The Times.
It's only made matters worse.
I thought it was what you wanted.
We mean get arrested by the store detective.
It was just a pun.
We have every intention of paying for this item.
"Ooh, Eddie, it'd be funny if somebody knocked that lot down."
"Not particularly, no."
I'm disappointed myself.
"Come, Eddie, for fruit."
It is the absolute sophis thing to offer fruit after the meal.
So refreshing and it comes in handy for the sex games.
"No, not this."
"Look, ridiculous."
"Oh, this is disgusting."
All this fruit is crushed and bruised.
I shall write to Esther Rantzen.
"- Ah, the meat, Eddie."
- Ha.
Load up the trolley.
They'll have been playing golf
- so they'll be ready for hearty vitals.
- Look at this little lamb chop.
"It was probably once a pig, gambolling in the mountains."
Yeah.
"Doingy, doingy, doing."
I could quite fancy myself as a farmer.
"Well, it's a good job you do fancy yourself cos I can't see that anyone else is going to do it."
"Eddie, do you see this frozen chicken?"
"Er, yes."
"Oh, urh."
Frozen tackle might teach you not to cheek me.
"Richie Rich, do you see this frozen chicken?"
- No.
- I think you do.
And you need to trust me.
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
But you inherited me.
You didn't...
see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
"And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal -- they were fake."
Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
And I wondered -- did they even care how many people die?
This administration -- the stuff they get away with makes me sick.
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
"Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those... kids that died."
Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
Thank you.
Pushing more dye.
"Oh yeah, there we go."
Look at the shape there.
All squished up like a Takotsubo vase.
like a Takotsubo vase.
"See that, that's textbook."
"Um, Nik..."
"What you got baby, you got a broken heart."
"- Oh Sam, don't..."
"- No, baby."
"No, I'm serious, baby."
You have stress cardiomyopathy.
"Yeah, it's also called broken heart syndrome."
"It's associated with sudden, intense emotional or physical stress."
The muscles around your heart took such a beating when you got the news about Stephanie that they're just having a hard time keeping up now.
You really do have a broken heart.
But we can treat this.
"I can't lie to you, we've got to go through this entire night incident-free."
"If we can do that, you're gonna be fine."
Hey!
We need a doctor!
What the hell happened?
Kid started complaining of a sore throat in the car.
"- Started wheezing, choking..."
- Let's get him on the bed.
Pike!
No verbal or motor responses.
What the hell is...
That's bruising around his neck!
Looks fresh.
Sats at 90 and falling.
Don't you remember what you used to say to me?
You swore you'd wait for me.
"She was convenient for you, wasn't she, because she was here."
You took very good care of Mother and Zina.
Very good care.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
I'll leave you to each other.
Are you alright?
"Yes, thank you."
"Oh, wait."
Take me to the police station.
Your name?
Clementi Sabourin.
What do you want?
I have some valuable information.
Information?
Concerning whom?
"Concerning a very rich man... who is in this country illegally, forged papers."
I'm sure you'll know what to do with his very considerable assets.
Anything we impound goes to the government.
Naturally.
What's this man's name?
"If I tell you, I want the necessary papers to take me to America."
If you are telling the truth... it will be arranged.
Alright.
He's living here under the name of Gerry Monte.
His real name is Sabourin.
He's originally from Czechoslovakia.
He runs a little antique shop near the Porta San Giuseppe.
Treasures stolen from all over the world.
Thank you.
"but I'm here now, dear."
Mother.
So I sent you here to wed a king
And find you engaged to a bastard.
"My darling, your engagement"
To francis was a careful negotiation set in place
When you were six.
And now you tell me
That you threw it all away because of a prophecy.
"One I believe, mother."
I did this and bash went along with it to save francis's life.
From a fate a magician predicted.
"Mother, it's all very..."
Complicated.
And we haven't been together in so long.
I came to the convent for your 11th birthday.
"Half the ship's crew died along the way,"
But I was there.
Gift in hand.
I only meant to say that...
I've missed you.
"And I wanted to talk to you about this, about francis,"
"About bash, a-about everything."
Please don't make light of nostradamus's warning
Or my choice.
I make light of nothing concerning you
Or our country's future.
Perhaps if you met bash.
He's-he's kind and-and selfless and brave.
Do you love him?
I'm beginning to.
It all happened so fast.
I'm out of gas and so is he.
If I don't get him into a bed his UTI's turning into urosepsis.
I got to make water!
"Yo, doc!"
- You are one sadistic bitch.
- Now give me your middle finger.
I would if I could.
Any emergency meetings get scheduled?
"Just one, about this spate of ER closures in the area."
I've advised the board that preliminary figures show an increase in our patient load by 34 percent.
- Who'd you take to La Scala's?
- Sorry?
Which board member's ass are you kissing?
- Now the ring finger.
"- Robert, I simply compiled a report."
- Nerve regeneration's a millimeter a week.
- I'm not kissing ass.
It's not my dominant hand.
"In fact, I only agreed to take on your responsibilities out of necessity."
I'll be in my office in two weeks...
- ... and back in the OR in two months.
- I hope you are.
Thought about upping your Vicodin?
Ibuprofen.
I want to stay clear-headed.
- That's enough for today.
"- No, keep going."
"Sorry, have another patient."
"Don't get comfortable, Kerry."
- Is there anything else?
- Just your continued support.
Lizzy.
You keep talking to me for no reason.
Did you lose it?
You can't retrieve it?
Moon Kwon.
Yes?
"When I completed the manuscript for the autobiography yesterday, didn't I send it?"
"You must have, you said you were."
"You sent that, made some fried eggs and we had one each."
They didn't get it?
It disappeared?
"Fine, all right."
Emails are now not only arriving late but disappearing?
No way.
I didn't send it.
There's no record.
"Noona, what's wrong with you?"
Why do you keep forgetting things?
"Stop taking the painkillers, I think that's the problem."
"I sent it, please check."
Change my phone number.
"You said you could do it through the homepage, right?"
"Yes, but why?"
When I tell you to do something just do it.
Do you have to know everything?
You do that too.
"All right, all right."
"I'll shut my mouth and complete my task,"
I have no complaints!
"Change your clothes and wash up, I'm hungry."
Let's eat some curry.
What did you say?
"I made some curry and rice, didn't you hear?"
"- No, no."
- She gets defensive.
"- No, I don't get defensive."
- I'm not defensive.
I'm not!
- She gets defensive.
Ladies.
"I am gonna meet with you before every date, and we're gonna check your clothes, your makeup."
To make sure you're projecting the right image.
Based on the bachelors.
We'll go over mutual areas of interest.
"Now, I have been going over your questionnaire and it seems like your priorities are..."
Huh...
"Well, looks."
"Oh, no."
"That doesn't sound like you, Kitty."
"No, it's me."
It's me.
It's me.
"Well, sweetheart, looks fade."
"You want someone intelligent, who'll make you laugh."
"And cultured, so you can travel with him."
- Go to the theater.
- Since when do I go to the theater?
"You know, Miss Walker, I just signed a client who sounds exactly like the man you're describing."
"He's charming, funny."
I think he's about your age.
"Never married, so he's not bitter."
And he's an accomplished ballroom dancer.
I think he would love to meet you.
Know what?
You'd be doing me a huge favor.
- He's a saint.
sublime.
He'II even stay that way if you don't marry him.
"Yes, well, there's no danger of that."
The count won't divorce me.
"Since I Ieft him, he won't even allow me to see the children."
"well, now you've begun a new family."
"still, I prefer to be married."
I know you thumb your nose at all that.
It's funny.
I thought I'd die of suffocation when I was married.
Now it's my freedom that's killing me.
(baby cries)
Sophie!
"tell me, have you been invited to Angers next week?"
The Duke and Duchess d'Antan have asked us to their estate.
(baby screams)
Sophie!
Where is that wretch?
Excuse me.
Franz?
I will see you.
You're not going to Angers too?
Eugene!
A whole fortnight among some tiresome old aristocrats.
"A fortnight of free food, exquisite scenery and no bills."
And all you have to be is brilliant at dinner.
She doesn't seem bothered she's being eaten alive.
No.
"She'd probably say ""Better to feel something than nothing."""
Even if it's teeth.
(piano being played)
"You don't keep a lot of old, useless paperwork around, do you?"
I have found shredders to be quite useful in eliminating clutter.
"- Miles, what's happening?"
- Did I say something was happening?
"If I knew something was happening and I told you, then I might be seen to be conspiring with you, which, of course, I never would."
Conspiring with me?
About what?
Conspiring with you?
About what?
"Miles, are you trying to scare the bejesus out of me?"
"Hard drives are particularly vexing when it's time for spring cleaning, though I understand there's software available for that purpose."
"- Miles, what is happening?"
- l'm off to a lunch now.
I just thought I'd stop by and say hello and let you know I'm thinking of you.
Karen?
Hi. I'm Bob Dumanjik.
- How are you?
- l'm fine.
Thanks for coming down.
- l know you're really busy.
- You do?
"Well, I assume it."
Should I not assume it?
Are you secretly lazy?
"Um, this way."
Stop it.
Not you.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Of course, it's always a mess around here."
Go ahead and sit.
"Whoa, whoa!"
Oh!
What?
This operation was not officially sanctioned.
- Excuse me?
- London vetoed the mission.
They still think Crawford is in custody in Kenya.
"Which is where he would be, if everything had gone to plan."
- I took a calculated risk.
- Fuck that.
- We need the information on Latif.
- And fuck you.
"Yeah, in latex, I know."
Shall we save the recriminations till later?
Let's get you to safety.
Wait.
Dieter's file say that he was a chopper pilot.
"It's a long shot but they might have a bird out here, to extract Clare and Crawford after the exchange."
How unfortunate that you killed him then.
Is it worth a hand job if I didn't?
"Hello, Dieter."
I'm Colonel Grant.
British Military Intelligence.
Don't move.
"Please, don't move."
"If I push this, an air bubble will go into your heart and kill you."
It's a very nasty way to go.
It's just insurance.
You were going to kill my men after all.
- No.
"We weren't, we..."
"- Shh, shh, shh, shh."
Now I can choose not to kill you.
So shall we discuss where your transport is?
and you call yourself a hero?
anyone not suited to fight this battle should disappear early on.
Well said.
Archer?
I am compelled by Command Seal not to fight you.
I would die just like Rider.
Saber?
that's enough.
My alliance with Emiya-kun is only until we defeat the Master hiding in the school.
Or what?
Do you want to force me to use another Command Seal on you?
Perhaps.
I got carried away teasing her.
Saber.
as well.
I shall overlook your words.
the first thing we need to do is locate her Master.
Caster's Master comes to this school every day.
we should let them be.
In other words we attack before they can return to Ryuudou Temple?
Exactly.
won't they stop coming to school because it's too risky?
That's unlikely.
I doubt Caster's Master still possesses their free will.
That's her style.
Her very first move was probably to turn her Master into a puppet.
That makes sense.
we'll continue our investigation of the school.
we strike.
but how do we look for them?
That's our homework for next time.
We're all tired.
"We're still pulling what's left of him from the truck wreckage,"
But we were able to lift some prints
From the passports that I found.
We had a vodka bottle.
"Plus, we got this beauty."
Don't touch.
What did the lab rats say?
They think it's some kind of long-range transmitter.
How long?
Moscow-long?
Run his picture by your embassy friend.
I'm on it.
"Hey, passport guy's mine."
You got any friends in moscow?
Or anywhere else?
Don't be that guy.
Ran the license plate we pulled from the roxxon debris.
Belongs to howard stark.
I found that.
Where's the rest of the car?
"Uh, we just got a plate and a bumper."
"Boss, stark was on the lam when roxxon went down."
Do we really think he would risk his freedom to blow it up?
Or in...
whatever the hell happened.
Somebody was driving that car.
I want to know who.
"Edwin, leave the dishes."
I can take care of it.
"Anna, darling, I'm going to take you up on that offer."
The day beckons.
"I'll, uh, be in the garden."
Someone in there might be trying to get out.
Thas a big assumption.
"Even if our people didn't cause the problem, you know they'd take advantage of it."
This is our best chance to find them.
"In about 30 seconds, the Mokra are going to open fire."
I don't know how long we'll be able to wait for you.
Understood.
Darod.
I'm looking for my people.
Back this way.
I'll show you.
Don't move.
There you are.
What are you doing here?
I would do everything in my power to protect my only child.
There's a phased- ion charge coming at us from the planet.
Full power to the shields.
Shields at 60 percent.
Minor damage on Deck 14.
They're firing again.
Modulate the shield frequencies.
Try to throw off their sensors.
No effect.
Direct hit to the port nacelle.
Redirect all warp power to the shields.
Two more coming in.
Captain.
We've got to get you back to the ship.
You're hurt.
"Ralkana, the other cells are this way."

"... havethemon theirknees,beggingme to make the keynote speech."
And then?
A short sojourn to Albany...
... followedbyalongone at the White House.
"If I didn't know better, I'd be bursting with admiration."
I thought I'd come in and find you on your knees.
"Instead, you're turning adversity into triumph."
That's just a reflex.
An old habit of mine.
But it's still good to hear you say it.
The way you say it too.
"""""Adversity into triumph. """""
It's good to know you still believe in me.
Did I say that?
I don't know.
I thought you did.
Don't fathers listen to their sons?
How is your father these days?
I haven't heard you mention him for a while.
Where is he?
"In a nursing home in Crowley, Louisiana."
Plays dominoes with orderlies.
Fulminates over his Cream of Wheat.
Don't be too hard on him.
We can't dictate our finishes.
I don't like the sound of that.
Of course you don't.
Because underneath all that need to believe...
... underalltheconcrete you poured into my pedestal...
... somethingiscryingtogetout.
What?
You know I called Judge Walter Stern.
Yes!
I am a criminal!
The people of the crime world are scared of me!
I am a disgrace on the name of humanity!
I know!
I know that you hate me!
You think Im not a nice man!
But I believe that no man in the world is bad.
No one is a born criminal!
No thief robs forthe sake of pleasure.
No criminal commits any crime for his pleasure.
No prostitute sells her body for her pleasure.
Time and circumstances.
Time and circumstances force a person to become bad!
And you know very well that a person who dies due to..
"..poverty or starvation, his final riots are not conducted."
"From that time.. from that time, I have Iearntjust one.."
"..thing from life, I have understoodjust one thing.."
..from life that it is not a crime or a sin to be born..
"..as a poor, but dying due to poverty.."
"..is the biggest crime, the biggest sin!"
Bravo!
Bravo!
It is the biggest crime..
-Thats our hero!
Heres our hero!
wonderful.
Mind blowing.

"I swear upon God, you were outstanding!"
The truth is that I have been happyjust twice.
95th Rifles.
Colonel De L'Eclin.
I have the honour to command the garrison in this town.
"May I present His Excellency, the Count of Matamoro."
You know my brother.
Major Blas Vivar.
I have the honour of knowing the Count.
"The title of Count is in dispute between us, as, of course, is Spain itself."
Why?
You're a Spaniard.
Why do you fight against your country and your brother?
Politics.
I am what is called afrancesado...
- one who suports France
- Why?
Bonaparte brings the light of reason.
"There are two Spains, Lieutenant."
My brother's Spain is a monastery - silence and superstition
My Spain is a court - science and scholarship.
"If you were Spanish,"
- which would you choose lieutenant?
- I am neither monk nor prince.
So I would choose a tavern.
You have 30 minutes to surrender.
I suggest you surrender your sword and order your men to lay down their muskets.
We don't use muskets.
We use rifles.
My men are all crack shots.
We call them Chosen Men
- They never miss.
"- I will stop you raising the banner, but many men will die for a superstition."
"Ten minutes, gentlemen."
"Even if she agrees, she's my age and time has taken it's toll on her"
"This is very simple, get married and God bless you"
- That's what I'm afraid of
- Afraid of what?
What will people say about a man my age getting married?
"When it comes to God's law, what people say has no importance"
"What's with you, Hajj?"
"You can marry 4, it's God's law"
"And the kids, Fawzi and Kadri?"
or Hamdy the district attorney?
"Hajj Azzam, what God allows no one can oppose not a district attorney, nor anyone else"
"What's with you, Hajj?"
It's God's law

"So keep your embittered, communistic treason to yourself during tonight's intercourse with Tarby and friends."
I am not having intercourse with Tarby and that's final.
What a surprise!
Four minutes into the episode and he delivers the most tortuous double entendre ever.
It was a great gag.
"- Social intercourse, Eddie, social."
"- Oh, phew."
We shall talk about subjects far above your head.
"Poetry, fine art, golf."
"That reminds me, I must bone up on Tarby's book of golfing anecdotes."
They are the greatest work of Eng lit since Dick.
- Oo-er.
"- Dick-ens, Eddie."
Dick-ens.
Oo-er.
There's only one thing I hate more than golfing anecdotes and it's this.
"It's a close run thing, though."
Ha ha ha ha ha!
"This is brilliant stuff, it's classic, classic, classic."
"Well done, Tarby."
Oh.
"Oh, listen to this one."
"Listen, listen, listen."
Shut up.
"""Lynchy and I had taken time off and flown to Spain"

- Lesie?
- Yeah.
- Playing golf with lesbians.
Fantastic.
I don't think they allow tourists.
Exactly.
This isn't one of those tourist traps from the guide books.
Hola.
They don't allow talking on the floor.
You'll see why.
The lector kept the workers educated and entertained.
"Nowadays, most factories outside Cuba use iPods, but these guys still use the real thing."
I want to show you the storage room.
It's been around since the '20s.
After you.
- Go ahead.
- I insist.
Simon!
Simon?
We have to go... now.
Here we are again... another end.
When will I see you again?
"I need to go home for a few days, take care of some... loose ends."
But soon.
I got you a gift.
"It's nothing fancy, but it's a little more portable than a steamer trunk."
I love it.
"I finally did open that trunk when we got to London, by the way."
"My imagination had built the contents up so much, I-- my curiosity just got the better of me."
And?
What was inside?
Clothes.
"Not guns, not knives... clothes."
You were protected by your parents' love.
Love makes us do remarkable things.
"Oh, wait."
"I left my spot empty, indicated in the pictures."
This empty seat is mine.
They're two men I knew.
I lived with this man with the blurry face...
The other...
Is a friend.
"He still is, by the way."
That's one of the first pictures where I put white inside...
Inside the picture itself...
I really enjoyed it.
I also liked the mouvement of one the characters.
It's the first picture on which I made the outlines blurry.
Very blurry.
But only to let this white in.
"The white of the frame, inside the picture itself."
"It's very London-ish, isn't it?"
I've never been.
That's true.
Where is this window?
Where do you think?
"The order, the greenery, the grass..."
"The fields, the trees.."
It's Britain...
Britain...
The heart of civilization.
It seemed to me...
Strangely I took this picture while I wasn't feeling well...
"When I wasn't feeling well, I took very ordered pictures."
"Very composed, with this..."
There's a little string.
"A little string of a roller blind, ready cover the whole image."
So you took this picture to show something of Britain?
"Kitty, you are going out with a very dynamic man."
"Dynamic isn't some sort of code word for deranged, is it?"
"God, no."
"You told me you wanted handsome, and I went above and beyond on this one."
"Oh, absolutely beautiful."
"Well, why does she get to wear black?"
She's a woman of a certain age and it's classic.
- Earrings are wrong.
- What's wrong with pearls?
"Nothing, if you want to remind him of his grandmother."
Diamonds.
- Where are your diamonds?
- Is this too much?
That's the one.
And for the final touch?
A gift for both of you.
- Chicken cutlets?
- They're boobs.
They're boobs.
No.
I'm personally very happy with my body the way it is.
"Well, that's very progressive of you."
But you pay me to tell it like I see it.
I see you both need help in this department.
- What was wrong with Kleenex?
"- They're lumpy, and these?"
These are light and comfortable and they have just the right amount of jiggle.
"See, I'm wearing them right now."
Would you like to feel?
"- Oh, no, no."
I'm good.
"- No, thanks."
"He does it more nicely, than the mom or me."
Wow.
So quickly.
"One of the more beautiful ones, than the other one."
And the kind Tót lord?
Does he not accompany us?
- Me?
- Daddy?
My kind dad?
I....noooo!
Why?
What?
Shall I sit over there?
For me it I do not have a manual skill.
Maybe you make of the box derogatory?
No.
No.
But...for major lord... a lot may allow everything to himself.
"That, if i it would be done, and its news would be going in the village, and...well..."
"Do not speak more, dear Tót lord."
I totally understand.
You disdain this work and you ruin others' joy.
I am sorry that I was inconvenient for you.
I travel with the first coach tomorrow.
Tót family it was implored.
they pleaded to him.
"It was asserted, that misunderstands the situation."
"Since nothing happened, that could have hurt it."
"This may not be something else, only a terrible misunderstanding."
"One single of their desire,that let everything be put onto his mood."
"Let us forget the whole one, kind Tót."
"- Maybe, that the mistake is in me."
Ooh.
I can smell the judgment coming off of you.
"Well, they're people, and you're treating them like they're dolls."
"If we're gonna be partners, you really have to stop being such a hater."
We're in a partnership because we share a goal.
Don't ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle.
My lifestyle?
So I assume that you still don't have the invention.
I'll get it.
I said I would.
You threatened to expose Damon Salvatore.
That didn't work.
You killed that Pearl lady.
Still no invention.
"I really don't think that your plan is working, John."
"Well, you being here isn't going to help anything."
[JOHN GRUNTS]
"You failed, John."
I'm gonna take it from here.
DAMON:
Did you ask about Uncle John?
- Are they working together?
ALARIC:
No.
"- No, they're not?"
"- No, I didn't ask."
- What about the invention?
- Didn't ask.
- She know about the tomb vampires?
- I don't know.
Did words completely escape you?
I was a little too distracted by my dead vampire wife to ask any questions.
I'll just hold it.
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are that they're not pressing charges?
"Oh, come on, it was just a joke."
A joke?
"Yes, I didn't think it would be taken this seriously."
"Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?"
"I mean, we're talking multiple levels of interpretation here."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Okay, well, how exactly am I supposed to interpret the stolen prison transport van, huh?"
We filled the tank!
Move!
It's not just this.
"Although, a restraining order is a new low that I didn't think that you would reach quite this soon."
It's everything on top of it.
"The completely bizarre behavior, the late nights coming home, having to beg Mr. Harris for you to make up that chemistry test that you missed."
I missed a chemistry test?
"Really, Scott?"
Really?
I have to ground you.
I am grounding you.
You are grounded.
What about work?
Fine...
Other than work.
And no TV.
The TV's broken.
Then no computer.
I need the computer for school.
"Then no, uh... no Stiles."
What... no Stiles?
No Stiles!
That would depend on what their replacement stores are like.

"I'm sorry, I just don't know."
I haven't any answers to your questions.
All I remember was I went my quarters and fell asleep in a chair.
At least that's where I was when I woke up a few minutes ago and found all this going on.
"Yes, I know exactly how you feel."
Just relax and try to remember.
Where were the rest of you when all this was going on?
What gives you the right to ask?
- You need our help.
- Do we?
We do.
I was off duty.
I share quarters with Pasco.
We were both there.
Routine rest period.
And your name?
Sonheim.
"We must have slept through it all, as Dr Kendall did."
And you?
I was in the communications centre trying to make repairs.
"I remember feeling very drowsy, that's about all."
And my name's Grovane.
Never!
No?
Do you think I will put you out of your misery?
Wake up.
Haven't you learned your lesson?

These men are innocent!
Step side!
No!
These men are innocent!
We need to show them an example.
An example?
"Yes, and we don't need many."
One should be enough.
Do you understand what I am talking about?
"Sir, you have to leave us with something to live on before you collect the tax."
Please don't be so cruel.
"Boy, there's not getting through to you!"
So what are you saying?
Are you not going to pay your taxes?
"We would if we could, but we can't afford to."
Don't you realize tax evasion is a serious crime?
Don't waste my time!
Please!
What are you waiting for?
Take the salt and load it up!
No!
You might as well be telling us to die!
Step aside?
"No, you'll have to kill me first?"

What are you waiting for?

"No, Father?"
Or they'll take you to.

Acting like a child.

--Does that apply to medal-winning dogs?
"--What dogs, what for?"
For them to do their doggy business...

Why didn't you tell me you were coming here?
"When I heard you went to kill the leader,"
I got the fright of my life.
I'm really too embarassed to face you now.
"Because of my bad foresight,"
I got the whole fleet and you into trouble.
Don't blame it on yourself.
The reason I came here was to make a deal with the bandit leader.
"If it weren't for you,"
I wouldn't have thought of it.
"Commander, So Seo-No came to the hideout herself"
What?
What if the deal doesn't go through?
"You may be a merchant, but putting your life on collateral to make a deal, is really too reckless."
"Speaking of recklessness,"
You and I are no different.
I... have already placed my fate in exchange for your life.
"Even if it fails,"
"Even if I die,"
I will not regret this decision.
-Take her out!
-Yes.

I will place mine in exchange for yours too.

"- Yes, sir."
"Sorry, sir."
"Fall in, Rifleman Harper."
"Yes, sir."
"Thank you very much, sir."
Wait.
Do you not wish your officer to give you some high honours?
"Oh, but he did."
He told me to fall in.
"Lieutenant Sharpe,"
I think it better if you now take command.
Get down!
"That fella's the dead spit of you, Major."
Something you want to tell me?
And what are your orders?
Open that chest and tell me what's going on.
"I'm sorry, not until we reach Torrecastro."
My orders are to meet someone at Casa Antigua.
But if they are not here...
Your fellow countrymen need your protection to Torrecastro.

Just hearing about these American guys coming into town.

- Do I know anything?
They've been giving my guys a hard time.
Selling good weed for cheap.
"I've been chasing them off, but then they took over the park across the street."
- They coming in here?
- They showed up at my brother's club.
Just a matter of time before we see them here.
We should do something before something gets out of hand.
What about the bank machines?
"I'll have my accountant look at the final numbers, but I think we're done."
You wanna talk about the weed?
You'll have the Eastern connection.
We're looking for commission on deals.

- Highschool?
That's facinating!
"- And, then what?"
- I went to college.
So... so do you live around here?
"Dean Bowman, can I tell you what a privilege it is to have you at your party?"
What a great tie!
So?
Are you really thinking of joining the Kappa Taus?
I haven't decided yet.
What do you think about it?
You see how much fun we can have.
- I know you love strip clubs.
- Boobs.
You don't think it wouldn't be awkward though?
"- I mean, if we're dating other people."
- Doesn't have to be.
"You should meet Greg, I really think you'd like him."
"Yeah, it'll be a little awkward."
I don't want to change your mind or anything.
I really miss hanging out with you.
Me too.
"In my statement, I told the police that the victim stepped into traffic and that I didn't have enough time to brake, but that was a lie."
The truth is...
I wasn't even looking at the road when it happened.

"Because of my own carelessness, an innocent man died."
There hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't thought about it.

Of course.
"Your Majesty must be tired, after such a long journey."
"Tired, yet reinvigorated."
"When I last saw you, Sire, you seemed..."
Lost?
"Now, I am found."
I want you to organize a banquet for this evening.
Send out invitations.
The entire court will attend.
"A fine idea, Sire."
"But first, tell me news."
All that has happened in my absence.
Hide nothing.
And your husband?
He grows sicker by the day.
The last few weeks are the worst.
It is too late to regret what you have done.
I regret nothing.
"But I will live the rest of my life, a murderer."
No.
You will live the rest of your life as a woman who defended herself.
Go.
The prodigal brother is returned.
"I understand you made a fine monarch, in my absence."
"I did my best but of course, I could not fill your shoes."
"Anyway, I thank you for your efforts."
You drove a good bargain and we now have a foothold in India.
All for the sake of France.
How was the war?
Exhilarating?
I wish it would have been so.
That would be better than the truth.
Ash-393 took it from the womb of your broken wife.
He took it with him.
No one knows where.
"We could not tell you the truth that time, but..."
"But if he had left, a Noid kidnapped a human baby..."
We would have genocidal panic above our heads.
You're telling me?
...
That my son still lives?
"Yes, Bishop."
But the most important:
We're giving you a chance to get them back.
Find Ash.
Then you will find your daughter.
My daughter...
"Our daughter, Mara!"
Five years have passed.
How could he survive on the ice for so long?
She does not have improved DNA.
Extension of DNA at the end of mitosis  sequencing the completed genetic material.
No human survives without Iso-Gel one day less than 60 degrees.
Could she really be alive?
Alert!
F-7100 to the maximum ..
Reprogramming of DNA is complete.
Markers identified for strength and healing.
"I think to resurrect a broken man, I suppose everything is possible."
"They brought me back, Mara."
To the place I never thought to return.
Spartan-7  slave police.
- You know.
- Are you kidding me?
You know what?
"Forget it, okay?"
I'm gonna do this by myself.
"I'm gonna go find some classy, sophisticated people who can hold their booze, who don't talk about their bleached assholes, and who aren't obsessed with poop."
"Okay, bring me up to speed here, boys."
This is an interesting piece.
I love his use of space.
The space... that's what I loved about it.
What do you think the chunky earth tones represent?
"Look at the rich texture, the dimensions."
It's almost as if you can smell it.
"Oh, God..."
This is the piece I was telling you about.
"It's unbelievable... and so raw, so base, so utterly human."
It's almost as if it exploded out of the artist.
Well...
I think it's crap.
Crap...
Crap...
Crap...
Crap...
You know what?
"Guys, let's just wrap up the evidence and start again fresh tomorrow."
"You think they'll keep, or should we put them in the fridge?"
They'll keep fine.
You know what?
"You guys win, all right?"
Are you happy?
Win what?
Heart failure!
Why did you come in?
You should have called me.
I'm not taking advantage of you?
- You've done three nights this week.
- Don't worry.
If I have one afternoon free that's enough.
I have to talk to the builders about the apartment.
It's in such a mess.
Then I just have to get a photo framed.
My situation won't improve.
Maybe we should tell the clinic and let them decide.
"Look, your husband walked out on you and the kids."
"You come the nights you can, and I'll do the rest."
Between us we'll manage.
Thank you.
- You stopped the intravenous nutrition.
- She didn't tolerate it.
- We can try again tomorrow.
- Yes.
"Now, go on."
- And cheer up.
- Thanks.
Six bulls and one woman.
"Next Wednesday, in the traditional bullring in Brihuega,"
Lydia Gonzalez is going to fight six bulls!
"- That's a lot of bulls, Lydia."
- Good evening.
Why such a drastic decision?
My job is to fight bulls.
"Two bulls, six, whatever they say."
People say a lot of bullfighters won't fight with you because you're a woman.
People can say what they want.
Aren't you ashamed?
People will keep chasing us if we run.
They will stop only if we make them run instead.
"Tomorrow, by this time, we have the money in hand."
Nothing should stop that.
Understood?
You are the reason for all these!
We can't get any money from Varun.
All his money has been spent on his eye surgery.
Everything has messed up.
we have to leave empty-handed now!
Forget it.
We can't expect all our attempts to be successful.
One or two might go out of our hands.
Okay.
What's next?
I'll tell you.
And listen...
Give us our share.
"What are you saying, uncle?"
We won't get any money.
And you are talking about a share!
Look...
"From spying on Varun and drafting a plan for you, there has been no mistake from our side."
If the plan messes up in the last minute...
We can't help that.
- Hey...
You will get your share if the plan go as anticipated.
Or else...
The loss is for everyone.
"If you'd properly given our share earlier, why would I demand now?"
You always take the major share.
How maybe I could have stopped it all
"If I had been braver and said something,"
"Well, that's when all this started."
"I'm sorry, daddy."
I should have said something to you.
Sir.
I've...
I'm so sorry.
"I had a dream last night,"
And in it... :
I saw ev-everything.
Now I know why you did what you did.
"I'm so sorry if I was short with you yesterday,"
So sorry about what happened to arianna...
To you and lily.
For everything.
Thank you.
It's been quite a burden.
The hardest part has been keeping my wife in the dark.
"Unfortunately, it looks like that's..."
No longer an option.
You are gonna come forward?
I don't think I really have a choice.
I should have put it all together sooner.
The obituaries that he was leaving everywhere...
That's how he figured it all out--
He must have come across one in prison
"And when he saw her picture, imagine his surprise"
When he realized that he raped
The daughter of his own defense attorney.
I'm gonna call a press conference
"Tomorrow, late afternoon,"
Fly low.
Understood.
Transform.
Clear the museum of civilians.
Please evacuate in an orderly passion.
These humans did not respond.
"Well, I don't think we should worry too much about them, partner."
We need to move the planters to create a fire block.
But I...
That would destroy the harmonious nature of the plaza's design.
What?
"Nice of you to show up, Dani!"
Could've been here sooner if my ride wasn't stuck in neutral.
Next time I'm walking.
Looks like a short started the fire.
But this should hold for a while.
Cyber wires are too much for these old circuits.
I have to insist the good thing nobody got hurt.
- I didn't tell it to do that.
- I wouldn't complain.
Your robot was still in rescue mode.
"You gave him the directives to save lives, so it did."
"You're welcome, Graham."
- Where are you going?
- I need some space.
Chief said there is a bunker below street level.
Really I get something called...
the cold war.
"Apparently, we're getting some space too."
Wait for me!
I still don't get it.
How did Cade's robot know that...
"Look, you can't keep running away."
"Come on, Janet, be reasonable."
We have a duty to resolve this.
- It's for the good of the college.
- We both know it's nothing of the sort!
You'll get nothing from me.
Scott?
Coffee!
"Black, two sugars."
- Try rebooting the whole system.
(Another phone rings)
- Luke Skywalker mug.
"- OK, I'll call you back."
And a custard cream.
(Rock music)
"Scott, will you keep the noise down!"
(Music off)
- Get your own coffee.
I'm not your slave.
(Gentle chimes)
- Sherry?
- Thank you.
Dinner tonight at High Table and tomorrow we start the conference bright and early at ten.
The college has suffered something of a minor tragedy.
"Three weeks ago, Dr Mary Goodyear, head of our biology department, died while on a marine expedition in the South Pacific."
"Yes, I read about it."
"Dr Goodyear's research was of the very first order, you understand."
"But when I came to examine her papers after her death, it soon became clear that sections of the research were missing."
Goodness!
"What, you mean stolen?"
"No, no, no, no, nothing like that."
"It's this bloody librarian, Janet Cramer."
"If you're worried about Neil falling in love with someone the way I fell in love with you, that's like worrying about being struck by lightning."
Hey.
I know what he has.
You don't have to worry.
Okay?
Got everything?
Any sign of technology will throw off our theme.
"Yes, I figured that out when I tried to make a phone call."
Details are important.
"Well, it's where the devil lies... in the details."
"- So, we done here?"
- Not quite.
I believe you owe me a document.
The Bastion contract with my forged signature.
Not just yet.
You do like to play hardball.
"You'll get your contract as soon as the party's over,"
"Bastion is in the clear, and we go our separate ways."
"Oh, are we breaking up?"
"If I'd have known, I would have insisted on being your date tonight."
Break up sex is the best kind.
Not for business partners.
"Is that all I am to you, Neil?"
After all this time?
Yes.
- Honey?
- In here.
You look...
Wow.
"Here, let me help you with that."
I'm a little nervous.
Jeremy should be here any minute.
Monsieur...
I am uncomfortable with the thought of this...
Jewish ritual.
Are you sure it's necessary?
Let me ask you this:
"Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your Führer?"
"Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?"
"Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?"
Hello!
Jones.
Jones!
"I'm going to blow up the Ark, René."
Your persistence surprises even me.
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your Führer has no prize.
"Okay, stand back."
"All of you, stand back."
Stand back.
"Okay, Jones."
You win!
Blow it up.
"Yes, blow it up!"
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archeological relics.
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
You want to see it open as well as I.
Indiana... we are simply passing through history.
This...
You haven't shed it yet.
Now who's on their back?
What the hell is going on?
Get your scurvy asses back down below.
You have to go now.
Go.
Go.
Keep your gun on them all.
Where'd he go?
He fell overboard.
He'll do well to survive with that wound he has.
Then good riddance.
"Well, at least they're stuck here a while longer while they fix our ship."
I don't think Atkins and his men will travel too far into the jungle anymore.
"Today, the battle may have been lost."
But the war is far from over.
"Have faith, my friend."
We will get you home.
Come.
Ripped By mstoll
You just fell for the oldest trick in the book!
And what book is that?
How to defeat the boastful warrior in one easy move.
"Well, then, you had better press home the advantage before it is too late."
But you're weaponless and flat on your back.
Really?
That makes it 3 hits to me.
"And to you... uh, none."
Who's that?
"Jacob, it's hotter than hell in here, and full of stinging things."
"You're my brother, nolan."
"Pardon me, dear Father, I beseech you."
"Henceforward, I will live beneath your rule."
"Well said, my daughter."
"If you should find Romeo in morbid grief or feverish, these herbs will make him well."
Be sure he's strong to take the journey home.
But do not fear.
My letter will revive him.
"Give me your blessing, and I will be gone."
God speed your path and keep you safe from harm.
"Nurse, here is the key to fetch more spices."
The cook wants dates and quinces for the pies.
We must a-move on.
Paris will be here.
"Get anything we need, spare not the cost."
"My lady and my lord, get you some rest or you will not survive the wedding feast."
What nonsense!
I've been up all night before for lesser cause than this.
And I know why.
And look to have no repetition now.
A wife still jealous after all these years?
"Why, 'tis compliment enough to give me cheer."
Hmm?
Hmm?
Wife!
Nurse!
- Will nobody obey me?
!
"- Oh, peace, peace!"
Go waken Juliet.
Dress her and trim her.
"Pray, bring her down to compliment the bridegroom in his choice."
Hmm.
Not the kind of makeup that women use in the street.
Pancake.
Women very often use a brand of makeup that's made up for actors like pancake.
"I, for example, use precisely that product myself."
"Yes, sir."
I know.
Yes.
I'm sure you do by now.
"No, but the point here is something else, sir."
"You see, the lab found traces of four different shades of makeup on that mask."
"And women, you know, they don't usually change shades that much."
"So, in the light of that, sir, I got to thinking."
Where did it lead you to this time?
"A guess, sir."
A professional makeup man?
"Right, sir."
And then to my makeup table.
"Oh, no, sir."
"No, sir."
No.
I only came here to see you.
Honest.
I was just fooling around with the shoes just to pass the time for something to do until you came in.
No.
I didn't look at another thing while I was here.
That means you didn't have to.
You already know something.
Where did you look?
"Guess, sir."
I'll give you three guesses.
The studio wardrobe department.
"You got it in one, sir."
You have a lieutenant here.
"Lieutenant, uh, James Dunbar."
"Yes, sir."
I'm Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
105353.
That is correct.
"Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations."
"Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men."
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt.
They are very angry in Berlin.
They will be even angrier on the east front waiting for that ammunition train.
"Don't you think so, lieutenant?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Now, lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters?"
I have a nice fire going.
I'm okay here.
Why bother?
No bother.
I'm very grateful for a little company.
"You see, I suffer from insomnia."
Did you ever try 40 sleeping pills?
"We have some rights, colonel."
Why is this man being taken out?
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.
You will not get them.
How did he ever find out about that train?
You must have shot your mouths off from Frankfurt to here.
"- No, we didn't."
-Maybe just a hint or so?
Think hard.
Let us hit them again.
Let us reform and hit them again.
I know we can do it.
"God bless you, gentlemen."
"They're forming over there, Major."
I do fear they may attack.
"Yes, sir."
General Pickett.
You may reform to the rear of this ridge and set up a defensive position.
"General Pickett, sir."
You must look to your division.
General Lee.
I have no division.
General...
We will withdraw as soon as we have secured all those wounded or who are well enough to be moved.
If we can reach the Potomac and cross over into Virginia there will be no more immediate danger.
"But I'll need your help, Pete."
I'm so very tired.
"What can I do, sir?"
General?
We must look to our own deportment.
The spirit of the army is still very good.
Very good indeed.
We will do better another time.
They do not die for us.
Not for us.
That at least is a blessing.
If this war goes on...
And it will.
It will.
"What else can we do but go on, you and I?"
It's always the same question forever.
I protected you from clear and massive violations of Federal rules and regulations!
You know what?
"Whatever you did, you got paid for it, didn't you?"
- [click]
- We made mistakes.
Okay?
But I'll tell you what we didn't do.
We didn't kill anyone.
"How about you, Donald?"
Did you kill anyone?
No.
- Don't tell me--
- Hey.
- You fucking asshole.
- Wendell.
You know what?
What was his name?
"But, with her consent, Captain Dreyfuss, so if you don't mind, I won't give you his name."
"I don't believe he meant any harm, and my daughter said he was sweet and chivalrous."
I don't want him punished any more than he has been.
Has been?
"Er, Michael was very upset."
He let the young man know forcefully.
- Forcefully?
Were there blows?
- Almost.
"No father finds it easy to cope with the idea that his daughter is the object of, er, let's say, desire, Captain Dreyfuss."
Do you have children of your own?
No.
"I am, er, I'm not married."
I should go.
"Our notes on Moybeg can wait until another time, given how you must feel right now."
"Hello, Damon."
Ever hear of knocking?
An invitation wasn't necessary.
I'm surprised that no living person resides here.
Is it just you and your brother?
"Yeah, how do you keep out unwelcome vampires?"
Kill them.
Damn.
"Have a seat, Damon."
I was hoping we could have a word.
Sure.
Freak.
We've taken up residence at a farmhouse outside of town.
It'll suffice for now.
- All 25 vampires?
"- Not all, some."
I imagine that a few have already left town.
"Others are probably still in the woods, or like us, acclimating."
- How'd they get out of the tomb?
- I think the witch screwed up that part of her hocus-pocus.
- Oh.
I understand that the founding families still have a secret council?
- And you're a part of it.
- Pft.
That's ridiculous.
I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet.
I'm up to speed.
And so am I.
"Now that you've infiltrated the council, I need to know everything starting with a list of the members and their families."
Everyone you've supplied with vervain.
"Yes, that will have to stop immediately."
What exactly are you trying to achieve?
--ask Sorokin --we know better than that
What is this?
--A sauna --Precisely.
A fire hazard.
--And these are?
--Tennis courts
--How many of you work in that factory?
--11...
--Thousand?
"--Speaking --Pavel, I'm calling regarding the garages"
"I just want to know whose order it was, Vladimir Nikolaevich's?"
Mine.
So that 2 people can swing their raquets.
But it was your idea to delay the demolishion of these garages
Timing creates the necessary adjustments
Could you please sign this.
It's my reprimand for professional misconduct
--Did you call Mamaev?
No
"--When he calls, will you let me know?"
--Where?
In the clinic?
--Go make copies of this --Cut it out.
"You created this mess, and you fix it"
--I said it's a severe reprimand --I was hoping it might be a basic one
"--Young lady, you forgot to tear off the label --I cannot, I haven't bought the pants yet"
"--Pavel Ivanovich, what do you think..."
--Call Galkina here immediately!
--Will you sign it or stare at her pants?
--I will not sign
I already told you that I will not sign
"--But why, Pavel?"
Alright.
Can't go no further.
"Passengers for Blue-3, you're on foot from here."
OK.
Hm...hm.
"This way, Miss."
A million bullets by morning!
?
No wonder the audience booed or snored.
We learnt our mistake.
That would have shorted their eyesight not the picture.
Authenticity.
"That's what they are after, you know."
Authenticity informed by optimism.
You think I don't understand to give an audience optimism?
I've three grandsons in the forces.
Your company reputation is founded primarily on comedy.
Highest grossing British picture of the year was a comedy.
Mine.
"And Mr.Buckley here, wrote it."
"Yes, and very entertaining was too, but... if we were to capture public imagination and their trust, we need more than...fat policeman toppling off ladders."
We need a story to inspire a nation.
"Give me all in brief, Mr.Swain. This year, I'll bring you a picture to win the war."
You have your briefings today later...authenticity and optimism.
....
Schmuck....
Right.
I'll look for a story.
So sorry.
Monstrous of us to have kept you waiting.
"Welcome to the Ministry of Information, Film Division"
Roger Swain.
"- Me, too!"
- Princess!
Your words alone are enough.
Princess...
"All of you, please live on."
And try to give the people of Estabul at least a little bit of happiness.
"For that, I would..."
You've created a problem for me.
All of your cares for your kingdom are quite moving.
"However, in my view, Lady Noa Ehn's life alone isn't enough to atone for all of your crimes."
"Yes, is a tragedy not the most fitting adornment for the tragedy of the kingdom of Estabul perishing?"
Who are you?
"I am Miran Froaude, Colonel of the Imperial Roland Army."
How did you get here?
Did you kill every soldier outside?
Certainly not.
This castle wouldn't fall so easily.
"Of course, even if it did fall, Roland soldiers still couldn't come inside."
After all this place will now play a part in the finale of the tragedy.
Let there be darkness!
- Protect the princess!
- Got it!
But we can't leave everyone...
Get inside!
Everyone's dead.
The kingdom...
The people...
Everything's been lost.
"No, there's still something left."
What do we have left?
Your life.
The cornered Estabul soldiers riot.
Carnivorous snow meets Victorian values... and something terrible is born.
We can go on!
And do everything we planned.
"Oh, yes, and what a plan!"
A world full of living ice people.
"Oh, dear me, how very Victorian of you."
What's wrong with Victorian values?
Are you sure?
I have always been sure!
Good.
"I'm glad you think so, since your entire adult life is about to be erased."
"No parasite without a host, without you, it will have no voice, without the governess, it will have no form."
What...
"What's happening, what's happening, what did you do?"
You've got nothing left to mirror any more.
Goodbye.
What did you...
Did you...
Did you...
Did you really think it would be so easy?
That's not possible.
How is that possible?
Doctor!
They're growing!
The snowmen are growing!
What do we do?
But you were just Dr Simeon.
"You're not real, he dreamed you, how can you still exist?"
Now the dream outlives the dreamer and can never die.
Once I was the puppet.
Now I pull the strings!
I have tried so long to take on human form.
I know.
It seems like it just expanded.
You are not trying to get these back in here.
- You are not getting rid of these pants.
"- We had a deal, mister."
These are not staying.
- You can store those horizontally.
- Goodwill wouldn't even take these.
"They could be pressed, flattened, you can..."
"If you're gonna throw them out, at least check the pockets, all right?"
So you don't throw away some personal items.
I love you so much.
So much.
And I wanna make you happy.
I need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy.
Will you marry me?
"Yes, of course I will."
Yes.
Yes.
NEIL:
Thank God.
GIGI:
Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up:
"If a guy punches you, he likes you."
Never try to trim your own bangs.
And someday you will meet a wonderful guy and get your very own happy ending.
- and your commitment to each other.
GIGI:
"Every movie we see, every story we're told  implores us to wait for it."
The third act twist:
The unexpected declaration of love.
The exception to the rule.
"Yes, one."
From which point at the airport will we shoot it down?
Only I know that.
"That way, none of you can betray our plan."
Our friend Silveira knows many ways of loosening silent men's tongues.
I know that all too well.
- But what if they arrest you?
- Then the plan falls through.
They're at the gate.
- That's definitely the president's car.
- No doubt about it.
The information was correct.
Ramírez is here.
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
We've received an encoded message saying that the plane will land on runway 3.
I will disrupt the electricity at the end of the runway for 20 seconds.
- Stand by.
- All right.
We must get to that sewer over there.
"If he doesn't manage to cut off the electricity, that's it."
Exactly.
That would be it.
Sánchez Granstev.
- Hello.
I'd just like to check something.
- Is anything wrong?
"No, everything's fine."
There just seems to be a minor problem with the transformer.
We'll have it fixed in no time at all.
It will only take a few minutes.
I'll go back to my post.
Janeway to Voy...
Get up!
Get away from her!
Commander... any word on that tellerium?
Not yet.
How bad is it?
The antimatter reaction rate is down to 12 percent.
"If it drops below nine, the plasma injectors will lock up and we'll never be able to reinitialize the nacelles."
Options?
"If we're going to reduce our power demands even further, we're going to have to drop the shields."
I don't want to leave the ship defenseless this close to a hostile planet.
All other systems are already off-line.
Life support is at minimal.
You asked for options.
Thas our last one.
"All right, power down the shields."
That helped.
Is only a matter of time.
There's nothing more we can do without the tellerium.
Neelix to Voyager.
"Yes, Neelix."
"The rest of the away team is gone, Commander."
They've been taken by the Mokra.
What do you want me to do?
Did you get the tellerium?
"Yes, I have it."
Then we need you here.
Prepare to beam directly to Engineering.
Rerouting emergency power to Transporter Room 2.
And... energizing.
Chakotay to away team.
"Captain, can you hear me?"
"- No, I canceled."
"- So, what do you want to do for dinner?"
- What?
Why don't you make that pasta with the artichokes?
"Then maybe later, we can figure out what to do with your hair for Claire's wedding."
What is this?
Look at this.
I wish I could escape.
"The mating ritual is both speedy and violent for these passionate insects, with the lesser male often covering the larger female."
"If unsuccessful in mounting, the male is often eaten by the female during copulation."
We're the girls of 1-400-Hot-Talk.
"Brianna, Tina, Marla and me, Felicia."
"Anything you want to talk about, call me."
Call me.
Call me.
I don't really know where to begin.
"Are you lonely tonight, darling?"
Yeah.
- So am I. What are you wearing?
- Nothing special.
"Felicia, can I ask you a question?"
Want to know what I'm wearing?
Just wearing a towel.
I was drying myself off after a hot shower when you called...
- Why do women leave?
- What?
Why do women leave?
Especially beautiful women.
I can't go through this anymore.
Life is very complex.
There are no guarantees.
Why should that be?
What about sleep?
How many hours of sleep do you get?
Do you sleep soundly?
"No, not really, I can't get a good night's sleep."
And it takes a while for me to fall asleep.
What about your appetite?
"I don't really crave anything, but I do eat."
"On a scale of one to ten, where would you rank your migraine?"
At its most painful.
I wonder...
"I'm not really sure, around a six or seven?"
It's difficult to endure without medicine.
And its frequency?
How many times does it occur in a week?
Three days?
Four?
"Once it starts, it lasts the whole day."
"When you take your medicine, does the pain subside?"
"Not completely, but yes."
What year is it right now?
Do I have Alzheimer's?
"Or am I in the process, and have a mild cognitive impairment?"
You've done a lot of research.
"I searched on the internet,"
I was worried.
"Yes, well first, please answer these questions and make notes often."
What day is it today?
Wednesday.
Seventy-seven plus twelve is what?
Eighty-eight.
"No, nine, eighty-nine."
Please count backwards from that number.
What do I know?
They...
They are very...
- Are you ill?
- No.
I only wish to lie down for a minute.
I have a room just to the side where you can relax.
"It's all right, everyone."
She's going to be all right.
- What do you suppose is wrong?
- She's probably pregnant again.
There's George.
Excuse me.
I have no desire to speak to that woman.
Chopinsky!
You hiding from George too?
You would know the reason.
I don't want to spoil a good drunken stupor by imagining your reason.
"Ever since the latest chapter of her egregious memoir was published,"
I can hardly show my face anywhere.
Did you read her latest novel?
"It's not literature, it's drainage."
She only wrote good books when she was with me.
Every morning while she was sleeping I'd cross out half her adjectives.
Hercules could not have done it.
He'd have rather cleaned out the bloody stables.
Know what's funny?
- She doesn't come.
- Oh.
"She makes a lot of pretty noise, but she can't come."
Like her books...
lovesick posturing and pretence for quick money.
Thank you!
-Thank you!
-Greetings!
"well, thats where the boss sits."
"Boss, your manager says that you.."
..dont want to accept our goods?
"Dont do that with us, sir!"
We will have to auction everything!
"Sir, we will be ruined!"
Thats what I want!
Krishna?
"Yeah, your humble servant!"
Krishna!
The same man who was slapped and abused!
The same man who was thrown out of..
..the house underthe false accusation of theft!
"So, you are taking revenge forthat?"
I have forgotten about that already.
But how can I forget about the tears from my madams eyes?
How can I forget what you did with my master?
"Do you remember, how did you suddenly.."
..change yourself in the time of need?
Do you rememberthat you had denied..
..from signing the guarantee papers?
Did you remember how did the lenders take away the car?
Do you remember how did you force sirto leave cigar?
"Mr. Vicky, you guys dont remember anything."
But Krishna is aware of everything.
I am not going to accept your goods.
Go and complaint about me in the police station!
Go to court if you want!
Go!
We're chasing PPO contracts to compete against the HMOs.
- We won't sacrifice our commitment.
- That's what Pedes is all about.
We're a family here.
The kids you see today will be the parents of the kids you'll see in 20 years.
We believe in continuity and commitment.
So do I.
- So do you want to join our family?
"- Yes, I do."
"How's she doing, Peter?"
She's stable.
We're just going over her films now.
Nasty break.
Anybody want to take a crack at reading it?
Type three tibial and fibular fracture with complete displacement.
- Thirty percent chance of nonunion.
- Excellent.
- Were knee and ankle films ordered?
- I don't believe so.
Knee and ankle films are necessary to rule out injuries from transmitted forces.
"She's right as rain, Peter."
Order the films.
Come on.
I've got a couple interesting Colles fractures you may wanna look at.
Have you ever seen a middle ear bone fracture?
- Hey.
How did the interview go?
- Great.
- What did they say?
- They said I was great.
- Did you get the job?
- Ninety grand a year and nobody dies.
"Now that they know our location and vitals,"
It will be perilous to continue with the expedition.
We should head back to BuYeo.
Sa-Yong is right.
"Miss,"
"Those people are with a vengeance, and they'll surely hunt us down."
Our best bet is to avoid them.
"We'd better go back, Miss."
I heard they still address their leader as 'Commander'.
"Ah, what's the use?"
They're nothing but bandits.
Hey don't look down on them.
They're even tougher than the average Heng-In soldier.
These men will gladly jump into fire at a word from their officers.
No wonder even the imperial guards are no match for them.
I... guess this is for real.
Brother.
Seems it's reckless to continue with this expedition.
We should go back to BuYeo.
"Yes, I agree."
"Brother, please convince So Seo-No."
"Truthfully,"
"No matter what adversities I may come across,"
I would still want to reach Go-San Nation.
But the fleet ultimately belongs to So Seo-No.
I guess we have to wait for her decision.
Follow me.
Where to?
To the bandit's hideout.
What?
!
Why?
I was a better teacher because of you.
- Fresh pepper?
"- Not for her, but I'll have some."
Could you bring her a side dish of dressing?
She likes a little extra.
I feel I should return the favors.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I'll have to think about that.
Just glop it on.
Enjoy your dinner.
- You're not eating.
"- No, I'm watching your ritual."
"I just about got your sequence now, I think."
"You start by rotating the plate counterclockwise, cut on the diagonal, remove unwanted elements, and now comes my favorite part, the loading of the fork."
"It's fascinating, the percentages you use of different vegetables to create that one harmoniously balanced, perfect bite."
Mmm.
You have a little...
Don't smear it.
That might stain.
You might want to put a little soap on that.
I'll be right back.
Mmm.
I want to ask you something.
- Don't stop.
- I'm not a machine.
"We both have overwhelming feelings for each other, don't we?"
- You're doing great.
Keep it up.
- Okay.
Ready?
- Doesn't that music infuriate you?
"- Yeah, I'm livid."
- Things don't end this suddenly.
"- Yes, they do."
"No, they don't."
"Look, I don't know if things end this way or not... but what we had together is over."
"We'll go on Saturday, then."
For one night.
You can choose a romantic inn.
"Pedro Paulo, my darling."
Former spouses don't travel together to romantic inns.
"Technically speaking, we're not former spouses yet."
"Technically speaking, I wouldn't travel with you... if my life depended on it."
MasterJockstrap won't let you go?
If you break into my apartment again...
- Our apartment.
- My apartment.
And you're forbidden to go in when I'm not there.
Does thejapanese guy look sexy in his jockstrap?
He's notJapanese.
He's Chinese.
These Orientals are perverted.
Has he asked you to perform any strange acts yet?
"There are no ""strange acts"" for people with open minds."
Don't let him tie you up in bed.
These guys will steal your furniture.
"What do you mean ""these guys""?"
Have you gone mad?
Japanese always travel in groups.
Give me back the key.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
- I was swimming.
- No problem.
Seems like Big Sis's type
"4,800 yen..."
That's quite expensive...
Heard he got busy and stopped writing
Still too expensive...
This fact wasn't written in any of the Books of Prophecies
"Impressive! ""Bon"" Natsuko the forever damned hunter with the blood of 108 sexual demons"
You can't seem to escape the wrath of sexual desire
"Oh, a sigh like a beast's roar"
So we didn't buy anything after all.
Sorry!
No it's Ok
"No, I'm really sorry"
"I didn't really care though, as long as I got the feel of Boy's Love"
"No, no, no!"
It doesn't work like that
"Without caution, you may dislike us BL lovers as well"
That's also why it was such a hard decision
But it's not like I'd start hating you
"Well, thank you then"
I thought you'd say that
"Well no, more than that..."
I don't want you to start hating anal
What?
Ok...
Um...
Let's eat
Thanks
"So, which do you like better, games or BL?"
You're gonna ask me that?
Um... nevermind
I know you can't choose
- Can you not refer to it as that?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
When were you menstruating out your pussy?
"No, the um..."
The-
- Can you not say...
"""pussy""?"
"Oh, yeah, sure, fine."
Whatever.
"Okay, so I'm gonna take two fingers,"
I'm gonna put 'em in your hair pie.
"I'm gonna feel around, apply some pressure to your ovaries and check you out for beav cancer, okay?"
- Listen...
"- Oh, did I press too hard?"
I apologize.
- No.
"- Okay, well, everything feels fine, so now I'm just gonna go ahead and clamp your clam open and then swab around the inside of your tuna taco"
- and I'll have you on your way.
"- Yeah, no."
Can you just use the clinical term for vagina?
I don't-
- I don't see what's so hard about just saying vagina.
I don't understand.
Are you referring to your sausage wallet?
- Sausage wallet?
"- You know, your lizard mouth."
Does it really feel normal to you to refer to it this way?
I-
- That would be like a proctologist calling a butt a--
Butt?
"Oh, God."
I'm sorry.
They were not permitted to marry.
- On what grounds?
- Eliza was poor.
"She was flung out of the house, and he was packed off to the army."
I think he'd have done himself harm if not for John.
- What became of the lady?
- She was passed from man to man.
She disappeared from good society.
When Brandon returned from India he searched and searched. -
- Only to find her dying in a poorhouse.
I thought my daughter Charlotte might have cheered him up.
Look at him now!
So attentive!
- I should try a little experiment.
- Please.
Let the colonel alone.
All suitors need a little help.
- We haven't heard you play of late.
- You have a superior musician here.
Brandon shares your passion for music.
He plays the pianoforte well.
You know as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne.
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.
I do not know any duets.
"Forgive me, Colonel."
Will we never have peace?
The rent is low.
But it comes on hard terms.
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's daughters.
There's a parcel arrived.
Look!
Look at her.
"Does she look innocent to you, of anything?"
Put your head back.
Put this on.
Better.
Let's go.
Self surreender
Are you entering a plea today?
Excuse us.
We're coming through.
Thank you.
We're here to stop an injustice.
"Yes, she had to defend herself--"
With this--The knife.
She has nothing to hide.
She asked us to turn this knife over
Because she wants the truth to get out.
"The bastard spins on my show,"
Then doesn't even give me an exclusive.
He's gonna pay for this.
She defended herself against a violent man.
"She deserves a medal, not a murder charge."
We will not let her be victimized
By the justice system.
That's it!
"The ""hollywood hooker homicide"" heats up."
Sources say she was a high-Priced prostitute
Who stabbed stein to death and picked his wallet clean.
The d.A.'S story is that ann is a prostitute
Who killed stein for the money in his wallet.
"Now the wallet was empty, but her prints weren't on it."
Now the d.A. Is going to say that she is lying
I was spellbound... but she said it all...
I even tried to get away...
"""but when I looked back, there she was, right in front of me"""
"""Then I smiled and she smiled back;"
"when I took a step, she came along"""
"""Then we became breathless, and a moment stood stilled"""
"And then, we were in love"
That's our love-story
That's our life-story
"3 months, 28 days and 8 hours ago we fell in love"
You're crazy
Why do you drag him everywhere?
He won't leave us alone
What does that mean?
- You're bananas
I'll be home by eight.
"Yes, I'm with Jai."
Brian is also with us
Why talk to your mother like that?
Like how?
So irritably...?
Because she irritates me
"At times, I hate her."
Maybe Because of the familiarity?
"When you're far from home, you realise... what mother means, what a family means"
This monkey is hovering around all the time... particularly when I'm with you
"Yes, because of you"
You're seeing my parents today
After we drop Brian.
Won't take long
Now smile and give an okay
Watch!
It's signed.
- You like the Bulls?
You ever go?
- Not often.
"Oh, okay."
So we're doing some stuff on Atlantor.
Some stuff?
"Yeah, stuff, DA Stuff."
"And because we're great investigators, we discovered you are too."
"I'm not investigating, I'm trying to get them to stop building this."
"Cool, to protect the neighborhood."
I like it there.
I grew up in Bridgeport.
- Mr. Dumanjik...
- Bob.
Are you going to tell me what this is about?
You mean about the grand jury?
Excuse me?
The grand jury we impaneled to investigate Atlantor.
lnvestigate what about Atlantor?
"Well, that would be telling."
Wait a minute.
A grand jury is investigating Atlantor.
And I was hoping you'd be happy about that.
This is strange.
You can't tell me?
What did they do?
I was hoping since you've been developing evidence for your own civil case that maybe you could share what you've found in a neighborly way.
I... this is... you're going to have to tell me more about this.
"I have all sorts of constraints, confidentiality issues..."
And your ex-husband is the architect.
- What do you want?
But this one little thing will break Nitu's heart
"Nitu is mature, she'll understand."
"Try and understand, Om"
"Jagadish, tell Ma to go home and prepare for the reception"
Take Nitu home in our car.
That car...?
Brother!
Your turn now
"Your brother-in-law-cum-chauffeur at your service, dear sister-in-law"
Drive carefully.
- I'll try
Move it!
Batra family on the move
Stalling...
Let's take a look
"Jagadish, take a look"
Can't make out a thing
Here's hoping it isn't clogged dirt.
Come on... put to the real test your five years of American education.
Get going
"Nitu, stay inside."
It won't look too nice
What about fixing a junk car on your wedding day?
Does that look nice?
My Ma had another car waiting didn't she?
"Oh come on, it's okay."
- No it isn't okay Jai
"Sister-in-law, Jai is jacked"
Never expected you to be up so early
But I am an early-riser
"Early to bed, then early to rise"
And the dark circles under his eyes tell us he hasn't slept all night
"Well, don't use our own troops."
We've got some adapted Helots under training.
"Yes, I've seen them."
- What do you think of them?
- They seem like all Helots after adaptation.
"Suggestible, obedient and glad to follow orders."
They should make excellent troops.
I don't know.
"Something missing, I think."
"- Fire in the belly, Quute."
You can't fight without it.
"- No, of course not, sir."
- I'm meeting the President-elect later on.
"- Yes, I'd heard he'd arrived."
"- He's a Helot, they say."
- Practor?
"Oh, yes, born and bred."
It's a good idea getting one of their own to run the place.
"- Is he adapted, sir?"
"- It's not necessary,"
Practor's been on the Federation civil list for years.
He knows all the ropes.
So it shouldn't take too long to hand over.
Then we can get on to Wanta.
- Wanta?
- That's our next assignment.
"- Something to look forward to, eh?"
"- Yes, sir, I'm looking forward to that no end."
"Where exactly is Wanta, sir?"
- How long till we make planetfall?
- Just over two hours.
You'd better check out which gun kits you want.
Can brother come along too?
Everyone has a free will.
They can come if they want or not come... if they don't want to.
It doesn't make a difference to me.
How much is this for?
You dare attack from behind?
Come on put it in neutral.
Who is it?
Jabbar sir it wasn't us.
Here.
Get your self treated.
Here.
Goodbye.
That's Jabbar the beggar...
What happened?
Did the tank explode?
No you've been exposed.
Take look.
Look.
Last night was the most embarrassing night... in the History of politics.
The entire country was shocked to see this.
25 MLA s of minister Vishwas Pradhan... were caught along with prostitutes late in the night... and in front of the entire media.
The unknown person that informed the media... calls himself a social-worker.
This is a conspiracy of the opposition.
The parliament speaker... has decided to suspend all the MLA s.
And the ruling have given a statement that... they are ready for a hung assembly...
But they will never take the support of these MLA s.
I am ruined.
My power's gone.
And wife too.
Rascal swine pervert.
Yes!
Is the plane ready?
"Yes, Miss Bristol."
Let's go.
Where will the conference take place?
At the Quito Hotel.
Is that so?
"Yes, all has been arranged, as instructed."
Have the models reported in?
"Yes, they are traveling by commercial flight, accompanied by Maddame Rapiee"
"All is well, Lucrecia?"
The operation will take place in Quito.
Will our other agents have any problems?
"No, all has been arranged, the only one that cannot pass trough customs is you, you are too well known by the intelligence agency."
"Very well, Lucrecia, I am now in your hands."
We wil go to Quito in one of the emergency planes.
And where shall we find it?
the secret landing strip is not far away.
What would you like?
Do you have loose American cigarretes?
Lights?
Twentieth century brand?
only Fiteenth century.
"Here, this is for you."
"""In case of extreme circumstances, look for contact in Quito, code 00100"""
When will we go into action?
"It will be soon, the members will arrive today."
"Agent one, S.O.S."
Got a light?
My matches are wet.
I do.
"I am Charlie, he is Sibor."
"I know, I was expecting you."
what did you come here for?
Revenge?
don't you?
Don't be so spoiled!
and forgot about the actual mission.
and entrust their lives to us will be exposed to danger.
Information from the satellite probe has revealed a shift in the magnetic field.
and it seems he's reached the heart.
There's no more time.
The situation is getting more and more difficult.
I think we need to take some kind of measures.
There is no need for that.
Macdougal will take care of it.
But General..!
one by one.
because the consciousness of our nation has been instilled in his head.
So this is Noah's ark.
It's bigger than I thought.
by a width is 50 cubits...
This is five times as big as that.
it's not made of any ordinary wooden material.
let alone destroy it.
This is the entrance.
Can't you open it?
material that has no time.
What did you say?
we can never destroy it.
It may not have even been created by human beings.
aren't you?
Machiner's Squad?
Yeah.
It's a Cyborg unit under the Pentagon.
"No, these places."
Poky little shops.
"Everything higgledy--piggledy, all scrunched in."
-
- Quaint!
-
"- Oh, good."
Do you think so?
Definitely!
"Good, because that was just the effect we were striving after."
"I said to the architect, ""Now, look, Sir Hugh,"" I said."
"""We don't want any of this modern rubbish."
"We'll go strictly for quaint."""
I love the smell.
"What is it, do you think?"
You've come on a bad day.
We get a lot of old people in here on a Tuesday.
"Which is fine, unless it's been raining, and then some of them smell a bit damp."
"I think it's cough drops, tobacco and paraffin."
That's right.
And that's only the women!
I see you're still selling things unwrapped.
"That's a vicious rumour, madam."
I've never even appeared in the shop unwrapped!
"Mind you, they do look tempting."
I might have risked a couple if you'd had tongs.
-
- Don't you use tongs?
-
- Of course we do.
I am notorious on the tongs.
But usually I just save them for the summer months because they are marvellous instruments for swatting flies.
Filming real families has put me back.
"Let's tell the truth, here was the story."
But my position became more and more uncertain.
So I devised a plan to stay afloat.
"Carlos, let's get him out of here."
He heard what he said.
- I know how to get from A to B.
Do you mean B of Belgium?
- What about B of Bulgaria?
Thing?
- See those lovely ladies?
The legendary Sirens of the Sea of Mero.
Folk singers.
"Their concert was canceled,"
And tomorrow they will depart for Bulgaria by coach.
The protocol will never approve it.
"- Look, here's the plan."
I ride a music video for them and they let us get out of here.
Secretly.
Forget it.
Do not you want to bring the king home?
- Sure.
Maybe we should talk to her boss.
Sire.
- I can not concentrate.
You are welcome.
The coincidence between universes and the kingdom...
The dysfunction of nature and man...
"The desire for independence characterizes every epoch, right?"
"It gave birth to our kingdom in 1830, and now it will probably collapse."
But what is the real nature of this independence?
This so-called freedom?
What'd you expect?
Nothing short of a triple axe murder will take it off.
"Keep feeding the press, morning and night."
Emphasize our tough stand on crime.
The 20% drop in homicides and street crime last year.
"Also, Stern's record."
Hard-line.
"Good, Kevin."
Corporation Council?
We've commissioned a study that'll prove this city has the toughest probation guidelines in the country.
Excellent.
Get Community Affairs involved.
Tell Parks clean up their playgrounds.
"Hover, nudge, show we care."
And then we got to do something concrete.
"Something big, something important."
Something that means jobs.
That means building BankExchange.
I won't let these shootings interfere with my program for the city.
I'm speaking at the boy's funeral.
James Bone's funeral.
That's a blueprint for trouble.
I don't care.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't think you'll be welcome there.
They got me anyway.
Let's go to work.
"Kevin, I need you."
So what happened?
Frank Anselmo and his real-estate cronies is what happened.
They want the subway stop to raise their land value on city property.
The property around BankExchange?
So you're accusing us of corporate espionage and murder.
That's absurd.
John Cutler was gunned down in a secluded cabin managed by your company.
You gonna tell me that was a coincidence?
Yes.
If that's what actually happened.
"What do you mean, ""if it happened""?"
I was there.
I saw it happen.
"Well, I'm sorry, but I haven't heard anything about a murder at one of our properties, so... you must be mistaken."
There's been no mistake.
You guys killed Cutler and then you covered it up.
Show me some proof.
(door buzzes)
Well... ask and you shall receive.
BENNER:
What's this?
CHIN:
That's a lab report.
"See, we just matched up the tire tracks found at the scene to a van registered to your company."
How's that for proof?
STEVE:
So why don't you tell me what happened with Cutler.
Did he up his price and it piss you off?
Maybe you thought he'd been compromised.
What happened?
What happened?
!
(sighs)
"Yes, Cutler was spying for us."
"Yes, we scrubbed the crime scene."
"But we didn't kill him, come on."
I'm pitiful
"I'm sorry, I was too mean"
There's no need to appologize
Otaku hunted at this age...
"I guess it was an old man hunt, not an Otaku hunt"
Or maybe it's both
Being an adult must be tough
"From a social standpoint, you're totally an adult, too"
We aren't gonna charge into Miyu's house today
Why?
I'm tired
"Coming from the countryside, the overnight bus was pretty tiresome"
That makes sense
"Yeah, so we will head directly to the hotel"
How do we get to Higashi-Ginza from here?
"Big Sis, we can't do that"
Why?
Cause we don't have money
Big Sis?
You took a pic?
Gonna send it to little sis
Why?
Cause I owe her money
I need to send pics periodically or the interest goes way up
You sold your soul
"Give me, I'll take a pic of you"
"Oh, your zipper is open"
Big Sis...
"And, send..."
"Oh, cruel ""Tiro Finale"""
"My little sis's reply will send me down the ""Law of Cycles"""
I'm not a big fan of Magical Girl
- You're well informed.
- He's bound to sail here to safety.
"Here, he won't be trapped or cut from his bases and supplies by the enemy fleet."
- Admiral Jarvis is no fool.
- He'd be happy to hear you say so.
He would have done as I said.
Our responsibility is to carry out existing orders.
We're responsible for the ship.
"To risk it for orders, instead of using imagination..."
"When you get your own ship, you can sail by imagination."
My ship will follow orders from the Admiralty.
Whatever the consequences?
You may have power over life and death of everyone on this ship.
"- I warn you, if we come through this..."
- Yes?
Lf?
To have followed Admiralty orders may not be enough.
I will say this once.
"I'll not be bullied, and I intend to be obeyed."
Your friends mean nothing to me.
"While you serve this ship, they'll mean nothing to you."
You can go now.
- Steady as she goes!
"- Steady, sir."
"Mr. Ponsonby, set t'gallants."
"Smartly, Ponsonby."
"Aye, aye, sir."
Topmen aloft!
- Set t'gallants!
- I can.
Get them down.
This isn't a nursery.
Of course.
My wife is a savage woman
- I know this region like the back of my hand
- It's this bone right here
It hurts so much when you press it
Right here?
Ah!
Easy!
Here!
Have a drink!
No more wine for us please.
We can't afford it
It's alright
This one's on me
You're indeed a beautiful serpent
Every day I carry those damn logs without getting paid properly
Now I'm so broke that even my hounds look down on me
We're losing our hunting grounds and you still keep the hounds to look down on you?
Look!
Those are the trees that used to watch over our ancestors
This is how they end up
"Strange thing is, why so many constructions?"
What?
Not only do you befriend us with wine but you speak our language fluently
Hey!
It's going to rain
- Stop drinking and go home!
"- Good morning, sir!"
"Good morning, Mr. Policeman"
You've worked all day long for such a mean wage and you waste it on wine?
What else can we do with so little money?
"Yeah, right!"
"""And now Teterin's been promoted And everyone feels truly blessed And now let's everyone together Bow down so low and kiss his ass."""
"I think the rhyme is good, and Comrade Teterin will like it, too."
What have you done?
That was Teterin on the phone.
Even better
"Pavel, what are these silly jokes?"
Do you understand how you made me look?
"I will dial it again, you go and apologize"
"Do you hear me, Pasha?"
"Pasha, what's happened?"
Do you have troubles at work?
"My little hampster, please answer when asked"
"Oh come on, I ironed this dress, and now I have to do it all over again"
--I find your flattery distasteful --What flattery?
A person is retiring with a farewell party.
Some warm words for him...
"--Who is retiring, Teterin?"
--Kovalev is.
Kovalev.
--And Teterin is taking his place --Precisely
"What, precisely?"
!
What?
!
--Lucy is in tears --What happened?
--What else has he done?
--I do not tolerate calculating people
"--Dad, you choose your words more carefully --Go, dad has some troubles"
"Dad, who's calculating?"
Lucy?
How?
That she married a student without a stipend?
He'll blame me all the same
What should I do?
"How dare you, you're still alive"
You've scared me so much!
Where's Gao Jian?
Didn't see him
"Master, I'll get him!"
Shut up and go!
Gao Jian!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
A while back I carelessly... bumped into 2nd Brother
You know the time now?
"Lazy boy, go and practice!"
"Master, have you heard of someone by the name Jin Tianyun?"
Why did you ask about him?
"Nothing, it's just that I've heard about"
How amazing Jin Tianyun's technique is
He is pretty skillful
A pity that he didn't come from a decent school
Just in case you run into him in future
You better turn away
"Master, will you turn away..."
If you run into him?
Nonsense!
"Gao Jian, if you'd rather leave us"
I'll make it easy for you!
"Master, you got me wrong"
Got you wrong?
"Master, this blockhead... didn't really want to learn martial arts"
He just wants a place to stay
"And have three meals a day 3rd Brother, can you shut up!"
What happened?
- Is she dead?
- She will be if you don't hurry the fuck up.
I understand that.
I'm not a fool.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Who are you working for?
I used to work for the same righteous pricks who twisted your life.
Now I work for the other side.
Just as twisted but they pay a lot more.
"They break us, you know."
Turn us into these awful things.
Broken pieces.
They push us.
Make us into men we're not.
And then complain when we no longer function.
They think we should live like this is normal.
"Like this is how we should behave, how we should think."
And our reward for this life?
We try to run away and they kill us because of what they forced inside our heads.
You think men like that deserve to live?
They deserve everything they got coming.
Maybe.
Did you stop the broadcasts?
Yeah.
Why?
Some fleeting virtue in not being a mass murderer.
I take it you're not a religious man?
You don't believe in a guiding light?
No.
"You're like me, then."
Floundering in wet shit.
"Well, I don't recall the details but, when these things came up, they would have been looked into."
Did you ever deal with complaints of abuse at Sands View Boys' Home?
That doesn't ring a bell.
"There was a specific allegation made by the social worker that we're talking about,"
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.
Sorry.
"Well, Stephens-Lloyd claimed he compiled a list of authority figures who, with the collusion of staff, conducted systematic abuse of boys resident at Sands View."
"See, I've never even heard of this Stands View place."
Oh!
Sorry.
"- I'll get that, love!"
- OK!
Here he is!
- Hope I'm not too late.
- Spot on.
"How you keeping, Ted?"
"Yeah, can't complain, can't complain."
I hope you don't mind me calling you.
"Not at all, sir."
A matter of professional courtesy.
As you were.
As you were.
"Oh, now, you'll stay after, won't you?"
Joyce'll kill me if I let you off the hook from her Victoria sponge!
"That's very kind of you, sir!"
Thank you.
Don't mind me.
"Now, where were we?"
Where's Hastings?
Briefing.
Inspectors and above only.
Kate.
And you're still acting like this?
"Then, I guess..."
I should investigate these invisible men for murder.
"If you're going to throw around accusations, at least make some sense!"
Or give us a name!
"Or why don't you bring some pictures, or any evidence at all?"
"Hey, follow him."
Officer!
Why are there no security cameras in this building?
Can you show me the footage from the elevator camera?
That camera...
it breaks every time we fix it.
So we gave up on it.
But I'm wondering if someone might be breaking it on purpose.
"Wow, seriously..."
Hey.
Why are you following me everywhere I go?
Are you worried I'm going to run away?
What do you mean?
Why would you run away when you didn't do anything wrong?
"Oh, geez..."
Joon Gi Moon?
The one who owned the sushi restaurant?
Did you know him?
"Then, the murder victim that Im Tae Ho was talking about..."
How did you know the victim?
- Park Seon Woo.
"- Oh, yes..."
"He was a colleague of mine, below me."
We were like blood brothers.
We also worked together once.
We were partners.
You have clearance.
"- Just launching the search for that spy ship, sir."
- Good.
What's the position regarding the monorail?
The sapper team have laid 18 charges in the tunnel.
They can be detonated either simultaneously or independently.
I suppose Leitz will expect a medal after this.
"Surface launch, Master."
What did I say?
"Slave, can you identify them?"
The heat pattern indicates three B 19 cruisers.
"Oh, come on, Avon."
Hit that button.
"That's a search formation, Avon."
They're not aligned for an attack.
So they're searching.
We're going to wait here till they find us?
Let's get out.
"They must have picked up Dayna and Tarrant, and realised we are up here somewhere."
"Slave, set the ship on an evasion pattern, maximum speed!"
- That's the first sensible...
- Just a minute.
This is Scorpio.
"Come in, Tarrant."
"Hold that order, Slave."
TARRANT:
"Soolin, we're almost finished here."
"Tell him if he doesn't get the hell out, we're certainly finished here."
SOOLIN:
"Tarrant, we think Scorpio has been spotted."
Teleport up now.
"I'm sorry, Soolin, we're not receiving you very clearly."
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.
"When the red light goes on, that's your temperature."
I'll run it!
[Regan humming]
A disorder of the nerves.
At least we think it is.
We don't know yet exactly how it works.
It's often seen in early adolescence.
"She shows all the symptoms-- hyperactivity, quick temper, performance in math."
"Yeah, why the math?"
What is that?
It affects her concentration.
Uh-huh.
Now this is for ritalin.
10 milligrams a day.
Is it like a tranquilizer?
It's a stimulant.
A stimulant?
"My God, she's higher than a kite now."
The condition isn't quite what it seems.
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic behavior in a child.
Ritalin seems to work to relieve the condition.
"As to how or why, we really don't know."
But the symptoms could be overreaction to depression.
That's out of my field.
My daughter isn't depressed.
"Well, you mentioned her father and the separation."
Do you think I should take her to a psychiatrist?
No.
I think we should wait and see what happens with the ritalin.
I think that's the answer.
How could I?
I didn't hold a grudge against you either.
I could never hold a grudge against you.
- How's life?
Are you happy?
- I am.
Happy that you became a famous artist.
What you always wanted... and what you truly deserved to be.
"Yet, I often wondered if this is worth of being alone in life."
"'Artists should never get married,' eh?"
Remember?
I always do.
"Everything was so beautiful then, the penthouse..."
the hole in the blanket!
The pot with our one and only sovereign!
I broke the pot and the sovereign was counterfeit.
Counterfeit?
The sovereign we swore on our love never to spend was... counterfeit!
"But our love was real, Pavlos."
And my portrait?
what became of my portrait?
"It's the only thing I have from you, Aliki."
I never sold this portrait.
"It's always been in the penthouse, over my bed."
When I feel lonely...
disheartened...
I talk to that portrait as if it was alive and listening.
"I tell her... my dreams, my worries, my bitter sorrows..."
Whatever I say... she'll always answer...
I love you!
"I love you, too!"
"We lost track of time, Pavlos."
"Once when India attained freedom, and today.."
..when my friend has become successful.
"I dont understand something, Dhanraj."
You want to buy Mr. Kumars mansion.
"And I want to sell it, in orderto.."
..get my money back..
- Right.
Then why dont you give me the..
..money and take the mansion?
Why are you conducting this auction?
You dont understand.
"When the house gets auctioned, then the.."
..dignity of the members of the house gets ruined.
There is a saying in Gujarati that if you want to show..
"..your rivalry, then you should see to it that your.."
..enemy becomes a pauper completely so that..
..he begs and doesnt mess with you again.
Ravi!
Vicky!
"Ravi, did you hear?"
Our house is getting auctioned!
"Why are you so shocked, sister-in-Iaw?"
This would happen some orthe other day.
will you.. will you let this heaven-Iike..
..house of yours get auctioned?
Vicky..
"Vicky, this house is notjust.."
"..made up of lime, sand and stones.."
..but your brothers hard work is also involved in this!
And.. and where will we go if we leave this house!
?
Now everyone will have to arrange forthemseIves.
It's backfiring in the cockpit block!
Shut down bypass.
Removing cockpit block!
Hang on there!
This baby's never had a person on board.
It's just a little nervous.
Take your time and figure out why the pressure's rising.
"Yes, but..."
Take care of it.
Brother...
Is there anything you value more than yourself?
Something I value?
It's to save...
This world!
Result code is timed out!
It's overflowing!
Abort experiment!
Disconnect all circuits!
There's a crack in the chamber!
It's too late!
I didn't understand why he wanted to be on Dangaioh.
That's why I wanted to be on it.
So I could see for myself.
I can understand how your brother felt...
"He said, ""something more valuable than yourself,"" right?"
Uh-huh.
"That's why I'm here, too."
I'm glad you finally decided.
I'm very grateful.
"Because you agreed, our mighty States can now gain the power we need to exercise justice!"
The power to prepare us for the coming threat!
"The power you seek, namely, the power they are going to grant you, will not make you into a mighty soldier."
- What was your last assignment?
The assignment was to rate Officer Hardy's competence   and to monitor his interest in the Three Rivers murder case.
You state that Officer Hardy neglected his duties   to pursue an illegal investigation into the Three Rivers murder case.
To what do you attribute his unusal interest in the case?
He feels the murders were committed by the Polish Hill murderer.
A case he worked on.
A prosecution witness in the case   said that Officer Hardy threatened him.
And that you were forced to protect him with your own weapon.
"No, that's incorrect."
- I drew my weapon as backup.
- Backup?
Officer Hardy was not...
out of control and dangerous?
At no time whatsoever.
Hardy is courageous and resourceful.
I wish we had more officers...
- Excuse me...
- Don't you want my evaluation?
"Thank you, Detective, you may step down."
Ten-minute recess.
I'm sorry.
- Why'd you change your testimony?
- Why do you think?
- You cheat good.
- Hardy.
"Hi, Emily, it's your father."
Sarah just wanted to say hello.
She's enjoying her visit.
We'll see you Sunday.
Bye.
"Hi, Jo..."
I mean Emily.
"- But that's what you mean, isn't it?"
I think you should leave.
I don't think you should come here again.
Very well.
"For most of Tutankhamun's reign, the real power was wielded from behind the throne by a military council run by the young king's advisor, Ay."
"But when Tutankhamun reached the age of 18, he would have claimed his inheritance to rule Egypt as a divine pharaoh."
The king's newfound power would not last long.
"In his tenth year on the throne, Tutankhamun died."
Exactly why remains a mystery.
"Some believe he was murdered by his own advisors, or perhaps he just had an accident."
Examination of his body using modern scientific techniques showed a leg injury which could have been fatally infected.
Tutankhamun was still a teenager.
And lift!
"Lift slowly, very slowly."
(Workers speaking Arabic)
"Down, Pecky."
"Pecky, down."
And tilt.
Tilt it.
Lift!
"All right, lower, lower, lower."
Slowly.
Go slowly.
"- Afternoon, Carter."
Where have you been?
- Packing.
I have to go to Cairo.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- I've had a telegram.
Carnarvon is ill.
- Nothing serious I hope.
- I rather think it is.
"Oh, look what's happened to city property."
No... but I'm still gonna take you to school.
- Just soon as I...
- Come on.
You jeopardized my life's work.
My accountants' are desperate.
You've proved yourself incompetent yet again.
I don't even know if I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?
I trusted you enough
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.
Don't tell me you don't trust me.
We have to trust each other.
Right.
I trust everybody.
Yes...
"Well, fortunately,"
I thought of something very spectacular which will satisfy both of us in terms of prestige and money.
"Well, you have the prestige, I'll take the money."
"But, before we celebrate your return to sanity, we'd better do something about Tony's sister."
How did she know we were at the museum?
I...
I'm not certain.
Tony.
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?
Telepathy.
She'll show up again and ruin everything.
"In that case, she will have to be, as you would say Scratched?"
Tia.
Tia.
What happened to you?
I can't explain now.
"Forgive us, Captain."
We will maintain your life-support conditions while you return to your ship.
Please accept our apologies.
Captain to Enterprise.
Captain to Enterprise.
"[ Spock ] Captain, we're receiving you."
"Beam me up, Mr. Spock."
We're free to go.
"Warping down, Captain."
Our warp factor--4.
"Approach channels clear, Captain."
"Colony Beta 6 clears us for normal approach, sir."
"Normal orbit approach procedures, Mr. Sulu."
Captain.
"Still thinking about Trelane, is that it?"
"For the record, how do we describe him-- pure mentality, force of intellect, embodied energy, superbeing?"
"He must be classified, sir."
"God of war, Mr. Spock."
"Well, I hardly find that fitting."
"Then a small boy, and a very naughty one."
It will make a strange entry in the library banks.
He was a very strange small boy.
He was probably doing things comparable to the mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy.
"Mischievous pranks, Captain?"
"Yes-- dipping little girls' curls in inkwells, stealing apples from the neighbors' trees, tying cans on--"
Forgive me...
Mr. Spock.
I should have known better.
"I shall be delighted, Captain."
You'll enjoy Commodore Travers.
He sets a good table.
I led the others.
I shot out your mirror machine.
Did you think that was the only medium of instrumentality at my command?
I took that chance.
I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong.
"Oh, then you do admit to the charges?"
"Yes, anything!"
Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey.
Uhh!
You pompous--
Immaterial!
Those people have done you no harm.
Inadmissible!
"We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement."
Silence!
This trial is over.
You are guilty.
"On all counts, you are guilty."
"According to your own laws, this court has no choice in fixing punishment."
"You will hang by the neck, Captain, until you are dead, dead, dead!"
"Captain 's Log, Stardate 2126.3."
First Officer Spock reporting.
Still no word from Captain Kirk on the surface below us.
Waiting time is almost up.
I willsoon be forced to attempt departure as per instructions.
"Until a moment ago, I didn't think it possible, but it was."
I did it.
I was angry.
I actually experienced genuine rage.
This experiment has been successful.
I'm glad you weren't disappointed.
"Why, Captain, you're still angry."
Bondage between the mother and the child is the umbilical cord
Why are you such a mean minded dad?
-Did I ever say I am the dad
-You said she is your girl
- Did I say I am her father?
- What do you mean?
"Today it is Karnataka, tomorrow it is Andhra"
- Day after?
- Kerala
Then it should be done for you and not her
-Where?
- Here
Don't lock me in your soul with my anklet
Oh Casanova!
-Subbu send 2 fags - will send it
You have breakfast at your house but want coffee of ours?
"Yes, because your filter coffee is superb"
-But seems it is not prepared by you
-Might be by her dad
Mind your business
Shouldn't smoke in public places
"If the legs are out, it is public place"
"If it is in, it is private"
"Tomato,Brinjal, Raddish, drumstick, beans"
"Ladies finger, snake gourd,...."
"What Ponni, You were not to be seen?"
"It's nothing, Arul"
I had a marriage proposal
Did you like the groom?
When we gave snacks They asked for liquour
What happened then?
My dad smacked and they ran away
She's so cute
Miyu... must be amazing to have a girlfriend like her
"No, we need to take her back"
Taking her back to where?
Back to her hometown obviously
I wanna go home too
So give me some train money
"Come on, please"
Come on
I still don't get it
Why'd we have to pay money to that guy?
We should have bought that BL book
"Those guys only have 5, no 3 years left"
Their lives are peaking right now
Grandpa said that people who are nasty will always fail at life
It was just two guys.
"We have two guys too, you know?"
I don't know...
Bebi... ..you're a grown man
Sorry
I've always been like this
I was bullied a lot too by guys like that
But even at this age...
I'm so sorry
Bebi it's ok.
They looked even stronger than Big Sis
"Their smirks were weirder than Big Sis's and they're a lot bigger than her, too"
"They had bigger boobs than her, too"
Hey there
Thanks
It just irritates me.
"Not only them, but with myself"
Results?
As expected
I topped the college
Is this how you deliver great news?
Yes!
Why are you underplaying?
"I'm so happy, I could hug you!"
Get back to India right away
One more good news.
Tell me
An automobile giant has offered me a job.
It's about my project
I don't want to lose out on this opportunity
So returning home will be a bit difficult
You have bagged such a good offer and that's just as well
People with education go out to serve that country
I'd rather that you returned to serve your country
"Daddy used to say, lose your land, and you have lost everything"
"We ought to be together, Jai."
"Right now, I need you, Jai"
E-mail from Jai?
Jai has topped his college.
"Congratulations, son."
Bless you
"Enough of it, now come home."
For five years...
I have only seen you growing up in pictures.
Now I want to see you
"Om, why did it black out?"
"Broken connection, happens sometimes"
"Ma told me, at the end of the story... everything works out fine"
"If not, the story isn't over yet"
* When you taught me
* What my heart
* Was made for
* I got what I prayed for
* You're
* An angel
* Dear.
"And so, my dear duchess."
"Tomorrow, I may be in possession of the city and its treasures."
- A theatrical titan.
"- Not really, Commodore."
Success is in my very grasp.
- Confounded flies.
- Tell me about it.
I have invested practically everything I have in a theatrical venture which is certain to make millions.
"Millions, duchess."
"Do you know, Commodore, since you've called me duchess when others address me as Mrs. Schultz."
I positively shudder.
"Yes, I can understand that."
"Now, as I was saying..."
But let's not talk anymore of money.
There are so many more important things.
- Name one.
"- Well, happiness."
There are times when I feel I could trade all my wealth for just a sip from the cup of dreams.
"For a cottage, small, by a waterfall."
You're so understanding.
"Uh, tell me, what is your opinion of the privileges of love?"
- I'm in favor of them.
- I mean..
Do you think a woman in love is privileged to speak her mind?
How can you stop them from doing it?
"And Ágika increasingly better enthused into dreaming about the major, the major changed to increasingly more attractive one  and resembled hers father increasingly better."
Just as tall.
Just as stately.
Like that than the dad's beautiful motion
And brave and gallant!
And he does not have a purse.
He carries the paper money out in his pocket into little dumplings.
Rolls a bullet there only if it is necessary to pay
And from this everybody knows who he.
His soldiers worship it.
The reds and the partisans they take shelter in the forest crazily if they hear his name.
The reds and the partisans they take shelter in the forest crazily if they hear his name.
A hero!
- A major!
A military officer!
A military officer!
A military officer!
A military officer!
He comes.
Daddy!
For Tót family was an idea.
"They was thought that a major is tall surely, haggard,  his sword rings, his spur twangs."
They waited for a major like this
There it is.
It's him.
"Whoo, this only lieutenant."
- Mom!
- My small son!
Look at that.The Melcsó child.
- He grownes beard.
- They let him home.
Daddy.
Are you worried about that?
Yes
I will give in writing that I have sold it
You give in writing that you have purchased it
"That is right, you give in writing Have this"
Do you keep it ready?
All shop keepers ask for it
Do they ask for it?
All shopkeepers are brilliant people
Sign it Get Rs 5000
Hold it Bring it
Ah!
this is a brick
- Useless fellow
- Why this?
- For being a fool
If you have spent Rs 5000 usefully I can understand
But you have purchased a brick for Rs 5000
Are you trying to assault me?
"stay there stay there, you fool"
He is dead
I used to walk through streets with fear
Never knew when a decayed egg or acid filled egg will be thrown at
Now I come very peacefully All this is because of your son
Like 'soorasamharam' by Lord Muruga He has thrashed the MLA
You should be very proud as Arul's father
-Aunty
-How are you?
What do I lack?
Your son looks after me very well
How are you uncle?
You are just 4 streets away Can't you come to our house once?
Yes.
Carlotta told me that you're feeling anxious.
"More like, uh, terrified."
I have seen so many patients die.
You'd think that I'd know how to do this.
I-I...
Okay.
We're...
"We're here to help, and we... we want to, so we've set up hospice care in your home."
But what else can we do?
"Uh, antidepressants or..."
"No, no, no."
Antidepressants take up to two weeks to work.
"By then, I'll be dead."
Ohh.
There must be something.
I'll try anything.
Okay.
I have a... a colleague at a palliative care center.
"And he's in clinical trials, treating terminally ill patients with psilocybin."
What?
Hallucinogenic mushrooms?
"- No, I know, Owen."
- Are you serious?
"I know what you're thinking, Owen, but it..."
Psilocybin has been tested all over the world to treat anxiety and depression in terminally ill patients.
"Apparently, people are having life-altering experiences."
What... what...
What kind of experiences?
"As far as I can tell, they're starting to see themselves as part of a larger whole."
"It's very spiritual, and..."
"And afterwards, death seems less frightening."
- Bastard!
I command you by the judge of the living and the dead to depart from this servant of God.
It's the power-
- Holy water.
It's the power of Christ that compels you.
-The power of Christ compels you!

What in the name of George Armstrong Custer do you think you're doing?
This demonstration is intended to dramatize... that I am unfit to wear any uniform.
- I am incompetent.
I'm insubordinate.
- And indecent.
This is a protest.
"Most of them are Scalerians, you know."
- Utter rogues.
Corruption's a way of life.
"- Yes, sir, but..."
"Can't fight worth a damn, either."
"It's a security problem, General."
It means that whatever's up there must be able to take information from databanks anywhere in the Federation.
- Really?
"- Yes, sir."
"What, you mean, troop movements, that sort of thing?"
"An open book, General."
Then put a stop to it at once.
"Yes, sir, well, if you would authorise a search and destroy mission..."
Absolutely.
"No, Commissioner, the video system's been destroyed."
"All right, Leitz."
- See nothing's touched and inform the General.
- I already have.
He's here.
Good.
Tell him I'll take charge of the investigation.
We need an arrest before Headquarters are told of Practor's death.
"Somebody wanted to make very sure of him, eh?"
"Commissioner Sleer said to touch nothing, sir."
- Sleer's taking charge?
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, it's a police job, I suppose."
- You searched the apartment?
"- Yes, General."
The computer must have let him in.
So the killer is somebody Practor knew.
I'd say that limits the field a bit.
-Normal?
No.
I would probably be a bit taken aback from it.
I would probably go crazy if they were here.
"I haven't the time to respond to anything, I'm going to a meeting."
That sublime expression...
It's possible to see it when they are thinking.
"When I'm thinking, you can't see anything on me."
Nothing at all.
Really.
But you are forgetting that we don't need to think.
So we can continue.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Certainly.
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
How would I react...
"Calmly, the same as to any other visit."
How fluid their walking is.
Just look.
We are not walking we are shambling.
"Yes, we are shambling."
Calm down.
They'll also be shambling.
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
I'm already too old for this.
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
Hard to say.
Thank you.
"You're from television, aren't you?"
They have questions like this.
"I don't know how I would react, you know."
Please don't put this on television.
I can do it right now.
Chakotay to Paris.
Is the rescue team ready?
Standing by.
Prepare for transport.
"Deflector ready, Commander."
Initiate the radion beams.
Sending out the first volley... Is working.
They're getting through the shields.
Begin the transport.
"Transporter Room 2, synchronize your confinement beams to..."
That came from the surface.
Maximum shields.
Damage report.
Shields at 90 percent.
That was a precision hit right to the source of the beams.
Main deflector is now off-line.
We're being hailed from the surface.
On screen.
Your attempt to penetrate our defenses is a hostile act against the Mokra Order.
There are now 85 phased- ion cannons targeted at your ship.
"If you don't withdraw from Mokra space in two minutes, we will open fire."
Commander.
"Give me some good news, Mr. Kim."
There's a disruption in the shields around the prison.
That qualifies.
Good work.
"I wish I could take credit for it, butit's coming from inside the prison."
Can we get through?
"Yes, but the Mokra will detect our transport."
Sounds like they have other things to worry about right now.
That disruption might not be accidental.
"You cur, you've come to harm innocent people again"
Get lost
Attack
"Don't cry, come"
Come here
Don't be frightened
Let's go
"Your name, sir?"
I am Chang San Fang of wu Dong
So it's you
"I am Sheung Yu Chun, at your service"
Please arise...
"Hero Sheung, you've been wounded internally"
I was escorting young master to the south when I was injured by the Monk who is your master?
Chau Tsi wang of Yuen Chou head pupil of the Ming Cult
That's right
Young master...how are you?
...
His body is cold
He's been hit by the Freezing palm
I have also been injured quite badly and was seeking a doctor
If you trust me
"let me take him too, how about it?"
would you be referring to the doctor of the Butterfly Valley?
Exactly
I still have a favour to ask
Since I am seriously injured and cannot take care of two kids
Could you therefore take my young master to wu Dong to be looked after?
"Okay, don't worry"
Thank you
who is this kid?
His name is Chang wu Ji
She's anointing him with oil.
CARNARVON:
"Now, mind your heads on the way in, it's rather low."
"Morning, Carter."
How's it all going?
We're very busy now.
"If you could just keep clear, I'll be with you when I can."
"Right, yes, of course."
Shall we come back later?

Yes.

"As soon as Tutankhamun was old enough, his queen was expected to produce a child."
The future of Egypt depended on it.
"Without an heir, the empire could be flung into chaos on the death of the king."
"Incestuous marriage between royals might have made political sense, but producing a healthy child from a union between sister and brother was fraught with risk."
"Tutankhamun's queen, Ankhesamun, miscarried at least twice."
But even dead babies were considered precious.
They were of royal blood.
Each was mummified for eventual burial with their father.
ADAMSON:
Would you make space?
"Go back, come on."
Move out of the way there.
Make space.
Move out of the way.
Come on.
Make way.
Make way there.
Move out of the way.
"Come along now, make way, please."
"You down there, move."
- Think on thy sin.

"Ay, and for that thou diest."
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas... why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents;
but yet I hope...
"I hope, they do not point on me."
"- Peace, and be still!"
- I will so.
What's the matter?
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee...
- thou gavest to Cassio.
"- No, by my life and soul!"
"Send for the man, and ask him."
Take heed of perjury;
thou art on thy deathbed.
"- Ay, but not yet to die."
- Yes presently:
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
For to deny each article with oath... cannot remove nor choke the strong conception which I do groan withal.
- Thou art to die.
- Then Lord have mercy on me!
"- I say, amen."
- And have you mercy too!
I never did offend you in my life;
never loved Cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as I might love:
- I never gave him token.
- By heaven...
I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
O perjured woman!
Why did you inform him?
We didn't inform
-Kanmani  Senthil informed them
-Fortunately nothing happened to MLA
-Else it could have been a big problem
-MLA died
-What are you saying?
"When I dragged his body itself, his pulse stopped"
God is helping me in some form Nothing will happen to me

Spotless!

But it's not that I try to impose my will on other people.

"For me, it's very important to respect people."
But I enjoy it and...
I like that when I say something.

We could've kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
"They would have told their superiors, sir, given away our position."

"With all due respect, they didn't seem particularly interested in talking."

You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.

Almost.
I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid language.

The intelligence you show in buying property..
-..must be there in keeping the accounts too
- OK
- Leader
- Long live
- Tell me where is he?
- Anthony street...
"Dear, Wait for a moment Give it"
You may go now
Start the vehicle
Coming 28th is an auspicious day
The ceremony at our temple too is on that day
- We have informed all our relatives
- What is the function?
Our family deity is in Chethumadai There is an annual festival
It will be very special for 2 days All of you must come without fail
- Come
"- Brother, going to buy clothes for marriage, you also come"
We are buying dress for you too You come and select it yourself
"You go, we will come by bike"
Find out where he is Where is he?
"Sir, why are you doing like this?"
What do you want?
Why do they break everything?
How dare he touches our men?
- Are you so gutsy?
- He is not here
How many children have you begotten?
Don't hit him He doesn't know anything
Prepare the bier with green plantain tree I will send your son's corpse
Come
-Where are those boys?
I think it's important to have a craft
"Especially in your youth, it's all about craft"
Craft is the Excalibur
I understand
Yep
To master a craft one must have hunger and be stoic
That's what Japan lacks.
They're way to peaceful
Because they have no craft they easily drift off
Hipocracy runs amok and low fertility worsens
How is low fertility related?
"Too peaceful, lack of crisis mentality, devolution of the species preservation"
Excuse me
"It's hard to verbalize, but these peaceful Japanese should work to find some sort of craft"
This journey should grow to become a strong voice for our souls
And the craft we acquire will certainly help us out
Absolute confidence should become a source for originality
Individual concepts of value.
An invinsible personality
Courage to challenge something new.
It would make us so strong!
"Oh, do you wanna see Miyu's picture?"
"Yes, absolutly!"
That's her
Kinda nostalgic
"Wow, she's so cute"
Right?
She's such a nice girl
Is that Bon?
Yep
You haven't changed 62 months have passed and you look the same
A lack of progress it seems
"Matrakçı, Bali Bey had a long trip"
I want you to host him in the best way
You'll take care of him

Thank you for your care
My Sultana
"Come on, let's zoom in"
I'll tell you about our sculptures
"Bali Bey, let's first go to the place we will host you. have a rest."
I'll pick you up in the evening
You haven't been in the capital since a long time
Let's see what kind of clubs there are
Which women are new in town
Did the angels come from the paradise?
Got it
Get ready for the evening
I have the key to the paradise
Good
This unbeatable soldier is Heracles
Son of Zeus
"I mean, Hercules"
The most beautiful Diana
Virgin goddess of hunters
Twin sister of Apollo
They never leave each other
And Apollo
"The god that represents the fire, sun, art and music"
He's a bowman and also healer
He's a soothsayer too
He tells news from the future
They give me the creeps
I'm afraid they'll bring bad luck
"898 01:13:43,485 --&amp;gt; 01:13:46,715 Yes, you can dress up in my room, no one is upstairs."
"899 01:13:46,715 --&amp;gt; 01:13:48,000 Okay."
"900 01:13:54,342 --&amp;gt; 01:14:00,259 Mira, can you take Safari from us please?"
"901 01:14:07,638 --&amp;gt; 01:14:12,433 Okay."
"Safari, come here buddy."
Well done to you!
"902 01:14:14,700 --&amp;gt; 01:14:18,067 You won't be frowning like this all night, no?"
"903 01:14:18,067 --&amp;gt; 01:14:21,300 I am sorry but I am not in a good mood."
"904 01:14:23,000 --&amp;gt; 01:14:25,635 Do you know what is your problem ?"
"905 01:14:25,635 --&amp;gt; 01:14:31,900 You encountered love very early in your life, I mean each other.. 906 01:14:32,200 --&amp;gt; 01:14:34,585 It was the same with me too... 907 01:14:34,600 --&amp;gt; 01:14:40,000 but Faruk didn't let me from his hands."
We got married right away.
"908 01:14:40,135 --&amp;gt; 01:14:43,580 And this was the best decision in our live."
"909 01:14:46,100 --&amp;gt; 01:14:51,300 As child he use to say he would become an engineer, architect..."
Thank you very much!
"910 01:14:51,400 --&amp;gt; 01:14:54,232 I said, i wish, i wish... 911 01:14:54,232 --&amp;gt; 01:14:55,320 Ok, mom, enough!"
"912 01:14:55,320 --&amp;gt; 01:14:58,436 But now hope is born."
I know he will make it now!
"913 01:14:58,500 --&amp;gt; 01:15:01,900 She will be an engineer and architect, like you."
"914 01:15:02,000 --&amp;gt; 01:15:05,400 Hopefully!"
My mom is excited.
"915 01:15:05,483 --&amp;gt; 01:15:07,351 You should get excited, you."
"916 01:15:07,351 --&amp;gt; 01:15:09,749 Of course dear, make everyone be ashamed, 917 01:15:09,800 --&amp;gt; 01:15:14,500 Make gumtree (Great surprise) to those who say: "" He will be like his big brother"""
"918 01:15:22,600 --&amp;gt; 01:15:25,600 Come Safari.."
"919 01:15:32,800 --&amp;gt; 01:15:36,700 Run, come on."
"920 01:15:42,700 --&amp;gt; 01:15:48,100 Safari, come here please !"
"921 01:15:48,300 --&amp;gt; 01:15:51,200 Come on, let's go!"
"922 01:15:53,900 --&amp;gt; 01:15:58,900 Come here grass enemy, come!"
"923 01:15:59,100 --&amp;gt; 01:16:02,984 I am sorry, he escaped again... 924 01:16:03,000 --&amp;gt; 01:16:05,700 Safari loves us."
"925 01:16:05,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:08,000 Hello by the way...- Hello.. 926 01:16:08,200 --&amp;gt; 01:16:10,300 Look, it's Yaman!"
"927 01:16:11,300 --&amp;gt; 01:16:15,300 I saw him."
Are you okay?
"928 01:16:15,800 --&amp;gt; 01:16:20,200 I am fine, what about you?"
"1002 01:23:23,989 --&amp;gt; 01:23:26,826 I don't have to give you any explanation , 1003 01:23:26,900 --&amp;gt; 01:23:29,900 but just for you not doing any injustice to Mira, I am saying it again... 1004 01:23:30,038 --&amp;gt; 01:23:34,956 really there is nothing like you think,..."
"1005 01:23:47,500 --&amp;gt; 01:23:49,500 God, I got it again!"
"1006 01:23:49,513 --&amp;gt; 01:23:52,635 Congratulations!"
- Thanks!
"1007 01:23:54,700 --&amp;gt; 01:23:56,600 Darling!"
"1008 01:23:56,876 --&amp;gt; 01:23:59,556 Hello.. hello.. 1009 01:24:00,459 --&amp;gt; 01:24:02,917 Come on, another one!"
"1010 01:24:08,400 --&amp;gt; 01:24:12,400 What kind of feeling is to walk around between your creations?"
"1011 01:24:16,900 --&amp;gt; 01:24:18,800 With your permission!"
"1012 01:24:24,313 --&amp;gt; 01:24:27,430 Now the time is ripe for introducing ourselves."
"1013 01:24:27,756 --&amp;gt; 01:24:30,033 I'm Asim Sekip Kaya."
"1014 01:24:30,860 --&amp;gt; 01:24:33,416 Hello."
"1015 01:24:38,869 --&amp;gt; 01:24:41,150 It means finally you met."
"1016 01:24:41,316 --&amp;gt; 01:24:44,581 Yes, finally I met with the protagonist of the incident 1017 01:24:44,700 --&amp;gt; 01:24:49,300 In the tiredness of the big storm he caused 1018 01:24:49,392 --&amp;gt; 01:24:52,316 he joined us in activities ."
"1019 01:24:52,800 --&amp;gt; 01:24:57,700 The storm happened because of your prejudgments."
"1020 01:24:57,900 --&amp;gt; 01:25:00,100 Anyway the water stopped now."
"1021 01:25:00,200 --&amp;gt; 01:25:04,700 Let's hope that a reverse wind won't blow lateen!"
"1022 01:25:04,900 --&amp;gt; 01:25:11,200 Let's during the time in what side blows the wind."
"1023 01:25:15,599 --&amp;gt; 01:25:18,264 Enjoy..- Where is Mert?"
"1024 01:25:18,428 --&amp;gt; 01:25:20,760 He as around , but..."
"1025 01:25:22,103 --&amp;gt; 01:25:24,830 Ahh, hello.."
"1026 01:25:37,900 --&amp;gt; 01:25:41,700 How can I be so unlucky?"
"1027 01:25:54,054 --&amp;gt; 01:25:56,135 How're you doing?"
"1028 01:25:57,800 --&amp;gt; 01:26:00,400 Pretty well.."
"1029 01:26:18,951 --&amp;gt; 01:26:21,839 This is my last night here ."
"1030 01:26:23,059 --&amp;gt; 01:26:25,419 Really?"
"1031 01:26:26,400 --&amp;gt; 01:26:30,200 It means that after tonight everyone will be back to their world ."
"1032 01:26:30,381 --&amp;gt; 01:26:32,236 Exactly.."
"1033 01:26:35,785 --&amp;gt; 01:26:39,143 Super, then wish you good luck ."
"1034 01:26:40,429 --&amp;gt; 01:26:42,229 To you too."
"1035 01:26:43,353 --&amp;gt; 01:26:45,736 See you.."
"1036 01:27:20,398 --&amp;gt; 01:27:23,083 Where were you?"
"You took the day off too... 1037 01:27:23,200 --&amp;gt; 01:27:26,900 It was Nerges's birthday, I swear I stayed two hours."
This is step 2.
"OK, what is this?"
"In the figure above, three wires are braided."
"That is, by starting in the order A, B, C--"
"OK, so this is A, B, C-- and then the order changes to B right, because the yellow line is B-- A, C."
"And then we get B, C, A. Right?"
"There's just the order of the strings, left to right."
"Or the braids, or the wires."
OK.
"That is start with the order A, B, C, the outer left wire is brought over wire B, right?"
"This is brought over wire B, to the middle position forming the order shown in step 1."
"Than the outer right wire C, this one, is brought to the new middle position shown in step 2 and so on."
Alternately bringing each new left and each new right wire to the middle.
"At what numbered step does the braid first repeat the original order A, B, C?"
"So what you do is, you first bring the left over the middle, then you bring the right over the middle, then you bring the left over the middle, then you bring the right over the middle."
"So at step 3, what do we have to do?"
So step 1 we brought the left over the middle.
"So we went from A, B, C."
You essentially switch the left and the middle.
"And then step 2, you switch the right and the middle."
"So step 3, we switch B and C again."
Because we're back on the left-hand side.
"So you get C, B, A."
"And then step 4, you're going to switch to the right-hand side."
Step 3 we switched these two.
"Now step 4, we're going to switch these two."
"So you get C, A, B."
"Then in step 5, we're back switched on this side."
"So then you get A, C, B."
"And then step 6, you're going to switch to the right-hand side again."
"So you get A, B, C."
"So by step 6, we repeat."
"-	If they can that would be huge, but the Infestors are waiting below."
"Umm, viOLet is too good for that!"
He is not going to let that happen.
"-	Yeah, I think viOLet has actually done this, he's gonna kill the last Orbital, and with that, Polt is just going to run around the map with these Marines."
-	He is trying to get Vikings though..
But again he is supply blocked.
-	He can't build anything.
"He's got no supply, he's got like two Depots in the back of his natural, and that's..."
Just about it!
Is there a Command Center floating somewhere?
"-	There is a Command Center being built in the middle-right hand side of the map, but will viOLet see that?"
"-	Yeah, there is no Orbital, so viOLet can just burrow Drones right next to extractors."
"-	Wait, where is viOLet's last building?"
Where is it?
-	Oh My God!
-	Ohh!
"Another Yamato gets planted, and now we start to see the Yamato's incoming for Rain."
Oh no!
BoxeR loses the Ghost!
No EMP's possible now.
And there are the Yamato's going down.
He is picking off one Viking at a time.
He needs to avoid those Seeker Missiles.
"Huge number of Point Defense Drones, a very tense micro situation."
"Now we see the big engagement, this could be the final battle."
"The Ravens on the wrong side, trying to move forward, if he can get a big.."
"Ohh, big Seeker Missile could go off, but no!"
They are all out of energy.
"And it looks like in terms of the air battle, we do see 31 Vikings, more are falling for BoxeR, can he pick off all of the Battlecruisers?"
"And it looks like BoxeR might come out on top in the sky, but the seven Thors from Rain give him the victory there!"
"-	There are still 66 Probes up for HerO, so his economy is still fine."
"-	Yeah, wow."
"When I take their sum, I get positive 4."
So I can rewrite this equation here.
"I could rewrite it as x plus 7, times x minus 3, is equal to 0."
"And now I can solve this by saying, look, I have two quantities."
Their product is equal to 0.
That means that one or both of them have to be equal to 0.
So that means that x plus 7 is equal to 0.
That's an x.
Or x minus 3 is equal to 0.
I could subtract 7 from both sides of this equation.
And I would get x is equal to negative 7.
"And over here, I can add 3 to both sides of this equation."
And I'll get x is equal to 3.
So both of these numbers are solutions to this equation.
You could try it out.
If you do 7-- negative 7 squared is 49.
"Negative 7 times 4 is minus 28, or negative 28."
And that does indeed equal 21.
And I'll let you try it out with the positive 3.
"Actually, let's just do it."
"3 squared is 9, plus 4 times 3 is 12."
"9 plus 12 is, indeed, 21."
Let's do a bunch more examples.
Let's say I have x squared plus 49 is equal to 14x.
"Once again, whenever you see anything like this, get all of your terms on one side of the equation and get a 0 on the other side."
That's the best way to solve a quadratic equation.
So let's subtract 14x from both sides.
We could write this as x squared minus 14x plus 49 is equal to 0.
"Obviously, 14x minus 14x is 0."
This quantity minus 14x is this quantity right there.
"Now we just have to think about what two numbers, when I take their product, I'm going to get 49, and when I take their sum, I'm going to get negative 14."
"So one, they have to be the same sign because this is a positive number right here."
But I think it's too early to say exactly how it will be played out.
We're
looking forward to the partnership announcements later this year. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA:
"Florian Samuel Paargia, TWN."
What about the responsibility from Google?
"You asked where can I find the Egyptian things and stuff, then you got the answer at the Pergamon Museum."
"I assume most of the people believe that now, but that answer is wrong."
"Your time is--in Berlin, I assume, very limited, so if you want to see the Egyptian stuff, you get that information, now, you're ending up in the wrong museum."
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Okay, so what was the right museum? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA:"
It's in the so-called Old Museum and Altes Museum.
It's very close to it... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA: ...but the Pergamon Museum is, as far as I know, not known or famous for Egyptian stuff."
It's famous for something--other things.
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Okay.
"Well, I will--I will defer to the--to the unique knowledge that this audience has to debate that point."
Thank you.
More questions. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:
This is Kelvin from Shenzhen State
Micro Technology in China.
First question is about the applications to Hugo.
"Just now, you were playing the Lady Gaga, Just Dance, and you will have to stop it by finger-click, right?"
You can't stop it by yelling at it?
Can you stop it by yelling at it? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Can you yell at--if you yell at the Lady Gaga video, it will stop? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:"
To stop it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Or will she yell back?
"Do you have a personal relationship, Hugo, with Lady Gaga? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:"
"Oh, I don't know."
"The question actually is about, is your Android platform the ear of your supercomputer, or if the voice control can control the mobile phone itself? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Hugo, do you want to go ahead and answer? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
"Okay, so put some ones down here."
This is the last n-by-n block.
"Put some ones there, and this is N plus one down."
Put it there.
Put it there.
"So let's put these 1's down, cuz it's easy."
Then we'll work on these last four.
Everybody good with that?
Okay.
"We'll start this back up, we can have the lights back down, mood lighting."
"There we go, so first of all I guess we'll have to do that, get rid of that seven."
So first let's go ahead and put in those 1's.
So first of all we have -four on the diagonal not one.
"Second of all, we have 1's on the edges."
"We have a, two 1's out there, and then we have two ones over here."
"And what do they, where are they located?"
"Well, the two, if you look at what we did here, and at my notation this at, all the way at negative N, minus M. And this is it, minus M."
"And is five, this is, so there are four by 4s that are sitting inside of these things, right."
"Cause I picked five points, but really it's the interior four that matter, okay."
Alright.
And then over here I have M and N minus M. If I do a spy on that.
Here's what I got so far.
Look at that.
Kinda nice.
Laying down some diagonals.
Everybody cool with that?
Alright.
I've laid down the easy ones.
"So, so what I'm working with is the M I picked is how many points I'm going to happen this way and this way."
"So, right?"
"I have five points, but remember the last point is the same as the first so it's really and four."
"That's why I come down here and say, I have a four by four block right here, and at the fifth location, I drop this."
"Good, so, I'm not gonna write it out, but you can write this out, ok?"
I'm gonna put dot dot dot there which means you finish the argument.
Ok?
"The other thing, of course, to check is that q and q are not zero."
Are they not zero?
"Well, by the ordered pair... the set we defined, it's not."
So you don't have to worry.
"Ok, great."
What is the second thing that you might check?
Symmetry!
"Ok q... is p coma... ok, what does that mean?"
"If p q tilde m n, does that imply, m n tilde p q?"
"First of all, do you agree that this is what we have to show?"
Good.
"Secondly, do you... can you see how you write this out?"
"Which, I won't bore you with."
"Yeah... this condition mean p m equals q n and this condition means this this equals this this, m q equals n p, is that the same thing?"
"Yes, Adam says it's the same thing, so, again, I'll let you finish that argument."
"Now, the third one is perhaps the most interesting one."
The third thing to check.
"Because if you look at it, it's actually not so obvious."
"Oh, I realize I could have used that board, but that's ok."
"Ok, this one says if p q tilde m n..."
"I gotta check that this... and if m n tilde... give me another pair of letters, maybe a b, then, is it true that p q tilde a b?"
There is a question.
Is that true?
"Ok, so this actually where it is very important to just be a little careful, ok?"
"So I'm gonna give you a hint as to how one goes, and you can verify this, ok?"
For a little bit of homework for next time.
"So one thing that you'll have to use... so try this... so, you'll have to use a property of the integers, which is the cancelation law."
"You don't have division, but it's the next best thing to division."
Ok?
"I like the white, white pages."
"White, easy to read white stuff."
We get some people in here that like to work too much.
"White on the dark, and making him really dizzy. ,, ."
"I used to, um, I used to be in charge of a lot of the websites for a university."
And I imagine that dealing with academia is very similar to dealing with the government. .
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, science is academia, science at Stanford."
"Exactly, it is."
"Really challenging, and I feel your pain. ,, ."
"Yeah, but it's, it's, it's, yeah."
"It's a, it's a challenge.'Cause I do want done."
"And, you know, it is hard to work on a team."
"Because everyone has a different, uh, view of what a website should look like."
"Well, and I think that the biggest challenge for me was getting, getting."
People to understand that the website isn't about them and it shouldn't be what they want.
"It should be for the audience, who is going to the website and how do they consume information in, in the easiest, most efficient way."
Yeah.
Right.
And that's what the content management system department.
"Exactly. , can be the other way around."
"But um, I, like I said, you're side is very helpful, I, you guys have so many good programs I wish I had more time to just sit and just watch some of them."
And then I got this new DA 100 camera but there's really not much happening there for that one. .
"But uh, we do have some digital uh reflex uh, it's at least for the moving piece, um, that's the part I. Used to."
"I mean, I bet my constant was a negative 79."
"I mean, forever."
"But uh, there's digital ones that are, they, they have a lot more stuff, they're a"
little more complicated.
They do.
"I have um, a 90, a D 90."
"The, oh yeah, yeah, the"
D 90.
You divide by something is the same thing as multiplying by its inverse.
So I'm multiplying by the inverse of 1/4.
"So this is going to be equal to-- well, we could divide the numerator and denominator by 2, so the 4 becomes a 2, the 2 becomes a 1."
"5 times 2 is 10/1, So it's just 10."
Part B.
Or let me do every other one.
C. 5/11 divided by 6/7.
"Once again, this is the same thing as 5/11 times the inverse of 6/7, so times 7/6."
"And so we get, this is 5 times 7 is 35 over 66."
And that's in lowest common form or simplified form.
So E.
Let's do E.
"E, we have negative x over 2 divided by 5 over 7."
"Once again, this is the same thing as negative x over 2 times 7/5, which is equal to negative 7x over 10."
Think you're getting the hang of it.
Let's do part G here.
We have a negative 1/3 divided by negative 3/5.
"Well, this is going to be the same thing as negative 1/3 times the inverse of this, times negative 5/3."
I just swapped the numerator and the denominator.
So this is going to be equal to-- the negatives cancel out.
A negative times a negative is a positive.
1 times 5 is 5.
3 times 3 is 9.
Let's do one more.
Let's do I.
Part I. 11 divided by negative x/4.
"Once again, this is the same thing as 11 times the inverse of this."
"The multiplicative inverse of it, times negative 4/x."
"And if this confuses you-- actually, I shouldn't write multiplying."
That looks just like an x.
I should say this the same thing as 11 times negative 4/x.
"Or you could view this as 11 over 1 times-- you could even view it as negative 4/x, which is equal to minus 44/x, or negative 44/x."
So it has this four pattern.
"So can we come up with any term that is a multiple of 4, what is our value?"
Well at 4 our value is minus 3.
What's the next multiple of 4?
8.
At 8 our value's minus 3.
So in general-- and if we did 12 we'd also get minus 3.
If you don't believe me you should try it out.
"So at any multiple of 4, we know our value is minus 3."
"So what I do is, they want to know the 55th term."
So what term is a multiple of 4 that's closest to 55?
"Let's see, is 56 a multiple of 4?"
Yeah.
56-- that's 10.
"14 times 4 is 56, right?"
"So the 56th term, we know the 56th term because 56 is a multiple of 4, just like 4 and 8 and 12."
So the 56th term-- I have trouble saying that.
Maybe I have a little lisp.
"56th term is negative 3, right?"
Because it's a multiple of 4.
"If the 56th term is negative 3, what is the 55th term?"
"Well the term before the negative 3 term is always the negative 5 term, right?"
"Up here, negative 3?"
It's always negative 5.
"So the answer is negative 5 is the 55th term, and that is choice A."
Very good.
"All right, let's move on to the next question."
"I know that one's a little hard, and those you always just have to experiment a little bit, try to see the cycle, and then make sure you have your terms right."
You know that you're starting on the first term as opposed to the 0 term.
And then figure out what the easiest value is as close what they're asking as possible and then you can kind of move backwards or forwards.
That's how I do it.
That's so you don't get too confused with the shifts on the terms.
Real stories.

"Maybe it's in their eyes, ""So amazing, it truly is""..."
"Maybe it's their smile, ""look at that smile, how can you not love this guy?""... whatever it is, ""it's great to see all these kids smile""... these cheerleaders sparkle."
"""It's a gift, it is a gift, there's no other way to say it."""
Patty Mitch is the head coach of the UW Platteville Cheer and Stunt Team.
"The team has 30 athletes, but this year, she brought on eight new members called Sparkles."

"He just got me right from the very beginning, and we laughed all the time, and he just was my best friend."
"When she was and Jim were together, it seemed like that was gone."
That didn't matter.
All the baggage of the memories that she had were what kind of put away.
"For a few years, she had doctors to help her, a husband's who adored her."
"Then two years after the marriage, tragedy."
"Jim, a diabetic, died of a stroke at the age of 42, another day relive in full pain over and over again."
And we could say time heals all wounds.
It doesn't for her.
"Her best friend, Wendy LaVoy."
"I think Jill's brave, and I think she has a lot of courage."
And she's my hero because of it.
I don't think she knows that.
She will.
"Before we go, she brings something for me-- an article from almost 40 years ago."
I was in my 20s.
I have no memory at all of this.
"Oh, my gosh."
I think you were working at the White House.
"Oh, good grief."
I was working at the White House.
"In her book The Woman Who Can't Forget, she says she's trying to learn to live forward."
"Inspired by her husband, learning to laugh at her difficult gift."
"What's so great about Jill is Jill will call me on any given day and she'll say, Wendy, do you remember what we did 20 years ago today?"
"I'm like, you're kidding, Jill."
I don't remember what I had for lunch today.

There is one place you must never ever find yourself.
"Whatever you think you're doing, don't."
[soft music plays]
"I guess love to me... is meant to be, you know, that warm feeling inside."
"Love is meant to make everything right, and everything complete, and everything whole."
"Love is meant to be, you know, as you see in the movies, the guy that pops into the screen, and steals your heart, and then never wants to leave."
"It's meant to be that white picket fence, that happy home."
"Like, I've looked for love... but I can't say I've found it in any one person or in any thing."
The first thing I think about is pain.
"You know, it's... to me it's scary."
It's vulnerable... and love really really hurts I guess.
"I don't want to feel loved by them, I don't want to love them. 'cause it just hurts and I guess I've been hurt one too many times by people and,"
"I've gone there too much, that it just scares the hell out of me, so when I get close to feeling love, I'll run."
"look, pray for us.."
You too pray for me go don't worry come on woman.. where is your drum? oh shit I forgot it.. never mind she brought it thank you Balçiçek.. how do you take this microphone out?
Ok.. go now are you ready?
"1,2,3000 hello dear guests.. welcome all..."
Tonight we will have a lot of fun.. me and my aunt oh I mean me and Mrs Kadriye will entertain you tonight although we are new to show bizz
Tonight we will dance and sing.. oh aunt kadriye stop thumping that drum..
I cannot hear myself talk..
I will give you time to play solo at the end of the program..
Why are you laughing?
She was always like this even when we were kids.. she didn't play the drum then but she used to hold it and hit our heads with it she's a real witch.. she is..
let's hear the drum aunt Kadriye..
"""Hoppa"""
Oh Great!
Why are you laughing?
Hey blondie why are you laughing???
You!! how can you laught with only 1 tooth in your mouth.. yeah you!.. they laugh a lot at everything..
Are you ready? we're ready
Ok let's start
We will start with a song
It was a wonderful concert.. thank you so this means you forgot last night
At one moment I began daydreaming and forgot everything
Who am I.. and where am I.. and what is this place
I just went with them and started daydreaming
Excuse me.
"I had to speak politely as the last time don't worry, be at ease.. it suits you more"
Aunt Kadriye it seems we have succeeded
I'll close my store and go on with show bizz from now on you're right
Get up girl and dance.. such a fool it seem they perfected the job
I hope they finish before they face any problems
God willing
"The food was extremely delicious when it comes to cooking, Nakiye is excellent"
Shewket what do you do?
So this is going to be 9 plus 27 is 36.
So that is 36.
"And if we want to add it to negative 81 over 4, we just have to find a common denominator."
"So all of this business is going to be equal to 2 pi times-- and so our common denominator can be 4, times something over 4."
"We have negative 81 over 4, and then 36 times 4 is 144."
Is that right?
"Yeah, that's 144."
"So 36 times 4, so it's plus 144."
30 times 4 is 120 plus another 24 is 144.
"So you have 144, essentially, minus 81."
"So this is going to be equal to 2 pi times-- and actually, I can even simplify it"
"little bit more, because we have a 2 here and a 4 there."
So divide the numerator and denominator by 2 so you get it over 2.
So you're going to have pi times-- this is going to be 44.
Let's see.
"If this was an 80, this would be 64."
So it's going to be 63.
Let me write it this way.
It's going to be 63 pi over 2.
Did I do that right?
60 plus 81 is 141.
"Add another 3, you get a 144."
Yep.
And we're done.
We figured out the volume of our front of jet engine-looking shape.

I dreamed a dream in time gone by.
"When hope was high, and life worth living..."
I dreamed that love would never die...
I dreamed that God would be forgiving...
"And I was young and unafraid... and dreams were made and used and wasted... there was no ransom to be paid... no song unsung, no wine untasted... but the tigers come at night... with their voices soft as thunder... as they tear your life apart... as they turn your dream to shame... and still I dream he'll come to me that we will live the years together but there are dreams that cannot be..."
There are storms we cannot weather...
When I stack another mass on here-- so let me redraw it actually down here.
Because it's a different case.
"And I apply the same force, and now I have this new mass on here."
I'll do it in red.
This is m1.
The problem tells us that my new acceleration is 1/5 of the original acceleration.
So it's 1/5 of whatever this was.
So it's 1/5 a sub 0.
"So the question is, what is the ratio of m sub 0 to m sub 1?"
So m sub 0 to m sub 1 is equal to what?
And I'm going to keep it in abstract variables just to confuse you.
And then I'll show you that you can actually substitute numbers and the problem becomes a little easier.
And you might want to pause it and try it for yourself.
So let's work it through.
So we know we have this relationship to start off with.
"And just for simplicity, let's write what m sub 0 is in terms of F and a."
So we just divide both sides by a sub 0 and you get F sub 0 divided by a sub 0 is equal to m sub 0.
Good.
So let's just put that aside for a second.
And let's do that same relationship here with this.
"So here, this relationship tells us that F sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0 times this new acceleration, which is 1/5 a sub 0."
"And so, if we divide both sides by this term right here, we get-- dividing by 1/5 is the same thing as multiplying by 5."
So you get 5 F sub 0 over a sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
I just divided both sides by this term right here.
"Well, what's F sub 0?"
What's this?
Let me switch colors again.
What's F sub 0 divided by a sub 0?
Well it's here's.
It's what we solved for in the beginning.
We just got it from this relationship.
So we could substitute.
Subtract 8 from both sides of this.
You get x could also be equal to negative 8.
Let's do one more.
"Just to really, really get the point drilled in your head."
Let's do one more.
Let's say we have 4x squared minus 25 is equal to 0.
So you might already see the pattern.
This is an a squared.
This is a b squared.
"We have the pattern of a squared minus b squared, where, in this case, a would be equal to x, right?"
This is 2x squared.
And b would be equal to 5.
"So if you have a squared minus b squared, this is going to be equal to a plus b times a minus b."
"In this situation, that means that 4x squared minus 25 is going to be 2x plus 5 times 2x minus 5."
"And of course, that will be equal to 0."
And this will only be equal to 0 if either 2x plus 5 is equal to 0 or 2x minus 5 is equal to 0.
And then we can solve each of these.
Subtract 5 from both sides.
You get 2x is equal to negative 5.
Divide both sides by 2.
You could get one solution is negative 5/2.
"Over here, add 5 to both sides."
You get 2x is equal to positive 5.
Divide both sides by 2.
You get x could also be equal to positive 5/2.
So both of these satisfy that equation up there.
Now we can write down our precise definition of dimension.
"So if we do what we've been doing, we create a geometric structure from a given D-dimensional object,"
"like a 1-dimensional object like a line, a 2-dimensional object like a square, etc., by repeatedly dividing the length of its sides by some number N."
"So, when we were bisecting the sides , the number N was two (2)."
"When we were trisecting the number N was 3, and so on."
"This is our recipe, and we saw that at each new level we got N raised to the D (N^D) copies of the previous level."
Uht-oh.
That brought us to seventy.
We want to show fifty two.
What happened was we weren't paying attention to the scale or the units.
The value between each of our numbers is ten because this number line counts by tens.
What we really want is two jumps of one and that will bring us to fifty two.
Be very careful to pay attention to the unit marks on the number lines.
Let's model forty five on a number line.
As we see these numbers come up we're watching our scale and see it counts by ones.
"It starts with thirty five, goes to thirty six, thirty seven, thirty eight, and so on."
We have four tens in forty five.
We can start at forty.
"Five ones, we can do one jump of five."
Forty to forty five.
If we model eighty nine on the number line
"-again let's look at our scale- eighty, eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, and so on."
I see this is counting by ones again.
Eight tens is eighty.
"And, we have nine ones."
We could handle this in a couple of different ways.
Let's think about doing what we did last time.
A jump of five; eighty to eighty five.
"Then we need to do one, two, three, four more jumps of one and we're at eighty nine."
Let's try a three-digit number.
One hundred thirty two.
"Ninety, ninety five, one hundred, one hundred five."
Our number line counts by fives  so we need to think about that as we're working.
"We have one hundred, three tens, so let's jump three tens."
"I have to do five and five is ten, twenty, thirty (three tens) and two ones."
"One, two, and that brings us to one hundred thirty two."
Let's model two hundred fifty three on a number line.
"Two hundred, two hundred ten,  two hundred twenty, two hundred thirty."
And he's in the seventh grade.
"So what happened to the fourth grade, the fifth grade, and the sixth grade?"
"I mean, something's wrong."
"At that point, I did think I was dumb."
"I was stupid, like, why can't I read?"
"All my friends go to Latin, Boston Latin, one of the best schools-- probably the best school in Massachusetts, like, an exam school."
They read fine.
Why can't I read?
Adam was too old for the early intervention remedies and the school's solution to help Adam sounded better on paper that it was in reality.
They said Adam needs a small classroom setting.
And where did they send him?
It's like going into prison.
"He's down in the cellar, in a little room about this size with 12 other kids."
"So instead of working on ways to make it in school, Adam started working on ways to get out of school."
I went to the school and went room to room to room to his teachers.
Some of his teachers had never seen Adam.
And this is two months into the school year-- had never seen him.
"You take school out of that age, you take it away, you take it out of the picture, what else is there?"
"There's marijuana, there's stealing cars."
"I mean, what else is there for a kid?"
So you run the streets.
"And you run the streets, you get in trouble."
You make bad choices.
Adam was so-- he was mad.
He can't read.
Adam's parents knew it was time for professional help.
At the Boston Medical
"Center, Doctor Andrea Weiss, a clinical psychologist, gave Adam a new battery of tests."
What we're going to do first is I'm going to give you some reading lists.
And what I'd like you to do is just read down the list out loud.
And if you come to words you don't know--
Doctor Weiss's tests provide a kind of road map to when Adam's learning skills hit the wall.
And each of these wires connect two
letters into a pair.
"So in this case, you might see, the letter Q is going to connect with the letter E. Now you make 10 of those pairs."
Two letters in a pair will swap over.
"So if Q is connected to E, then Q and E would swap over."
That's an extra level of scrambling only available to the military.
"Now, this had the most number of combinations."
"Now, this calculation is going to be the hardest calculation, but we can do it."
So there are 26 letters in the alphabet.
How many ways to arrange 26 letters?
"Well, it's 26 times 25 times 24 all the way down to 1."
That's 26 factorial.
But we don't want every combination of 26 letters.
We only want to make 10 pairs.
"So that means there are 6 letters left over, which we don't care about."
"Because we don't care about them, that means we're allowed to divide."
And we're going to divide by 6 factorial.
Now there are 10 pairs.
We don't care what order those 10 pairs are in.
"Because we don't care about it, we can divide by 10 factorial."
"And the last thing to divide by, 2 letters in a pair."
"Well, if I swap them over, that would still be the same pair."
"If I had A and B, that's the same as B and A. That's still the same pair."
So I can divide by 2.
And I do that for each pair.
"There's 10 pairs, so I'm going to divide by 2 10 times."
Just 2 to power 10.
And that is how many ways that you can connect 20 letters into 10 pairs on the front of the machine.
How big is that number?
Shall we do that?
"150 trillion, 738 billion, 274 million, 937,250."
"So the total, 158 quintillion, 962 quadrillion, 555 trillion, 217 billion, 826 million, 360,000 flat."
"And if you multiplied that times that, you'd get 1."
Part B.
I'll do all of these.
We have 2/8.
"The inverse of 2/8 is 1 over 2/8, which is the same thing-- this is equal to 1 times the inverse of this."
"Times 8/2, which is the same thing as 4."
"Now immediately, you might see something."
"I guess, you see a pattern here."
"If I take 1 over a fraction, the result is the fraction swapped."
So the inverse of 2/8 is 8/2.
You just swap the numerator and the denominator.
So let's apply that to part C.
"If I have negative 19/21, its inverse is just going to be you swap the numerator and the denominator."
Negative 21/19.
"And if you were to multiply these two numbers, you would get 1."
The negatives would cancel out.
"The 21 and the 21 would cancel out, the 19 and the 19 would cancel out."
Part D.
"The inverse of 7, multiplicative inverse, is 1/7."
"And then finally, let's do E."
So the inverse of-- so they give us z to the third over-- so it's negative z to the third over 2xy to the third.
"So the multiplicative inverse of that-- one of the harder words for me to say-- is just going to be equal to-- so that's the inverse-- is going to be 1 over this, which is just going to be negative."
The denominator becomes the numerator.
2y to the third over z cubed.
Now let's go to this next section.
Divide the following rational numbers.
Be sure that your answer is in simplest form.
"So I'm just going to do every other one of these problems, just so that I don't use up all of your time."
So let's do this first one: part A.
"Well, I'll do it over here."
Part A. 5/2 divided by 1/4.
This is the same thing as 5/2 times 4/1.
"""A week."""
"Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped."
"He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking."
"And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was, in that second."
"And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time."
(Laughter)
"And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done, and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen, and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno, and I'm like ... (Laughter)"
"Melanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up."
Albert hands me the knife.
"I go in, tail comes off."
"I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off."
"Albert instructs, ""Push it way up there."""
I do.
"""Push it further."""
I do.
"The testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs, coming right at you -- and he says, ""Bite 'em."
"Just bite 'em off."""
"And I heard him, I heard all the words."
(Laughter)
"Like, how did -- how did I get here?"
How did -- you know -- I mean -- how did I get here?
(Laughter)
"It's just -- it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own: and suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies, and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy."
"You know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity."
(Laughter)
"And I'm like, ""What is this jacked-up metaphor?"
"I don't like what I'm thinking right now."""
"And I can't get this thought out of my head, and I can't get that vision out of my sight, so I did what I had to do."
I went in and I took them.
"I took them like this, and I yanked my face back."
And I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin.
(Laughter)
"Jack had a bucket in his hand, a chicken under his arm, and a pitch fork and a rope at the end of which there was a goat."
"And Jill said, I am feeling very nervous."
"Jack said, Why? I am afraid you may have your way with me."
I am alone with you.
"He said, What do you mean?"
I didnt do anything and my hands are full?
"So she said, You may put the pitch fork down, plant it in the earth, tie the goat to it, put the chicken down and put the bucket over it, couldnt you?"
(Laughter)
"And in the process of holding a relationship, the first moment of meeting the expectations may be common."
"But as every step that we take in life, the expectations may become different."
"Because these expectations keep changing in people, they are not consistent and they cannot be."
One person may be consistent with the same expectation throughout their life; another persons expectations may be changing because his perception and experience of life is changing.
Now relationships become great conflict.
(Applause)
A while ago an old client contacted me.
He was having some trouble at work and he was asking me for coaching
"It was in the early days of August, he was telling me he had some time issues, but I agreed,  so he sent me a message asking me,"
"""Can you make it on Tuesday  at 20 and 8 minutes?"
"The first thing I thought was,  ""At that time of the night?"""
"Plus, he was cynical, he asked for 20:08."
Couldn't it be at 8:30? or 8:00?
"Fine, I forgot about it."
"Ok, I texted him"
A week passed away.
"Next Monday  I sent him a confirmation message,"
"""Where do you want us to meet?"
"""At the office..."""
At that time in the office?
8pm?
Generally they're closed.
"Fine, Ok I tell him, ""I'll see you tomorrow."""
"Automatically he sends me a message,  ""Tomorow?"""
It spent most of its time in Algiers. ...and recently turned up and it went to Switzerland.
Now we have it.
It's a major discovery.
It's a unique piece.
"There is no other cast of it in bronze."""
The buste comes with its original wooden case which is covered with masonic symbols.
"It's on sale for 680,000 euro."
"Other gems at this year's Tefaf are paintings by El Greco, Auguste Renoir and Frans Hals."
This Rembrandt is the most expensive piece on exhibit.
The asking price is 35 million euro.
New York-based art dealer Richard Feigen says the global art market... ...remains buoyant as a result of continuing financial uncertainty.
"""There is a lot of liquidity, a lot of money out looking for art... ...and less and less art to buy with it."
"I think that reflects that art has effectively been monetized... ...and now seems to be regarded as an asset class, a place of refuge."
"People don't like the dollar, they don't like the euro, they don't like sterling."""
Security at the Tefaf art fair has been stepped up considerably this year.
"Last year, on the final day of the art fair, one visitor walked away with two pieces of jewelry... ...worth 860.000 euro."

[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I'm a..a..46 years old
I guess maybe you don't want to know that but I have a family a young family here in town a wife and 3 children.
I've been coaching here at the university for 13 years and I'm also a graduate of Western illinois 1987.
[Nick Spinozzi]
This is your 13th year coaching 12th or 13th?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
So line I can be 6x plus 5y is equal to 3.
So if we were to subtract 6x from both sides you get 5y is equal to minus 6x plus 3.
And then you divide both sides by 5 and you get y is equal to minus 6/5 x plus 3/5.
So this is line I right here.
I'll do line q in a different color.
So q is 5x minus 6y is equal to 0.
So let's subtract 5x from both sides.
You get minus 6y is equal to minus 5x.
"If you divide both sides by negative 6, you get y is equal to-- minus 5 divided by negative 6."
That's 5/6 x.
"Well, it actually looks like D comes into play."
Because the slope of this one is minus 6/5.
That's the slope of line l.
The slope of line q is the inverse of that made negative.
At this point it's a good thing to memorize.
I haven't proven it to you yet.
"If you want a line that has a slope perpendicular to this one, or a line that is perpendicular to this one will have a negative inverse slope."
So the inverse of this is minus 5/6 and the negative inverse is plus 5/6.
So this is the negative inverse of that.
So these lines are actually perpendicular.
So that is D.
See you in the next video.
We're on problem 27.
"And the question is, which equation best represents the graph above?"
"So before even looking at the choices, let's see what we can figure out about the graph."
So what's its y-intercept?
"So if we said that this is the equation of a line, we said y is equal to mx plus b where m is the slope and y is-- and b is the y-intercept."
"It's late, I'm getting slightly muddled."
So what's the y-intercept?
"Well when x is equal to 0, y is equal to 0."
So this is going to be equal to 0.
The y-intercept is 0.
Let me do it again.
"The Laplace transform of sine of at is equal to a over s squared, plus a squared."
And that's a significant entry.
"And maybe a good exercise for you, just to see how fun it is to do these integration by parts problems twice, is to figure out the Laplace transform of cosine of at."
And I'll give you a hint.
It's s over s squared over s squared plus a squared.
And it's nice that there's that symmetry there.
"Anyway, I'm almost at my time limit."
And I'm very tired working on this video.
So I'll leave it there and I'll see you in the next one.
I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before:
What is possible with the human voice?
What is possible with the human voice?
(Beatboxing)
♪ Ooh baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Cat meowing) (Dog barking)
Yeah.
(Applause) (Boomerang noises)
It was coming straight for me.
I had to.
"It was, yeah."
"As you can probably well imagine,"
I was a strange child.
(Laughter)
"Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be."
I was constantly experimenting with these noises.
And I'm still on that mission.
I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make.
"And the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises"
"I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it can't do."
And there's things that no one's voice can do.
"For example, no one can do two notes at the same time."
"You can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... (Two-tone singing)"
Please take good care of her.
Dong-Yi!
"You see this symbol, right?"
Don't forget this symbol.
"If you leave this symbol, this older brother will come find you."
You have to come and get me.
All right!
"Dong-Yi, I promise."
I'll come and get you
Brother Chun-Soo!
"I'm super excited for Family Fest, I actually just found out that my mother is coming which is really nice."
"She'll also be bringing my dog and my little brother, hopefully."
My mom is actually coming up for the first time since she came up first week of orientation.
"My parents have never been to Mac, so it'll be like ""here's my new home!"""
It'll be nice to have them here when I kind of know my way around a little bit more and I can sort of tell them about Macalester.
My grandparents are probably coming out.
"I didn't know they were still mobile, so that should be interesting."
"I'm running the 5k with my mom, and ""running"" is a loose term."
I'm betting my dad will attempt the 5k and then just not want to do it about halfway through.
And then he wants to go to a Wild game so we're going to try to hit that.
"Last year I did the 5k, which was pretty awesome."
Probably we'll be going to a play in Minneapolis hopefully and cooking dinner for her.
She's the best.
I'm also running the 5k with one of my roommates.
"Running, walking the 5k with one of my roommates."
I'm really looking forward to getting some nice meals in good restaurants.
"I don't run, I stand there and watch people run around."
I think we're going to explore Minneapolis because I've pretty much stuck to campus so far.
My mom says she wants to see my apartment.
We'll see how that goes.
I definitely have to clean my dorm room before then.
"I just want to see them, I don't know, they're nice people."
"And the sharpest rock on the wildest shore can never break that ocean apart, they can never wear that ocean down, because it's the ocean that shapes the shore."
That's what we're starting to do here today.
That's what we're starting to do here this week.
"With wave after wave after wave crashing against that shore, we shape it to our vision."
Thank you all for being a part of that.
[People shouting:
"""Thank you!"", cheering]"
"Well, how should I...?"
"I don't actually think I've ever given a talk on the history of Mozilla to a large set of people, which is pretty shocking..."
Ok!
So...
I'm gonna give it a try.
I'm not sure if I've actually given a talk on the history of Mozilla to this many people.
So that's probably an indication that I need to do more of it.
"Mozilla's been around for a long time, since 1998."
And I thought when we got started...
I'd like to ask:
"Of the people here, how many have been in Mozilla for three months or less?"
Can you raise your hand?
"Ok, excellent."
How many have been here a year or so?
That's a pretty good group too.
"Ok, how about the five year?"
Pretty good and I'm gonna say the ten year.
How many people?
"Who's around, though?"
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..."
So there's nine people in this room that have been working on Mozilla for ten years and more.
And there's probably another nine or ten people in this gathering today who have been here that long as well.
And so I'm gonna explain the different roles that we had in the early days.
"I'll try to name some names as we go along, I won't get all of those names, but if you see this people and have questions about Mozilla or Mozilla's history, find a good time and ask them, because we all have many memories."
"So, Mozilla started in 1998."
"Yes, so her family knows who we are."

"By the way, if you have his number... ...I can call him for you."
-Really?
-Yes.
"Anyway, he gave me this paper... ...and asked me to give it to anyone if he is late... ...and who will take this paper will drive me."
Give it to me.
It must be his number.
Maybe he is busy and it is not a good idea to call him
"Just give it to me, will make sure he is fine."
Or you don't want to see Hamada?
"Okay, but when my son come to take me... ...you must come to his house and have lunch with us."
"Please, whoever finds this woman... ...take her to the nearest elderly house."
"So let's do it, lets make a scatter plot."
"To make it easier, on the X axis, we'll say that the miles are in 10,000's."
"So 60,000 will correspond to say, 6 on this axis and the value of the car we'll say is in 1000's."
Click where on this graph these points belong.
Now look I had a fixed formula in all of those.
"If you call the data X₁, X₂ all the way to Xn where n is the number of coin flips,"
"I wonder which of the following formula do you think best capture as what we we're doing the sum/Xi, 1/Nsum/Xi, the product of Xi or 1/Nthe product of Xi."
"This is incomprehensible, Sir!"
They say they already recommended Commissioner Seo as the official in charge of the city!
Isn't that supposed to be your position?
How can your uncle treat you like that?
Don't get overexcited.
I've gained something much greater than that official status.
What?
"Power is not inherited, but is taken by those who wield it."
My uncle has taught me that lesson.
It was a good lesson.
"Even better, just sweep."
You know what I mean?
(Laughter)
And I am energizing myself  while I am doing that.
"I don't know whether it is helpful, but I think finding times during your day, standing in the copy room... (Bell) (Laughter)"
Thank you brother.
(R. Brady) One bell.
That's fine sometimes.
"Sorry, I'll go a little more faster."
"So, I think there are ways to ... (Laughter) (R. Brady) Outline the summary."
"Okay, thank you."
(Laughter)
(Bell) (Laughter)
"(R. Brady) Thank you Jon, I think this brings up a question that many of us have, which is if we bring mindfulness into our classroom, will there be less time for the other things?"
(Laughter)
So the answer is no.
Katherine Weare is a professor at the Exeter University in UK.
"She has been very involved in social  emotional learning, creating curriculum, and more recently, has been involved  with the creation and evaluation of the .b (dot-be) Mindfulness Curriculum which is developed for secondary students in England by mindfulness practitioners who  are teachers in secondary schools."
"- (R. Brady) So, Katherine ..."
- (K. Weare) Thank you.
Thank you for inviting me here.
"As you get that I am from England,  so I hope you'll understand the accent."
(Laughter)
It is great to be here and looking at these great crowded people can make you feel quite jumped-up really about yourself and feel you are very important  to be sat on this stage.
I went home once after a do like this and I said to my son- he was in the kitchen-
"""I had a great time."
"Somebody came up to me afterwards and said, 'I could listen  to you talk all day'."""
"He said, ""Only because we don't have to."""
(Laughter)
"But I am afraid you have to, for 7 and half minutes, whatever I have left."
"Like everyone here, I have a mindfulness story and it is very similar actually, to some of the earlier ones."
"I was sailing along as a very successful, in inverted commas, academic."
These Air Force guys.
"We can't pick a nice day - if it's windy we can't say, ""No, leave them float down there for a couple days."""
"So, they really practiced."
And they were good.
I was impressed with them.
The paramedics?
Yeah.
The Air Force.
They were before the Green Berets or before any special forces.
The Air Force had them in the 50s.
One other short one.
When I left Yemen when we flew back - we left Saudia Arabia or Beirut - and we flew back to the States so that was maybe 30 hours of flying time.
"30, 35 hours from Beirut back to Zl."
So they'd have a volunteer crew out over Christmas and single guys would always sign so that married guys could be home with the wives and kids.
So I signed up for it.
"It was like the 5th of May, and... went up to Pakistan up to Peshawar, where Gary Power, you know, the guy got shot down."
The U-2 pilot.
Yeah.
"Anyway, that was around that I happened to get on."
"Not a very particularly good run, because you're in"
Turkey and Pakistan...
"So, I couldn't even fly because I needed like 70 hours."
You could only fly 120 a month or 330 in three months.
So I was pushing my 120 hours flying time with getting back to the States... and then with this thing for a round trip.
So we get over there and spend the night there in civilian clothes.
"Normally we can stay in a pretty decent hotel but because it was Christmas Eve, they had us stay in the Embassy Compound because the Marine guards and everything like this just because there wasn't really any hostility with - animosity with - You weren't an American walking around on a Christian holiday, you know."
So we run up to Peshawar the next day
Christmas Day.
And had a load of stuff.
"Food, and, you know vegetables, perishables, whatever."
"Unloaded and they said, ""Hey, we've got a trailer over here."" It was like a 32 foot semi trailer and"
"""Can you haul that?"""
"This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert numbers into words."
"I store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers."
I know it sounds complicated; it's not.
"I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of ""Rain Man."""
(Laughter)
"There's definitely a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely."
Sorry.
(Laughter)
"If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then."
"By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here."
"If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, ""you're close,"" or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself."
"If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?"
(Laughter)
"Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK."
"So, without any more stalling, here we go."
"I'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683."
"57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931."
"38,931; double that to get 77,862."
"77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822."
"That seems right, I'll go on."
"Cookie fission, OK."
"Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion."
"Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489."

Yeah!

Chechnyah
"During our journey in this show 'Travel with the Quran' we have travelled to many countries to spot light The Quran institutes.. to find the miracles of the Quran around the World. and amongst these countries, is the Country of Chechnyah."
Everyone knows that Chechnyah have been through many wars and it finally became stabilized 6 years ago
When i first decided to come to Chechnya - people thought that the war is still on!! even my mother asked me:
Isn't There a war in Chechnyah?
I replied to her:
"""No mother, Chechnyah is now stabilized"" after it was stabilized.. their main focus was on the book of Allah swt and they have a great Quran institutes now"
This is why we came here to introduce to you.. the Kids of Chechnyah and how well focused they are When it comes to the Book of Allah swt
"Also to show you the Quran insititues here which I am sure you will love, here in Chechnyah but while I was recording, those two young boys were heading to register for Summer Quran classes so I've asked them to join me"
"May Allah protect them and keep the Quran firm in their hearts, and may Allah preserve you all as well."
"Ok, well, the moment we've all been waiting for.. this is what I'm getting Judy for May Day, these cool underwear things."
I'ts a new style for panties.
They were my mom's when she was little.
So I'm pretty sure Judy'll be really happy to wear my mom's used underwear.
Here I go.
"Judy, happy May Day; here's your new panties."
"Judy:Ew, get away!"
"Fred:How could you say that, Judy?!"
"Oh, my God!"
I'm so embarassed!
"Oh, my God, this is so embarassing!"
This is so embarassing!
I didn't get it on video tape but Judy put the panties on my head.
She's so mean!
Yet so attractive.
"Whatever, I guess I'll give them back to my mom."
I'm going inside my house and never coming back out.
Nobody understands me.
(singing) My May Day didn't turn out
How I wanted it to
Everything went wro-o-o-o-o-ong
I hope next year is better
I can't believe Judy threw panties on me (high-pitched note)
"Fred:Okay, well, that's all I have for you guys."
"I hope all you guys' May Day was better than mine, okay?"
"No need to rub in how good your May Day was compared to mine, no offense."
"Okay, well, see y'all."
(high-pitched note plays again)
The early detection of the risk of suffering from depression during or after pregnancy may reduce the negative effects in both the mother and the foetus.
"Researchers from the Universitat Jaume I in Castelló and from the Universidad de Zaragoza have developed the computer application 'Mamá Feliz' [Happy Mum], which enables to anticipate depression."
-The main objective of our project 'Mamá Feliz' is studying the risk factors which the scientific literature has proven to be related to the greater probability of developing depression during the pregnancy or after birth.
"Therefore, we have created a computer application, 'Mamá Feliz', which includes these variables."
"So here, more work is going to get done."
"And now my force, I would say, is maximal."
"So I've got lots, and lots of force finally."
And so it would be something like this.
"And so based on my curve, I've also demonstrated another point, which is that, the first issue, getting us from point one to point two, really helped a lot."
Really.
"I mean, that was the big, big deal."
Because you needed some space here.
"Again, this space really was necessary to do work at all."
"And now that we've gotten rid of the overlap issue, now that we've gotten these last few myosins working, we have even more gain."
But the gain was really-- the biggest advantage was in that first step.
"Now as we go on, let's go to step four."
So this is step four now.
"As we go here, you're going to basically see that this is going to continue to work really well."
"Because you have your actin, like that, and all of your myosins are still involved in making sure that they can squeeze."
So all the myosins are working.
And our titin is just a little bit more stretched out than it was before.
And our force of contraction is going to be maximal.
"And you're going to have-- and so here, I'm drawing the z-discs again."
They're very spread out.
Our sarcomere is getting longer and longer.
And our force of contraction is the same.
"Now let's just take a pause there and say, why is it the same?"
Why did it not go up?
"Well, it's because here, in stage three, you had 20 myosin heads working."
20 out of 20.
"Up here, you had something like 16 out of 20 working."
"Here, we said maybe zero out of 20 right?"
"And here, you again have 20 out of 20."
So you still have an advantage in terms of all of the myosins working.
But there's no difference between 0.3 and 0.4.
"Because again, all the myosins are working."
Peshawar and they've got rotor conveyors from the mess hall - little dinky ones.
"And they have big heavy duty ones and they're making these guys - the cooks, because they don't have a load crew there."
It was just a spook base.
They have the U-2s and the
RB57's and stuff like that there.
All spy stuff.
So we loaded it all up and I got it ready [?] comes out and hands me a can of beer and he already knew because we joked about this before.
"He put a can of beer under the front crew door and when I just barely touched the top, the plane was perfectly balanced."
Not [?] but you can fake it.
"Anyway, I did that and then I had him jump up and down the back."
"All these guys, to get it to rock a little - see how it stabilizes, you know."
But what I didn't realize was the wheels - they put the wheels on the ramp that slopes up in the back of the plane.
"So anyway, I chained it down."
You could really chain stuff.
He's back out there and I'm ...
They're tying it down and everything.
"So he says, ""Well, what do you think?"""
"I said, ""I'll sit in front of it."""
"He said, ""If you sit in front of it, I'll fly it."" I said okay."
So we take off and it was just a little bit tail heavy.
Not bad.
So we got down to Karachi and I just moved it forward about two inches.
That's all it took.
Swinging on into Germany.
Same damn thing again.
We pulled in there and we just backed a 40-foot flatbed up to the back end they dropped the ramp out and put a wench on it so we pulled the tires and they skidded this thing off.
There's another one of these E8s from Washington.
Wants to know where my manifest is.
I didn't have one.
How do you know this is it?
He's looking at this big trailer.
He knows it's not a ...
"Why don't you jump in the right seat."" So he put her in the right seat of a couple trips."
"And you handle the gear, you handle radio communications, do some switching."
Co-pilot.
"He said, ""Hey, Kathy, you stick with me, you'll have your 4-engine commercial in a year."""
But this... she's married to - they took the motorcycles and shipped them to Anchorage - from Anchorage down to Seattle.
Rode down through California with him and over through Vegas.
"Ran into a sleet storm in northern Arizona and I told her when she got to Seattle,"
"""Put your bikes in there."""
"""Oh, no, Dad, this will be nice."" ... what the hell, young, you know."
But when they run into bad weather they rented a van and put their bikes in there and drove it to North
Carolina.
"For some reason or other, he wanted to go there."
So she did good - she worked at IBM for a little while and then she got this job and she wanted the mechanic but now she's got her instrument rating.
She's got her
IA.
She can sign off any airplane made.
Or grounded.
And right now she's picking up her commercial license.
She's flying a brand new diamond.
"About $280,000 airplane, getting her instrument readings."
"Got the new flatscreens, instrument type stuff."
"It was funny, she called here last year."
She had to run in the middle of the night and - instrument time.
She went over to Myrtle Beach and over to South Carolina.
"But she was coming to Columbia the controller - it's nasty weather - it was real instrument time, it wasn't under the hood."
"So, he calls - a 737 is coming in behind her so -"
Whatever outfit it was - delta such and such or whatever.
"He says, ""Slow down a little bit."
I got a girl with a diamond up ahead of you.
"She's not quite your speed."""
"Kathy said, ""I damn near told him I could go that fast."""
She was coming in with this instrument.
Today... do what we prepare and present it to the audience

Now on problem 37.
And they say what is the value of xy minus yz.
"Statement one says, y is equal to 2."
"Well, that by itself doesn't help us."
That just tells us 2x minus 2z.
So if you don't know what x and z are you can't figure out what this whole thing is if you just know y is equal to 2.
So that alone doesn't help.
Statement two is x minus z is equal to 5.
"Now this is interesting because this expression, we can factor out the y."
What happens if we factor y out of both of these expressions?
I'm going to just rewrite it. xy minus zy-- I just switched the y and z-- that equals x minus z times y.
"Well, we can figure out x minus z from statement number two. x minus z, this is equal 5."
And we know what y is equal to from statement one.
So y is equal to 2.
So we can definitely figure it out as long as we have both statements and we can show that the answer is y is equal to 2.
"So the answer is, 2 times 5 is 10."
But we didn't have to figure it out.
We just have to know that we could figure it out if we had both of these data points.
"One by themselves, you wouldn't be able to solve it."
So the answer is C.
Both statements together are sufficient but neither alone is.
Problem 38.
"OK, they drew us a picture."
"Let me see if I can draw that same picture,"
looks like some type of device.
"So it looks like that and then they have the other end, and the other end looks like that."
"There are these handles, or something that looks like handles"
I haven't read the problem yet.
So they say will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?
So this is a book rack.
"Second, it has to be in this string."
So a1 does match this regular expression.
"We're looking for things like a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, etc."
There's actually an a1 in this string.
"So, yes."
2b does not match this regular expression.
"For this particular regular expression, the first letter always has to be a letter and not a digit."
This doesn't work out. b2 looks very promising.
"It's one of the strings we would match, except that it's not actually found in our haystack string."
"It can't be part of the return value. cc doesn't match, because we're looking for things like a1, b1, c1 that have a digit in the second position."
This is not a digit. cc3 does not match because it's three characters long and we're looking for strings that are two characters long.
"44 doesn't match, because it doesn't start with a through z. d4 looks very good."
"It's the sort of thing we would match from this regular expression, but it's not actually in our haystack string."
Instead we have 44d.
The empty string--this was a bit of a ringer or distracter thrown in-- doesn't match our regular expression.
It's too short.
"It's zero characters long, and we're matching things that are two characters long."
"But finally c3 matches our regular expression and it's present in the string, so yes."
And the answer is 88.
It takes 7 steps to go from start to goal if we just count the go straight steps.
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
"And we have to turn once in this spot right over here, which costs an additional -5, so we pay a total of -12."
That plus 100 gives us 88.

From kindergarten on there were signs of discipline problems.
So Nathan's parents had him tested.
They came up with a diagnosis of ADD without hyperactivity.
And so we knew that the pencils rolling on the desk or dropping or anything like that would probably take him off task.
It's like a jigsaw puzzle.
Some days I wake up and it's just like two or three pieces to put together.
And other times it's like 500 3D puzzle or something.
Ritalin was prescribed.
But Nathan's parents learned there was no magic pill.
We went up to 10 milligrams.
It helped for a little while.
But we still had the problems with getting the assignments home.
So his parents took him off Ritalin.
But now they had nothing.
"He would be real sad that he was not able to learn, that people didn't like him, that they were out to, you know, ridicule him or make fun of him."
He got to where he hated everything when he started school.
He didn't want to
"learn, didn't want to read, didn't want to write."
Didn't want to go.
He didn't want to go.
"A lot of times when, you know, he's not in a good mood and he's real irritable and says stuff like why am I even here and stuff, I get real worried."
I hope he doesn't get too drastic.
"And when he said, I just shouldn't be alive."
"I said, this child does not have to go through this."
His parents are desperate.
"For them, public school is not working and private school is too expensive."
"So his mom, Edie, is trying home schooling."
"Separated regions fight about borderlines, are reigned by different clans."
Some of them seek independence.
One could claim that the breakup of the state is related to the destruction of the National Theater.
Most of you will know the movie Black Hawk Down by Ridley Scott.
In one scene the US-pilots are flying over Mogadishu.
Their mission is to destroy the arsenal in the National Theater.
Ever since the theater has no roof.
"Only these metal bars are left as you see here,"
"And everybody is sitting under the open sky, as in ancient greek theaters."
Liu Xenfang is standing behind me.
"He is from Hongkong, about 55 years old,"
And he worked as a young man at the construction site of the National Theater in Somalia.
"When I'm standing in this picture, I always think:"
Please give the Peace Nobel Prize to this human being!
I showed him the picture once and told him what I think.
"Lui, Peace Nobel Prize?"
"He laughed at me and said, the only Chinese that got the Peace Nobel Prize, was a provocation of the West."
Liu how are the real human rights conditions in China?
"Well, China is ok, much more stable, than other countries."
"But, Liu, stability and human rights have no bearing on each other."
"Well, I think it has."
"Liu, China is the state with the most executions."
"You know, in some occasions, politics must kill the people."
"China is such a big country, it's hard to establish discipline, but you need it."
"When the construction of the theater was finished, Liu stayed in Africa."
"Now he runs a shop here in Nairobi, where he sells lots of different things."
"Plastic bags, clothes, mobile phones, akkus, shoes and so forth."
"There is one bestseller, which is this: a multi-band radio."
With slack joint.
"This is Ahmed, a friend of mine, from Somalia."
"He was born in Bonn, Germany, maybe he is not somali."
We studied together in Berlin.
"We'll give the whole class time to work with one deck of cards,"
"All 30 of you together, and see how fast you can sort it."
This will be interesting.
We'll [INDAUDlBLE] lab.
"Eh, and we'll see all these problems."
"So there are some common problems with eh, parallel programming, and I will cover three of them today."
The first one is called Race Condition.
The idea is that if two people are trying to use the same resources at the same time.
So let's look at this code.
"Let's say the balance is 100 and, the balance is 100."
The amount is 100 and two people want to withdraw 75 dollars each.
They could get a conflict in this code.
So let's actually try it.
We will set the balance to 500 and broadcast withdraw.
Each sprite with will recive withdraw and withdraw 300.
"And this is the code, the same code."
That if the balance is greater than the amount then set the balance to balance minus amount.
"And eh, so the buffalo withdraws 300 and the star withdraws 400."
So let's see what could happen.
"Eh, oops."
Edit.
Make this bigger.
Zoom in.
"Big, too big."
Maybe.
Still big.
"Okay, so what could happen, maybe the buffalo checks the balance, 500, is greater than his amount, 300, and it is."
And then he sets the balance to 500 minus 300 which is 200 and reports true.
"And then the star comes along and checks if 200 is greater than 400 and it's no, so he reports false."
And no problems right?
"But what could happen is that the star checks if the balance is greater than 400, and it is, and before it gets over here, before it gets to this set, the buffalo comes along and checks if 500 is greater than 300 and he says well, I, there's still enough money in there."
And then they both come in and set the balance to whatever they think it is.
"HerO, you know, I mean this is what happened, and this is what?"
The third game in a row now?
ZeneX Life is just really trying to kill him in about this time in the game and it hasn't worked out.
He is slowly building up a Corruptor count and kinda slowly moving towards that Hive tech.
But he is still on three bases.
"He needs to start taking more bases, it is obviously not working."
"-	There is 41 kills, 42 kills between the Immortals now, his micro has been so good with those, picking them up once again!"
"HerO, this is legendary!"
-	Unbelievable play by HerO.
Look at that!
These Immortals are living up to their name for the first time in Starcraft 2 history.
- 47 kills now and ZeneX Life continues to ride in.
"Still saving those Immortals, keeping those at the back."
"HerO, you are so good!"
"-	Ohh and he get one finally, but man!"
"This is a huge mistake here, ohh, Liquid HerO is getting a little bit far down the ramp, but he has got enough."
Nice micro with the Warp Prism again.
"Ohh, he gets the Warp Prism before the Colossus got down."
- And he kept the Immortal alive!
Just at the very last instant!
A 45 kill Immortal now.
- Target fire down these Probes to make sure that HuK cannot mine anymore.
"If NaNiwa can make sure that HuK has no more Probes left and no ability to make any more, the Stalker will be able to out micro the two Zealots all day long."
"With that being said, the Stalker is getting dangerously low on health."
"NaNiwa are still trying to target fire down those Probes, will it be enough?"
"The Probes getting so low on health, only two remaining!"
But the Stalker is getting so low on health.
NaNiwa has to be extremely careful if he wants to win this game.
"- This is coming down to the hit point bars, we can't let them go."
- Oh no!
The Stalker could get surrounded!
"- It is down to just seven hit points, three hit points."
And we said well the acceleration of the pulley is just half the acceleration of the block.
The pulley's velocity and its acceleration is half whatever the block's is.
And so we substituted that in for the acceleration of the pulley.
"And now we can substitute tension, which we solved here, for the-- my mind's getting flustered-- for the tension in this equation."
So what do we get?
We get 150-- let me move back to a nice color-- minus 2 times this expression.
This is the tension in the rope.
"10 times a, b, acceleration of the block, plus 39.2 is equal to 5 times 1/2."
Well what's 5 times 1/2?
It's 2.5 acceleration of the block.
So we have 150 minus 20 times the acceleration of the block minus-- what is this-- 78.4 is equal to 2.5 times the acceleration of the block.
Well let's add 20 times the acceleration of the block to both sides.
"Well, we'll just simplify this."
150 minus 78.4 is equal to 71.6.
So 150 minus 78.4 is 71.6.
So that's just this minus this.
"And I'm going to add 20 a b to both sides, so I'm essentially moving this 20 a b over on that side."
I'm skipping a couple of steps just to save space.
So if I add 20 times the acceleration of the block.
"That's not a, b."
It's a sub b.
You get 22.5 times the acceleration of the block.
"And this is a 6, not a block."
71.6 is equal to 22.5 times the acceleration of the block.
We're almost done.
So we divide both sides by 22.5 and what do we get?
Let's see.
"Divided by 22.5, and we get the acceleration of the block."
So that's this block right here.
The acceleration of the block is 3.18 meters per second squared.
That's how fast this thing accelerates to the right.
And we already figured out that the pulley accelerates at half that rate.
Let's do this last problem right here.
"The world's largest trench digger, Bagger 288, moves at 3/8 miles per hour."
"So its speed, or its velocity, or its rate is equal to 3/8 miles per hour."
We could write it like this.
How long will it take to dig a trench 2/3 miles long?
So we want to go a distance that's equal to 2/3 miles.
So we just remember that distance is always going to be equal to rate times time.
So our distance is 2/3 miles.
"That's going to be equal to our rate, 3/8 miles per hour, times our time."
"Or we could divide both sides by 3/8 miles per hour, so if we divide both sides by 3/8 miles per hour, we'll get our time."
So divide by 3/8 miles per hour.
Divide by 3/8 miles per hour.
This cancels out.
"So time, we're going to get time is equal to this."
So we have 2/3 miles.
Let me write it this way.
2/3 miles divided by 3/8 miles per hour.
"Or another way to think of it, that's the same thing as times the inverse, times 8/3 hours per mile."
I just took the inverse of this.
We divided by this.
That's the same thing as multiplying by its inverse.
And we inverted the units as well.
And so we'll see that the units cancel out.
"Mile in the numerator, mile in the denominator."
We're left with hours.
"And so this is equal to 2 times 8 is 16 over 3 times 3, 9, 16/9 hours."
"So like an hour and 7/9, or 1 and 7/9 hours to dig the 2/3 of a mile."
Welcome back.
"Now that we've hopefully, learned a little bit about"
"Newton's law, let's apply them to solve some problems."
"Let's say I have a-- I don't know-- some kind of vehicle, a car, a motorcycle or something."
"We can make buildings like trees, we can be carbon positive."
"We can look at a child and say instead of, ""Oh, shit, overpopulation"", we can say, ""Holy shit!"
"How nice!"""
Thank you very much!
The city swings and 200 dancers from 20 nations are swinging with it.
At the first Jazz festival in Heidelberg [Germany] over the weekend.
This is the first dance of my life;  I used to boycott the dance school
It is extremely multisided as you can be extremely creative and playful.
Because it is fun and you meet people; for example somebody like this.
There are nearly no rules.
You can't make mistakes.
Everything is  just a variation.
You can do what you want.
It is really the best dance that I know.
"Katja and Ali are dance partners, but also married couple."
They teach Lindy Hop all over Europe.
With the first Jazz festival here in Heidelberg they both realised themselves a dream.
"Swing is for the vice european vice champions not only a music and dance, but also an attitude towards life and limitless."
"It is like a language; first you learn the grammar in class and then everybody can ""speak"" with each other on the dance floor."
"New York, 1927:"
"Black and White, poor and rich,  meet on the dance floor in Harlem."
"At the Savoy ballroom the Lindy Hop is created, the most original way of swing dancing."
There are no written rules.
Lindy Hop thrives on improvisation.....
...to this day!
"That makes it so exciting, fun, sexy, full of energy!"
"The atmosphere is boiling in Heidelberg's town hall when the Shim Sham song comes on, one of the highlights of the evening."
But what would Swing and the 20s be without Big Band and dresscode.
"Part of it is a proper hair-do, the adequate outfit."
"It also makes you dance differently, compared to dancing in jeans and T-shirt."
"Katja and Ali met in Paris, dancing on the banks of the Seine."
And their enthusiasm is as fresh as on the first day.
"So, let's say that you have some data now from the, from the sets of families I mentioned."
And this is what the family unit looks
like.
"Now again, we have the genotypes, just for"
"A and B. We don't know anything about C except, by virtue of disease status."
Okay?
"So, [inaudible] are Aa, ."
"So, you know, they're heterozygous for both the A and B markers."
"416 of them were healthy, and one was diseased."
'Kay?
So most of them tend to be healthy if you're heterozygous for both.
"Those are little a, little a, little b, little b."
"Most of'em, or actually all of'em in this case, are diseased."
"If you're big A, little A, little B, little B."
"So you're homozygous for little B, but you're heterozygous A marker."
"So, you're mostly healthy, there's a couple of diseased individuals."
"And this case, little A, little A, big B, little B, most of them are diseased."
"So, look at this just a minute, and speculate whether you think marker A is closer to the disease-causing mutation or marker B is."
"Again, remember mapping is looking for an association between genotype and phenotype, okay?"
"So what you wanna do, and looking at this right now, this is just like the problem we did in a previous video."
Look and see.
Does your genotype just at A predict the disease?
Does your genotype just at B predict the disease?
"All right, let's take a look now."
"So at A, just looking at A. Well, actually let's start with B, let's start with B. Just at B, big B, little B."
"So this one is big B, little B. Most, almost all of them are healthy."
"This one down here is also big B, little B."
Almost all of them are diseased.
"This one's little b, little b."
Almost all of'em are diseased.
"This one is little b, little b and almost all of them are healthy."
So b really doesn't predict the genotype very well at all.
I am gastronome.
I explore unique foods that are available to us all over the world.
"In 2002 I founded, as part of my work, a nonprofit organization"
"The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation,  whose goal is to plant 18 billion fruit trees  and nut trees all over the planet."
"We're at about 200,000 right now."
"And, that same year that we founded this organization, a wonderful organization  filled with amazing people,"
I ran into the most incredible fruit and nut tree in the world.
It is the source of the Earth's favorite food.
"That's right, the population of the world  has one favorite food."
"And of course, it's chocolate."
"Now, in my exploration of this I stumbled into it because I was a health food fanatic."
I never ate chocolate since I was fifteen years old.
This was about when I was maybe 32.
I stumbled into  this form of chocolate here.
This is raw chocolate.
"This is chocolate  in its unique original form, a form that is called -- by the British it is the slang word ""coco."""
But it's really cacao.
That's the real word.
"And is sometimes called a bean,  but it's really a nut."
It is the most widely eaten nut in the world that nobody actually eats.
I was in Hawaii with some friends.
We were peeling them.
They started  showing up in our smoothies.
"We'd get these coconuts,  we'd break up coconuts and make these incredible drinks."
We called them superfoods smoothies.
"And we started adding them to these smoothies and I asked my friend one day,"
"I said, ""What is this?"""
I didn't know what it was.
"And he said,  ""Oh, just peel the next one, and eat it."""
"So, I did eat it."
And that's what it looks like on the inside.
"And, at that exact moment that I ate that food,  I was touched by the spirit of chocolate."
I was just upstairs talking with Win Phippen and he told me I could find you down here.
I am over here talking to him about his new USDA grant so I thought I would just ask you a couple of questions if you have a couple of minutes.
William Bailey:
Certainly do.
And welcome to our Ag Mech Lab.
Beth Seaton:
"Yeah, I've never been in here before."
It smells like an Ag Mech Lab.
Tell me a little bit about what a grant like Win Phippen's means for your department.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for Win, for the"
"School of Agriculture, and for our students."
It means a lot because it puts us on the cutting-edge on a lot of the research that is going on in plant breeding.
"And, more importantly, it gives students an opportunity to work with Win, who will teach them plant- breeding techniques, and they will apply what they learn in class under his supervision."
Beth Seaton:
"He seems really exicted about his program, and when I'm talking to him about it"
[Text on screen:
"Beth Seaton, Director, WlU Office of Sponsored Projects] you can just see the enthusiasm come out."
I've talked with a lot of other ag faculty from your department in my role as the director of sponsored projects.
"You have a lot of faculty member who are involved in not only in teaching in the classroom, but also heavily involved in research projects."
William Bailey:
We certainly do.
And it is that blend of
[Text on screen:
"Dr. William Baily, Director, WlU School of Agriculture] research and teaching, which, I think, is real hallmark of the School of Agriculture here at Western. because the faculty members are doing their scientific research, bringing it into the classroom themselves."
They are the teachers and they are the researchers.
"For example, here in the Ag Mech Lab, the students put on the Ag Mech Show, under the guidance of our ag mech instructor."
Beth Seaton:
And that is every February?
William Bailey:
Every February.
But it's student run.

Dealing with an eye injury is probably one of the most scary things for people to deal with.
"Often people don't like touching the eyes, don't like seeing any problems with them."
Even things like watching people put contact lenses in the eye can feel quite bad.
"Also, one of the senses you'd least like to lose is your sight."
So somebody with any eye injury is gonna be very very scared.
Now you can damage your eye through different things.
"Maybe just a bit of dirt or grime in the eye, maybe a scratch, maybe an impaled object into the eye."
"Also got chemicals, and things like this can all do damage."

My tubing fits in here.

Okay?
And I need to attach it to my patient.
"And again, before I have done this, before I do this, I would have checked for residual, checked for placement, I opened up my stopcock so it'll flow between the patient, into the patient from the bag."
Now I'm going to set my pump for what I need to run it at.
"So we first turn it on, and it says, ""Set dose."""
And that's the total volume you're going to give.
"So if we want to give 200 cc's, hold that down until we get to 200."
Hold that down.
There we go.
I went over a little bit.
Sorry.
Went over.
Okay.
So my dose is 200.
I need to set my rate.
"And that might be 30 cc's an hour, whatever your order says is what you would set it for."
Okay.
"So, I've set my rate, I've set my dose, and I hit run."
"Again, you want to make sure your patient is not flat, while they're receiving feedings, so they don't aspirate."
"Even though you're receiving, giving tube feedings on a pump, you still need to periodically check for residual and to give some free water per the order to give the patient some extra water."

"And in fact, voice search has become an incredibly popular application."
"Just to give you an idea, out of every four searches that we receive from Android devices in the USA, one comes from voice."
"That's 25%, which is pretty amazing."
So what I wanted to do today is actually show you how we're taking the voice UI to an entirely new level; through Cloud computing innovation.
Let me ask you a question.
"Have you found yourself, say, rushing at an airport?"
"You've got one bag in one hand, you've got a jacket or maybe, you know, a baby on the other hand and you need to send a quick text message but it's just too hard."
Wouldn't it be great if you could do it with just one single click?
Let me show you how you're going to be sending your text messages very soon.
Send text to Robert Hamilton: let's meet outside terminal
five in 10 minutes.
So this is going to process on the Cloud for a couple of seconds and then it's going to come back.
"So, let's see, perfect recognition."

Gordon Brown has got his big new idea.
He says that he wants to make children stay at school until they're eighteen.
"That's just not living in the modern world, is it?"
Seventeen year olds having to go to school.
Who's going to pick their kids up from primary?
He wants to bring in ID cards. with retina scans and 49 items of information.
"ID cards won't stop your identity being stolen, it just means that once it's stolen, you're fucked."
"""Oh, I've left my wallet in the hotel,"

"Now, the one-eyed monkey really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice, so she retold events exactly as they had happened."
Vishnu gave his judgment.
"""The god Indra has sinned, in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin."
"May he be called to wash away his sins."""
"So, Indra arrived, and performed the sacrifice of the horse."
"And so it transpired that a horse was killed, a god was made sin-free, a Brahmin's ego was appeased, a woman ... was ruined, and a one-eyed monkey was left ..."
very confused at what we humans call justice.
In India there is a rape every three minutes.
"In India, only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station, and of these 25 percent that come to a police station, convictions are only in four percent of the cases."
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.
And it's not only about women.
"Look around you, look at your own countries."
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.
"If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail."
"If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis, our tribals, the Naxalites."
"If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks."
There is a trend here.
"And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story, always get to tell their truth as The Truth."
"So, have we all become one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?"
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
Good morning.
Look here!
What's this?
Is this true?
I knew it.
I knew he was like that.
What is this?
His fan club must be in havoc.
The response today was really good.
All the messages were full of compliments.
Of course!
They complimented that the style was good.
As the model is good.
"But, when did you learn the drums?"
You were really good.
Did you see Won Kang Hwi's photo?
It's no joke!
That's right.
I felt he was gay.
Yes.
What is this?
What is this?
"But, did the two of them really do it?"
"All the things mentioned so far are the private affairs of our singer. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;U Entertainment has done our best to protect the privacy of Won Kang Hwi.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;However, judging that it could arouse social criticism,"
U Entertainment has decided that Won Kang Hwi of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take One&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;...
We have decided to throw him out . &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;U Entertainment has decided to throw out Won Kang Hwi of Take One. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; has decided to throw him out. &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;Subtitles by the Maid of the House 2 team at viki.com Join us and subtitle your favorite dramas too. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Man Ok!

"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellb-eing of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care."
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 25
Imagine watching bulldozers destroy your home losing everything you own in an instant.
"Imagine being forced to move to a remote area with no jobs, no hospitals, and no schools."
"Without clean water, adequate food, or sanitary living conditions... the fabric of your community destroyed."
And it comes up and over like that.
So this is kind of what the actin would look like.
"And, of course, I want to make sure I draw my titin."
"Titin is kind of helpful, because it helps demonstrate that there's now a little bit of space there where there wasn't any before."
And so now there is some space between the z-disc and this myosin right here.
So there is some space between these myosins and the z-discs.
"In fact, I can draw arrows all the way around."
And so there is a little bit of work to be done.
But I still wouldn't say that it's maximal force.
"Because look, you still have some overlap issues."
"Remember, these myosins, right here, they're not able to work."
"And neither are these, because of this blockage that's happening here."
This blockage.
"Because of the fact that, of course, actin has a certain polarity."
So they're getting blocked.
They can't do their work.
"And so even though you get some force of contraction, it wouldn't be maximal."
So I'll put something like this.
This will be our second spot.
This will be number two.
"Now in number three, things are going to get much better."
So you'll see very quickly now you have a much more spread out situation.
Where now these are actually-- these actins are really not going to be in the way of each other.
"You can see they're not bumping into each other, they're not in the way of each other at all."
And so all of the myosins can get to work.
So the z-discs are now out here.
"My overall sarcomere, of course, as I said, was from z-disc to z-disc."
So my sarcomere is getting longer.
"And you can also see that because now there's more titin, right?"
And there isn't actually more titin.
I shouldn't use that phrase.
But the titin is stretched out.
Let's try that again.
"Actually,"
it's right there.
"And of course, I don't have a sim card here, so it didn't place the call, but it's incredibly fast and this was a real live local search."
The number is not stored in my address book or anything.
It literally took half a second to find it and call it.
Let me show you another one.
"So, a friend of mine told me about this museum here in"
Berlin.
He said there's all this cool Egyptian arts there.
"So I want to drive there, but the name is very long, it's complicated, I forgot it."
I can't remember what the name of the museum was.
"Well, maybe I could do something like this:"
Navigate to the museum with Egyptian stuff.
And let's see what I get back here.
So it recognized what I said.
"So this is going to launch Google navigation which will figure out where I want to go and, in fact, it's right there."
It's the Pergamon Museum.
So I can just click on it and get directions.
So let's think about what happened here.
"So, first of all, my phone is with me and it knows that I'm in Berlin."
So it knows to search here.
"Secondly, there are thousands of pages on the web about the Pergamon Museum which obviously talk about the Egyptian art that's in this museum."
"So, all that Google has to do here is relate and connect all these pieces of information together and come up with a magical answer like what you just saw."
This is precisely what Eric means by Cloud Computing Innovation.
Let me show one more voice action.
This happens to be my favorite.
"Listen to Lady Gaga, Just Dance."
"So this is going to launch your favorite music application, in my case it's Spotify, and it will just going to play the song for you."
We'll stop that.
So those are voice actions.
They are
You do not eat meat?
"Where do you get your protein from?"""
"Like all of a sudden, ""Holy shit, it's all of a sudden dawned on me,"
I have been without protein in the last 8 years.
"Let 's go to McDonalds and get a Big Mac!"""
"Like, I am about to fall down or something."
Or pass out.
Have you ever heard of somebody in the U.S. suffering from a lack of protein and going to the hospital?
It's unheard of.
"It's funny, even dealing with kids, I have a kid say,"
"""I tried to go vegan for a day, and I got really sick."""
What?
It's like people they know somebody who is vegan who is sick.
Really?
I know tons of meat eaters who are sick.
"Yes, you can be an unhealthy vegan."
"What I am telling you is it does not matter if you are eating meat milk, dairy and fish or you are eating a plant based diet, you should know what you putting into your body."
"You should know how many grams of protein you are getting the amount of iron, calcium that you are getting."
"By the way, people say omega-3 from fish."
"You can get that from the seeds, the nuts."
You can get that from other things.
Flax seed is a very good example.
Think about this: these are the largest and strongest land animals on Earth.
What does their diet consists of?
Plants!
"You're in good company, if you're only eating plants."
"And what is so ironic about this is that the largest and strongest land animals not only do they just eat a plant based diet, they also live the longest."
This animal can live to 70 years.
"They can live to about 50 to 60 years, the gorilla about 50 years in the wild."
And their diet consists of nothing but plants.
Are you going to tell any of them they are missing out on protein?
This animal has 10 times the upper body strength of the average male adult.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
AUDlENCE:
Hi.
I have a question about lining stuff up.
"So in Android, I would try to put an image next to a text view, and then there would be this little bit of space from the top of the text view until the text actually shows up, so it does not line up."
"The top of the image does not line up with my text, and it bothers me."
"I try to fix it, but there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it."
Should I even try?
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Yes.
Please try.
"I am reminded again and again that that's a little bit difficult right now because the reality is top of the text as we perceive it is the top of the caps, it's usually the place where we want to measure from."
"And in this case in a lot of the systems, it measures from the clipping bounds."
"So measuring from the very top of the text, if you're building these kinds of systems, measuring from the cap height and the baseline is where you want to measure from."
"So you may have to do some kind of-- people always hate negative margins, or I don't know how to technically achieve it."
AUDlENCE:
"I mean, I guess the next question is, if I decided to do it, how do I figure out, what is the amount to shift for my font?"
Is there a computational way to do it?
"I don't want to just trial and error, one pixel, two pixel, I do it until it lines up."
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Yeah.
We can talk a little bit after.
ALEX FAABORG:
It's an important limitation.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"Em height times 0.23, I think."
ALEX FAABORG:
But thank you for trying to line it up.
That's great.
AUDlENCE:
"This is something I've been really curious ever since Google started rolling out the new design, because in"
Dietrich stated on a note on her Facebook wall:
"""If reporting a rape only got me to the point that I'm not allowed to talk about it, then I regret it."
"I regret reporting it."""
"But, one good thing that has come out of this is that Savannah recently opened her Facebook page to the public, allowing hundreds of random friend requests from people offering financial support and petitions in her cause."
"And with her Facebook page and Twitter account,"
"Savannah Dietrich gets to control what people see of her, for once."
"It's ironic that technology, which helped humiliate her previously, is now allowing her to put her best foot forward."
"The judge behind the ruling is named Judge Deana ""Dee"" McDonald."
The defense attorneys for her rapists are
Chris Klein and David Mejia.
Oh!
"And her rapists, the boys who decided to violate this girl and spread that violation throughout her highschool, potentially ruining her youth, their names are Will Frey and uh I'll spell this for you if you want to write it down, that's Will, like Will, and then Frey."
F. R. E. Y.
"And the other rapist is Austin Zehnder, that's Z.E.H.N.D.E.R."
Please do not share this information or let anyone know that there are two rapists in Kentucky named Will Frey and Austin Zehnder.
Because Judge Deana McDonald doesn't want you to.
Nor do their lawyers David Mejia and Chris Klein.
"That's David Majia and Chris Klein, uh, Will Frey"
Austin Zehnder
Austin Zehnder and Will Frey
Perfect!
Now of course there are two sides to every story.
"For example, Will Frey and Austin Zehnder ""allegedly"" raped Savannah Dietrich."
Oh!
Wait.
Sorry.
No.
"They plead guilty, so yeah, they definitely raped her."
"The thing is it's important that we protect the identities of Will Frey and Austin Zehnder, because, like, this could look really bad for Will Frey and Austin Zehnder."
"Like, real bad."
Cuz they're rapists.
It's insane to me that a court system would allow a victim of sexual assault to be silenced.
"Once they get to know her, and when people are able to identify with an individual and look her in the eye and see that she is living, feeling being who has a will to live, then people care."
I have been working here with Animal Care and Control for almost nine years.
This morning was really astonishing to me.
"All of a sudden it dawned on me, this sweet, innocent cow running away from being slaughtered."
"And I never been thought about it before, that something is actually being slaughtered, and it is my ground beef, and it is my steak, and stuff like that."
"And we have been eating this for years,"
I never pictured that face on that.
And it hurt.
I can't do that anymore.
I can't.
"So, now, we are all work on not eating meat."
Me and my entire family.
Because I am realizing that this is a life we saved today.
And with my family we will be saving a couple of more.
Thank you.
She is about a year old absolutely beautiful Hereford.
And those unfortunately are cows that are used for meat.
"She was most likely at a live market and because they have a very strong will to live,"
"like any living creature, she got loose."
"She had a will to live, and she did it."
Hello!
"When she is going now, she is gonna have cows of her own breed even."
She is gonna be so happy.
"When the trailer arrives, the cows in the herd will moo."
Yeah.
They will moo in a big line.
Everybody lines up.
They will start mooing to her to comfort her and to tell her that they are there.
And she will moo back.
"Any animal, any creature has a strong will to live."
"She is an ambassador for all animals, who are still suffering in slaughterhouses and on farms, and who don't don't have such a lucky outcome."
People love a happy ending and it's happy.
And the trouble is the toilet was about 20 meters outside the hall.
[Some laughter].
In the darkness.
"So this poor little, you can imagine what he felt like, he had the pain in his bladder against the fear of that ghost getting him."
So he made a run for it - desperation.
"He ran and he got to the toilet, locked the door."
He'd only been in that toilet for about a few minutes when he heard the steps.
[Laughter].
And it came right to the toilet cubicle he was in and started scratching.
Can you get a scratch..?
[Scratches tissue box].
I tried to get some special effects.. for the tape
[Laughter].
A scratch at the door..and this poor little novice didn't come out of that toilet cubicle for about 3 hours.
[Laughter].
And when he came out he was telling us - the ghost came to get him!
The ghost!
"And he heard it, he heard it scratching."
Another monk saw that ghost..
You know what it was?
It was a civet cat.
Like a possum.
Those of you who've been to Asia know they've got squat toilets.
"The toilets are actually on the floor, and that little possum, civet cat, every evening he would go into that toilet cubicle to get some water to drink from the toilet bowl."
That was his drinking place.
And so that evening all that happened was this little possum walked to that toilet and was scratching the door
"- ""please let me in, I'm thirsty""."
[Laughter].
"But that little novice [laughs], he was a ghost coming to get me!"
"And you can actually see how because of wrong thinking, and because there was a funeral that day, thinking all day, thinking all evening, and what was just a little jungle cat, just coming for a drink, he thought it was a ghost and he was in that toilet for about 3 or 4 hours - poor little novice."
Now what about you?
What do you get afraid of?
I always had to go in there and fiddle them.
"Then another version of WOlips would come out, and I'd have to change the things again."
In ANT 1.6 they added the ability to import one build.xml file into another.
That's a really good thing to do.
"For an example of doing things like that, see the Wonder build system."
"It is really quite complex, but you can find a lot of interesting things in there."
I'm currently redoing our build system so that I have a couple of shared files that all the projects use.
This is what I've ended up for a build file for a WO framework.
"That's it, three lines and a couple properties."
It's a lot easier to maintain.
- OK.
Just one comment on that.
Look at Maven.
You can actually build some awesome tools with Maven.
I think there was a demonstration last year from Jake.
Maven is actually an extremely good tool to build Web Objects.
That's how we build Web Object every night.
We use Maven.
We've got a Maven build system for Web Objects.
It's really awesome.
It takes care of all the dependency.
"It's really reliable, in fact, you don't have to write much code if you accept two of the Maven conventions."
- I don't.
- We use some funky tools.
You can ask Mike.
"Every time I tell him one of them he goes, ""Oh, I want to die."""
"Our build files are highly customized, so I don't know how happy it would be with Maven, but I'm not going to go there."
"There was a question and answer here, I've been doing some questions."
I'm going to skip over this.
"We don't have time to go into the fun topics, but if you want something to talk about over beer tonight..."
"- They're hard to read from this distance, and we'll take that as a good thing."
- It didn't look so bad on the screen.
"People go on hunts every day, and usually no one gets killed."
"But today, one man gets charged by an elephant."
And everybody can see that he got killed by an elephant.
Why did he happened to be in the path of the elephant?
Why did the elephant go in a different way?
Why did he hunt a slightly different way?
Why didn't the elephant here him and run away?
The man would not have been in the path of that elephant if not for witchcraft.
"To put it another way, the Zande have no concept of bad luck."
"When something bad happens, when misfortune comes along, it's due to witchcraft."
"Someone, a witch, made it happen."
Why did my crops fail when everyone else's thrived?
Why did the tornado zig in set aside so it hit my house and not my neighbor's house?
Why did the mosquito bite me and not use so I got malaria but you didn't?
To these-- the answer to these questions for the Zande is witchcraft.
In Zande Land anyone could be a witch.
Children and the very old are usually not accused of witchcraft because it's rare for them to seriously offend people.
But almost any adult you meet could have witchcraft inside him or her.
So you better be nice to everyone.
Witchcraft is never random.
It's personal.
The person who causes you harm knows you and probably lives near you.
He or she is someone you've offended.
"So when something bad happens you ask yourself, who have I offended?"
Have I insulted someone?
Have I cheated someone?
Have I slept with someone's spouse?
Did I break a promise?
Those are all the kinds of things that could make someone's witchcraft heat up.
"The Zande know-- okay, now the part for the medical students in particular about how-- what witchcraft has to do with the treatment of illness."
The Zande know that people get sick.
And they usually get better.
Exactly as it was the case with the letters ?
your Father has prevented you to see your mother hidLetters from you and that meansYour father is an enemyyour mother.
"My father did nothave any enemy... he didn t ,burn the letters ,just hide them ! did you he readall the letters of your mother... and nevertheless you would stillbelieve that your father did not separated you from your mother ?"
yes mr Judge!This man was reading the letters while pretendingbe a practicing lawyer in the courtand wrote a report about it...
"Since he is the witnessln this case,"
"I want to file a lawsuitagainst this man for fraud,falisfication of documentsand deceiving the court and government officials and should be immediately placedin judicial proceedings!"
The case accepted!
"I 've committedall of these errors, but please believe mewhen I say that my fathernot the enemy nor Suleimannor Kader Altun!"
"If you were, I would have known!"
My father has not committing the crime!
"Mr. Mahir, you can sit down.No further questions."
Does defense have anyquestions for the witness?
"No, Your Honor!"
"Okay, witness may goback to his place."
Your Honor...
I'm not finishedwith my declaration.
I want to tell you what happenedmy family aftermy father was charged with this murder...
"Prison officershave abused my motherwhen they brought her at night to visit my father, that my nephew was been kidnappedand my father was blackmailed over the phoneto admitt all the charges..."
I wish that all thisput in evidence...
It's already been provenand is not applicable to this case.
"Mr. Judge,please listen to me! your requestto speak has been denied!"
"Please believe me,When I explain what my family has gone throughyou'll realize that was set a trap to my father !"
Sit down
Feride
"recess for ten minutes,then we'll continue."
Come on!
"Can I come in,Mr. Neždete?"
"Come on, come on..."
Today is Miss.
"Aytenshould come for the rehersal, but... did not come to the testthat is not normal, because it is supposed tobe her first nighton stage!"
How's that?
"I called,but she does not answer. her Sister answeredbut she explained Nothing..."
"Hi i'm Samantha Atwell i'm a junior Social Science Education major from Olathe, Kansas."
The reason why
"I chose ESU is because being an education major, ESU is one of the top four schools in the country for education."
"Being empowered by E means a lot to me, I've been involved in alot of different organizations, meeting alot of friends have helped me to be empowered by E. Some of the things that i absolutely love to do are to scrap book and to take pictures, so at events on campus you'll see me with my camera at all times."
One thing I would advise new students when they come here is to get involved on campus we have a lot of organizations here and by getting involved you get to meet new people really quickly and when you graduate you'll have friends from those organizations.
.
Now here's the question.
Does it really matter.
Why am I making a big fuss about this?
"Whether use it two norm or a one norm, right?"
Because you know what's wrong with using the two norm.
"There is no problem, right?"
"There isn't, but at least from the surface, there would be any problem with using a one norm too."
"Okay,"
let me show you the difference.
"Today in class, you're gonna see it."
Okay.
So what
"I'm gonna do is take this data that I showed up here and we're gonna try to do an L two fit and an L one fit, and you're gonna see what happens."
"Alright, so there is our data we're gonna work with and we would like to put a nice line through that."
Okay.
"So, how do we do this."
"Well, what we gonna do is use what's called."
The
F means Search Command.
"Cuz, we find to do is minimize this a quantity."
Right.
"So, sorry."
We're trying to minimize this.
Right?
This is the idea.

She was that powerful.
One day she had a question for the class.
I'm sitting there.
Let's go back to the 1970's.
"I'm wearing bell-bottom pants (Horrible, never again!!)."
"But there I am, she had a question."
I raised my hand hoping that she wouldn't call on me.
She called on me.
"Remember, she's a larger-than-life woman with a lot of energy."
"""Stephen, that's right!!"""
"Wow, because of Mrs. Jordan, she changed my life at that moment."
Announcer:
"""That's right, Stephen,"" became a personal mantra as a reminder of the power and impact one person can have on another."
"Ivan Noble of Boston University writes,"
"""I have read over 400 student evaluations of your presentation, [with comments like]"
"'Bring him back, please!' 'The Best!' 'Truly inspiring!'"

Ray Hexamer:
"Most times you hire a speaker, it's the same speech that they've done 50 times in the last four months."
"Stephen's was not that way, he was different in the respect that he took the time to actually get to know what First Communications was and what they represented and tailored his presentations to fit what we were looking for."
Stephen:
"You have dreams, like me, you have ambitions, like me."
I'm just like you.

Stephen:
Khan's lessons are unscripted and unadorned.
His voice over a black screen as he writes or doodles!
His style has changed little since this all began back in 2004 as
Youtube videos to help his young cousins.
9 times the 6...!
"He's now recorded more than 2,400 lessons on everything from simple arithmetic to college-level biology."
Anyone can watch for free!
People are more likely to say thank you when it's free!
And thank you is worth a lot!
But what are Khan's lessons worth?
The Los Altos school district is trying to figure that out.
"Last year, the district used Khan lessons in five classes."
"The students did well enough that this year, the Khan method is in 40 classes to be used by every fifth and sixth grader in the district!"
We found that the students are really engaged in this type of learning.
It was a great addition to what we were already doing.
You might say this California school has flipped!
"Students get their lectures at home and come to school to do their homework, fundamentally changing the role of the teacher!"
The kids can really move through in their own pace.
And then I can see who is struggling.
"At home, students listen to Khan's online lessons."
"In the classroom, they practice what they learn while teacher Courtney Cadwell works with those who need help."
"When they're having fun and they're wanting to do math, that tells me that this is a good thing."
This educational overall comes from a man who was working as a hedge fund analyst until 2009!
Khan has a Harvard MBA and three degrees from MlT.
"You're kind of a math geek, I guess."
Aren't you?
"Yes, in the best form of the word!"
"In the beginning, he financed the Khan Academy from his own savings, until he was discovered by some people with money."
"Well, it's amazing!"
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.
Thank you!
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and
"And, we could see this with a poll, or we could see this with tech."
"We had a lot of benefits in the United States, because of George Bush."
George Bush was great for us.
Right now we have so many creative people which we could hear here because we had George Bush.
"In November, 2007,"
"I was in Australia, in Sydney."
"So was George Bush, and he said, ""I'm so glad to be in Austria""."
(Laughter)
"Because, after seven years in power, he didn't know the difference between Austria and Australia."
"Then, he was opening a conference."
"He thought, ""Vienna, Austria"", opening this OPEC Conference."
"But it was not the OPEC Conference, it was the APEC Conference,"
The Asian-Pacific Conference.
"When this is your president,"
- we have some potential as well - we don't wait for the government anymore.
That's why we have seen huge innovations in the United States.
"Now, with Mr. Obama, everybody sits back and relaxes, and waits for what the president is doing."
"But before that, we had George Bush, and so we knew it is up to us."
We didn't wait for the government anymore.
"So, in a certain way, George Bush was beneficial."
"But only in certain ways, definitely."
We need to reinvent our products.
Everything we see in front of us is not designed.
"We talk about colors in Brazil, but all the colors that you see are hazardous waste. even the flip-flops that we saw are hazardous waste."
35 million flip-flops go into the ocean every year; 35 million.
"There's more seals, more whales, more turtles, more dolphins, killed by flip-flops, than by anything else,"
Because the animals eat the plastic.
There are 12 million tons of plastic going into the oceans.
Nothing is designed to go into biological systems; nothing is designed to go into the biosphere.
We feel so bad that we are here that we are romanticizing nature.
"People talk about ""Mother Earth""."
"But there is no ""Mother Earth""."
"So, what do you get and if you get a lot of money basically, you get two million dollars, 2.59 million dollars, arlight."
"Its two, five, nine, zero, five, six, five."
"So, what does this tell you?"
"This tells you that if you invest $10,000 in a bank 40 times, the future value of that will end up being 2.59 million dollars."
"So, what"
"I'm going to do, I'm going to try to talk you through the problem again."
"So, just, so that we are working together."
What did I do?
I calculated Future Value.
"So, in order to calculate Future Value of something that I don't know, I have to use the Future Value function in the calculator or in the spreadsheet."
"And out popped, I gave this information $10,000 was the PMT, 40 was n."
But most importantly eight percent was r.
"So, I gave all this information to Excel or a calculator, whatever you choose to be using, simply because it's a very complicated calculation."
"Conceptually, it's not that difficult."
And we got 2.59 mil.
"And I'm going to just use it approximately because I'm not going to calculate, write all the digits and so on."
"So, what has happened here?"
Let me just walk you through this problem.
"First of all, remember yesterday, remember I asked you, what is the answer to a Finance question or anybody asks you what, what should you say?"
Compounding.
But you always have to pause because you want to
"look smart, right?"
"So, you take a pause, and you say compounding."
"And so, so let me ask you the following question."
"Suppose there was no interest rate or, in other words, how much of the 10,000 are you throwing in?"
And suppose the interest is zero.
This problem is very simple to do.
Why?
"Because you do 40 times 10,000."
"You have $400,000, right."
"So, the interest rate, time value of money is zero, you will have a lot of money in your bank account but how much will it be?"
"400,000."
"So, what have I given you?"
I have given you everything you need.
"I have given you PMT, RC, which is 10,000."
I've given you number of years
"left for you to retire, 40, and I've given you an interest rate that you're likely to earn on your portfolio, which means, where you put your money."
"A bank, whatever."
We'll talk about that in a second.
"But let's just focus on this, and try to do this problem."
"I hope you've been listening to me, and I hope you've been paying attention."
"Because if you pay attention to a problem, it gets to be a little intense."
And I'll do the problems with you.
"And I have promised myself, today, I'll spend a"
lot of time just doing problems with you because that's how you learn.
"And I, another piece of advise."
"I've given you textbooks to read, that you can go, get and read."
They can be second hand.
"They can be, whatever."
The fundamental principles of Finance have been known since we were in the cave.
"So, it's a, it's a, just remember that what you're trying to do is focus on the fundamentals."
"So, read whatever you want if the video doesn't satisfy your curiosity."
But the video is trying to be self-sufficient.
"So, let's do this, let's now start doing the problem."
"And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do two problems for future value, two problems for present value."
But I'll take breaks with you.
"So, I'll let you know that maybe it's time to take some time off."
"Get some coffee, go jog around the apartment building where you live, or talk to your friend, or watch a video on"
"YouTube, you know, why not?"
Okay.
So let's get started.
I'm going to draw a timeline right here.
"You can use the box I gave you or you can use, I prefer this."
And how many years?
Oh! -- it's trick.
It's a gimmick to crawl into a corner and wait there until somebody comes to your rescue.
I'm admitting it.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm not being phony.
I'm not pretending I'm so brave.
I resent that.
"I feel like you're saying, unless I come out openly and stand on my own"
I'm not a phony.
Bologna!
I'm just as real sitting in that corner as I am out here all by myself.
But you're not sitting in that corner.
"Well, I'm not now."
We're on problem 27.
"They tell us if i is equal to the square root of minus 1, then what is 4 times i-- that's an i-- times 6 times i?"
"Well, multiplication is associative."
You can switch the order around.
"So this is the same thing as 4 times 6 times i times i, or the same thing as 24 times i squared, right?"
"If we square both sides of this, you get i squared is equal to negative 1."
So this is 24 times negative 1.
"So this is minus 24, which is choice C."
"Next problem, 28."
They want to know what an equivalent form of 3 plus i is.
"A lot of times, people don't like either when you have a square root in the denominator or they don't like it when you have an a complex number in the denominator."
A complex number is just something that has part real and part imaginary.
So the way you can do it with this case is you multiply times the conjugate of this number.
"I know that sounds like a fancy word, but all it means is you take the opposite of the imaginary part."
So what's the conjugate?
"Remember, the only way you cannot change a fraction is if you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing, because then you're multiplying by 1."
So what's the conjugate of this?
The conjugate of 3 plus i is 3 minus i.
We're imaging that we're going be able to create a function T that is going to give us the answer to that.
Let's just leave it at that for now.
"Finally, in the case where a is odd, it's going to execute the condition of this if statement, the condition of this if statement, both of which will fail."
"Then it will recursively compute the product, and then basically execute the returns."
A total of 3 statements plus however long it takes to do the recursive call-- so 3 statements plus this particular kind of recursive call.
This now is a mathematical specification of a function.
"We don't know at the moment what the relationship is between a and T(a), but at least it's fully specified."
"It turns out that you actually can solve this pretty easily by using what we already worked out about the number of times you can divide a number a in half, rounding down if it's odd, before you get down to 0."
See if you can put that together to try to answer the question what does T(a) equal from these set of choices.

Kang Hwi?
I love you too.
Why did you come now?
"Kang Hwi, Kang Hwi!"
My head...
Where is this?
Aish!
What happened yesterday?
Cell phone!
I am really disappointed!
Why on earth did you go to a place like that?
Leaving all the nice places aside?
"Ah, I don't know, I don't know."
I just opened my eyes and a water bed&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; was lapping underneath me ...
Aish!
I don't even want to think about it!
How much alcohol did you drink?
That you even blacked out?
"But did something happen, hyung-nim?"
"Perhaps, were you with a girl I don't know about?"
Ok.
[Audience member]
How do you select text using the keyboard?
[Panelist]
"Um, I was alluding to that a little bit earlier."
"You select text by holding down, ah, the, I think Command A, will select all the text."
"Ah, command...."
[Other panelist]
I think it's Shift.
[Panelist answering question]
Shift.
I'm sorry.
"Yeah, if you hold down the Shift key."
"And then use, ah, either the Arrow keys, or the Option left and right arrows, you can select by character or word."
But you use the Shift key in the same way that you would in Windows.
"Um, You're holding down the Shift key and left and right arrow is going to select a character at a time."
And then Shift Command left and right arrow for example would allow you to select a word at a time.
"And then you would use of course your Command X, Command C, Command V, commands to either cut, copy, and then paste that selected text."
"Obviously, I'm not going to get into that demonstrated at the moment."
I can't even fix a misspelled word here.
"So, I don't want to, I don't want to press my luck here."
"Again, but you know that shows how I use it."
I do a lot of typing in meetings.
"And I just send raw text with loaded with mistakes right to um, there's a way to do that in email."
It goes to my email box as a text file--right in the email message.
"And then I can save it down, and then bring it into Notepad or Edsharp which I use a lot, or even Word if you want."
And then I just do most of my editing right on the PC itself.
"So, I don't do a lot of selecting of text on the i device, but you certainly can do it, and it does work."
[Other panelist]
"I've done it, and it does work very well."
[First panelist]
I should let you do that part.
[indistinct]
"I dunno, they must not have noticed it's Six Flags Day."
I guess we're the only ones.
[yelling]
Now that's what I'm talking about!
Let's bring it in.
"You know, Brandon, Rollercoaster Day's not just about the thrill of g-forces and riding coasters with your friends, it's a lot more than that."
"It's about taking a day off work, taking a day off of school, and just going and having fun."
We don't have to go and fulfill our commitments.
We can take a day off and just ride rollercoasters together.
"Rollercoaster day this year falls on Wednesday, April 27th."
That means you're gonna have to ditch class and call in sick for work.
"Rollercoaster Day is an international event, so here's what you're gonna have to do."
"If you're in the Los Angeles area, over here,"
Join as at Six Flags Magic Mountain!
"If you live over here, find a theme park near you and go there."
"If you live over here, your theme parks might not be open yet so you gotta do some other fun activity"
"like snowboarding or ice skating or something, I dunno."
"If you're in the rest of the world, I'm gonna be honest -"
I have no idea what your weather / theme park situation is but the point is that you have to abandon your commitments and have a day of fun wherever you are.
All of these details will be up at http://facerocker.com/rcday2011.
Check over there to find a list of excuses to give your boss and also how to connect with other people in your area.
It's time to goof off!
I don't care!
Say that you got food poisoning!
Whatever it takes to have a day of fun.
"The best excuse, of course, is to retroactively show your teacher or boss this video."
That's probably -
That would win right there.
That'd get you fired.
[laughs]
"Don't do it to your boss, do it to your teacher."
"One looking at a half a million, a million, and two million seeds per acre drilled, and broadcasting, where we just toss it out on the ground."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"Another big question is simply determining when in the fall we need to plant, so I have successive planting dates, starting at September 1, all the way up here to November 30."
And looking at what is the best time to plant.
Can we do it right after corn?
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
So the pennycress is crop that you're using to put into the field in the alternate season.
"So you're still going to have corn or beans, and then this goes in afterwards?"
Win Phippen:
Yes.
"Typically, on pennycress, we would follow corn."
So you would plant after the corn comes out.
"And this would form a rosette, just a bundle of leaves, into the fall, it will overwinter just fine."
And it will start flowering in early spring.
And it will be at this stage by the end of May.
And you would hope to harvest that by the first week of June.
And then you'll plant a full season of soybean right behind it.
And so the real niche for this crop is growing off-season crop production.
"It's called ""double cropping."""
Beth Seaton:
And this is what the Field Day is going to be about tomorrow; people are going to come out so they can
learn more about pennycress and what you're doing out here?
Win Phippen:
Absolutely.
We're trying to answer all the basic questions you would ask on any sort of new crop you're introducing.
"Because this is strictly for the bio-diesel market, we're not making a feed crop or anything like that."
It's strictly for off-season bio-diesel production.
So we've got a lot of studies out here.
"What we'll look at, in terms of, what kind of nitrogen does it need?"
"Key to a healthy diet is a variety of foods, a variety of colors."
You get everything from this.
"And then you build your walls with the legumes, the beans."
"And you got the whole grains, the wheat, the pasta, the spaghetti, the rice, the breads, and on top, your roof, you get your nuts and seeds."
"You can get everything from this, everything."
"All your vitamins, A, B, C. Vitamin D from the sun."
"You get all your calcium , all your iron, your omega-3, all your protein and amino acids."
"Everything from this, everything."
"Now I know I am a skinny white dude with glasses telling you to get enough protein, but these guys aren't skinny."
Only one of them is white.
"So as you can see these guys, their diet consists of no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
There might be some variations.
"Tony Gonzalez, he might be eating fish."
Don't hold me to it.
"But I know Prince Fielder, who is the 2009 home run derby king, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
"Mac Danzig, who fights in the ultimate fighter, he is a season 1 champion, UFC fighter, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
So you can still excel at your sports.
You can still gain muscle mass on a plant based diet.
"Again, just remember the gorilla."
So what do they eat?
"Instead of dairy everything a meat eater, a dairy eater an egg eater eats,"
"I eat as well, that just comes in plant form."
"No cruelty involved, no cholesterol, high in fiber."
And these are all the processed food.
This is the transition food.
This is where you go when you go from eating meat and you make that switch.
Instead of poultry.
Instead of beef.
"Garden burger, veggie burger."
"Right here what you see up here, this is one of the best items on the market."
"Again, not the healthiest food in the world, but certainly better than your meat."
This is called the Riblets.

Gadejuristen - The Danish Street Lawyers
My name is Nanna Gotfredsen and I am a street lawyer in Copenhagen.
We are at the open drug scene right now.
It's just behind the main station in Copenhagen and we have had an open drug scene here for 30 years- 25 or 30 years.
"What we are doing here with our bike is that we are sending out a legal team providing users, homeless people, and outdoor sex workers with legal advice and legal assistance."
It's the package:
"Pump, filter, water, injection needle."
We have several kinds of needles that we can offer.
"If you don't use these, then we have some bigger ones and we also have a pump that is bigger."
But this is what you have in the ordinary set here and also alcohol cleaner.
And this is a J-Key card.
Information for safer injection.
This is a question and then you have the answer on the other side.
There is not doubt that law enforcement cannot prevent people from using drugs.
Using drugs has other reasons than whether it is criminalised or not.
When the police is targeting the open drug scenes you can only make it worse for drug users.
They are fighting so hard to stay alive and we can see that from the constantly high death rate in Denmark
This is our office - The street lawyer.
"Drug users, homeless people and all of them are here with us."
"We can be like 30 or 40 people up here, and so we would like some more space."
Homeless people are having their clothes and things and papers and things like that in the office.
"And what is more, Factory Farming corporations have been destroying communities and mistreating their workers for decades."
"Since 1950, over 2 million small hog farms have disappeared."
If they continue at this rate there'll be no real independent family farms left.
"That is the Meatrix, Leo."
The Lie we tell ourselves about where our food comes from.
"But it's not too late, there is a resistance."
Count me in!
Washington.
"City of politicians, policymakers, lobbyists and activists."
Think of the seals when you buy your meals.
Boycott Canada!
Today there's a demonstration against the seal hunt is held at the Canadian Embassy.
Think of the seals when you buy your meals.
Boycott Canada!
"This demonstration was organised by the Humane Society of the United States,"
America's largest animal welfare organisation with 10 million members.
"30 minutes later I have an appointment on Capitol Hill with Wayne Pacelle, the president of the Humane Society."
Hi.
- Welcome to the United States.
"Welcome to Washington, our nation's capital."
- Thank you.
We are so proud of what you've accomplished in Holland with your election.
We all took note last November of how you were elected and you're the first Party for the Animals in the world to achieve this.
"- Yes, that's true."
So thank you and we look forward to learning about what you have done.
"Oh, OK."
So nice to meet you finally.
You are the biggest organisation on animal welfare?
"Yes, we are."
"We have ten million supporters here in the United States in terms of paying supporters, and then of course we have millions more who believe in what we are doing, and we are here to organise that sentiment to achieve political reforms for animals, among doing other things."
"We try to pressure corporations to do the right thing and we educate the public, and we do hands-on care of animals as well."
But the political work here in Congress is very important.
"You can't do better than 100%, right?"
"So now in stage five, we kind of take this a little too far, right?"
So let me actually just make a little bit of space here.
We take this a little bit too far in the sense that our actin is going to slip out all the way over here.
And it's going to be out all the way over here.
"So we've got a huge, huge gap now."
"And, of course, our titin is completely stretched out."
It's about as stretched out as our titin is going to get.
This green titin protein.
"And now the question is, of course, would you get any force?"
And the answer's probably no.
Because the myosins aren't even touching the actins anymore.
"So really, again, you have zero out of 20 myosins at work."
"And of course, that means that then the amount of force would be zero."
So we go back down to zero.
So this is part five.
"So you can see now, as we've gotten longer and longer, things were good for a while, but then they drifted all the way back down."
"And this curve that I'm showing you, this tension-length curve, is now based on exactly what you see on the right."
"It's based completely on the idea that as you stretch things out, the amount of force changes depending on the length of the sarcomere."

Meet the relatives
"These are our closest cousins, the great apes."
We like to think we're different.
"But a few million years ago, we were just the same."
"Now, we dominate the planet."
"Somehow we humans have left apes far behind, or have we?"
Through a series of experiments we'll prove that apes are much closer to us than anyone thought.
Startling images reveal that their instant memory is far superior to ours.

"Now that I'm following a few people on Twitter,"
I have a personalized recommendation engine that makes it very easy for me to find and discover new people to follow.
Let me show you how it works.
Here are all the Tweets from everyone that I follow.
It looks like my friend Maggie just posted a Tweet about the Cove.
Let me see what else she's talking about.
Oh wow!
It looks like she just posted a reply to my friend Ed.
I didn't know he was on Twitter!
I think i'll go ahead and follow him.
I'm going to check out who else she's following 'cause there might be some interesting people in there.
It doesn't appear that I know most of these people.
"Oh, but look at this:"

Hit Enter.
I've gone from one problem size eight down to eight problems of size one.
At this stage I'm at my singleton case.
So this is easy.
What do I do?
I merge.
"And the merge is, put them in order."
What do I do next?
"Obvious thing, I merge these."
And that as we saw was a nice linear operation.
"It's fun to do it upside down, and then one more merge which is I take the smallest elements of each one until"
I get to where I want.
Wow aren't you impressed.
"No, don't please don't clap, not for that one."
Now let me do it a second time to show you that --
I'm saying this poorly.
Let me say it again.
That's the general idea.
What should you see out of that?
"I just kept sub-dividing down until I got really easy problems, and then I combine them back."
"I actually misled you slightly there or maybe a lot, because"
I did it in parallel.
"In fact, let me just shuffle these up a little bit."
"Really what's going to happen here, because this is a sequential computer, is that we're going to start off up here, at top level, we're going to divide into half, then we're going to do the complete subdivision and merge here before we ever come back and do this one."
We're going to do a division here and then a division there.
"At that stage we can merge these, and then take this down, do the division merge and bring them back up."
Let me show you an example by running that.
I've got a little list I've made here called test.
"Let's run merge sort on it, and then we'll look at the code."
"OK, what I would like you to see is I've been printing out, as I went along, actually let's back up slightly and"
look at the code.
There's merge sort.
Takes in a list.
"It builds a pearl around it to smooth out the sand, and that's what our memories are really."
"We forget all the bad things, or a lot of them, or they're dulled."
We dull the emotions.
"But with Jill, she's right there."
"For instance, her mother, a dancer, remembers saying the usual one or two things about her daughter's weight gain."
Jill has the days and dates.
She'll not realize that she said 500 times.
She'll think she's said it one time.
"And it has caused a weight problem for her, but there's nothing I could do about it anymore."
"Jill wants us to know that too much memory, living in the past, is paralyzing."
It's uncontrollable.
"I actually probably should be in a mental hospital because this makes me crazy, but I figured out a way to live with this."
Think about your junior year in high school.
Now what can you remember?
Doctor Cahill and Doctor McGaugh of the University of California
Irvine say there's something else they've
"learned about that mysterious part of Jill's brain, which is larger than usual."
It's an area associated with OCD.
We believe that she has strong tendencies towards obsessive-compulsive.
"Could her brain be storing an infinity of memories, just as some OCD patients hoard things?"
We don't think it is an accident that the tendency to collect is both for objects and for memories.
"We think these are related, and we think the brain does it, and we want to figure out how."
"Do you save things, hoard things?"
"I don't like the word hoard, but yeah."

Antidepressants.
That doesn't work either.
There is only one thing they did make a dramatic difference.
It ties right together.

And that's the beauty of the College of Arts and Sciences.
It really exposes you to ideas and ways of thinking that you wouldn't necessarily have been exposed to.
"Jocelyn Krebs, Ph.D. Biology Professor:"

"Alvin Amason, Native Arts Program Director:"
"I personally don't care if they are an Arts Major, or Anthropology or something close to that."
I think that what they can pull out or identify with in our program will help them through all their endeavors.

Narrator:
There's an S in there.
"The sparse diagonal matrix means what you're going to do is, you're going to basically so it's going to be a matrix fulls of zeroes, and you're gonna tell me which diagonals have stuff in'em, and put stuff on those diagonals."
"So, for instance, here's how you might put something in."
"So, first, you tell it."
Let me give you the structure here.
It's going to be an n by n matrix.
Doesn't have to be.
"You can tell it what size it is, but for us it's an n by n."
You tell it the location of where you wanna put this thing.
"So, for instance, if I wanna put something on the diagonal at zero, if I go to the right of the diagonal, it's one, two, three."
"Go to the left, it's negative one, negative two, negative three."
"So your location is predicated off that diagonal, to the right or to the left."
"So if you say zero, and what I'm going to do is put."
Lay down an E1 on that.
So right now what I've made is essentially the identity matrix.
Here's another command.
Spy.
"Spy allows you to look at the, all the non zero components, of the matrix."
"So if I do this, press go."
"There's my matrix structure, the blue dots indicate which things are not zero."
"By the way, by using the SP Diags."
The only things it saves is the blue dots.
"Notice the matrix is sparse, it's almost empty."
"If you were to save all these zeroes, right, order N squared matrix, the memory requirement would be order N squared for you."
"To save all these things as zeroes, if you save it as a sparse matrix, it's order N. 'Kay."
Be easy on your chip.
Try not to save memory stuff.
You're going to have to use your memory for other things besides saving matrices.
Okay?
"So, this is what's nice about this."
"So, hey, look at that."
I put down a diagonal.
"You have to work so hard to form the letters, that it's hard to do that and spell at the same time."
And it's hard to do that and have good ideas at the same time.
You're so good spatially--
Dr. Levine tells Nathan his strengths can help overcome his weaknesses.
"For example, his ability to draw this complicated design from memory can help him visualize facts like history dates that otherwise he would forget."
Remembering dates is a lot of detail.
But it won't be a lot of detail for you if you make a diagram of it and remember it as a visual pattern.
I have evidence that you're very smart.
You need to convince yourself of that.
"It was probably the first time he's heard somebody-- since the second grade teacher-- tell them how great he was, instead of ADD, you know, this huge thing."
It was really specific and it was something that seems manageable.
So it's very encouraging.
"But Nathan's parents think he needs one other thing, discipline."
"One year later, the ranks of the Hargrave Military Academy include Nathan Suggs."
"We get a lot of boys that are very smart and intelligent, have a lot of potential."
But for whatever reason they come here because they do not think they can do it.
Cadet Suggs.
"For his parents, sending their son here is a big sacrifice."
But they believe it's his big chance.
"For this year, we cleaned out his college fund and my parents also contributed."
"And so, I don't know exactly what we would do for next year."
I love you.
I love you.
I've missed you so much.
He lives at Hargrave.
And this fall has been very difficult for me.
"But I'm hoping that he will take in some of the discipline, make it his own."
I'm feeling happier.
I have more self discipline.
I'll probably have more than I have now at the end of the year.
And it will probably be a whole lot easier.
You look so nice.
"The problem is your body, all of us; we care about what happens today, not down the road."
"One of the take home points that astonished me when I start to think about it, is that nature, evolution selects out for who has good kids, and that's what evolution is about: it's about having children; about progeny."
It's not about what happens when we're 80yrs-old or 90yrs-old.
"And so, inflammation is fantastic at dealing with today's ramifications."
"The problem is if you get the flu today, your risk of cancer and heart disease a decade or a two decades from now are up."
S:
If I get the flu just once?
Dr:
If you get the flu once.
"So those five, six days where you feel horrible, your inflammation is through the roof."
That's having ramifications down the road.
S:
"This is already getting a little scary for me, because I've had the flu...so I already feel a little worried about my cancer risk."
Dr:
I can tell by looking at you!
S:
"The symptoms we get when we have the flu or cold, it's not the virus that's causing it."
"The virus is causing the inflammation, which is causing the symptoms."
Dr:
Yes.
That's what's wild.
"When you get a virus, your immune system attacks it, and then you get a fever."
I still don't know why we get fevers.
"It's one of those things where cytokines, which are proteins the immune cells make to send out and get more reinforcements and tell the body what to do, it causes a fever."
"Is a fever good, is a fever bad?"
I don't know!
"We take Tylenol to lower a fever, but is that a good thing?"
Nobody has really looked at the long-term ramifications.
"We've looked at the short-term, but how does that effects will there be a decade from now?"
We just don't know.
S:
"What you're saying is the reason we have inflammation is, something is happening to my body,"
We saw it as an opportunity to develop a crop locally.
It's really volunteers in of our field.
"If you drive around, it's really easy to see right now."
It's going to be turning yellow.
"You can do down the interstate, 65 miles an hour, and you can pick it out."
Once you see it a couple of times.
So it is easy to see.
It's pretty much everywhere.
It's all across the Midwest.
"It stretches into Canada, down into"
Texas.
It's very widespread.
"It originated, probably, in this country with wheat, as a contaminant of wheat."
And that's probably why you see it so widely dispersed.
So we're not the discoverer of it.
We just saw an opportunity to take that plant and do something with it.
So it has very high oil.
"It is 36 percent oil, in the variety that we're working on."
"It's a very small seed, as you've seen this morning."
And it does dry down.
"It has a lot of good things going on in a crop, that you want right out, as a wild crop."
And usually you have to work to get those things.
It doesn't really seed scatter.
It will after a while.
That is how it gets dispersed.
It is usually several weeks after it's ripe that you'll start to see the seed shatter.
"So it holds on to the seed, so you can get it into the combine and do all the things."
"And so, these things sound all easy when you talk about them but when you work on a new crop, these things aren't easy to get to that point."
So this thing started way ahead of every other new crop that we have ever worked on at the lab.
And you have bear that in mind.
It may take tens of years to get to the point where pennycress started.
"So, Win has an opportunity to really take that and move that forward quite a bit and make some real advancements."
"This means I'm standing here on stage facing you,"
"And you are in the audience, in your seats, facing me."
You see the first row in the photo from the top here.
This is a photo of the model that the architects built for the contest.
"The building changed a little during construction, but basically it still looks as you can see here."
This is a photo of the National Theater of Somalia in Mogadishu.
This building has been constructed by Chinese people in the 60ies.
It was a gift of Mao to the young state Somalia.
Therefor Mao-Bibles have been provided at the opening celebration 1967 for each visitor.
"There was a page marked, when you opened it,"
There was a quotation from Mao:
"An army without culture is an uninformed army,"
And an uniformed army can be defeated.
A photo of the opening celebration.
The photographer took this picture on the 4th of May 2012 from a steep perspective.
Therefor you can see the stage tower well.
"From the stage, where I'm standing up to the rooftop are about 14 meters."
This equates roughly the height of the opera-house in Bayreuth.
The only difference is that this theater here is located in the heart of the city.
"Because of the angle which the photographer chose, you can see the prospect hanging there."
"This is the stage desgin of the opening play, which hase been written especially for this occasion."
You can see 4 persons hugging each other.
"At the back up in the sky, here, this is the white star from the flag of Somalia."
This flag resembles the flag of the UN.
It has been designed that way as gratitude to the UN for their aid.
The play has been written for this occasion.
It is called Dalaarwin Walid -
Dadaarwin Walid.
This means advices by the parents.
And this is a play about love.
"Somalia is a country in the east of Africa, which doesn't exist anymore."
"Anyway not as a state, because it fell apart in more than 20 years of civil war."
"I think this graph is the most important graph in all of health policy and I'm not lying or exaggerating, okay."
"There are at least two important lessons to be drawn from this graph, three important lessons."
So the three points of this is we're on another planet when it comes to health care spending.
"This is, the characteristic of a"
luxury good not in necessity and we could get down a considerable amount without the necessity for rationing.
That's why I think this graph is.
The most important graph in health care policy.
"I would also say for those of you who are a real nerds,"
look at these hours squares.
You don't get this kind of correlation.
In any other social science.
You just don't.
You barely got this in the biological sciences and you really have to go to Physics to get these kind of co-relations.
A perfect correlation is 1.0.
"We're spending $7,300 per person in 2007, corrected the next highest country as I mention, Norway."
"Switzerland is number three, $4,763."
Okay?
"So, compared to that, over 50 percent higher than they're spending."
"Now, some people and I won't get in this today will say, well, a large part of that is prices."
We pay more so our MRls cost more.
Our doctors have turns out have higher salaries than doctors in Europe.
Our nurses get paid more.
A day in the hospital in the United States is more expensive than a day in France.
"All true, doesn't eliminate this gap, okay."
"Might reduce it by half, doesn't eliminate it."
Plenty of rich otherwise healthy countries are down below the average.
"New Zealand, right?"
"Korea, South Korea, okay?"
"So, you don't have to, you know, even Finland is just [inaudible]."
You could be a perfectly fine country and spend a lot less than you're spending.
"I mean, these are countries spending a third of what we're"
"- I am need dropped dock tonight, respecting any ships and a boats."
"So this is the width, this is the length."
So L plus W is equal to 8.
What is the perimeter of the shaded region?
Fascinating.
Let's do it step by step.
First we can just figure out what this part of the perimeter is.
"And that's the easiest part, right?"
Because what's the perimeter of the whole circle?
"Well, it's the circumference of the whole circle."
Circumference is equal to 2 pi r.
This is the whole circle we're talking about.
"So that's equal to 2 pi times 6, so that's equal to 12 pi."
"This is the circumference of the whole circle, so the circumference of this arc, of this piece, is going to be 1/4 of that, because it's 1/4 of the whole circle."
"So it's 1/4 of 12 pi, so that's 3 pi."
"Now, what we need to be able to figure out is L and W because if we can figure out L and W, we can figure out everything else about this circle."
"And actually,"
"I'm going to continue this problem in the next video, because I think it might get a little involved, and I don't want you to get too confused."
I'll see you in the next video.
"What's a fuck, lord, music store?"
Hi!
Where's your compact disc departament?
"We don't care CDs, only vinyl."
Only vinyl?
Uau!
What blast to the past
The people's still listen to vinyl records?
I don't know.
"Well, me nice still have..."
I am to interview a patient and I'd like to give you some thumbnail sketch of what
Gestalt therapy stands for.
"The Gestalt therapy works on an equation awareness, equal present time, equal reality."
"In contrast to depth psychology, we try to get hold of the obvious, the whole surface of the situation in which we find ourselves, and to develop the emerging Gestalt, strictly on the I and thou, here and now, phrases."
You can see that's a modern battery in there.
We've converted this.
And this battery is connected to a bulb.
And it lights up.
"It's the most simple thing you can make-- a battery and a bulb, the bulb lights up."
And that's all it is.
The clever bit is the wires of the circuit are inside the rotors.
"So when the wires turn, the battery will connect to a different bulb."
Let's try and see that happen.
"So I'm going to turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
"Do it again, I'm going to turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
It changes.
"Do it again, turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
"And that's why it changes each time, because it has moving parts inside."
"But otherwise, it's just a simple circuit."
I think we need to know how to decode.
"This would be no good if we can't decode our message, so"
let's do that.
"First of all, we're going to take our code here, we need to know what the setting was."
"Now, if you notice, in the little windows, we have three numbers."
"It's like a combination lock, like a bike lock."
"Now, I took a note of what those three numbers were."
"Those three numbers, when we started writing Numberphile, were a 13, 9, and 21."
"So the idea is, you would type in your message, and you would get a code."
"The machine itself doesn't transmit, so you would have to write that code on a piece of paper."
So that piece of paper would be given to the radio operator who would then transmit the message by radio by Morse code.
That would travel miles away.
"So now imagine a second German officer, maybe on a ship somewhere in the ocean, now he's tuning into that radio signal."
He can hear the code.
"It's coming in, and he writes it down."
"Now, this second officer will have an"
Enigma machine as well.
What we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work.
"Well, we had no real reason to expect it would, and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these."
"And just last February, the last time we did these trials,"
I saw a miracle starting to happen.
"What we found was most of these eggs didn't work, but then suddenly, one of them began to divide."
That was so exciting.
And then the egg divided again.
And then again.
"And pretty soon, we had early-stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those."
"We even DNA-tested some of these cells, and the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells."
So we're very excited.
This is not a tadpole.
It's not a frog.
"But it's a long way along the journey to producing, or bringing back, an extinct species."
And this is news.
We haven't announced this publicly before.
We're excited.
We've got to get past this point.
"We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate, to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues."
It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog.
Watch this space.
I think we're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
"We haven't done it yet, but keep the applause ready."
The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.
"The thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog, or maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes."
But it's not related to any of those.
It's a marsupial.
"It raised its young in a pouch, like a koala or a kangaroo would do, and it has a long history, a long, fascinating history, that goes back 25 million years."
But it's also a tragic history.
Any might that you might think that my city as the ideal city.
It is not.
You would be a straight jacket for future generations.
They will make all the cities.
Do you understand?
No final frontiers.
That is the message.
"Well, i got all these ideas from the human body."
"When you get an infection on your toes, there is no community."
That sends a command to the brain.
"And the brain says, oh, i am going to do a two month study."
But at that time your infection is up to your knee.
The antibody go right away.
So every organ of the body is taking care of it.
That is how the Earth is operated.
"Nature's way, not Fresco's way."
Will check.
"""There is one outstandingly important fact regarding spaceship earth."
"And that is that no instruction book came with it."" (R. Buckminster Fuller)"
"- Hi Fiorela, tell me what do you do and why do you blog?"
"- Well, I have two kinds of blogs."
"One has personal content, ""Bitácoras de Fiori Álvarez"" where I tell all kinds of stories, short stories that cross my mind at that moment, some of them are my own experiences, another are my friend's experiences, and things that necessarily need to be repeated, in some way."
"The other blog, has more academic content"
They are brief summaries of what I read.
I study Political Science.
"So, you will find a lot about Sociology, Political Sciences."
"International Relations, etc."
"Basically what I want in the first one is to have a place to vent in the second one, I seek to share knowledge because not to many people have access to a certain kind of books or they don't easily understand them."
"-Besides your blogs, in what other places are you in internet?"
"- Well, I follow some blogs, starting for Ivan Lazo's blogs"
I follow Lucifer Achocada ... ... well different kind of contents there are different things that I read..
"Most of them are about politics, because of my career. the second is related to short stories and simple writings, just to distract my mind for a while."
"This question, that you want to find out."
"Because sometimes, there is so much distortion when you try to focus, that you'll forget the question."
It's like something is zooming in on really what is important.
"And what happens is that, that part of your mind or psyche that's trying to avoid, seeing the truth for what it is."
The mind as you come nearer to identifying the mind will begin to throw stones in the bush.
To trying to get you to look somewhere else.
"So, this will be felt , like a kind of distortion"
"'no, no, I can't cope with it' and all this type of stuff."
"So, write it down."
And hold the question in your consciousness.
And it will begin to burn something.
"You feel, feel it. what will be left is just a sort of spaciousness."
"And intense feeling of presence, just presence, and joy and space."
"Then , in this moment, you re-invite again the question , you see."
"'Now who wants, who wants this picture?'"
'Who wants to fulfill this picture'?
And see what happens then?
It will have no pulling power for you.
"So, this is really the effectiveness of the enquiry."
I want to go over it again for you.
Something is on the mind.
Something is coming up.
"In India sometimes, when it is intense. intensely personal, nothing can trouble you except you personalize it."
"If there is no identity, it has no power."
"You've to somehow spray your scent on whatever it is, to empower it."
You understand what I mean by this.
See Part Three
"The last couple of days, we had heard that Tyler had his head shoved into a wall locker."
They said he was a geek.
My concern is that you were making someone feel so unomfortable that they didn't want to be in school.
I feel kinda nervous on the school bus.
"I like learning, but I have trouble with making friends."
- Yes.
- Especially because Java catches jar index offsets.
- If you replace a jar in a running app....
"- Things get very, very interesting. - ..you get horrible, horrible problems."
"- If you try to load a component that hasn't been loaded yet, the jar offset is wrong so it will just give you a bizarre ""no class.found"" error."
It's a bad error.
It's bad.
That is all.
"- Because I noticed it the other day and because I think it's great, when you look at 5.4, they now ship examples in a format where you build ANT and you get legacy, JAR, and WAR versions fully embedded of all the examples from Web Objects"
"If you don't know how these work or you don't know how to build them, they ship with 5.4 examples now."
"Thanks, Pierre and whoever else made that happen."
- It was actually Daryl.
- OK.
Thanks Daryl.
- Thanks Daryl.
- Is that a hand in the air?
- He may have been the shadow we run to the door.
- I just have a quick question for Pierre.
"When you compile those jars into the extension directory, [indecipherable] and you still have to put them back in the [indecipherable], correct?"
- No.
- If you just shovel them in there then you're lost when the application starts?
- Any jars in your slash content extension are going to be loaded before anything else in your class paths.
There is nothing you have to do.
It's even loaded before the library extension.
"If you want to override a JAR, you just put it there."
It's going to be loaded before anything else.
- OK.
"I just want to go through one quick final topic here, and we're running low on time."
Don't repeat yourself really.
I've only got so many jokes.
I have to use the lame ones.
"One of the things that bothered me when I first started using WOlips is I had all these build files for each project, and they were all substantially the same."
Now what if I tell you that we observe that X 1 was equal to this little value X 1.
"Well if that's the case, then you can come up here and you'll see that X 2 is more"
likely than not to be in this region as.
I'll circle them right here.
So in fact you would expect the conventional mean x one equals little x one to be maybe somewhere around here .
And this would be near 2.1 okay?
Likewise you can see just from this.
"Again, that the variance of x2 would have shrunk."
"Because knowing something about x1 would give us information about x2, and that would decrease our uncertainty about the"
location of x2.
And in fact this expression here tells us how to actually do that.
This mathematically.
"So, so they're conditional distributions."
"A conditional distribution of a multivariate normal is again, multivariate normal."
"We also mention that the linear combination, ax plus a, of multivariate normal random variable x, is normally distributed with mean, a times the expected value of x plus little a, and covariance mix, matrix a times covariance of x times A transpose."
Welcome back.
Well we left off on problem number 13.
But let me start it over just so that we don't get confused kind of doing the problem over the course of two videos.
So number 13.
It starts off with this pattern.
"3, 5, minus 5."
And what it says in the problem is that each even number term is 2 more than the previous term.
And then each odd number term is negative 1 times the previous term.
So we started with 3.
"So let me say term-- let me write it here, term-- term and then value."
And then what we did.
Maybe we could call that f of x or the function.
How did we go from one value to the next?
"So if we make a table, term one is value 3."
And that's just the starting one.
Term two is 5.
"That's because we added 2, we added 2 to 3."
"While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution, and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders, we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage, or whether it's domestic violence, whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere."
"So, why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?"
"What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in, that we can stop, and that there are other ways of actually taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people."
"Well, here is one such way."
(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.
Your parents were peaceful people.
Your grandparents were peaceful people.
So much peace in one place?
How could it be otherwise?
(Music)
"But, what if ..."
Yes.
What if ...
One little gene in you has been trying to get through?
"From your beginnings in Africa, through each generation, may be passed on to you, in your creation."
"It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you."
"And if it's in you, then it's in me too."
"Oh, dear."
"It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother."
"It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide."
"Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work, and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk."
"Oh, dear."
"And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town."
It's that little gene.
It's small and it's mean.
"Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection."
"Adrenaline, kill."
It'll give you the will.
"Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it."
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
"Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me."
"Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln."
Win Phippen:
"On a more sophisticated scale, the corn and soybean production has been around for a while."
And there are several plant breeders in the country that have actually been working on this.
But they are simply trying to improve production practices.
"And so they could be, simply, improving the hybrids for insect resistance, or disease resistance."
Every year new diseases come along.
Soybean Asian Rust is one that came back a few years ago.
All of our current varities didn't have Soybean Asian Rust resistance in it.
"And so now they are looking back to the old wild populations to see if they can find that resistance and find some old lines, and cross it into today's hybrid line."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
And why it is that Western is well positioned to be doing this sort or research?
Win Phippen:
We're in the perfect location.
"We're ideally suited, in the middle of the Midwest."
"We're right in the center of a lot of graduate-level programs, where students can go on and get master's degrees, and PhDs in plant breeding."
"And, most of the seed-breeding companies are located right here in the Midwest."
And so our students come in with a good agricultural background.
And now they can get...
"This grant adds a new minor here in the department, in the School of Ag."
Beth Seaton:
So you have a new minor in plant breeding?
Win Phippen:
A new minor in plant breeding.
So that offers two new courses.
One is in traditional plant breeding...
And this is where we simply cross plants with each other.
And it offers the new bio-technology plant breeding.
"And this is, you've probably heard about genetically engineering plants."
This is here we can introduce DNA from other sources into plants to give it some unique traits.
And this is where we can have plants resistant to herbicides and insects and things like that.
Beth Seaton:
Hockenheim.
It was while test driving and I was always a proponent of hassling people.
That's what we were talking about.
This hierarchy...
"Mansell, Prost, Senna, Berger wanted to put us in our places, which I could never accept."
One example was the test driving in Hockenheim.
I was during a qualifying simulation.
"Ayrton already finished his turn, actually, but suddenly he wanted to come in again."
"He saw that I was straight behind him and even though he had Honda power he drove the curves very slowly, but I could not overtake in a curve, so I tried on the straight but he pushed the throttle and was gone again."
I could not keep up with my Ford engine.
"He did that to me twice in different moments, but then there was a third situation."
"But this time, I was the one ahead and of course I made now the same play as he did."
But he could not stand that and told me afterwards that this is not a correct behaviour.
So that were the first conflicts with the established ones.
I remember that Berger once said:
"""This guy is so eager."
Totally overambitious.
"Actually we don't like him!"""
Did you feel that you got kind of ignored by those drivers?
I felt the opposing wind from them.
"There was an interesting situation, I think in the first or second year"
"Gerhard (Berger) had a flat tire, drove on the side, could not go fast anymore."
I tried to overtake and he totally cut in on me.
This was an act to show me that I should be aware when and whom I overtake
Years later we went home from Monza in the same car...
I already made my first championship and we had an honest conversation.
He said:
"""Well friend, at that time we had the feeling that we must run rings around you."""
You were considered as unapproachable at that time...
What do you think about it?
Quite the contrary!
"Of course I was stubborn, ambitious and focused, but I always tried to be fair"
That's classic thylacine habitat.
And the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around.
So could we put it back?
Yes.
Is that all we would do?
And this is an interesting question.
"Sometimes you might be able to put it back, but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again?"
And I don't think so.
"I think gradually, as we see species all around the world, it's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild."
"We'd love to think it is, but we know it isn't."
We need other parallel strategies coming online.
And this one interests me.
"Some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos, sanctuaries, even at the museums, had collar marks on the neck."
"They were being kept as pets, and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets, and they say they were wonderful, friendly."
This particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep.
A wild animal.
And I'd like to ask the question.
We need to think about this.
"If it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then, would the thylacine be extinct now?"
And I'm positive it wouldn't.
We need to think about this in today's world.
"Could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them, maybe they won't go extinct?"
"And this is such a critical issue for us because if we don't do that, we're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is why we're trying to do these kinds of de-extinction projects."
We are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset.
Thank you.

"large molecule, it's going to move very slowly."
"If it's a very small molecule, it will move through fairly quickly."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"When it gets to the very end of that tube, there is a flame there, and it's going to burn off this molecule."
"And depending on the intensity of the fire, that is created because the molecule comes out at that time, creates a signal."
"And that allows us to determine not only how much oil was in the plant, but also the specific components that actually make up that oil."
Let's take a look at the computer here.
"And so this is the controller, and this controls where all the viles are."
And it keeps track of all the numbers.
I know where all my samples are.
"I know how much material is in those samples, and when it is going to be run."
"And after the sample is run, I get what is called a chromatogram."
"And, simply, it's a graph."
This is the signal strength over time.
"And so, I inject my sample here, and as it goes through, every time"
"I get a peak, that tells me that a compound that is coming to the end of that glass tube."
And so this tells me all the different compounds that were actually in my seed oil.
"Now, as a plant breeder, how do we make sense of this?"
All right.
"What I know is, I know what compound this is at the two-minute time period, four-minute, or six-minute time period."
"Well, let's say I'm trying to create a bio-diesel product that doesn't create as much smoke."
Or maybe doesn't gel up under very cold conditions.
Beth Seaton:
Right.
Win Phippen:
So what I would look for is plants that have very high of this compound and perhaps something low in this compound.
Beth Seaton:
I see.
Win Phippen:
And so I can alter the relationship of these different constituents within the oil.
No!
They are going to know.
"Then, no!"

"When we meet these people, especially those with special needs we find in ourselves.. honestly in myself and yours.."
"The lack towards the speech of Allah we can see and the Quran is right infront of us, and our FlRST language is Arabic"
"Allah says:And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book which is recited to them? yet we still keep away from Quran, some of us read the Quran only in Ramadan, and some of us does not want to memorize the Quran and he knows that the Quran is easy to memorize."
Look at all these examples that was brought your way!
We now want from you to start with your children in helping them memorize the Quran. and you should also memorize too.
"Memorizing the Quran, Reciting the Quran and prefecting it because"
"BY ALLAH, this Quran will be with us OR against us on the Day of Judgment. especially for those who know the Arabic language, those who have been blessed with their sight, their hearing and their tongue"
By Allah we will not succeed.. and will not find blessing except by the Quran.
I ask Allah to Allow us to complete this show and through these great examples - motivate you to memorize the Quran.
You and whoever is around you.
Ameen.
"""I can't seem to get this paper right!"""
"""Having trouble with your writing, Timmy?"
"Have you tried the writing center?"""
"""The writing center?"
"What's that?"""
"""Why Timmy, the writing center is a free opportunity for you to improve your writing skills!"
You don't need an appointment and it's located right in the tunnel.
"Our excellent staff will be glad to help you at any stage of your writing."""
"""Wow!"
A really nice algorithm.
"As I said, an example of divide and conquer."
Notice here that it's different than the binary search case.
"We're certainly dividing down, but the combination now actually takes some work."
I'll have to actually figure out how to put them back together.
And that's a general thing you want to keep in mind when you're thinking about designing a divide and conquer kind of algorithm.
"You really want to get the power of dividing things up, but if you end up doing a ton of work at the combination stage, you may not have gained anything."
So you really want to think about that trade off.
"All right, having said that, what's the complexity here?"
"Boy, there's a dumb question, because I've been telling you for the last two lectures the complexity is n log n, but"
let's see if it really is.
What's the complexity here?
"If we think about it, we start off with the problem of size n."
What do we do?
We split it into two problems of size n over 2.
"Those get split each into two problems of size n over 4, and we keep doing that until we get down to a level in this tree where we have only singletons left over."
"Once we're there, we have to do the merge."
Notice what happens here.
We said each of the merge operations was of order n.
But n is different.
Right?
"Down here, I've just got two things to merge, and then"
I've got things of size two to merge and then things of size four to merge.
But notice a trade off.
I have n operations if you like down there of size one.
Up here I have n over two operations of size two.
Up here I've got n over four operations of size four.
So I always have to do a merge of n elements.
How much time does that take?
"Well, we said it, right?"
Where did I put it?
"Right there, order n."
And that jumping to the front in the end are just a matter of updating that cursor position from zero to the size and whatnot.
The operation where things get a little more bogged down is on this insert where I need to insert a position.
"If I insert the X, Y, Z into the middle there and you can see it kind of chopping those characters down, making that space to insert those things in the middle."
"Similarly, doing delete operations, if I jump to the beginning I start doing deletes here."
"It has to copy all those characters over and deduct that length, right, so that the vectors do that work for us on remove that."
"That means that if the vector's very large, which is not a typical in a word processor situation, you could have you PhD theses which has hundreds of pages, if you go back to the beginning and you start deleting characters you'd hate to think it was just taking this massive shuffle time to get the work done."
So
let's see my - I'm going to bring in the display that
"- whoops,"
I don't like something here.
[Inaudible].
"Now, what do we have?"
"Oh, look at this."
"Well, well, we will continue on."
This inside - okay.
Hello.
[Inaudible].
I have no idea.
I'm not going to try to [inaudible].
Okay.
It's inside.
That's got me totally upset.
Okay.
We still have our old code somewhere.
Okay.
Why do I still have the wrong - what is - okay.
"Oh, well."
Today's not my lucky day.
I'm not going to worry about that too much.
I'm just going to show [inaudible].
Okay.
"So seeing what's actually happening, right, it's like just mostly kind of moving that stuff back and forth, and then having the vector do the big work, right, of inserting and deleting those characters, and doing all the copying to get the thing done."
And this is like the average that you're used to taking before you learned any of the statistics stuff.
You add up all the data points and you divide by the number there are.
The sample is the same thing.
We just use a slightly different terminology.
The mean of a sample-- and I'll do it in a different color-- just write it as x with a line on top.
And that's equal to the sum of all the data points in the sample.
So each of the xi in the sample.
But we're serving the sample is something
less than a population.
So you start with the first one still.
And then you go to the lower case n where we assume that
lowercase n is less than the big N.
If this was the same thing then we're actually taking the average or we're taking the mean of the entire population.
And then you divide by the number of data points you added.
You get to n.
"Then we said OK, how far-- this give us the central tendency."
It's one measure of the central tendency.
But what if we wanted to know how good of an indicator this is for the population or for the sample?
"Or, on average, how far are the data points from this mean?"
And that's where we came up with the concept of variance.
And I'll arbitrarily switch colors again.
Variance.
And in a population the variable or the notation for variance is the sigma squared.
This means variance.
And that is equal to-- you take each of the data points.
You find the difference between that and the mean that you calculate up there.
You square it so you get the squared difference.
And then you essentially take the average of all of these.
You take the average of all of these squared distances.
So that's-- so you take the sum from i is equal to 1 to n and you divide it by n.
That's the variance.
And then the variance of a sample mean-- and this was a
A pile of elephant dung is about this big.
Okay?
So that's what's going off in here.
We are deeply indebted to dung beetles. &amp;gt;
Believe me.
And to fungi.
What's going off here is respiration.
So that's energy.
"You know, you all use it up every day."
"You're using up somewhere between oh 3500 and 5000 calories a day, depending on whether you're on a sports team or not."
And so that's what's going off out here.
And this is coming off of every level here.
Okay?
So you can think of this as what's left over and this is the flow of all that ATP driven stuff on the planet surface.
Now how does that look in space?
"Well if you look at tons of carbon fixed per hectare per year, where green is a lot and yellow is a little, you can see that the forests are really important."
Okay?
"And the closer you get to the equator and the wetter it gets, the more efficient the forests are at fixing carbon."
This is for the terrestrial part of the world.
"If you could put the reefs in, they would be fixing carbon, and they would be withdrawing it on kind of a different timescale."
"Because the tropical forests, although they fix a lot of carbon, don't actually cleanse the atmosphere of CO2, at least not at equilibrium."
Why not?
Student:
As they're &amp;gt; they're actually they're also respiring.
Prof:
"They are respiring, yes."
What happens to a tree when it dies?
Student:
It releases a lot of carbon.
Prof:
"It releases a lot of carbon, right?"
So in fact you could grow up a big forest but you only get the carbon benefit the first time you grow it up; after that it goes into an equilibrium where the trees are falling down and the logs are rotting and they're releasing carbon back into the atmosphere.
That can be nice but then you only have what's on that island.
By opening up the borders for others you become more innovative and you get more unexpected creative solutions.
"As a result, you become better at what you do."
We made the Muse app firstly because we enjoyed it and also because there wasn't an app like it.
"Besides being a fun app, it also gives a better perspective on art history."
"Old paintings from for instance the 17th century consist of many details, which can overwhelm spectators."
We're not used too looking at images in that way anymore.
"By focussing on the small parts and making your own image, you create a better view of the overall picture."
After we won the competition we contacted Open Culture Data... ...to see if we can use the basis we made for other museums as well.
These other musea have their own needs and different data.
"Also, we made MuseApp from our own perspective... ...but by using the data and wishes of other organisations we can perhaps use it in other ways."
We've learned a lot by organizing our own app competition.
Getting a result of 27 entries like we did takes a lot of work and energy.
"You need to let developers know what you're doing, but you also need to know what they want."
Sustainability is also an important issue for app competitions.
"We've given out these four prizes, but what happens to an app when the competition is over?"
I heard everything.

"But even so, even so I mean the fact of choosing, of selecting and deciding on one was the result of being very careful about not using my sense of beauty or my belief in some esthetics of some kind."
"In other words, finding some object of complete indifference as far as esthetics are concerned and that indifference is very difficult because there is always some detail in any object that will attract you esthetically."
"Meaning, that you find it beautiful or even ugly which is the same thing."
Ugly or beautiful is the same thing when it comes to choosing an object in the form of a Readymade.
"By Readymade, also the idea of it was being made by either manufactured or made by another person can be a Readymade, too, you see."
I even remember signing a big painting in a restaurant for the pleasure of calling it Readymade.
"You see, and of course it was not manufactured."
[Laughing]
"So, of course I couldn't take the painting with me because it was attached to the wall."
But this explains that the difficulty is to make people understand that was not through an attraction or the beauty of the object that I would call it Readymade.
"That's why I made so few because after a certain while, anything becomes beautiful."
"You know, it takes 40 years sometimes"
[Laughing]

You'll have one per week and a final.
You'll have deadlines for these
like in a real class.
And you must do these.
Apart from getting a certificate you'll learn.
Finally.
I want you to know how I've structured the class.
I think this is true of most courses or classes.
Its highly recommended to mimic the real world or face to face classes on some dimensions.
"So one of the dimensions is, I will release material one week at a time."
You will not be able to get into the ten week class and do the whole class in a week.
Why am I doing that?
For two reasons.
"One, I genuinely believe that you need time to understand new stuff and practice assignments."
Problems within the videos.
"And if you understand the stuff, you are better off, you can go to the next step."
Luckily Finance builds on stuff.
"So you have to know the first week to know the second week, and so on."
"Well, the second reason is probably more important of releasing one stuff, one week at a time."
"So synchronous, I mean not at a point in time, but for a week."
The second reason is that learning happens from each other.
"So when I do these classes live, all assignments are on a group, and they evaluate each other, not everybody gets the same grade."
"So, this I can't mimic online, but you can."
Join the forums and
learn from each other.
"In fact, I believe you learn far more that way than you'll"
learn from my videos.
And I actually hope that's the case.
Now content and materials is important.
The main material you will get from me is the video.
"For every week there would be approximately two week, two hours worth of video broken up into pieces."
Because Finance is so applied you'll have many opportunities to pause the videos whether I ask you to pause or not.
"We just got an announcement, for those on the phone, about a film Jurassic Park is being played, I guess somewhere in this building, I don't know."
"But , um, the nice thing is, if the developer has written the application properly, and it works well with voice over, any edit box you get to, you can turn Quick Navigation off and you have this whole facility of being able to move by line, character, word, cut, copy and paste."
If you hold down Option and hit left and right arrow you'll move by word.
"You can do Command X to cut text, Command C to copy, Command V to paste--just like Control X, C, and V will do it in Windows."
It's really wonderful.
"So, yeah, any edit box is going to work."
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn on QuickNav again?
[coordinator]
"Um, sorry, question from the phone, would you repeat the question?"
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn on QuickNav?
[panelist]
I didn't hear the question.
[coordinator]
We can't hear the question.
It's something to do with quick nav.
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn it off and on?
[coordinator]
How do you turn QuickNav off and on?
[panelist]
Great question.
"On the keyboard, you hold the left and right... ok, you hit the left and right arrow keys together. ..."
"It just said ""quick nav on."""
"And I'm going to hit them together again, [software speaks]"
"""Quick nav off."""
It's a toggle.
"And the great thing about that is you can turn Quick Nav on, quickly move to the edit box, then turn Quick Nav off and, just, start, you know, typing away."
"Or If the edit box isn't selected, and you want to edit, you can actually, if you move to with Quick Nav ... if you press the up and down arrow keys at the same time to go into the edit box, it will automatically turn Quick Nav off for you."
Good point.
[Other panelist]
- Yeah.
"On the very rare occasions when you expect it and it won't hurt and you're dealing with it some other way, then, yeah, just comment it."
But don't leave an empty block like that.
"The problem is, though, if you don't have that in there then you have to say,"
"""OK, this method throws parse exception."""
Then all the methods that call that have to throw parse exception.
You end up making changes all over your code.
It's a real irritation of Java checked exceptions.
"The best practice for this, instead of swallowing the exception, convert it to unchecked and re throw it."
- Or throw it.
Or throw the original.
"- Yeah, but if it's checked then you have to declare it all the time."
- Yes.
- As opposed to... nobody likes to do that.
Nobody is going to do that.
Nobody is going to make that many changes in their code.
This forward exception has a little bit of a private API call that you can use there if you want to stick with that.
"Pierre is shaking his head going no, and I agree with Pierre because I don't do that."
- I hate that feature of Web Object.
"It's forward exception is something that... objective C polluting Java, it's..."
"- I get this from Wonder, and I blame Wonder for making me do that."
I did it the nice way and Anyo got cranky at me.
There's actually a class called Exception Converter.
"In the notes to the slide there's a URL for it, and it's a much nicer thing to do."
"- Well, you run that exception?"
"- Yes, but the problem of throwing in a run time exception is you lose the original stack trace."
"- You chain it, you chain it."
- Not if you put parentheses E.
- Yes.
Actually parentheses E plus exclusion as to what in this level why it's being thrown.
"- Chain, chain, chain always chain."
- No.
Now I know the woman that you are

"Over the next 14 weeks together we will learn how in nearly 15,000 years humans went from hunting and gathering..."
"""Mr. Green, is this going to be on the test?"""
"Yeah, about the test."
"The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged, and productive citizen of the world."
And it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms and in places of worship.
"You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football and while scrolling through your Tweeter feed."
The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages whether you will be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric and whether you be able to place your life and your community in a broader context.
The test will last your entire life and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that when taken together make your life yours and everything...everything will be on it.
"I know right, so pay attention!"
"In a mere 15,000 year humans went from hunting and gathering to creating such improbabilities as the airplane, the internet, and the 99 cent double cheeseburger."
And there's a real reason why professionally produced narrative is so successful.
"You know, just watch the Oscars and get a sense of how important it is to society."
"My view is that--you asked the question, if"
I may answer it at the wrong order.
"The right way to answer the question is, What does the future look like?"
"And then, How does everybody's models adapt to that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Well, we know what the future looks like. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"Well, let's say it, because I think people are often, are a little confused about it."
The fact of the matter is that mobile devices are going to be the majority of the way that people get information.
And the argument is relatively simple.
You already have them.
They're called your phones.
"And over the next five or 10 years, these phones, if you just-- a simple Moore's Law calculation--will have the capacity to do much of the entertainment and communication and so forth that you use in other media."
And you're seeing that today.
So you have a business model issue.
But there's not a question of how people are going to spend their time.
So let's go through what these devices look
like.
"They've got a GPS on them, so they know where you are."
"They're personal, so they know what you've seen and they don't show you the same thing over and over again, like my television."
You know?
The same show over and over again?
Show it just once.
"It's highly, highly personal."
It can do excerpts.
"And, of course, it's also summary form."
So the combination of all of that means a huge change in the business model.
And I don't think we know exactly how that'll monetize.
What we do know is those products are getting built.
And so the challenge and the opportunity is to figure out how to make money in that.
"But, you won't get there by suing your end users."

The algae are more efficient. &amp;gt;
Prof:
Well you're getting at it.
"They are more efficient, but they're more efficient in a particular sense that makes a big difference to rates."
Okay?
This is the difference--this is a still photo and this is a movie.
Okay?
So there's--that's the difference.
It's a difference in rate.
Yes?
Student:
Algae reproduce a lot faster.
Prof:
"That's basically it, yes."
"A single celled alga can probably have two generations per day and-- at least one per day--and maybe even in a warm estuary three per day, whereas a grass is probably going to be lucky to get through two or three generations per season."
Okay?
So there's a difference of perhaps a hundredfold in the rate.
"And the things that are eating them have a much, much longer lifespan."
"So down here what's going on is that the algae, there are not so many of them, but they're cranking over like crazy, and they're getting harvested"
like crazy by all of the planktivores in the ocean.
"So the krill, the copepods, everything that eats algae, is grazing them, and that's keeping the algae at a fairly low level."
They're a long away from their own carrying capacity.
They're in exponential growth rate almost all the time.
"So they're booming along, and it doesn't take so much standing crop to maintain a lot more biomass because they are turning over and reproducing and multiplying so quickly."
So that is why you see this dramatic shift.
"Okay, so that's a bit of the overall description of the world's ecosystems."
Now let's take a look at cycles of matter.
Okay?
"The main compartments are oceans, fresh water,"
"land and atmosphere, and they are exchanging materials all the time."

The Martian Chronicles is a hinge.
It's the first great science fiction novel.
"Although science fiction writers thought of it as fantasy, and were annoyed that Bradbury got this agilation to leap from the ghetto into the general consciousness, and it was, in fact, a book that got read as a book."
It was not just a fix up.
"It was, in fact, a composite novel."
We can see that if we take a look at the ways in which the stories changed from their original publication to the publication in the novel.
Bradbury bridges the publishing history from before the 1950's to after the 1950's.
"The Martian Chronicles is not only a wonderful work of literature, it is a milestone in the development of American culture."

What are we working for?
For Tanayiku.
For all the community.
"It's such a pleasure, such a delight!"
That's it.
"Oh, I'm almost crying......"
The happiest thing for me is to get all of us together.
"Recovering from the typhoon disaster gradually,"
This is what makes me so happy.
Also I've learnt a lot from this place.
"For example, the interpersonal relationship"
"And also the working attitude, which is very important"
"Whenever I help my customers, I feel very happy."
"Although sometimes they complain to us, we still try our best to reply to their complaint nicely."
I have to work with pleasure everyday.
Because sometimes the visitors want to take a picture with me.
It feels really nice to just be able to watch from above what everyone's cooking style is.
It looks like Tali's never made risotto before.
"It looks like Dave Mack has never made risotto before, as well as Scott."
"He's not using a classic technique, and there's reasons why techniques are developed."
I'm gonna make a poblano risotto for them today.
I'm gonna add a little scallop on top and see where we go from there.
"Hello, Helene. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What do you think?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Um, I think it's actually done."
The texture is telling me that it's really close.
- Did you taste that rice?
- Yes.
That taste cooked to you?
"Well, it's getting there."
- Monti.
"- Yes, sir, chef."
"One, two, three, four pans going."
What are you doing?
"I am gonna make risotto with green and yellow beans, white asparagus, and sun-dried tomato. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Not keeping things simple?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I'm gonna see how things turn out, and I'm gonna go from there. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Last 15 minutes."
Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"So, with 15 minutes left, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we should certainly be adding&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the first consommes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to our final risotto.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"The rice should be toasted, the onions should be wilted."
"You're starting to see the rice swell a little bit, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;gaining volume... working it,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;working it, working it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Who do you think's gonna be doing something delicious? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I think that Frank'll do&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a good risotto,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;because I think&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;he's eaten it before.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Dave Mack?
"- He's got a pot like this, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;where it's literally, like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;just making this porridge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Right.
- I think Tali &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is kind of really&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;out of his comfort zone.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;His technique is off.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"He put cranberries in there. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I mean, there's certain things&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that never go&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in a bloody risotto."
Cranberry's one of them.
He doesn't know when to stop. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He doesn't know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when to stop.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I mean, I'm seriously concerned. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He is in hot water.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Five minutes to go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
That's what I was talking about.
To block somebody in a training session on purpose or tease somebody....
I never did that.
"And I think that, because of me, we have nowdays clear rules in this respect..."
That one treats another fair no matter if someone has the fastest or slowest car.
Everyone tries to respect each other and let them their freedoms.
"Things in Formula 1 have changed a lot after 1994, also due to the death of Ayrton Senna."
When you look now at yourself...
What are the special things about Michael Schumacher?
"Considering the beginning of your career where you were considered unapproachable, overambitious, gifted with steady nerves and an intuition about how to act in critical moments..."
There is a good example.
A German sport journalist described it like this:
In order to describe the characteristics of Michael Schumacher there is one key moment!
"It was in Austria 2003, Schumacher is about to win and makes a pit stop."
"While he was standing in the pit, flames are blazing."
"The astonishing thing is that the remains calm, with an even temper."
"Not like that he would jump out of the car, as we might do it... but one recognizes that he moves the helmet slightly to the right and observes in the mirror what is Happening."
"He sees the flames and although everything is over quickly, he drives out of the pit and wins the race."
And I think in this situation you can see what makes the difference between very good racing drivers and champions...
The ability to be mentally ahead in criticial situations.
That they take their time and analyse without any emotion and only after that make their decision without beeing hectic.
Did he describe it correctly?
...
Not bad ...
But I did not say that money is a bad thing
"I respect every religion ... ... as servile, as it is."
Oh. .. yes ... you do not know ...
"Only calm down, stop splashing with your the spinal cord."
MONEY IS GOD
And you believe religion is Christianity Buddhism and shamanism0:
"00:00:23,501 --&amp;gt; 0:00:00:25,001 not ... but certainly not ..."
And you are not stupid ...
This is very important.
"Every time I put up a problem and you're reading it, please recognize that this is an opportunity for you to learn the stuff by doing the problem first and then starting the video and doing it together with me."
"This is my main advice to you, take every opportunity to do the problems in the videos."
"So you have lot of testing, self-testing opportunities."
"Having said that, video is the main resource."
What do
I mean by that?
I am not going to give you Powerpoint versions of the video.
"To me,"
"Powerpoint is great, but it also makes you go to sleep."
"Online learning, has huge advantages."
"You can make your own class notes, and I encourage you to, from the video."
"But be an active listener, not lay sitting back having a coffee."
And you can do that too [laugh].
"You know, I am too."
Of course I can possibly watch.
"But I would encourage you to make, be an active participant in the video and hopefully if"
I am interesting enough right?
"But I will provide you very few notes, and these are"
largely geared towards stuff that you need to know at one place.
So two or three of these.
"Review of Statistics, some notes on how to use Excel or a Financial calculator, and some formulas put together to."
"But I must emphasis, don't go by the how to do things."
"First understand what the heck is going on, and why."
Another resource I'll give you is there are many textbooks written on Finance.
Finance took off in the late 50s.
"And for the next 30 years, there were a lot of really great breakthroughs."
And those breakthroughs from the fundamentals and great textbooks are available.
"And I'll give you some, I'll give you references."
"But there is one textbook which you may want to look at, which is free on the web, written by a colleague who allows you to read the stuff free not download."
And so on.
"So please when you use this textbook, don't try to download the stuff."
"In Gregorio Marañón or in Castelar, I don't know."
"That moment, when the people were crying and hugging."
"People coming from the northwest and people from the northeast, it was also a moment of..."
"Just over a month had gone by and these people were still getting emotional over little things like that, to meet in a square again coming from different parts of the city."
"They were very emotional moments, and nobody, whether they're for or against what was happening, can deny that there have been moments of emotion. sharing things that don't usually happen in politics."
"They don't usually happen, but that's politics too."
Empathy is pure politics.
Those were three emotional moments that I experienced.
"And the worst, probably what happened in Barcelona."
"I mean what happened at the gates of the Parlament, violence as an answer to whatever, but in the end violent outbreaks of tension."
That somehow fractured part of the message that we were sending out.
That was a very sensitive moment.
But it also consolidated the movement.
"Because people went out to the street to prove that that was just an isolated episode and not what we're about, that is not what defines us."
But it was a complicated episode.
Another bad moment...
ST:
I'd like you to find something that you experienced.
"That you witnessed or that affected you, that made you feel bad."
In my case it's obvious.
There were maybe two.
"The violence on the 5th in the Ministery of Interior, or the 4th of august which was the first contact and not very violent, but for me very surprising."
And afterwards undoubtedly on the 17th I took that video and got home trembling.
I experienced that and it was terrible.
I don't know if you...
JL:
I wasn't there that day.
ST:
"It doesn't have to be in that sense, I don't know."
Frustrating.
"Or if you don't remember, I'm happy for you."
JL:
We won't stand for tyranny!
O king: and it's too late to apologize.
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late!
"We've paid your foolish tax, read the acts, and they just won't do."
"We want to make it clear, we believe this much is true: all men were created with certain unalienable rights!"
"Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!"
It's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
It's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!
It's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize!
Halfway across the globe and we're standing on new ground...

In this session we値l be talking about Renaissance and the landscape that incorporated the time roughly from the 14th to the 17th century.
We値l be talking about Italy and the Italian philosophies and different design styles and how they set a pattern for the rest of northern Europe which became known as the Northern Renaissance.
The Renaissance was a cultural movement.
It began in Italy in the late Middle Ages and then spread to the rest of Europe.
The ideas from the Renaissance have disseminated from around the 15th century across Europe.
"It was really this resurgence in classicism and it was a time of development of linear perspective, artists and rendering techniques, realistic type paintings and gradual educational reform."
The tortoise and the hare are racing to see who can run 100 feet in the shortest amount of time.
"However, we need those two bubbles to keep the rope, the wire, the cable... whatever it is... in a fixed position."
"So, here is the crane's arm with a hook."
Let's attach it back to the cabin.
Congratulations again.
We have made the crane.
The crane will look much better and have much more use if we put the crane on a base.
"So, let's make a base."
Inflate a balloon
leaving about three inch flat tail.
Twist a chain of four about...two inch size bubbles.
Lock both ends of the chain of the first four bubbles in one lock twist.
The rest of the balloon we split aah...to make four about seven inch size bubbles.
Twist the fifth seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the fifth bubble between the first and the second bubbles.
Twist the sixth seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the sixth bubble between the second and the third bubble.
Twist the seventh seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh bubble between the third and the fourth bubble.
If you properly measured previous bubbles then the rest of the balloon is the eighth seven inch bubble.
It's OK if we make eighth bubble of different size.
Lock the free end of the eighth bubble between the fourth and the first bubble.
Congratulations.
We have made the base for the crane.
Our next step is obvious.
We attach the crane tower to the base.
There are four ends at the bottom of the tower.
We tie each end to the appropriate spot between bubbles of the base.
"Again, if you made a different size eighth bubble of the base, then you want to place the eighth bubble of the base on the front or on the back side of the crane."
"Congratulations, we have made the crane on the base."
Let's just fix all bubbles in proper positions.
The structure of crane base allowed us to convert the crane to sort of a mobile crane.
Simply adjust position of the sides of the base to make two wheels mobile crane.
"For example, I can do something,"
I can cut my hair short to minimize my shampoo consumption.
"I can reduce my footprint by, for example, taking the elevator."
"Because when you take the elevator, you can be five time less bad"
"Because it takes, for a vegetarian, five times more energy to lift somebody by taking the stairs, than taking the elevator."
"In calories, it's five times more energy intensive than taking the elevator."
"So, whenever you want to protect the environment, take the elevator, because it takes so much less energy when you have an elevator, because you use calories so much."
"We can do a lot, for example, never drink sparkling water."
Because it's three litres of carbon dioxides.
"We can do a lot; we call it ""sustainability""."
"When I ask you, ""How is your relationship with your girlfriend?"
What would you say?
Sustainable.
(Laughter)
"Then, I am really sorry for you."
(Laughter)
"So, this is not about minimizing being bad; it's about being good."
We talk about reducing carbon dioxide emissions; but two thirds of all the carbon is in soil?
"Not in oil, not in coal, two thirds of all the carbon is in top soil."
"So, we want to be carbon neutral, but why don't we make a footprint which is beneficial, instead of carbon neutral?"
"People try to be ""less bad""."
"You will say, ""Oh yes! 'm 90% bad, 80% bad,"
"I make all zeroes carbon neutral""."
"For example, Europe has a goal to be carbon neutral in 2050."
You can only be carbon neutral when you don't exist.
This is the only way.
"Just by thinking, you are not carbon neutral."
"So how could you say, ""My biggest goal is to be carbon neutral?"""
"Out of all the environmental disasters,"
"- Seveso, Bhopal, The Love Canal, Chernobyl - the generated feeling is, ""it's better we're not here""."
"And when you are in, say, Amazon, we think, ""We are a pain for the planet""."
This is why we try to be less bad.
"Pale skin shows through, where the intensely itchy animal's rubbed off 80% of its hair."
"These ghosts are sick, starving, and fatally anemic."
But the ticks live on.
Females remain dormant in the ground for weeks.
"In Africa, some species survive without food for much, much longer."
"In harsh environments, big mammals are few and far between."
So a tick finds a shady tree and heads underground to wait... and wait.
Ticks are ultimate survivors because they can sit waiting for a blood meal for ten years!
"We've seen ten of nature's toughest animals-- battling adversity for days, months, and years."
"But only the tick can survive without food for a decade, which is why it's number 1!"
even as I put it in my last incarnation:
"""Everybody's got something to lose except for me and my monkey"""
Hi!
How can we survive without overusing nature's resources?
It's of vital importance here to maintain a balance.
"This is what we examine in this unit, focusing on fishing-- trying to find the best strategy that serves both humans and nature."
"On the way there, we encounter some fundamental concepts of differential equations and in the larger fleet of simulation."

"Once again, I am so sorry."
That one doesn't know front from back.
"It would have been nice to have your son join us, as well."
"No, not at all."
He isn't my son at all.
I need super computers.
"So, what does Google do here?"
What does--why do we do this?
"Well, partly, at the end of the day, it's paradoxical."
We want to give people time back.
We want them to get you to an answer quickly.
"We want you to be more productive so that you can get back and give us the things that, that--the things that you enjoy, which"
I would argue or relay around people in society and culture and the things that all of us appreciate so much.
"So in our case, a new definition of Google would have--we're trying very hard to get you something fast."
"Never underestimate the importance of fast, quick, quick, quick."
We want it there.
We want it now.
We want to help you right now.
Speed matters because your time matters.
We make hundreds of improvements to search every year.
You see them gradually all over and over again.
The accuracy gets better.
The index gets much bigger.
You'll see some of the facilities in a sec now that we've done around translation and other kinds of annotation.
"We have one of the largest infrastructures now which we just introduced, which is internally known as Caffeine, which basically allow us to handle even greater, greater indexes and many more information."
"Now, what are we going to do with search?"
"Ultimately, search is a personal activity."
"So, ultimately, where search goes is it searches not just the web, but literally all of your information, your email--the things that you care about."
"This is with your permission, I might add."
"This is personal search for you and only you because ultimately, search is about finding what you want right now."
"And the next step of search, of course, is doing this automatically."
"So when I walk down the street of Berlin, I love history, what I want is I want the computer--my smartphone to be doing searches constantly."
Did you know?
Did you know?
Did you know?
Did you know?
This occurred here.
"From then on we danced together, no matter where or when; waiting for the underground or the bus stop."
"And we are still like that today after 10 years that when we are going to a dance, we just walk faster"
We just want to arrive and start dancing!
"Unconventional, without prejudice and full of life energy; Lindy Hop is more than just a dance!"
John:
"Hi, I'm John Green."
"This is Crash Course World History and, today, we're going to discuss, wait for it, the Mongols!"
(wild galloping music)
So you probably have a picture of the Mongols in your head.
"Yes, that's the picture."
"Brutal, bloodthirsty, swarthy, humorously mustachioed warriors riding the plains, wearing fur, eating meat directly off the bone, saying, ""Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar."""
"In short, we imagine the Mongol Empire as stereotypically barbarian, and that's not entirely wrong."
"But, if you've been reading recent World History textbooks,"
"like we here at Crash Course have, you might have a different view of the Mongols, one that emphasizes the amazing speed and success of their conquests."
How they conquered more land in 25 years than the Romans did in 400.
How they controlled more than 11 million contiguous square miles.
"And, you may even have read that the Mongols basically created nations"
"like Russia, and even Korea."
One historian has even claimed that the Mongols smashed the feudal system and created international law.
"Renowned for their religious tolerance, the Mongols, in this view, created the first great free trade zone,"
like a crazy medieval Eurasian NAFTA.
"And, that's not entirely wrong either."
"Stupid truth, always resisting simplicity."
(upbeat lively music playing)
So remember herders?
"We talked about them, back in Episode 1, as an alternative to hunting and gathering or agriculture."
Here are the key things to remember.
1.
Nomads aren't Jack Kerouac.
They don't go on random road trips.
They migrate according to climate conditions so they can feed their flocks.
2.
"And Mozilla has been blessed with all three: immense effort, tremendous skill and this luck that things appear."
"So, Mitch appeared and he essentially arm wrestled AOL for that seed money."
We look at the 2 million dollars and we thought that we could support maybe 10 people for two years.
"Because we had set down as mozilla.org and thought that to be effective as a project, the minimum number of people we needed was 10."
Running the machines was one person.
"You know, we keep the project alive but we couldn't be successful."
And Mitch had pitched a little bit of other money and IBM and Sun were our first commercial partners and they pitched in some money and started maybe with 12 or 13 employees.
What that meant was:
"Johnny Stenback and D Baron, that was the platform team."
"One person on Firefox for the front-end team, one person on Thunderbird, one release engineer,"
"Chofmann as an engineering manager,"
"Mick did the ultimate sacrifice and ran our systems for us, for a year or two before we were able to get him back into a role that really fit him better, we had one person helping us on sustainability,"
"Brendan as Brendan, and me trying to be successful."
And that was it.
And that seemed like a lot to us.
[Question]
"That's right, I forgot Asa"
How can I forget Asa?
[Question]
And project management.
And still.
"From that day till now, phenomenal."
"Whenever I have a problem with my browser, Asa is always able to figure out what it is."
So that's it.
No one else can ever do that.
[Question]
"All of a sudden, we had our own independence."
"It was pretty scary, 10 people is not really enough, there was no ongoing financial sustainability that we knew of, it was a gamble, but we had our own independence and we could make a product."
We made phenomenal changes in that period.
It was our second set of phenomenal changes.
"When we were founded we made up an organisation that was revolutionary, as Chofmann described."
How do you work with a company?
"Yes, if you're trying to do like a full blown formatter, then you actually do need to worry about the position."
"- The point of the Wonder Helpers, by the way, is that formatters you can only...well, from the binding, from binding, you can only use them on components that expose a formatter finding."
Wonder Helpers you can use on any binding.
- That's nice.
- I don't think I've used those.
- You should because you steal them.
- I will.
"- Right, right."
You can have multiple...
- They can be extended into something else.
- I usually just chain the formatter instances.
- No instances.
- We won't go there.
"OK, so, moving on to our final topic, I think we're, are we out of time Pascal, or Keep going.?"
"Deployment, trying to get through here quickly."
There's really not much to say about deployment that hasn't been said in other places.
"Manage dependencies, plan for change."
It's going to happen.
"Web Object extensions directory sounded like a great idea when it first came out, jammed all kinds of jars in there."
It was wonderful.
Then I needed to update one app in the server and I couldn't update the other apps and it was terrible.
"For deployment, my advice is just delete everything in that directory."
It's just a dependency nightmare waiting to happen.
"Instead, if you need it, if you need jar files, put them in a framework, use the framework in your application."
Framework goes into your subversion repository wherever your repository is.
Manage the dependencies like that.
"In fact, I'll go one further and say,"
"""You should embed all frameworks."""
"All frameworks, I include the Web Objects ones as well because that way you can deploy applications using different versions of Web Objects, different versions of the jars on the same server."
You don't have to worry about conflicts.
"And Yeah, people are going to say,"
"""Oh, it's going to be bigger."
"They, I'm sure you know, their paper has improved as a result of this."
"Right, right."
"So you know, that, that does not hurt."
"It's everybody's instinct, I think to at first be a little defensive when you get your review back."
Yeah.
Because you have to go back and.
Yeah.
Tweak the language a little bit.
"Right, right."
"To make sure your, you know polite."
"That's a good tip, yeah."
And can you give us some words of encouragement for young scientists who might have submitted their first paper and actually got an outright rejection?
"Can you, what are some words of encouragement?"
"Well, I would just say, fix it and if it's totally rejected by that journal, their not asking for resubmission, fix it."
"Try to respond to the reviewers comments that you feel are justified, and submit it elsewhere, and persist."
"I've had my, as an author, I've had to submit papers to as many as four journals til the, finally got accepted."
So I think persistence is important.
Don't take the rejection personally.
"It's hard not to, and I sometimes do, but you realize that some reviewers may not be very competent, may not really understand what you're doing."
This will often happen if you've submit[ted].
Epidemiologic paper and it gets reviewed by a clinician who does not really understand.
Um-hm.
Principles of epidemiology.
"They'll feel that if you write a paper about stroke if, if every case was not reviewed by a neurologist then it's not a valid paper."
Right.
"So or, or maybe they're competent but just had a bad day and, and didn't really pay close attention to what you wrote and miss some passages that really would have answered their questions."
"So just realize that reviewers are human, just like you just like authors and, And."
That's just the way the system works.
"Yeah, yeah."
It's not perfect.
And then talking about the system a little bit.
"You know, what changes do you anticipate are gonna occur in the publication process?"
"This stream cipher consumes in the beginning both a key and IV, as we've seen, but does a computation 100 times to produce an internal state that is then mapped onto the output that's then XORed with the message is basically the output message."
"Interesting is this part, though."
Each of these links is such a small computation that you can easily reverse it.
"It is nonlinear, meaning you cannot really reverse it without 100% certainty, but it's such a small computation that you can just kind of brute force the input space."
[Dave]
Okay. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Carson]
Right?
So little--
[Carson]
But the input space is small.
[Carson]
"Yeah, just a few bits change in each of these steps, so you can just go through all the possibilities of input space and see which ones map back to your output."
Right?
"Now, you may end up with several, so it's not always that only one of the inputs would have produced."
That's exactly the nonlinear property.
"However, this may look as a complication at first but does, in fact, help the hacker because each of these also generates a key for some given IV that you assume."
"Well, at least some."
Some may be dead ends.
But at least in a lot of cases you can track one point that you store in your table back to different keys. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Dave]
I see.
Different starting key IV pairs lead to the same output.
"Exactly, and on average, for each value that you store in the table you have 13 keys that you find every time."
Only one of them will be the correct one.
Sometimes even all 13 are wrong. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Dave]
I see.
[Carson]
But if you do find a key it will just be one of them.
"However, storing this point in the table is equivalent to storing 13 points in this table."
[Dave]
"Right, and now each lookup is the equivalent of doing 13 lookups."
[Carson]
"No, the lookup is actually the same effort, but the storage is decreased."
You loved me and I frozen in time

Professor Charles Bailyn:
"Okay, here's the plan for today."
I want to do one last foray into relativity theory.
"And this is going to be a tricky one, so I hope you're all feeling mentally strong this morning."
"If not, we--gosh, we should have ordered coffee for everyone."
"And, in so doing, I want to introduce one key concept, and also answer at least three of the questions that you guys have asked before in a more--in more depth, and also relate the whole thing back to black holes."
"And then, having done that, we'll have some more questions."
"And then, having done that, I want to get back to astronomy; that is to say, to things in the sky that actually manifest these relativistic effects."
"So, that's where we're going today."
"And along the way, as I said, we'll deal with some of the questions you've been asking in a deeper kind of way."
"In particular--so, questions."
Watch out for the answers to these questions.
No rumours were published.
"I know that sounds obvious, but it's not as easy as it sounds [laughter]."
"It's not that easy, and no rumours were published."
"The only rumour that was heard one day was whether something had happened to a kid in Barcelona, but they immediately rectified... that is if they actually ever published it."
"They said over and over that nothing had happened, and asked people not to spread rumours."
"And in the end, everything works through soft leadership, where anyone can do what they want as long as it's inspired in the collective, very interesting projects appear."
"Take the Square, the 15-O (october) from the beginning, Stop Evictions as a warning and alert platform when there are evictions..."
"Things start to happen that transcend the traditional strategy of communication in social movements, and they transcend the strategy of political communication of any self-respecting political organization, they would love to have the richness of communication that the 15M had."
ST:
"Not related to what you've been talking about just now, although maybe it does form part of it, I'd like you to tell me what has the 15M done wrong?"
JL:
(thinking)
I don't know what to say... because to personify it's hard.
What has the 15M done right?
"15M, since I'm convinced it doesn't move..."
ST:
I define the 15M as a state of mind.
JL:
Exactly.
You could say that the 15M is a state of mind.
But I understand what you're saying.
"The black spots, right?"
ST:
Yes.
Things that weren't pretty?
"There have been obvious mistakes, others less obvious, some of them that you have experienced..."
JL:
I understand the problem with the media.
"I understand perfectly the grudge, or if you prefer another word"
less contemptuous: the indignation against the media.
That indignation can't disappear in three days.
There is damage that the media has done in the poverty of everything.
"An emergency fund could take the form of cash, checking accounts, savings account money market funds or even certificate deposits at a bank or a credit union."
"These funds, should not be subject to any sort of major market risk."
"Some people might consider equity in their house or access to their credit part of their emergency fund, but, still a foundation of cash and cash equivelants is, is, still the best and very important, because access to credit could suddenly dry up or be hard to get in an emergency."
An emergency fund is also vital to tapping into assets I'm sorry emergency fund is also vital to avoid tapping into assets that may have been earmarked for your long-term goals.
"In the next lesson, we'll talk about setting some financial goals."
"Have you ever stood naked, in front of the mirror?"
And looked at yourself?
I mean really looked
I did.
This morning
How was it?
Completely horrifying
Guys have it so easy.
"The expectations for a woman are hellish, Harrison"

What am I doing?
I'm not going
"Oh, you're going Mom."
You've been planning this for a years
"I've ironed the shorts, you were looking forward last night."
They're already packed.*
"Shorts packed, check"
"Oh, no."""
I'll happily trade off some FDP upload time for manage dependencies.
- OK.
Two comments on that.
"Most embedding framework,"
I would encourage you to embed a jar version of the frameworks.
"If you look at since 5.2, I think."
"You can actually jar your framework, and they would work just the same."
"You can just dump them in your application in content extensions, and they're going to get loaded exactly like any other framework."
"It's very compact, it works really well."
You cannot [indecipherable] jar.
You can have flat jars which are the same.
"The other comment that I would say on the size of the app, is that gziped your app, before you upload them, you will save more time."
"It's incredible, I have seen so many people trying to upload a .woa not zipped."
It takes forever because the protocol are usually very inefficient on starting and stopping files.
"You are going to upload hundreds of small, tiny files, which is crazy."
- Yes
"- gzip's them, you'll be surprised you can save one, if not two order of magnitude in the upload."
"- If I can continue with that, once you have zipped it and put it up once, use RSync to sync it after that, because then you only move differences."
- Don't do that.
The reason you should not do that is because you will have a running app on the old version.
"If you have multiple instances, you really should upload it into a different folder and do a version swap so you have..."
"- To be clear, you should shut down the production site prior..."
"- No, no."
You don't want to shut down the production site.
You want to keep it running.
"- You just Rsynching the zip file, not the app."
- Then you have to unzip it on the server.
"- No, you're proposing unzipping the WOA, I think."
"- I was Rsynching the WOA, right?"
But I shut down the site.
- If you don't want to shut down your production site and you don't want to be replacing your WOA in line.
"Off-topic but, if that quote rings a bell, it might be because Oliver Stone blatantly plagiarized"
"Genghis Khan in the movie, ""Conan The Barbarian."""
2.
Is an extension of 1.
The Mongols were seriously brutal conquerors.
"I mean, not uniquely brutal, but still ..."
"The Mongols often destroyed entire cities, and most historians estimate the number they killed to be in the millions."
3.
Their empire didn't last.
"Within 80 years they'd left China and been replaced by a new dynasty, the Ming."
"And, in Persia, they blended in so completely that, by the 15th century, they were totally unrecognizable."
"I mean, they'd even taken up agriculture!"
Agriculture!
The last refuge of scoundrels who want to devote their lives to working instead of [skoodillypooping]!
4.
They also weren't particularly interested in artistic patronage or architecture.
"I mean, your palace may last forever, but my yurt can go anywhere."
5.
The Mongols were probably responsible for the Black Death.
"By opening up trade, they also opened up vectors for disease to travel; in the case of the Plague, via fleas infected with Yersinia pestis."
"And, at least, according to one story, the Mongols intentionally spread the plague by catapulting their plague-ridden cadavers over the walls of Caffa in the Crimea."
"While this primitive act of biological warfare might have happened, it's unlikely to be what actually spread the plague."
More likely it was the fleas on the rats in the holds of Black Sea ships that were trading with Europe.
"But, that trade only existed because of the Mongols."
"All right, Stan, one last time - cue the Mongol-tage."
(wild galloping music)
"So the Mongols promoted trade, diversity, and tolerance, and they also promoted slaughter and senseless destruction."
"And, what you think about the Mongols ends up saying a lot about you."
Do you value artistic output over religious diversity?
Is imperialism that doesn't last better or worse than imperialism that does?
"And, are certain kinds of warfare inherently wrong?"
"If you think those are easy questions to answer, then I haven't been doing my job."
Ole:
It could of course be true
Martin:
But it is also different to compete in the artistic substance than just compete in who can jump highest; ... and run the fastest... is there a difference in these things?
Ole:
"Yes but unfortunately they did that too but they had competitions in oratory and theater and so on, as you mention but it is a competition where you will be honored by the community as well as there's competitions in the immediate self sacrifice for the community that isthe greatest honor that can happen to you"
"Whoever wins this contest winner on behalf of the community and it's not how competition works in our culture but it may well be that competition as a phenomenon has paid off just like the life struggle has done because if people had not been forced to work for a living, perhaps they had not created ​​the things they have"
Martin:
So it's a side effect we are talking about and not competition in general?
Ole:
"No, it's very complicated."
Martin:
But then you're now touching the whole basis of the free market
Ole:
What it has led to're highly problematic and where they have attempted to tie them through government controls have indeed created some absolutely terrible results
Martin:
So it could have been done otherwise?
Ole:
Then it really should be done otherwise!
You have to prevent a concentration of power and one can only imagine the slow transitions
Martin: but we havn't got the time..
Ole:
"No, we havn't got the time if we are to achieve it within your prediction horizon"
Martin:
What would you do first if you were to start a positive process now?
Ole:
"Then we should start tomorrow already by going out in town and tell every person you meet no matter if you know the them or not, something nice about them ...and then see what happens.."
It's actually not that easy..
Martin:
"It's probably not so easy, no... and if everyone did it at once.. it would be a great day for everyone.."
Ole:
"A fantastic day, right.."
That's so funny!'
"Gideon said, 'Yah.'"
"Couldn't see any of them laughing, though"

"Hi, I'm Bibiana."
I'm from Venezuela and I've been in Kiwi House for 4 years.
Kiwi House is one of the 24-hour care houses of the ministry Formando Vidas (Shaping Lives)
Here in Kiwi House we work with children of different ages and stages.
"Currently we work directly with 8 children; 4 full-time and 4 part-time in the ministry which come on weekends and some other times, because we're working with their moms."
Part of working in 24-hour care and Kiwi House is being a full-time mom
"We get up early, we cook, we clean, we help with homework"
All the general things of a family home
"That is very risky and tiring, but it also brings a lot of joy many times"
The background of the majority of the kids we work with in Casa Kiwi most of our kids have spent a lot of time on the streets
It's beautiful from every standpoint if you're a health economist.
You keep healthcare cost down and you get revenue and wages up.
"Now, some."
"Nasty, bleeding heart liberals say, you're taxing people."
True but their wages are also going up so their take home pay guess what?
It's going up.
You don't collect taxes unless their wages are going up.
It's a beautiful thing to tax people more.
"It means that earning more, okay?"
"This is the law stand point, those of us who are being inclined to the economic way of thinking, this is a beautiful thing."
"So, you're right."
You take.
All three existing condition but there is still another problem which is age.
What do we know about age?
"You guys are healthy, I'm getting sick, right."
I'm getting older and the older you are the more likely you are to get sick.
Your body just runs down.
"Things begin to fall apart, you need replacement parts, right?"
"So, the [inaudible] was more likely to hit more people except there is protection, alright."
One protection is.
"In cases each year index with inflation, okay?"
"We have a higher threat of level for the entire individuals, 55 and older, high risk professions, [inaudible] objective, firefighter, excellent."
"Unions and high risks so, you know, this is democracy."
You cater to every special interest.
You decide this [inaudible] arrangements with all sorts of exceptions and [inaudible] because you want to keep the center.
Companies with higher health cost stood to age or gender or their work.
Get exceptions.
"So, we've tried to take into account many of these potential problems."
"And by the way, in the exchange, there's a limit to how much you can [inaudible] because of older people, three to one ratio."
"The, the funny raise a point here."
"Notice this, what's beautiful about that first doc?"
It's inflation adjusted but why is that such a beautiful [inaudible] health care economist like prices.
"I have some trauma or an injury, but I might have to run away from a lion tomorrow."
"So fix-fix-fix Sal now or fix David up so he can run away from a lion tomorrow, but in the wild I might not have lived to 40 anyway."
So why even worry about whether that person might get cancer if they get to 40 or 50?
Once they're past the point of reproduction.
Dr:
"Right, the body has to choose priorities."
The priority is today rather than tomorrow.
"An amazing study was done where we gave patients what we call a ""statin""."
Statins are drugs that were developed to block the synthesis of cholesterol.
"We thought, you know, people with higher cholesterol--particularly the bad one, LDL--those people have a higher incidence of heart disease."
"So, if we block the synthesis, we're going to affect heart disease."
What do you know?
We did!
A dramatic effect:
We lowered the death from heart disease with these drugs.
S: so it seems like they worked!
Dr:
Right.
"Then a company, or a very clever group did a trial where they gave people with normal cholesterol these drugs."
"It also had a dramatic effect, in that it delayed heart attack and stroke by almost a dozen years,"
Wow and it reduced the incidence of cancer by about 40%.
S:
"So cancer, something we don't normally associate with cholesterol."
Dr:
"So it turns out these drugs, which are the biggest drugs in terms of sells we ever had, worked by lowering inflammation."
"So the affected heart disease wasn't by lowering cholesterol, it was predominantly by lowering inflammation."
And the affect on cancer was by lowering inflammation.
"In fact, remember when the swine flu came out a couple of years ago?"
"If you got the swine flu, the only thing that protected you from your lungs collapsing going on what we call a ventilator, a breathing machine, was being on one of these statins."
S:
Because it would stop the inflammation.
"Because with swine flu, people were dying from inflammation going nuts."
They have a form of language.
[high pitched ape sound by man.]
And they use more complex tools than anyone realized.
"By looking at the differences and similarities between apes and us, we may find the secret ingredient that makes apes apes and humans human."
We take it for granted but self-recognition is a fundamental building block of human society.
We exist as individuals.
Each with our own unique features.
Scientists believe self-recognition is essential for our survival.
We can live in large groups because we recognize similar features to our own in others.
We can tell friend from foe.
But is self-recognition uniquely human?
Show a monkey a mirror and it thinks it's another monkey - it attacks.
But how will our closer relatives the great apes react when faced with their own image?
This 3 year old chimpanzee has never seen a mirror before.
He's not sure what to make of it.
Erect fur is usually a sign of fear or anger.
But his fear is soon replaced by curiosity.
"When chimps see themselves in mirrors the first time, they naturally assume it's another chimp."
The way a human being who's never seen themselves before does.
And begin to play with mirror image.
"Soon, this chimp will know it is looking at itself."
"Just like these older chimps, they know exactly what mirrors do."
This chimp appears to know that that's her tongue and those are her teeth.
Chimpanzees seem to have a concept of the bodily self that allows them to look into a mirror and say that image is equivalent to this body.
But how can we prove that humans and chimpanzees really identify the figure in the mirror as themselves.
Psychologists have a well-known test for this.
"It's called the ""mark test."""
A researcher marks a child's cheek.
The child then looks in the mirror.
He moves his hand up to the mark.
He recognizes himself.
"By the age of 2, half of all children tested can recognize themselves."
In 1985 the church have closed as the roof has collapsed.
It rained and snowed into the building
It was hardly any ... left on the walls
The benches ereased as they were all ... eaten and totally rotten
Humidity was nearly constatly above 90%
And the consequences was mold and decay.
Whoever the community refused to throw in the towel.
Together with ... supporters and craftsman from the region
Reconstruction begun in 1996 and was also supported by DRYMAT.
This has deffinetly helped to reduce humidity enormusly not only in the room air but also in the walls.
It is checked continously the humidity value being determined and we were quite amazed to see such an effect
You know we have already tried all kind of methods.
"We have drilled holes, put injections into the walls, and kept renewing the ..."
And at that time the water really run down the walls in ...
Everything we did was useless
So this is the only method which has really been helpfull for us.
And it is persievable.
Visitors who come into our church often say that the air has improved considerably.
Finally the church where JSB got married could be preserved thanks to the supporters who spent countless hours working here after work and the weekends.
Thanks to the many donations made by ... supporters from all over the world
And thanks to DRYMAT.

The semantics of relational logic is not by itself to tell us which terms are equal and which are not.
"In fact, it's possible for every term to refer to a distinct object in the real world and it's possible for every term to refer to the same object."
"Well, the semantics relational logic does not constrain your quality relation."
The idea of coreferentiality does.
"For example, it's not possible for us to believe a=b and b=c and at the same time, not believe a=c."
We can capture these constraints through axioms.
"Let's say, serious vote of no confidence and a serious use of patient of congressional authority."
"Now, it's."
Set the ball user patient of congressional authority because the congress voted it.
"By the way, when we were pushing or discussing this, who do you think was most [inaudible] against this provision?"
The congressional staff.
The staffers on the house ways and means committee really hated this.
Why did they really hate it?
[inaudible] in the heat but every time they're going to consider changing the Medicare law or the.
Right?
They didn't have power.
"They've got either the device people or the doctors, or the hospitals, or the drug companies, or the patients, everyone [inaudible] arguing why the opposition is right."
They have a lot of power.
"They just given up the power to some other organization, you know who are they?"
The [inaudible] decision made by someone else.
They're n obody.
They really hated this.
"Those staffers, they went berserk."
"But, the President made clear that this had was one of the, absolute [inaudible] parts of the bill."
I believe it will not be [inaudible] that this not another Republicans blew it.
How did they blew it?
Anyone following the news?
They blew it by their [inaudible] appeal to [inaudible] reform.
What does that blow it?
Democrats aren't interested in.
"Now, reforms stand along and they get enough for it."
So.
The ambition of project Velocar match one of the great stakes of our time : sustainability of our mobility.
"Before the end of this decade our big, fat and oiled powered cars will inevitably have to be reinvented."
"That's fortunate, we are not alone thinking this way."
"You may have heard of the recent Twizy, a two seated electric micro-car."
"And well before this, the velomobiles with their simple yet clever idea : get rid of you car problem, by replacing it, with you bike !"
"In practice, a Velomobile is an aeroshell that sits on top of a trike to help you brave wind, cold and rain on your everyday rides."
"We're gonna start off by playing some kerbals space program then continue to outlast, so join the fun."

"Hello, my name is Maryanne."
And my name is Ashley.
We are seniors here at Western illinois University.
Majoring in Instructional Design and Technology.
"Also, known as IDT."
Something I really enjoy about our majors the opportunity to be working with the latest technology.
"As well as, experience such diverse and unique careers depending on what we want to do and where we want to go."
"In the IDT field you can focus your future working with government, business, health, military or the educational setting."
It really has no limit where you want to extend this career.
IDT involves learning to use technology to effectively design training and educational material.
Did you know that IDT department is just one of the few departments in the nation?
"In fact, we are the only school in the Midwest to offer a bachelors degree in IDT."
"Also, in the Chicago area alone there is 141 job offerings."
Let's talk about what this field can offer for your future career opportunities.
As Maryanne mentioned before the IDT department offers a variety of career opportunities that are diverse.
"You can pursue careers in government, heath, business, military and educational setting."
These are a few companies that our previous graduates had the opportunity to work with.
Our IDT department offers hands-on learning lesson and experiences from highly world dedicated professors.
"Why don't you take a moment to take a look at the IDT see all the different resources, as well as, the two options of study our department has to offer."
I choose the medium web base development option.
The section of study I love the formal based learning with focus of online course development.
And I choose the games and simulation option.
This option of study is a learn by doing approach.

The college of Arts and Sciences is there for students to seek who they are and to become who they can be
Narrator:
It's the largest college at the University of Alaska Anchorage the College of Arts and Sciences a place where world class instructors are exposing students to possibilities that will begin to define their future
"David Edgecombe, Ph.D. Theatre Professor:"
I was talking to a student about directing and directing is all problem solving
"It's all making decisions, sometimes spontaneous decisions to change and affect what you are seeing in front of you and those problems, I think, can be very easily transferred to real world situations"
Eric Murphy:
Ph.D. Associate Professor of Psychology:
Whether one approaches the problem from an arts perspective or a natural science perspective what we are giving them is pretty much the toolkit on asking the important questions and then pursuing the answers to those questions on their own.
"Charles Crew, CAS-Psychology Student:"
How I decided
"I really wanted to get into helping to teach as well as helping to conduct research here on campus,"
I started to conduct my own research project in 2009.
I was definitely pointed in the right direction from faculty
like Dr. Murphy
"LeeAnn Munk, Ph.D. Depart Head-Geological Sciences:"
We feel like we've succeeded most when the student gets to the point where they are making their own discoveries.
"Hillary Jochens, CAS-Geology Student:"
"This semester, for example,"
"I'm taking an economics class, which is so pertinent to geology, and all the English that I've done, and the art, and everything"

"Now, I think the parties are afraid, because people are so outraged."
"I would say, on the left and the right, knowing this presidential election is going to cost $2.5 billion dollars--obscene--the--if you add the congressional races, you're up to $5.8 billion--that just says that our system is broken."
"And I think that the two parties are worried about it, because the American people are starting to realize that it's very hard to keep calling our system a democracy when it's being run by a very small elite that is the shadow government."
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide

My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done"
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
"Well, a few of the verses"
"Well, they've got me quite cross"
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see
I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody that this is your song
"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done"
I hope you don't mind
"But despite these limitations, Wiki has been, Wikipedia has been extremely powerful in certain fields like medicine the Wikipedia entries are extremely well documented."
So now we have to look at some of the underlying reasons.
Okay.
Including forming consensus on conscientious articles.
Among a community of possibly anonymous contributors.
One way to look at the challenge of consensus formation is to look at the order of growth.
"For example, if we look at."
A network.
With many nodes and many links.
We often say that there is a network effect.
"And a positive one, where something good Gross."
As the square of the number of nodes and okay the something good for example could be the utility of the presence of a node.
Now this implicitly assumes that every node is linked to every other node.
Or at least the number of links a node has growth linearly.
As N.
"So we'll later come back to this positive network effect, this n-square law, in various lectures."
But today we'll also look at the complementary picture that is two to the n law.
Suppose each one of these n nodes is just a binary state of mind.
"For example, do I support a certain political position or do I not support?"
"Then out of N, knows that two to the N possibilities of configurations."
And yet we would like to reach a consensus.
This exponential growth two to the n in the number of people in the crowd or network highlights the difficulty of reaching consensus.
There're just too many possibilities.
"And yet, consensus we must reach, and what"
Wikipedia practice is what they call the good faith collaboration.
There are rules and guidelines.

The decedent expired due to a gradual shutdown of the bodily functions.
Why did her body shut down?
The autopsy found that it was a cumulative effect... ...from numerous physical traumas exacerbated by malnutrition... ...which severely inhibited her ability to recuperate from those traumas.
"In other words, her starving body had little or no means to recover... ...from the injuries it was sustaining, and so it eventually just gave out."

Sadhguru:
"When you are unable to hear what somebody else is saying, your relationships will go bad."
(Laughs)
"In many ways, the fundamentals of your relationship is, you are willing to listen to the other person, isnt it?"
Hum?
"If you want to say everything, there will be no relationship."
"Relationships, for most of you the way you are right now, the quality of your relationship"
largely decides the quality of your life.
Is that so?
Hum?
The quality of relationships that you hold in your life
largely decides the very quality of life that you live.
"So, when it is playing such an important role in your life,"
I think it needs to be looked at.
So what is the basis of a relationship?
Why do human beings need a relationship first of all?
"Relationships are formed on different levels, various types of relationships, to fulfill different types of needs."
"The needs may be physical, psychological, emotional, social, financial, political, it could be any kind."
"But to fulfill various needs within a human being, relationships are established on different levels."
"Whatever the nature of the relationship, whatever the type of relationship, still the fundamental aspect is you have a need to fulfill."
"No I have nothing to get, I want to give."
"Giving is also as much a need as receiving, isnt it?"
Yes?

"Rational numbers, integers, whole numbers, and natural numbers were infinite but a particular type of infinite he called ""countable""."
"Irrational numbers were also infinite, but what he called ""uncountable"" a much larger infinity than the countable rational numbers."
Cantor established a hierarchy of infinities.
We saw that real numbers are formed by combining the rational numbers and the irrational numbers.
Since real numbers include irrational numbers which are uncountable real numbers are also uncountable.
"In other words, the infinite collection of real numbers is the same size infinity as the infinite collection of irrational numbers."
Unlike the rational and irrational numbers every point on the number line corresponds to some real number.
If you randomly pick a point on the number line it will always correspond to a real number.
There are no gaps in the real number line.
This means that you can move smoothly between any two points and never encounter anything but real numbers.
"Since there are no gaps, the real numbers form a continuum a property which is essential for calculus."
So now we know that between any pair of irrational numbers are an infinite number of rational numbers and between any pair of rational numbers are an infinite number of irrational numbers.
And don't forget that there are infinitely more irrational numbers than rational numbers.
If this makes your head want to explode then congratulations!
You are on your way to becoming a mathematician.

Farn-Sasan
"Farn-Sasan was the last king in the Indo-Parthian Kingdom who ruled Sakastan from about 210 to 226. There are no books that talk about him. He is only known because of the coins he issued. He was killed in 226 by the ruler Ardashir I. Because of this, the Indo-Parthian rule ended."
Origin of name.
"Then name ""Sasan"" was popular with the Indo-Parthian people. The origin of the name is not entirely known. David Neil MacKenzie and V.A. Livshits says that the name comes from Old Iranian, translating to *""Sāsāna"" (""defeating enemy""). It is also the name of a Zoroastrian deity."
Biography.
"Farn-Sasan went into the Indo-Parthian throne sometime in 210. They don't know what king was before him. They think it may have been Pacores. Farn-Sasan is not mentioned in any books. He is only known because of his coins. These coins all say ""Farn-Sasan, son of Adur-Sasan, grandson of Tirdat, son of the grandson of Sanabares, the King of Kings."" Farn-Sasan tried to make himself notable by his rule by showing that he was related to his great-grandfather, Sanabares, a famous Indo-Parthian king. He calls the King of Kings Sanabares the King of Kings. Farn-Sasan also called himself the King of Kings. This happened a lot in Achaemenid and Parthian rulers."
Adur-Sasan and Tirdat were never a ruler. This means that Farn-Sasan was probably from a cadet branch in the dynasty.
"On the front side of the coins, he is seen with a cap. On the other side, a fire altar is shown. The altar has writing around it. Farn-Sasan is the only king that is known to have a fire altar on coins that is also from Sakastan. Around the same time, Ardashir I () made coins with a fire-altar that looked like Farn-Sasan's coins. Historians are not sure if Farn-Sasan copied the fire altar or if Ardashir I copied the fire altar off of Farn-Sasan."
"Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I share a similar name. Because of this and the fact that both of their coin has a fire altar, historians think Sasanians and Indo-Parthians may have had common ancestry. Historians say that Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I were rivals. Both wanted to be the King of Kings. The Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani argues that Farn-Sasan was a superior of Ardashir I. He said that Ardashir I was only able to say that he was the King of Kings after he defeated Farn-Sasan in 226 and ended Indo-Parthian rule."

"These prize amphores were made to a standardized shape, held about 42 quarts, and were decorated in the black-figure technique. An armed Athena was depicted on the front of the amphora and a picture of the sport on the back. This amphora depicts five men and a youth."
"The museum writes, ""Notice the wealth of incised lines depicting musculature, a preoccupation of Greek artists for centuries to come ... An inscription on the front of the amphora gives not only the official designation of the vase as a prize, but also the signature of the potter, Nikias, a rare occurrence on pots of this shape."""

The Ghan
"The Ghan is a passenger train between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin on the Adelaide–Darwin railway in Australia. The train is operated by Great Southern Rail. It takes 54 hours to travel the with a four-hour stop in Alice Springs."
The name.
"The train's name is a short version of its nickname ""The Afghan Express"". This nickname is said to have been first used in 1923 by one the train crew. The train's name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help find a way to reach the country's unexplored interior."
"Another view is that the name was an insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached Oodnadatta. This was home to about 150 cameleers, known as 'Afghans'. 'The Ghan Express' name was used by train crews in the 1890s as a joke because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, 'on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan'. As early as 1924, it was known as 'The Afghan Express' because it was so unreliable, often days, or weeks late. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, the insult of the names, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has turned the name into a term of pride in its heritage."

"""Hanji"" is made out of inner bark of mulberry, a tree native to Korea. The inner bark of the mulberry is so strong and durable that it does not decay in water up to a year. Korean paper’s durability comes from this tree. The life span of Korean paper is 1,000 years. For example, ""Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong,"" the world's oldest woodblock print was created in 751. Also, thanks to its durability, Koreans even used it as body armor in war. 1 year old trees are used to make the high-quality ""hanji"", and older trees are used for cheaper modern papers."
Usage.
"There are several kinds of mulberry trees in Korea. They grow in different climate conditions. Each kind of mulberry tree produces different kinds of hanji, and they are all used in a different way. There are various kinds of Korean paper, and they are named after their usage. ""Changhoji"", for instance, is a kind of Korean paper. ""Changhoji"" means window paper. Koreans used to glue ""changhoji"" on a door because it allows both air and light through it, thanks to its wide fiber. There are other kinds of ""hanji"" as well. When Korean paper is used as a copy paper, it is called ""bogsaji"". It is used as paper for family registry book or Buddhist scriptures. When the Four Gracious Plants (plum, orchid, chrysanthemum and bamboo) or birds are drawn on ""hanji"", it's called ""hwasunji"", the drawing paper.

The typescript of ""Doctor Zhivago"" was smuggled out of the country to Milan and published in 1957."
"Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature the following year, an event which humiliated and enraged the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Who is a Jew?
"Who is a Jew? () is the basic question about the identity of Jews, or in other words: which people are considered to be Jewish."
Question of race?
"The definition of who is a Jew may depend on a few things. Because Judaism has no specific race, it can include characteristics of an ethnicity, religion, and citizenship, and so the definition of who is a Jew is not specific."
"This question has been a subject to legal arguments, especially in Israel but also outside of it. There have been court cases in Israel since 1962 which had to address the question. In addition, the United Kingdom and other countries has had to consider whether the question was a racial issue or not."
In Nazi Germany.
It was an important question to the Nazi party in Germany. The Nazis decided who a Jew was with the Nuremberg Laws.
My mom is Jewish or I converted.
The question is based on the person's genealogy. Simple definition: a person is a Jew either by birth (in any case if one's mother is Jewish) or by religious conversion.
Other ideas.
"However, some disagree. Therefore, the following need to be taken into account:"

Where they live.
Bushmasters are found in forest areas of Central and South America. They are also found on the island Trinidad
Reproduction.

A female can lay around a dozen eggs at a time. The female stays with her eggs until they have hatched and may attack any predator that comes near the nest."
Venom.
"The bushmasters are one of the largest and dangerous snakes in South America, and can inject a large amount of venom into their enemies. Even young bushmaster's bites are harmful, but bushmasters are nocturnal (they are active at night), so not a lot of people have been bitten by them."

Tamamo-no-Mae
"Tamamo-no-Mae (玉藻前) is a legendary figure in Japanese mythology and folklore. In the Otogizoshi, a collection of Japanese prose written in the Muromachi period, Tamamo-no-Mae was a courtesan under the Japanese Emperor Konoe. She was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman in Japan. Tamamo-no-Mae's body mysteriously always smelled wonderful, and her clothes never became dirty. Tamamo-no-Mae was not only beautiful, but she was very wise in all subjects. Although she appeared to be only twenty years old, there was no question that she could not answer. She answered every question posed to her, whether about music, religion, or astronomy. Because of her beauty and intelligence, everyone in the Imperial Court adored her, and Emperor Konoe fell deeply in love with her."
"After some time had passed, the Emperor suddenly and mysteriously fell ill. He went to many priests and fortune-tellers for answers, but they had none to offer. Finally, an astrologer told the Emperor that Tamamo-no-Mae was the cause of his illness. The astrologer explained that the beautiful young woman was in fact an evil fox with nine tails (kitsune), who was making the Emperor ill in a evil plan to take the throne. Following this, Tamamo-no-Mae disappeared from the court."
"The Emperor ordered Kazusa-no-suke and Miura-no-suke, the most powerful warriors of the day, to hunt and kill the fox. After escaping from the hunters for some time, the fox appeared to Miura-no-suke in a dream. Once again in the form of the beautiful Tamamo-no-Mae, the fox told Miura-nosuke would kill it the next day, and begged for its life. Miura-no-suke refused."
"Early the next day, the hunters found the fox on the Plain of Nasu, and Miura-no-suke shot and killed the magical creature with an arrow. The body of the fox became the Sessho-seki, or Killing Stone, which kills anyone that comes in contact with it. Tamamo-no-Mae's spirit became Hoji and haunted the stone."
"Hoji is said to have haunted this stone until a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by Hoji. Genno did a certain spiritual ritual, and begged the spirit to consider her spiritual salvation, until finally Hoji surrendered and swore to never haunt the stone again."
"In Matsuo Bashō's famous book, ""The Narrow Road to the Deep North"" (Oku no Hosomichi), Bashō tells of visiting the stone."
"The stone split on March 5, 2022. While some have humorously said that Tamamo-no-Mae is now free, there is a far more general belief that the split is an omen of impending tragedy."

When the featherfoot is hunting you, it waits till you’re alone or in a small group, at night walking to a destination. The person or the group will start to get a sense of foreboding, followed by a strong sense they are being followed. The featherfoot is close behind, following. Its steps are silent and leave not tracks. The only way to survive a feathfoot attack is to never look behind you until you get back to a light source. Keep walking and don’t look back, it’s when the person looks behind them, is when it attacks. Often the reason the spirit will follow and attack someone is because they have committed a crime, or something as heinous or evil."

Nurse
A nurse is a person who is trained to give care to people who are sick or injured. Nurses work with doctors and other health care workers to make patients well and to keep them fit and healthy. Nurses also help with end-of-life needs and assist other family members with grieving.
"Nursing is a profession, like a doctor, but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must train and what kind of training they need. In some places, nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse."
"Nurses work in many places. Nurses work in hospitals, in doctor's offices, and in the community, and they even visit people at home if they can not get out."
"Sometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors, because the nurses will be able to help patients directly, by talking to them, doing things they need, carefully watching that nothing goes wrong, and then seeing them as they get better."
"Like doctors, nurses can choose what work they do. Some nurses train and work to help during surgery. Some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition (what to eat), and disease (what can make people sick). Nurses can do many different jobs to help people."
Nurses are in demand because there are not enough nurses to handle hospital needs. Because of this shortage nurses will sometimes travel to another location to work for a few months in what is called travel nursing.
Titles.
"Registered Nurse in some countries like U.S is a term for an officially registered nurse. In hospitals where nurses wear uniforms with caps, an R.N. is recognizable by the fact that the cap has two black stripes."
Nursing in Australia.
"Nursing in Australia is done by ""Registered Nurses"" or ""Enrolled Nurses"". Both must complete education past high school. An Enrolled Nurse must complete a course of study between 12 and 18 months. Registered Nurses need to complete a Bachelor's degree."
Gender-neutral titles.
"Titles have changed because men as well as women can be nurses. It was, in most countries, a wholly female occupation. The titles were designed for females and have now been revised to be genderless. The exception to this is midwife, a term still used because it seems natural that a nurse helping a mother through childbirth should be a female. There are some males acting as midwives. The supervisory body for UK nursing is the Nursing and Midwifery Council."
Teams.
"Some medical and surgical groups operate as teams. This means that senior surgeons always operate with the same group of people, so reducing the risk of mistakes, and allowing juniors to learn and understand the individual cases."
"Also, moving around as a team allows specialist groups to serve more than one hospital. This is particularly useful when the amount of work in a speciality does not permit having a full team on site in each hospital."

Lake Torrens National Park
"Lake Torrens National Park is a national park in South Australia, 345 km north of Adelaide. The park protects the area around Lake Torrens, which is a large, dry, salt lake covering an area of 5,700 square kilometres. The lake is part of a large rift valley that also includes Spencer Gulf. Lake Torrens has been filled with water twice in the last 150 years."
"The lake filled in 2010 and attracted a large number of birds, including 150,000 Banded Stilts. This bird can only breed on islands in flooded salt lakes and have only bred in South Australia seven times in the last 70 years. The last known breeding was at Lake Eyre in 2000. During dry times the stilts live at the Coorong Lakes waiting for the salt lakes to flood."
History.
The first European to find Lake Torrens was Edward John Eyre in 1839. For many years it was believed that Lake Torrens was a large horseshoe-shaped salt lake in the northern Flinders Ranges. This salt lake blocked any path to the interior. The first European to get through this barrier was A. C. Gregory from the north in March 1858.
"Later in 1858, an expedition under Benjamin Herschel Babbage and Major Warburton in the north-west also crossed the non-existent barrier near modern Marree. Eyre's horseshoe lake was actually made up of six large salt lakes; Lake Frome, Lake Callabonna, Lake Blanche, Lake Gregory, Lake Eyre South, and Lake Torrens itself."
Hominin
"Hominini is the tribe of african apes that comprises humans (""Homo""), and all ancestors of ""Homo sapiens"" back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with ""Sahelanthropus"" as a key fossil."
"A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the genus ""Pan"" (the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). In this case, the subtribe Hominina is the ""human"" branch, including genus ""Homo"" and its close relatives, but not ""Pan"". All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species."
Genera.

Subtribe Hominina
Hominina
"Hominina is a sub-tribe of the hominid primates. It is used by some anthropologists to include the upright biped apes, including the genus ""Homo""."
"If an anthropologist wants to includes chimpanzees in the tribe Hominini, then it follows that a sub-tribe is needed to put Australopithecines and humans in. But this is not a majority view at present, and the mainstream view is:"
"If used, the group includes ""Sahelanthropus"" six to eight million years ago."
Taxonomy.
"Even today, the genus ""Homo"" has not been properly defined."
"Because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, Carl Linnaeus did not even bother to define ""Homo"" when he first created it for humans in the 18th century. The discovery of Neanderthals brought the first addition."
"The genus ""Homo"" was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human."
"Over the decades of the 20th century, there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times."
"Classifying a fossil as ""Homo"" means evidence of:"

San Diego Convention Center
"The San Diego Convention Center is the main convention center in San Diego, California. It is in the Marina district of downtown San Diego. The center is managed by the San Diego Convention Center Corporation."
"The convention center has of exhibit area. As of 2009 it was the 24th largest convention center in North America. It was designed by Canadian architect Arthur Erickson. The building can hold 125,000 people."
"The center's best known feature is the Sails Pavilion. It is a exhibit and special event area. The Sails Pavilion's roof includes Teflon-coated fiberglass ""sails"". They are intended to show San Diego's maritime history. The Pavilion was first built as an open-air facility under the roof. This made it hard to get people to use it. Because of this, the Pavilion area was enclosed in glass. This made it much more usable."
History.
San Diego approved the construction of a new convention center in 1983. It was built on land owned by the Port of San Diego. Construction of the building began in March 1987 and was finished in November 1989. The center was made larger in September 2001 by doubling its square footage.
"Notable events hosted at the convention center include the Comic Con International convention. It hosted the 1996 Republican National Convention, which nominated Bob Dole and Jack Kemp for President and Vice President of the United States."

Burning of Jaffna Public Library
"The burning of the Jaffna Public Library () was an attack at the central library in the city of Jaffna, Sri Lanka. It was one of the events that led up to the Sri Lankan Civil War. The first attack on the library building was on 1 June 1981. A group of Sinhalese rioters burned the library that was one of the important libraries in Sri Lanka and one of the biggest in Asia."
"This was one of the most violent examples of ethnic-based book burnings of the 20th century. At the time of its destruction, the library was one of the biggest in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts."
"In 1984 the library was repaired. However, the civil war had begun the previous year. The building was burned several times during the years of fighting, until 1998 when the president tried to make peace between the Sinhalese and Tamil sides. In 2003 the rebuilt library reopened again."
List of Mayflower passengers
"The ""Mayflower"" was a ship which is famous for its sailing to North America in 1620 bringing pilgrims and other settlers to create the Plymouth colony in Massachusetts."
This is a list of the passengers who traveled on that voyage in 1620. Some of these people were looking for a new home so that they could practice their own religion. Others were passengers who came for other reasons.
Servants.
"Thirteen of the eighteen persons in this category were attached to Pilgrim families, the other five were with non-Pilgrim families. Four of those listed here were small children, given over by Samuel More to Thomas Weston and then to agents John Carver and Robert Cushman, who assigned them to senior Mayflower Pilgrims to be classed as indentured servants."
"In all, there were 102 passengers on the Mayflower - 74 males and 28 females"
Animals.
"At least two dogs are known to have participated in the settling of Plymouth. Edward Winslow writes that a female dog which is called an English Mastiff, and a small English Springer Spaniel came ashore on the first explorations of what is now Provincetown, Massachusetts. There may have been other animals on the ""Mayflower"", but only these two dogs had been mentioned."
History.
The club was founded in June 1914 as football department of Turnerbund Lustenau and was named FA Turnerbund Lustenau. This name had the club till 1936. For not having a football assosiation in Vorarlberg the club only played friendly matches. During the time of First World War there were no matches. In 1920 the club started in a regular championship. The first success was the Vorarlberg championship in the 1929/30 season. They were qualified for the Austrian Amateur Championship and reached the final versus Kremser SC.
"In 1936 the club left the Turnerbund Lustenau and became a club of its own. The were renamed to SC Austria Lustenau. In the following years they reached several titels. In 1994 they won the Regionalliga West and were promoted to the First League, the second division in Austrian football. From 1997 to 2000 they played in the Bundesliga, the top division of Austrias football. Since the relegation 2 000 they played in the 2. Liga. In the 2021-22 season they won the league and were promotet to the Bundesliga."

Cradle of Humankind
"The Cradle of Humankind is a World Heritage Site. It was first named by UNESCO in 1999. The site is about 50 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa in the Gauteng province, and occupies ."
"The site's limestone caves, including the Sterkfontein Caves, were where fossils were found. A 2.3-million year-old fossil ""Australopithecus africanus"" (nicknamed 'Mrs. Ples') was found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson. The find followed the 1924 discovery of the juvenile ""Australopithecus africanus"" skull, 'Taung Child', by Raymond Dart, at Taung in the North West Province of South Africa, where excavations still continue."
"The name ""Cradle of Humankind"" reflects the fact that the site has produced a large number, as well as some of the oldest, hominid fossils ever found, some dating back as far as 3.5 million years ago. Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils ever found."
Recent work.
"The remains of several partial skeletons of a previously unknown Australopithecan species were found in 2008 near Johannesburg. They have been dated to about two million year ago (mya). A recent re-examination of two partial skeletons of ""Australopithecus sediba"" has led to its identification as close to the origin of the genus ""Homo"". Not all palaeoanthropologists agree this is a new species."
"A new analysis shows this species had a human-like pelvis, hands and teeth, and a chimpanzee-like foot. In six separate research reports, palaeontologists reported on the anatomy of a juvenile male skeleton, MH1, a female skeleton, known as MH2, and an isolated adult tibia or shinbone, known as MH4. The findings suggest that some species of australopithecine climbed trees, some walked on the ground, and some did both."
"Colleagues in England investigated the teeth. Like other parts of the skeleton, the teeth are a mosaic of primitive and human-like features."

Luís Vaz de Torres
"Luís Vaz de Torres was a Spanish explorer. Sometimes his name is spelled Luis Váez de Torres. He was born around the year 1565, and died in 1607. Today, he is noted for the first recorded European navigation of the strait which separates the continent of Australia from the island of New Guinea. The strait is now named after him (Torres Strait)."
Origins and early life.
"Captain Luis Váez de Torres undertook a voyage from 1606 to 1607. In this voyage, the crew called him a ""Breton"" in reports. One of the reports points to an origin in the northwest province of Spain, that is Galicia. Historians accept this as evidence of his origins. The year and exact place of his birth are unknown but he was likely born around 1565."
"Torres has been presented as Portuguese, without any evidence other than his name. He is never called a Portuguese in the records but they note remarks made by crew members of the Portuguese origins of Pedro Fernandes de Queirós."
Torres entered the navy of the Spanish Crown and found his way to its South American colonies. By late 1605 he first entered the historical record as the nominated commander of the second ship in an expedition to the Pacific. The Portuguese born navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós proposed him for the position.

Variscan orogeny
The Variscan orogeny (Hercynian orogeny) is an ancient mountain-building event in the late Palaeozoic era. It was caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana to form the supercontinent of Pangaea.
"It explains many older features of the present-day world. The Appalachians in North America and the Massif Central in France are two examples. Other examples are the Pyrenees, Sardinia, the Rhine Massif, the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. To the east, the Variscan caused the Urals, the Pamir, the Tian Shan mountains."
"This geologic mountain-building event took place mostly in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. By then Pangaea was more or less complete. In the Triassic period of the Mesozoic, there was land between Siberia over the North Pole to Antarctica over the South Pole. Later in the Mesozoic, the opening of the Atlantic split Pangea. The various parts of the huge mountain belts ended up widely apart on the modern globe."
Higher mountain chains on present-day Earth are the product of a later episode of mountain-building known as the Alpine orogeny.

The bodies of the other five children have never been found. The Sodders believed for the rest of their lives that the five missing children survived."
"In the 1950s, as they came to doubt that the children had died, they put up a billboard at the site along State Route 16 with pictures of the five."
"In support of their belief that the children survived, the Sodders have pointed to a number of unusual circumstances before and during the fire. Authorities say the fire was caused by an electric fire and that the remains were cremated in the fire. The Sodders believed the Sicilian Mafia or someone else kidnapped the children due to George's anti-Benito Mussolini views."

"Sing Pao Daily News kept writing for months that the group had been causing trouble in Hong Kong for their own gain. Leung sounded like he looked down on the above-said writing when he once answered reporters' questions. Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, whose boss is Jiang, kept writing for months that the above-said writing was telling lies."
Many people cared about their writing bad things about each other. They had different guesses on why it was happening.
"In February 2017, Sing Pao Daily News said that some people had begun doing horrible things to try to make them stop writing about 'the Gang of Four Messing up Hong Kong'."

Problem signs.
"Unintentional weight loss is when a person loses weight without trying. It can be a symptom of some types of cancer. Stress can cause unintentional weight loss. Stress can come from divorce, changing jobs or over the loss of a loved one. Once the stress is removed and the person feels happier again, the weight may return to normal. Depression may also cause weight loss. Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can cause significant weight loss. These disorders usually require the help of health care professionals."
Sleeping.
"Getting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight. Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight. The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food. Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits."
With every breath.
"Without going to the bathroom, a person naturally loses over while they sleep at night. One reason is humans breathe in oxygen but breathes out carbon dioxide. That is breathing in one molecule of Oxygen for every two molecules of carbon each time they breathe out. A molecule of carbon does not weigh much by itself, but given that with each breath twenty billion-trillion molecules are expelled, over a 7-8 hour period that adds up to over a pound of carbon. Normal perspiration occurs while sleeping but usually only causes a small amount of water weight loss."
Your body also burns calories while you sleep.
Diet vs exercise.
"It is well known that lean mass (muscle and bone) burn more energy than fat. Even at rest, a body with more muscle tissue will burn more calories."
Exercise alone can be effective in weight loss. Several studies found similar results. The comparison between dieting and exercising found both resulted in weight loss. The conclusion was that using both diet and exercise together was the most effective method of weight loss and in maintaining a healthy body.

Sportsbook
"In the United States of America a sportsbook is a place where a player can bet money on many different sports, for example basketball, golf, football, hockey, baseball, soccer, horse racing, boxing and many more."
"A bet is when a person thinks that a particular team/contestant will win a competition and gives some money. If he wins the bet - he will receive his money back with some monetary prize. If his team/contestant loses, he will not get his money back."
"The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 allows only Nevada, Oregon, Montana, and Delaware to legally bet on sports."
"There are more Sportbooks that allow betting online or through mobile. With better availability and lower minimum bets, the whole industry is rapidly growing."
Before placing a bet a person should read the terms and conditions of the sportsbook to avoid any problems.
Paid survey
A paid or incentivized survey is a type of survey where person for filling out the details will get some reward.
The recency effect is normally said to be caused by short-term memory. (STM) The STM of a person can store a small amount of information for a short time. The amount of information is normally two to four items. The last few items of a list being normally still in the STM of a person when the items are being recalled. This theory explains why the recency effect is generally larger than the primacy effect. It takes more effort to get the first items from long-term memory (LTM) than to get the items from STM. This is affected by the STM of the person being affected by a distraction.
"Newer research has shown that the recency effect can exist without STM. For instance, Bjork and Whitten showed that even when STM was distracted there can be a long-term recency effect. During their study, they had the people do something to affect their STM during the entire test. These test showed that there was still some recency effect . Some psychologists think that the recency effect is based on a theory of temporal context. Temporal context means ""the context of time"". Theories in this field are vague and still developing. The general idea is that context is connected to each item on the list. During recall, This contect will help the person remember the item. The later the item in the list, the more similar the context of the item is to context of the test."
Link to models of memory.
Earlier research showed that the serial position effect was connected to single way that memory is stored such as LTM (primacy) and STM (recency). Research on people with brain damage that affected their LTM has showed a recency effect but not a primacy effect. This gives good evidence for this.
"On the other hand, the serial position effect is also supported by dual-store or multi-store models of memory. For instance, research on the serial position effect supports the multi-store model of memory by Atkinson and Shieffrin. Research about the long-term recency effect may show evidence for theories of the working memory model."

Freud Museum
"The Freud Museum was the home of Sigmund Freud and his family after they escaped the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938. It is at 20 Maresfield Gardens in Hampstead, London."
"After the death of Anna Freud, the youngest daughter, in 1982, the home became a museum. The centrepiece of the museum is Freud's study, preserved just as it was during his lifetime."
"There are two other Freud Museums, one in Vienna, and another in Příbor, the Czech Republic, in the house where Freud was born."
The study.
"The study and library were preserved by Anna Freud after her father's death. The bookshelf behind Freud's desk contains some of his favourite authors: not only Goethe and Shakespeare but also Heine, Multatuli and Anatole France. Freud acknowledged that poets and philosophers had gained insights into the unconscious which psychoanalysis sought to explain systematically."
"The room contains the original analytic couch brought from Berggasse 19. On this patients would recline comfortably while Freud, out of sight in the green tub chair, listened to their 'free association'. They were asked to say everything that came to mind without consciously sifting or selecting information. This method became a foundation upon which psychoanalysis was built."
Antiquities.
"The study is filled with antiquities from ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt and the Orient. There are some fine masks and carving from Africa. Freud visited many archaeological sites (though not Egypt). Most of the collection was got from dealers in Vienna."
"He confessed that his passion for collecting was second only to his addiction to cigars. The importance of the collection can be seen in Freud's use of archaeology as a metaphor for psychoanalysis. One example of this is Freud's explanation to a patient that conscious material 'wears away' while what is unconscious is relatively unchanging: ""I illustrated my remarks by pointing to the antique objects about my room. They were, in fact, I said, only objects found in a tomb, and their burial had been their preservation""."
The collection includes a portrait of Freud by Salvador Dalí.
Emu
"The emu (""Dromaius novaehollandiae"") is a large flightless bird. It is native to Australia. The emu is the tallest bird from Australia. It is also the second tallest bird in the world, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. The emu is also related to the cassowary which is slightly smaller but heavier. It should also be noted, as an odd fact, that the Emus won a war against Australia."
Other emus.
There were four separate groups of emus in 1788 when the European settlers arrived. The emus on the mainland of Australia and those on the island of Tasmania may have been different species.
"There were also two species of dwarf emu, ""Dromaius minor"", one living on King Island in Tasmania and the other on Kangaroo Island. They are examples of island dwarfism. The group on King Island became extinct in 1805, that on Kangaroo Island in 1827, and that in Tasmania in 1865."

Also called eyelid geckos, the eublepharines have more simple features than other geckos. For example, they don't have the ability to climb surfaces. Unlike other geckos, they also have movable eyelids. They are generally active at night or at twilight. These lizards often eat insects and similar creatures. They lay a pair of leathery eggs, and, in most species, the gender of the young is determined by the temperature of the egg; just like crocodiles."
The subfamily contains the following genera:

Truman, who ran Spirit Lake, and volcano expert David A. Johnston."
Property management
"Property management is the process of managing and taking care of property. Property management can be applied to personal, business and public properties. Property management is used in various situations, like building a home, where property manager looks over the process of construction, management of resources and security. The process of property management can be carried using both people (onsite management, security) and machines (cameras, detectors and alarms). An example of property management will be hiring security company. They might be allowed to enter property and check for any issues while the owners are not present. In business, property management is extremely important to achieve safety and improve work environment of employees."
"The kererū (""Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae"") is the only type of pigeon native to New Zealand. It is very big and easy to spot, and its wings make a loud sound when it flies. It is the only still-living New Zealand bird which can eat large fruits whole, and so is important for spreading the seeds of many native trees. Kererū were an important type of food for Māori. There are much fewer kererū now than before the Europeans arrived in New Zealand, mostly because the Europeans brought meat-eating animals like cats, ferrets, stoats, possums, and rats, and cut down a lot of the forest. Because there are not many kererū any more, it is against the law to hunt them."
Name.
"'Kererū' is the most common name for this bird, but in some parts of the North Island it is called ""kūkū"" or ""kūkupa."" Kererū are also called ""wood pigeon"", but they are a different type of bird to the wood pigeon (""Columba palumbus"") of the Northern Hemisphere."
Description.
"Kererū are big and generally weigh between 550 and 850 grams. They have a white underbelly and dark green/blue head, shoulders, and wings. The green/blue colour is iridescent, meaning it is shiny and shows lots of different blues, greens, and purples in the sunlight."
Henotheism
"Henotheism is the adherence to one particular god out of several, especially by a family, tribe, or other group."
"Henotheism is sometimes defined as a monotheistic belief within a polytheistic world - believing that one god, or articulation of God, is better or clearer than others. Alternatively, henotheism is the worship of one god above an acknowledged pantheon. An example of this second form is the worship of a tribal god."
A henotheist would admit that many gods have real existence and are able to be worshipped. However the henotheist chooses to worship only one of these gods. This sets the henotheist apart from the polytheist who worships many gods.

Pygmy peoples
"Pygmy is a word that describes several ethnic groups with unusually short people. According to anthropologists, pygmies can be any group where adult men are less than tall on average. The best known pygmies are the Aka, Efé and Mbuti of central Africa. There are also pygmies in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil. The Negritos of Southeast Asia are also called pygmies."
"The word ""pygmy"" is sometimes thought to be pejorative (an insult). It is, however, the only word that is used to call ""all"" African Midgets."
"The word Bayaka is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local Pygmies. In the Congo Basin, pygmies are called the Kongo word Bambenga."
Name.
"The name ""pygmy"" comes from the Greek word (""pygmaios""). This word was derived from (came from) the word which is the length between a person's elbow and knuckles. The Latin word (pl. ""pygmaei"") came from this older Greek word."
"The word was first used in Greek mythology by the poet Homer. He wrote about a tribe of dwarfs called ""Pygmies"" who lived in India and Ethiopia."
Origins.
"There are a number of theories to explain why pygmies are so short. It has been proved that their height is hereditary, and is passed on from parents to children. It may have evolved because of the low ultraviolet light found in rainforests, where many pygmies live. This would mean that the pygmies would make less vitamin D in their skin. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which is important for bones to grow. Since the pygmies would get less calcium, they would have smaller bones and skeletons."
There are other explanations for why pygmies are so short. Some explanations are:
Some research shows that the genes for the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone are found much less in pygmies than in related tribes. These genes are important for humans to grow tall.
Africa.
"Pygmies can be found in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia. Most of these groups are partly hunter-gatherers. They get food from the environment and trade it with nearby farmers. From the farmers they get crops and tools. There are about 250,000-600,000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest."
"It has ed spikes of reddish-green flowers, which bloom in summer, becoming purplish. The stamens and pistils are on different plants (dioecious); the ripe seeds are brown and shining."
Uses.
"Common sorrel has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves may be puréed in soups and sauces or added to salads and shav; they have a flavour that is similar to kiwifruit or sour wild strawberries. The plant's sharp taste is due to oxalic acid, which is a poison. In small quantities sorrel is harmless; in large quantities it can be fatal."

"is in nearby Natori, Miyagi, south southeast of Sendai Station. The airport was badly damaged by the tsunami, but re-opened for limited service the next month. The US State Department said the airport was safe to visit."
There are several ski resorts and golf clubs in Sendai. The football club Vegalta Sendai has its stadium in the city. Sendai has one university: Tohoku University.
Electron transport chain
"An electron transport chain (ETC) is how a cell gets energy from sunlight in photosynthesis. Electron transport chains also occur in reduction/oxidation (""redox"") reactions, such as the oxidation of sugars in cellular respiration."
"In aerobic respiration, each molecule of glucose leads to about 34 molecules of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) being produced by the electron transport chain. This is by far the most productive part of respiration."
Background.
The electron transport chain consists of a series of redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. The underlying force driving these reactions is the free energy (energy available to do work) of the reactants and products. Any reaction that decreases the overall free energy of a system will happen.
ATP synthase is an enzyme found among all domains of life. It is powered by a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient. This is the result of the series of redox reactions. What the electron transport chain does is produce this gradient. The free energy is used to drive ATP synthesis.
David Carradine
"David Carradine (December 8, 1936 Hollywood, California, U.S. – June 3, 2009, Bangkok, Thailand), was an American actor. He was famous as the lead in a 1970s tv series ""Kung Fu""."
"Carradine had an unstable childhood. This instability continued throughout his life. He married five times. He was frequently arrested and prosecuted for a variety of offenses which often involved substance abuse. He died on June 3, 2009, from erotic asphyxiation."
Television.

Selenography is the study of the physical features of the Moon.
Sorption
"When two chemical substances come in contact with each other, through what is called a phase, they will interact with each other in that phase. They may also have an interface. If a substance accumulates within a phase this is called absorption, if the same process happens on the interface, it is called adsorption. In the year 1909, James William McBain introduced the word Sorption to describe such a process, in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and adsorption."
"Examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment; using sorption it is possible to bind pollutants to small particles in the air (called aerosols), or in the soil (where they bind to colloids). Sorption makes these bindings possible. In much the same way, polluants can be transported over long distances."
Machines and processes that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning.

Fobos-Grunt
"Fobos-Grunt (also spelled Phobos-Grunt, also called Phobos Sample Return Mission) was an unmanned Russian spacecraft. It was an attempted sample return mission to Phobos, a moon of the planet Mars. Scientists intended Phobos-Grunt to orbit and study Mars. It was meant to look at Mars' atmosphere and dust storms, plasma and radiation. Then, Phobos-Grunt should have landed on Phobos and returned a 200 g soil sample to Earth."
"The spacecraft was the first Russian interplanetary mission since Mars 96. It was launched on 8 November 2011 (UTC), aboard a Zenit rocket, at Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was sent with the Chinese spacecraft Yinghuo-1 and with the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment."
"The name ""Phobos-Grunt"" () is Russian for ""Phobos-Soil""."

Materials science
Materials science studies the properties of matter to solve science and engineering problems. It uses applied physics and chemistry. Supersmall nanotechnology has got attention in recent years. There are many inventions of new material. Work on why structures fail or break down is very important to engineering.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Nintoku.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun"") at Sakai. Nintoku is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Irukandji jellyfish
"The Irukandji Jellyfish, ""Carukia barnesi"", is a species of jellyfish. It lives in the waters of northern Australia. It is a very deadly jellyfish. The Irukandji is only 2.5 centimeters (with bell and tentacles) in diameter. This makes it hard to find. The Irukandji is believed to be the most poisonous creature in the world. Some people are not sure if that is true."
"The Irukandjis' name comes from an Australian Aboriginal tribe. The tribe lived in the Palm Cove region of North Queensland. When the Irukandji people were stung by the Irukandji, there are many symptoms. This includes:"
"Sometimes, people may also get fluid on their lungs (pulmonary oedema), hypertension, and heart failure."
"The Irukandji has killed at least two swimmers in Australia. In 2002, Richard Jordon came to Australia as a tourist. He was a 58 year old British man. He was stung while swimming off Hamilton Island. Jordon died a few days later. There may have been more deaths which doctors did not know were caused by the jellyfish."
"The Irukandji is related to another jellyfish. This is the box jellyfish, ""Chironex Fleckeri"". Irukandji was identified in 1964 by a Cairns doctor, Jack Barnes. Because of this, its scientific name is named after him. When people were getting hurt in the sea, Barnes was sure it was because of a jellyfish. He put on diving equipment and lay on the sea floor for six days until he discovered it. When Barnes discovered the Irukandji jellyfish, he tested its sting on himself, his son, and a lifeguard. They all had to be taken to the hospital."
"Irukandji has stingers – not only on its tentacles, but also on its bell. It is very small and weak. Because of this, sudden force may kill it. So, it cannot be kept in a normal aquarium. The first Irukandji jellyfish in captivity was born in Townsville, Queensland."
Emperor Yūryaku
"was the 21st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Yūryaku to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Yūryaku""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to the ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihonshoki"", Yūryaku was the fifth and youngest son of Emperor Ingyō."
He was the brother of Emperor Ankō.
"Yūryaku was followed on the throne by his son, who would come to be known as Emperor Seinei."
Events of Yūryaku's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Yūryaku's life and rule. Only limited facts can be studied before the rule of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"After Ankō's death, Yūryaku overcame others in the struggle for power. He became the new emperor."
Yūryaku is known as a patron of silk. It is said that he encouraged growing mulberry bushes for silkworms to eat.
"Poems that are said to be Yūryaku's are included in the ""Manyōshū"". A number of his verses are kept in the ""Kojiki"" and the ""Nihonshoki."""
He is credited with bringing many artisans from Korea to Japan.
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Yūryaku.

La Niña
La Niña is a coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon that is counterpart to El Niño. The
"name means ""little girl"" in Spanish. La Niñas are often, though not always, preceded by an El Niño phenomenon. Weather patterns in the United States are usually different than during El Niño years. During La Niñas the Atlantic hurricane season produces more intense storms than normal."
Recent history.
"A strong La Niña hit in 1988-1989. A weaker one took place during 1995. An extended strong La Niña spell took place from 1998 to 2000, followed by neutral periods between 2000 and 2002. A more recent La Niña happened in 2007-2008, followed by neutral conditions in 2008-2009."
Central Committee
"In political parties, the Central Committee (also called Steering Committee or National Committee) is a group of party members that make all decisions for the party."
"The Committee is usually led by a Chairman. The Committee usually elects it's Chairman to represent it, and also elects other important members of the party."
"In one-party dictatorships, the Central Committee is all-powerful and leads the country. In the Soviet Union, for example, Joseph Stalin, used his power as General Secretary to have complete control over the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee and was able to become more powerful than the Committee itself."
This Tuesday in Texas
"This Tuesday in Texas was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was held on December 3, 1991 at Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. There were five professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the card. The main event was a rematch involving Hulk Hogan and the Undertaker. Lukewarm reaction made the experiment a failure."

He was born on June 22, 1963 in Surrey, British Columbia and died on June 7, 2006 in Sanford, Florida from bladder cancer."
"Tenta was shown in the video games, WWF WrestleFest in 1991, WWF Super WrestleMania in 1992, King of Colosseum II in 2004 and as DLC character in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 in 2009."
Championships.
Tenta held many championships during his professional wrestling career:
Arthur Griffith
"Arthur Griffith (; 31 March 1872 – 12 August 1922) was the founder of Sinn Fein, which became the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. Griffith said the Act of Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1800 was illegal and that there should therefore be one government for Great Britain and another for Ireland. The King of Great Britain would also be King of Ireland."
"Elected to the parliament in 1918, he was also responsible for the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) which helped set up the Irish Free State."

Her body was discovered from a water tank at the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles on February 19, 2013. She had been reported missing at the beginning of the month."
Maintenance workers at the hotel discovered the body when investigating guest complaints of problems with the water supply.
"The circumstances of Lam's death, once she was found, also raised questions, especially in light of the Cecil's history in relation to other notable deaths and murders. Her body was naked with most of her clothes and personal effects floating in the water near her."
The autopsy showed that her death was by accident.
Boy in the Box (Philadelphia)
"The ""Boy in the Box"" is the name given to an unknown murder victim, 3 to 7 years old, whose naked, abused body was found in a cardboard box in the Fox Chase section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 25, 1957. He is also commonly known as ""America's Unknown Child."" His identity has never been discovered, and the case remains open."

"The Keddie Murders an unsolved American murder of 4 people that happened in Keddie, California. The murders took place in Cabin 28 of the Keddie Resort during the late evening of April 11, 1981, or early the following morning."
"The victims were Glenna Sue Sharp (née Davis), known as Sue (age 36), her son John (age 15), and his friend, Dana Wingate (age 17)."
"At some time after the crime was discovered, Sue's daughter, Tina (age 12), was reported missing. Her skull and several other bones were recovered in 1984 in Camp Eighteen, California, which is in Butte County."
"The case still remains unsolved. In 2004, Cabin 28 was demolished."
Ken McElroy
"Ken Rex McElroy (June 1, 1934 – July 10, 1981) was an American non-convicted murderer from Skidmore, Missouri. He was known as ""the town bully"". His unsolved killing became the focus of international attention."
"McElroy was accused of dozens of felonies, including assault, child molestation, statutory rape, arson, hog and cattle rustling, and burglary."
"He was indicted 21 times but escaped conviction each time, except for the last. In 1981, McElroy was convicted of shooting and seriously injuring the town's 70-year-old grocer, Ernest ""Bo"" Bowenkamp."
"On July 10, 1981, McElroy was shot to death in broad daylight as he sat with his wife Trena in his pickup truck on Skidmore's main street. He was struck by bullets from at least two different firearms, in front of a crowd of people estimated as between 30 and 46. To date, no one has been charged in connection with McElroy's death."
Murder of Brian Wells
"Brian Douglas Wells (November 15, 1956 – August 28, 2003) was an American man who died after a homemade neck-bomb exploded while being involved in a plot involving a bank robbery in Erie, Pennsylvania. Before his death, Wells was a pizza delivery man who, shortly before his death, made a delivery stop outside of Erie."
"Investigated by a task force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it was described as ""one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI"". The Wells story was the subject of significant attention in the mass media. The question of whether Wells was a victim or a mastermind behind the robbery plot is debated."
"Something untrue is false. A half truth is something true mixed with something false, or something partly true with key information omitted."
"If the things one says are true, then they are speaking the truth, or speaking truly. Saying something that is untrue can be called a lie, if the person who is saying it knows it is untrue. A person who says something untrue is often called a ""liar""."
True and false in logic and philosophy.
"""True"" is also one of the two basic values of logic. The other such value is usually called ""false"". In symbols, ""true"" is written as, T or 1."
Aristotle was the first to put logic into a formal framework. His version is called propositional logic (see also syllogism and deductive reasoning). Other forms of logic use types of mathematics (mathematical logic) or symbols. Boolean algebra is about things being true and false.
The relationship between verbal claims and external reality is handled by epistemology and the philosophy of science.
Philosophers argue over what makes up truth and how to define and identify truth.
Zimbabwe
The Republic of Zimbabwe is a country in the southern part of the continent of Africa. Its capital city is Harare.
Geography.
"Zimbabwe is surrounded by other countries, and so it has no coast on the sea. This type of country is called ""landlocked"". The countries that surround Zimbabwe are Zambia, Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique."
"Zimbabwe is home to the famous waterfall, Victoria Falls, which are a feature of the river Zambezi and also the Great Zimbabwe, the ancient architectural monument from which the country was named after."
Vegetation (Fauna and Flora).
"The country is mostly savanna. In the east it is moist and mountainous with tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees include teak and mahogany, knobthorn, msasa and baobab. Among the many flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya."
"There are around 350 species of mammals in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species."
History.
"The area that is now Zimbabwe was added to the British Empire around 1890. Zimbabwe is also known by its old name of Rhodesia. In 1965, it became an independent country when Prime Minister Ian Smith announced the Unilateral Declaration of Independence(U.D.I). The government was mostly controlled by the white population, similar to South Africa at the time. African citizens were given full equality in 1980, and the country's name was officially changed to Zimbabwe. Robert Mugabe led the country as the Prime Minister and President for 37 years. Though Mugabe was elected fairly at first, he became a dictator, and had put in place a number of cruel and disastrous laws. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned as President of Zimbabwe."
Language.
"The country Zimbabwe has a mixture of languages; Shona, Ndebele, Venda, Manyika, Nyanja, Chagani, and a unique-unified Zimbabwean English."
Economy.
"Zimbabwe uses the currencies of several other countries. The government uses the United States dollar. The economy is currently in a bad situation. Foreign currency reserves are at very low levels, and the Zimbabwean Dollar has become very devalued. Just recently, three zeroes were taken off the Zimbabwean dollar (for example, $1,000,000 (one million dollars) would become $1000 (one thousand dollars)). Many observers link this to Mugabe's controversial Land Reform programme."
2017 coup d'état.
"On November 15, 2017, President Robert Mugabe was placed under house arrest as Zimbabwe's military took control in a coup. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned the Presidency."
Provinces.
Zimbabwe is divided into 8 provinces and 2 cities that are the same as a province.
Cities.
The largest cities are:
Sports.
Football is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe. Rugby union and cricket are also popular. Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals.
Zimbabwe has also done well in the Commonwealth Games and All-Africa Games. Kirsty Coventry won 11 gold medals in swimming.
"Zimbabwe has also been at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. Other sports played in Zimbabwe are basketball, volleyball, netball, and water polo, as well as squash, motorsport, martial arts, chess, cycling, polocrosse, kayaking and horse racing. Most of these sports don't have international representatives but instead stay at a junior or national level."
"After ""Excitable Boy"" Warren Zevon published ""Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School"" in 1980. This album had the only other song recorded by Zevon that reached the Billboard Top 100: ""A Certain Girl."" ""A Certain Girl"" is a rhythm and blues song written by Allen Toussaint."
"This album was dedicated to Ken Millar, who calls himself ""Ross Macdonald."" Millar is a writer who writes mystery novels, and Zevon really liked Millar's stories. He met Millar in an intervention put together by the journalist Paul Nelson. For awhile this intervention helped Zevon not drink too much alcohol."
"Cancer, death and ""The Wind""."
"Warren Zevon did not like to go to the doctor, and never went to one when he was an adult. Before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and started to have a chronic cough. When Zevon told his dentist his problems, his dentist recommended seeing a doctor. When he finally visited one, the doctor diagnosed him with mesothelmia."
"Warren Zevon did not want to get treated for his cancer if it might keep him from making music. So instead he started to make his final album, titled ""The Wind"". He had a lot of friends who helped him make the album. These friends included Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others."
Papa John's Pizza
"Papa John's is the third largest pizza company based in the United States. Its headquarters are in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. It was founded by John Schnatter in 1984."
Shrew opossum
"The order Paucituberculata contains the six surviving species of shrew opossum. ""Caenolestes"" is the main genus, and the group as a whole may be called 'caenolestids'."
"They are small, shrew-like marsupials of the Andes mountains of South America."
"20 million years ago, there were at least seven genera in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the high Andes."
"Insectivores were absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are present now only in the northwestern part of the continent. Shrew opossums have lost ground to the these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Nevertheless, the ranges of shrew opossums and insectivores overlap broadly."
"Shrew opossums are about the size of a small rat (9–14 cm long), with thin limbs, a long, pointed snout and a slender, hairy tail. They are largely carnivorous, being active hunters of insects, earthworms and small vertebrates. They have small eyes and poor sight, and hunt in the early evening and at night, using their hearing and long, sensitive whiskers to locate prey. They seem to spend much of their lives in underground burrows and on surface runways."
"Largely because of their rugged, inaccessible habitat, they are very poorly known. Recent studies suggest that they may be more common than had been thought."
Australidelphia
The Australidelphia is a superorder of Australasian marsupial mammals.
"It consists in five extant (living) orders, which contain most of the world's marsupials."
ÖFB Ladies Cup
"The ÖFB Ladies Cup is the Cup competition in Austrian women soccer. It was first played in the 1972/73 season under the guidance of the Vienna Football association as Ladies Cup. Since the 1992/93 season the Ladies cup is under the guidance of the ÖFB (Austrian Football Association) and is called ÖFB-Ladies-Cup. From 2004 till 2009 the competition was called ÖFB-Stiegl-Ladies-Cup, after the main sponsor of the cup, a brewery from Salzburg."
The Cup is played with 32 teams in five rounds. The ten members of the ÖFB-Frauenliga and 22 teams from the nine federal states take part. In the first round the teams were drawn after local aspects.
Lepidodendron
"Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive (tree-like) plant. They were the first large land plants, and a major part of the coal forest tropical flora."
"They were huge, over , and the trunks were often over in diameter."
"Sometimes called 'giant club mosses', they are actually closer to the quillworts ""Isoetes"" than to clubmosses."
Ecology.
They thrived during the Pennsylvanian sub-period of the Carboniferous 315–300 million years years ago.
The conditions were tropical swamps and rain forests of a huge river system much larger that the Amazon basin.
"Disgust is an emotion. People feel it when they see, touch, hear, or taste something that they think is nasty or repulsive. It is also caused by scorn. For example, when one finds something dirty or not fit to eat. Levels of disgust vary based on cultural, religious, and personal backgrounds/experiences. Disgust can be deliberate as someone can do something on purpose to create this emotion."
Oven
"Ovens are closed, heated containers which are used for heating, baking, and drying. It is used the most often in cooking and pottery. They provide even, dry heat to all surfaces of food inside them. An indoor oven can have an electric heating element, or be fired by natural gas or coal. Outdoor ovens are often made of brick or clay and are buried in hot coals. An oven which is used for making pottery is called a kiln. An oven used for heating or industrial processes is called a furnace. They are hot inside, and often things come out of them hot."
History.
The people in the settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization were the first to have an oven inside of their mud-brick houses by 3200 B.C.
People who study the history of food give credit to the Greeks for making the baking of bread into an art. A type of oven called Front-loaded bread ovens were created in ancient Greece.
Pot
"A cooking pot is a vessel to cook in. It is often larger than a pan, and will be taller than it is wide."
"Pots are used for boiling liquids, like soups or stew."
Liquid
"A liquid is a form of matter. It is settled between solid and gas. Liquid has an almost-fixed volume, but no set shape."
"Every small force makes a liquid change its shape by flowing. Because of that, gravity makes liquids always take the shape of the container. The molecules that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves."
Fluids that flow slowly have a high viscosity. Some fluids like tar have such a high viscosity that they may seem solid.
"It is difficult to compress a liquid. If a liquid is cooled down until it is colder than a certain temperature, it will become a solid. This temperature is called the melting point or freezing point and is different for every different type of liquid. If a liquid is heated up it becomes a gas. The temperature this happens at is called the boiling point."
"Examples of liquid are water, oils and blood."
"In a liquid, the liquid on the top presses down on the liquid underneath, so at the bottom the pressure, ""p"", is bigger than at the top. The equation for working this out is:"
"where ""z"" is the depth of the point below the surface and ""g"" is how strong gravity is pulling on the liquid. ""ρ"" is a number that tells us how heavy a set amount of the liquid is. We call this the density and it is different for all liquids."

White
"White is the brightest color. White light can be made by putting all the other colors of light on the spectrum together. These other colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet."
Meaning of white.
"White is linked with light, goodness, innocence, purity, cleanliness and virginity. It is sometimes thought to be the color of perfection. The opposite of black, white usually has a positive connotation. White can stand for a successful beginning. In heraldry, white depicts faith and purity."
"In advertising, white is linked with coolness and cleanliness because it is the color of snow. You can use white to show simplicity in high-tech products.

Causinae
"The Causinae, commonly known as the ""night adders"", are a subfamily of venomous vipers found in sub-Saharan Africa. The family is monotypic, since it only has the genus ""Causus"". There are six species."
"The night adders can grow to around 60 to 90 centimeters (24 to 36 in) long. They are usually dark gray, light gray, light brown, or black in color with gray or black blotches."
"Even though they are called the night adders, they are usually active at day, but some are active at night. When they are attacked or disturbed, they usually coil up and start hissing at their enemy to scare it off. Some may raise their head and neck off the ground, and with their tongue sticking out, move froward like a the Cobra does."
"They eat mainly toads and frogs, but there are reports of some night adders eating almost everything they can find until they are completely unable to swallow any more food."
Reproduction.

Cluster (computing)
"In computing, a cluster is made of many individual computers that work together to solve a problem at hand. Clusters can have different forms: They can be whole computers working together, or only CPUs. These CPUs can communicate over a fast network, but they share the same hard disks, for example. Depending on the problem, solving it with a cluster of cheaper components can be less expensive that investing in better hardware that costs more."
Grid computing is different in that the individual computers work on separate tasks that are part of a large problem. They are usually more different from one another and geographically further apart than cluster computers are.

"In 1937, Hartnagel met Sophie Scholl at a dance event. Under Scholl's influence and after experiences on the front (including in the Battle of Stalingrad), Hartnagel changed from an enthusiastic soldier to an opponent of war and Nazi dictatorship. He supported the resistance activities with news about the course of the war and war crimes and with amounts of money (including 1000 Reichsmarks) although he never officially joined any reistance movements."
"After the execution of Hans and Sophie on the 22nd February 1943 Hartnagel assisted the Scholl family. After the remaining Scholl family members were put into Sippenhaft (clan arrest), Hartnagel appealed for clemency for the Scholl family. After they were released, he supported them financially."

Atlanta Compromise
"The Atlanta Compromise was an informal agreement, between the black people of the cotton-producing states of the United States, and the government of these states. It came after a speech by Booker T. Washington, given in 1895. The compromise is the following: The black people would tolerate means of racial segregation, most notably the Jim Crow laws. In exchange the white government of these states would allow them to get some basic education for free; this education was focused on technical jobs or basic training in jobs the industry needed. This would also improve the living conditions of the black peaople. Black people would no longer focus on fighting for egality, integration into society or justice. White people would finance educational institutions for black people, such as Tuskegee University. Even though people agreed on these points, their agreement was never written down."
"Shortly afterwards, arounf 1900, African-American leaders, such as W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter, said that black people should instead focus on the stuggle for civil rights. It was Du Bois who coined the term to Atlanta Compromiise to refer to the speech by Brooker T. Washington."

History.
"The majority of their ancestors, the Jōmon people, arrived in Japan about 30,000 – 15,000 years ago from Central Asia and southern Siberia. They were largely replaced by the proto-Japanese which arrived from southeastern China about 2,000 years ago. The Ainu have strong similarities with Palaeolithic Europeans and people of the Middle East as well as with Native American groups of the northwestern coastal culture area in North America. Some scholars think they were related to the Emishi of northern Honshu."
"During and after the Yayoi period they were attacked by the early Japanese people. The Ainu and relative tribes lost most of their land in Honshū, many were killed or ensalved by the Yayoi-Japanese. After the rise of the Yamato, few Ainu were left in Honshu. After the Meiji restoration in the late 1800s, the Japanese began to colonize Hokkaido, sending their own people to live there. They forced the Ainu to leave the warm coast of Hokkaido and try to live in the mountains in the middle of the island. The Ainu were not allowed to fish for salmon or hunt deer. The Ainu were required to speak Japanese and use Japanese names. Japanese scientists and treasure hunters would dig up Ainu graves and steal the bodies and artifacts."
"The Ainu in Russia had more luck and lived their traditional life until the Second World War, when they were forced to act like other Russians."
"In April 2019, the Ainu became recognized as native population of northern Japan, and the rest of Japan has started to think of their culture as good and valuable. However, the Ainu still face discrimination in Japan. Most Japanese outside of Hokkaido mistake the Ainu for foreigners or tourists."
Culture.
"Their culture is based on the ancient Jomon culture of northern Japan and eastern Russia. Their native folk religion has some similarities to early Shinto. Their gods are named ""kamuy"", similar to the Japanese ""Kami"". They practiced agriculture but were also hunter gatherers. The Ainu are famous for their wood work and art."

Abdominal compartment syndrome
"Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity (compartment) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within. This may be caused by internal bleeding, a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines, or 'ascites' which is when fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and the abdominal organs (the stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder)."
"This increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand, stretching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs, which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them. When the pressure reaches a level above that of the blood supply to the tissues and organs of the abdomen, ischemia will happen leading to organ dysfunction and eventually failure."
"An operation called a decompressive laparotomy may need to be performed, where an incision is made to open the abdominal cavity. The incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the pressure in the abdomen."
Abdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories:

Child labour
"Child labour means that children are forced to work like adults and take part in an economic activity. According to the ILO International Labour Organization the term is applied to people up to age thirteen, or seventeen in case of dangerous work. Only about a fourth of the ILO members have ratified the respective convention, but the age limits are generally accepted."
"When children work like adults, this will deprive them of their childhood: Very often, they cannot attend regular school either. This kind of work is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful."
"Child labour is fundamentally different from casual work done by children, like guarding other children, or helping here and there. Child labour is forbidden in most countries. In some places minor boys and girls work in tea stalls, restaurants, hotels and other small shops. Some work in huge factories like brick factories. The main reason why child labour occurs is poverty."
There are two kinds of work that minors can do:
"In general the second kind of work is usually labelled child labour. Estimates are that up to 350 million children are affected by child labour. Eight million of these are affected by the worst forms of child labour: they are child soldiers, they are forced into child prostitution, they are used for child pornography, they are child slaves, debt bondage or affected by human trafficking."
"Often such cases are known through scandals in the mass media. In that manner, a working child is often seen as a slave, working in a Sweet shop in a third world country, producing textiles, or as one of the street children in South America. The reality is different though: Such shops exist all over the world, also in countries like the United States or Italy. The fact that child labour is involved is often hidden: More than three quarters of this work is done in the sector of agriculture, or it has to do with activities done at home, in the context of the family. If child-slaves exist, they are only a minority. This form of work done by children also existed before industrialisation and globalisation, the two phenomena have made it more visible."
Cash crop
"A cash crop is a crop that is grown to be sold on the market. This is different from a subsistence crop which is grown for the personal use of the farmer, or as food for the farmer's animals."
"There are several different categories of cash crops, for different purposes."
Foods.
"Food crops are grown to be eaten by humans or animals. Since modern agriculture(farming) methods allow farmers to grow much more food than they need to feed themselves and their families, the extra is sold to others."
Some food crops include:
Spices and Herbs.
"Spices and herbs are ingredients added to food in order to make it taste less bland. Spices/herbs do not make up much of a meal but are very flavorful. Since spices/herbs are used in small amounts but can be grown in much larger quantities, the surplus grown is sold as a cash crop."
Some spices/herbs include:
Materials.
"Material crops are plants which have parts that can be used as raw materials to create objects with. Material crops are not eaten, but sold to the market for usage for various purposes."
Some material crops include:
Medicinal/Drug.

"In some countries, such as New Zealand and Singapore, professional traders and those who trade frequently are taxed on such profits as a business income."
Women in the history of Manipur kingdom
"Manipuri women have been known for their valor, skill and active involvement in social, economic, political and cultural activities, besides holding almost all the household responsibilities as a mother, wife, daughter, sister and daughter in law."
"Thomas Callan Hodson, the then British Political Agent of 1908 Manipur, quoted in his monograph, The Meitheis, as follows:"
&lt;poem&gt;
"""The women hold a high and free position in Manipur, all the integral trade and exchange of the produce of the country being managed by them. The habit of the country is to have bazars (markets) at convenient spots by the road side, where a handful of women congregate at the early hour...!"""

"Kuranganayani, originally known as Shija Phongalokpi, is the biological daughter of King Gaurishyam and the adoptive daughter of King Bhagyachandra. She was offered hand in marriage to the Ahom king to strengthen the relationship between the two kingdoms as well as to get military aid from the Ahoms for the Meiteis to resist the Burmese conquest of Manipur. But she turned out to be a heroine even in the Ahom kingdom. It was she who saved the Ahom kingdom from the hands of the Moamoriya revolts."
Yairipok Thambalnu.
"Thambalnu was a lady from a poor family in Yairipok town of Manipur. But her beauty and charm causes conflicts among many able men in the kingdom in her times. During flood times from the Imphal river in the kingdom, the Royal Oracle proclaimed that the water god Wangbren will be pleased if a young girl is offered to Him. Since Thambalnu became a problem for numerous men, she was chosen to be offered to the deity. So, she was forcibly (or voluntarily) put in sacrifice to the strong river flow. After her death, the flood was also gone."
Maharani Kumudini.
"Queen Kumudini was widowed when her son was at a ripe age. She devised many diplomatic relations and plots to protect the throne from the other family members of the royalty. When her son, Chandrakirti became the king, she was known as a popular feminine icon in the kingdom."
"Waitangi, Northland"
"Waitangi ( or , ) is a locality in the Bay of Islands on the North Island of New Zealand. It is close to the town of Paihia, 60 kilometres north of Whangarei. ""Waitangi"" is a Māori-language name meaning ""weeping waters""."
Waitangi Day
"Waitangi Day (), the national day of New Zealand, celebrates the anniversary of the initial signing – on 6 February 1840 – of the Treaty of Waitangi, which is seen as the founding document of the nation. The first Waitangi Day was not celebrated until 1934, and it was made a national public holiday in 1974."
"There are many reasons why alcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Some of these reasons include religion, culture, laws, and people's attitudes about drinking. For example, on average, people in Northern Africa, the Middle East, and islands in the Indian Ocean drink less than people anywhere else in the world.p.4 These are areas where many people are Muslims. Many Muslims in these areas do not drink any alcohol, because the Koran says not to.p.4 In some of these countries, drinking alcohol is illegal."
"However, in other areas, like Western Europe, alcohol is a part of daily life. It is legal and easy to get. People very commonly drink alcohol with meals. Very few people drink no alcohol. People's attitudes about alcohol are very different than attitudes in mostly Muslim countries. This is an example of how differences in religion, culture, laws, and attitudes about drinking can affect the amount of alcohol use and alcoholism in different areas."
Men and women.
"Alcoholism is more common in men than in women. However, in the past few decades, the number of female alcoholics has increased."
"Female alcoholics are most common in the Americas and Europe. In the United States and Western Europe, five to ten percent of women will become alcoholics at some point in their lives."
"In the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific areas, less than 1% of women are alcoholics. In Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean area, almost no women are alcoholics.p.21"
Young people.
"In many countries, young people are using more and more alcohol. In a 2008 WHO survey, underage drinking had increased in 71% of countries. Drinking by young adults (ages 18-25) had increased in 80% of countries.p.10"
Treatment options.
Alcoholism can be treated. There are many forms of treatment for alcoholism.
Detoxification.
"Detoxification (detox) is often the first step in treating alcoholism. ""Detoxification"" means ""getting toxins out of the body."" Alcohol detoxification means that the alcoholic stops drinking, so that alcohol (a toxin) can get out of their body. The alcoholic also needs to give their body time to recover from not having alcohol any more."
"It is not safe for an alcoholic to suddenly stop drinking on their own. The safest way to stop drinking is to go to a hospital that specializes in alcohol detoxification. These hospitals are often called ""detoxes"" or ""rehabs."" These places can make sure that an alcoholic has a safe detox. They can also give medications to make the alcoholic more comfortable, and to prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The most common medications that doctors give during alcohol detox are benzodiazepines.p.35"
"Once a person stops drinking alcohol, they are called ""sober"". Most people need other treatments to help them stay sober."
"Detox can be an intense process, and some people experience very strong emotions during it. This is complicated by the fact that, in the past, they may have used drugs or alcohol to help them handle strong emotions. In detox, the therapist helps them manage their emotions."
Therapy.
"Psychotherapy and group therapy can help alcoholics stay sober. For example, they can help alcoholics learn how to:"
Medications.
Some medications can help alcoholics stay sober. These medications include:pp.130-144
Vitamins.
"Many alcoholics do not have enough vitamins in their body. This can cause serious problems. For example, if an alcoholic does not have enough thiamine, they can get brain damage. Often, alcoholics are treated with thiamine to prevent brain damage. They may also be given other vitamins if needed.p.144"
Groups for alcoholics.
"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the biggest support and mutual aid group for alcoholics in the world. This means that in AA groups, alcoholics come together to support each other and help each other recover. AA uses a twelve-step program. This program is meant to help alcoholics fix the problems their alcoholism has caused."
"There are also other groups for alcoholics, like:"

Sprain
"A sprain is a type of injury in which a person hurts the part really bad, but it is not broken. It has common side affects of a broken bone, but it is less serious."
Degrees.
The first degree is only a minor tear or stretch of a ligament.
"In short, moksha symbolizes something which is beyond comprehension; too great and too wondrous to be truly understood, it can only be felt when one attains it. The world is truly a beautiful place, but the greatness that lies within is even more so, since the power of the greatness is completely unknown."
"After all, isn't that what beauty is; appreciation of the unknown!"
For a more comprehensive explanation of this topic read the books:
Moksha is the ultimate goal of a person to get liberated from the cycle of birth and death
Caste
"The caste system is a system in India that was once mainly used by Hindus. This system has been generally accepted for about 3000 years. There are four castes in this system, and one outcast group regarded as ""untouchables"". There are also castes in countries other than India as the system spread to South Asia about 2000 years ago. For centuries, this system has dictated one's marriages, geographical location, and occupation. People must not marry someone from another caste, and they must not do things that another caste does. The Indian government today works to decrease this discrimination with the quotas set in government jobs in 1950."
Brahmin
Brahmin is one of the part of four varnas in Hinduism. Brahmins are the highest and most respected among people. In ancient India people who read the complete Upanishad Brahmanak were called Brahmins
Caste system.
"The caste system classified people by jobs. The people in this caste were mostly priests and dramatists in the Aryan society. The Brahmins arranged prayers and rituals. Parashurama was one of the well known Brahmin by birth, but throughout his life, he was a warrior whose job was to protect Dharma. Parshurama is also Creator Father of Bhumihar Brahman and Bhumihar Thakur, Bhumihar's are also known as Parashurama Brahman &amp; Bramhkshatriya. Most Brahmins practice vegetarianism. An old tradition is that Brahmin Men pulled there foreskin back since childhood, with an Glansring, because of became clean in this part"
"There are many subgroups in Brahmins based on demography. Rishiswar, Sanadhya, Kanyakubj, Telang, Saryupareen, Bhumihar, Goswami, Tyagi, and Saraswati are the main streams of Brahmin. Across the subcontinent, other Brahmins are also believed to have switched from the traditional duties of Brahmins in favor of military and administrative ones. In other parts of the subcontinent, outside of Punjab and the Gandhara region, they have been known as the Tyagi Brahman and ""brahma-kshatriya"" groups. These groups also claim to have descended from the Parshuram Tyagi Brahmans of Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh; traditionally, they have a close relationship and brotherhood with Mohyals."
"Some Mohyal Brahmins migrated eastward and became as some sub-divisions of Bhumihar Brahmins, some of whom are also descendants of Hussaini Brahmins and mourn the death of Imam Hussain.[7] Bhumihar Brahmins and Tyagi/ Mohyal Brahmins have an affinity and brotherhood for each other. The  Bhumihar Brahmins, of whom many, though not all, belong to the Saryupareen Brahmin division of Kanyakubja Brahmins.In Kerala Ezhavathy is also a Mohyal community.[8]"
The Brahmins of Vedic Period.
"The Brahmanas of the Vedic period were regarded as the most knowledgeable people and the best of best in all arts. Therefore, not all Hindus worship other Gods."
The sub-groups.
"In Tamil Nadu, The Iyers and Iyengars are well known Brahmin communities. Iyers are mostly worshippers of Shiva and the Iyengars are Vaishnavites."
DNA.
"The majority of the Males in Brahmin caste belong to of Y-DNA R1a1* Haplogrup, interestingly the same Haplogroup can be found view in the Roma people too"
Kshatriya
"Kshatriya is a division of the caste system in Hinduism. A ""kshatriya"" is a warrior, ruler, politician, or administrative worker."
There are 3 lineages of Kshatriyas:-
"However, there is one more lineage (not mentioned in any Puranas) - Nagavanshi (snake-born), who claims descent from the Nagas."
Vaishya
"Vaishya is a division of the caste system. A vaishya is a trader, merchant or artisan."
Shudra
Shudra is a division of the caste system. A shudra is considered a servant or peasant. Shudra and Ati-shudra indicates the bottom most ranks in the Indian caste system.
"Mahatma Jyotirao Phule set out the history of shudra-ati-shudra communities in his book ""Gulamgiri."" He drew the attention to the exploitation of Shudras, Ati-shudras, and women etc. At this time, most prefer not even to touch such castes."
"The night adders have very big venom glands, which are around 10 centimeters long. But even though the venom glands are big, the adders don't always use their venom on their prey. The venom would kill the prey fast enough, but they usually seize their prey and swallow it."
"When someone is bitten by a night adder, the venom does not spread around the body, and only causes swelling in the place of the bite. There have been no reports of deaths by night adder venom."
Common night adder
The common night adder is a species of venomous vipers found in sub-Saharan Africa.
Description.
"The common night adder can grow up to around 60 centimeters (24 in) long, making it the longest species of the genus ""Causus"". The longest ever recorded was a male found in eastern Zimbabwe which was 93 centimeters (around 37 in) long. They are usually olive green, brown, or grayish-brown in color with black rhombic-shaped blotches, but not all have blotches on them."
Common names.
"The common night adder is also called the ""rhombic night adder"", the ""demon night adder"", the ""Cape Viper"", and the ""African night adder""."
Where they live.
"The common night adder is found in the savannas of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Nigeria, east to Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, south to Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, northern Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland, and eastern South Africa."
Behavior.
"The common night adder is a fairly fast species of snake; it can move at the speed of 3.3 km per hour. They are usually found on the ground, but they can climb trees and can swim. They are mainly nocturnal, but some have been seen basking in the early morning or late afternoon. When disturbed they coil up, inflate their body (which makes the black blotches on them stand out), and start hissing loudly."
"Common night adders are oviparous, meaning that they lay eggs, while other vipers are usually viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. Females lay around two dozen eggs at a time, which take around four months to hatch. Once hatched, the young are 10 to 12.5 cm long and eat small frogs and toads."
Feeding.
"Their diet is made up of mainly frogs and toads, and sometimes small mammals like mice and rats."
Polystyrene
"Polystyrene is a form of chemical compound that is mainly used for a wide variety of packaging. It is an aromatic polymer made from the monomer styrene, a liquid hydrocarbon that is manufactured from petroleum by the chemical industry. Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics, the scale being several billion kilograms per year."
Polystyrene can be in either a thermoset or a thermoplastic form.
Allometry
"Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape. In particular, it refers to the rate of growth of one part of the body compared to other parts."
"In most cases, the relative size of body parts changes as the body grows. Most allometric relationships are adaptive. For example, organs which depend on their surface area (such as the intestine) grow faster as the body weight increases."
"Also, there are changes in allometry as a clade evolves. Allometry is an important way to describe changes in gross morphology (body shape) during evolution. Changes in time of development in an evolutionary series or clade are very common. The trend is known as heterochrony."
"Allometry was first outlined by Otto Snell in 1892, D'Arcy Thompson in 1917, and Julian Huxley in 1932. The relationship between two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law:"
or in a logarithmic form:
where formula_3 is the scaling exponent of the law.
On being the right size.
"J.B.S. Haldane's 1926 essay ""On being the right size"" gives an overview of the way size interacts with body structure. Haldane's thesis is that sheer size very often defines what bodily equipment an animal must have:"
"Many of his examples are based on the square-cube law. If an animal's length is doubled, its surface area will be squared and its weight cubed. This alone causes allometric changes in any evolutionary lineage where successive species get larger or smaller. There are many such lineages."

The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is the short title of an important book by the 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon. The book traces the Roman Empire—and Western civilization as a whole—from the late first century AD to the fall of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire.
"Published in six volumes, from volume I in 1776 to volumes IV, V, VI in 1788–89. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 AD, and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and its fall in the West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, its methodology became a model for later historians. This led to Gibbon being called the first ""modern historian of ancient Rome""."
Thesis.
Gibbon gave an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell.
"According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions because its citizens gradually lost their ""civic virtue"". They had become weak, using barbarian mercenaries to defend their Empire, who then became so numerous that they were able to take over the Empire."
"Romans, he believed, became unwilling to live the tougher, ""manly"" military lifestyle. In addition, Gibbon argued that Christianity created a belief that a better life existed after death. This fostered an indifference to the present among Roman citizens, and sapped their desire to sacrifice for the Empire. He also believed its pacifism tended to hamper the traditional Roman martial spirit. Finally, like other Enlightenment thinkers, Gibbon held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious, ""dark age"". It was not until his own age of reason and rational thought, so it was believed, that human history could resume its progress."
"Gibbon sees the Praetorian Guard as the main catalyst of the empire's initial decay and eventual collapse, a seed planted by Augustus at the start of the empire. He cites repeated examples of the Praetorian Guard abusing their power with calamitous results, including numerous instances of imperial assassination and incessant demands for increased pay."
Views on Christianity.
"In Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, Gibbon challenged Church history. He estimated far smaller numbers of Christian martyrs than had been previously thought. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. For Gibbon, however, the Church writings were secondary sources. He shunned them in favour of primary sources from the period he was writing about. This is one reason why Gibbon is referred to as the ""first modern historian""."
Gibbon's main theory was that Christianity as a prime factor in the Empire's decline and fall.
"And, more generally:"
"Later historians have mostly not agreed with Gibbon. Today, historians tend to analyze economic and military factors in the decline of Rome."
Editions.
Gibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.
Aminul Islam (poet)
Aminul Islam (born 29 December 1963) is a poet and essayist. He is from Bangladesh. Aminul has written seventeen books. He written thirteen poetry books. He has been involved in creative writing for 20 years.
Aminul Islam (trade unionist)
Aminul Islam (1973 – April 2012) was a Bangladeshi trade unionist (someone who organises trade unions). He was murdered in 2012.
Work.
Islam was a former garment worker and was president of the Ashulia and Savar Bangladesh Garment &amp; Industrial Workers Federation.
"Also he was the leader of Bangladesh Center of Worker Solidarity. It has advocated for improved working conditions and higher wages. In 2010, the organization led protested to push for a larger increase in the minimum wage for garment workers. Islam and other protester were arrested for that."
"Islam had recently been working to organize workers in factories, which belonged to the Shanta Group. The company produces clothing for multiple American companies, like Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, and Ralph Lauren. He had also assisted ABC News, for an interview with the survivors of a recent factory fire in Bangladesh."
British Rail Class 458
"The South West Trains Class 458 (or 4JOP) electrical multiple units were built by Alstom at Washwood Heath between 1998 and 2000. These units are part of Alstom's ""Juniper"" family of units, which also includes Classes 334 and 460."
British Rail Class 460
"The British Rail Class 460 (or 8Gat) electrical multiple units were built by Alstom at Washwood Heath between 1999 and 2001. These units were part of Alstom's ""Juniper"" family of units, which also includes Classes 334 and 458."
All have since been converted to Class 458/5 units (other than four surplus driving vehicles used as spares donors) for operation by South Western Railway.
Domitian
"Domitian (Titus Flavius Domitianus, 24 October 51 – 18 September 96) was a Roman emperor who reigned from 14 September 81 until his death in AD 96."
Biography.
"Domitian was the last emperor of the Flavian dynasty, which ruled the Roman Empire between 69 and 96, This included the reigns of Domitian's father Vespasian (69–79), his elder brother Titus (79–81), and that of Domitian himself."
"When Titus died (he was struck down by a fatal illness in 81), the next day Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. This started a reign which lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who ruled since Tiberius."
"As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage. He expanded the border defenses of the empire, and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome."
"Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Scotland, and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to win a decisive victory against king Decebalus."
"Domitian's rule was totalitarian. He saw himself as the new Augustus, as an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality. By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate."
"Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day, he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant."
"Modern history has rejected these views. Now we see Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful second century."
British Rail Class 465
"The British Rail Class 465 ""Networker"" electric multiple units were built by Metro Cammell and BREL between 1991 and 1993, and by ABB Rail between 1993 and 1994. They were brought into service from 1991 onwards. They are mostly used on suburban routes serving the South East of England, now operated by Southeastern."
Dacian Wars
Dacian Wars can be either of two wars by the Roman Empire along its Danube River against the north bank kingdom of Dacia and the Dacian king Decebalus:
British Rail Class 466
"The Class 466 750V DC third rail electric multiple unit (EMU) is a suburban EMU, which operates with Class 465 EMUs in southeast London and Kent on the Southeastern network. It is a member of the Networker family of trains."
London Underground 1992 Stock
The 1992 Tube Stock is the type of train used on the Central line and Waterloo &amp; City line of the London Underground. The trains were built by BREL (later Adtranz and now Bombardier Transportation). They were built after three 1986 tube stock prototype trains were tested to find out what the public wanted on the new trains.
Carol I of Romania
"Carol I of Romania, original name Prince Karl Eitel Friedrich Zephyrinus Ludwig of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, later simply of Hohenzollern (20 April 1839 - ), German prince, was elected Domnitor (Prince) of Romania on 20 April 1866, following the overthrow of Alexandru Ioan Cuza. He reigned in 1881 in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 . He died in October 1914 during World War 1 just after Austria-Hungary and Germany declared war on Serbia , Russia and France in August 1914"
Supports.
Equity premium puzzle.
"Equity premium puzzle(EPP) refers to the problem of why there is a big difference between returns in stocks and risk-free investments historically. Since stocks are much riskier than government bonds, the underinvestment in stocks relative to bonds supports the idea of loss aversion theory. Specifically, it's the myopic loss aversion introduced by Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler, which indicates the behavioural characteristics of ""loss aversion"" and ""frequent evaluations"" of investors. Benartzi and Thaler argue that loss-averse investors are more willing to take risks if they do not evaluate the performance of their investments frequently. In their model, investors are unwilling to accept return variability and tend to take a short-term view of their wealth."
Demand elasticity.
"Demand is more elastic for price increases than price decreases, based on the assumption that the price increase is a loss while the price decrease is a gain for consumers."
Daniel Kahneman's contributions.
Prospect theory.
"Based on the principle of loss aversion, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Twersky developed prospect theory to explain how consumers make decisions in uncertain situations. Unlike the hypothesis of rational man use in economics, prospect theory reveals the irrational psychological factors that affect the choice behaviour. Most people are unwilling to take risks when facing gains but become risk-seeking in losses."
Endowment effect.
"Loss aversion theory explains the endowment effect. The endowment effect refers to the finding that once an individual owns a good, he/she tends to naturally place more value than he did before he didn't own it. Due to the asymmetric responses to losses and gains in the decision-making process, the consideration of ""loss avoidance"" is far greater than that of ""gain seeking,"" so people value more on a good they own."
Real world applications: Marketing Strategy.
"By using the loss aversion theory as a marketing strategy, firms are able to gain higher profits by changing consumers' behaviours. For example:"
RTÉ One
"RTÉ One () is a television channel in Ireland. It is the main TV channel of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). It is the most popular channel in Ireland. It started in 31 December 1961 and was called ""Telefís Éireann"". It was the first TV channel in Ireland. It was called ""RTÉ"" from 1966, and ""RTÉ 1"" from 1978 when RTÉ 2 started. The channel was only in black and white between 1961 and 1968. From 1968, some programmes were broadcast in PAL colour."
"Some of the money for the channel comes from a government television licence, and the rest comes from advertisements. RTÉ channels have fewer advertisements than other channels because of this. RTÉ One can be watched by 98% of people in Ireland in HD on the Saorview digital service. It can also be watched on Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media, and online through RTÉ Player."
Coat of arms of Lesotho
"The Coat of arms of Lesotho was adopted in 2006, after Lesotho's 40th anniversary of independence, replacing the original one used from 1966 to 2006."
Pelton wheel
"The pelton wheel is a kind of water turbine. It is used in power plants, to convert a water flow into a movement of a wheel (and then into energy). Lester Alan Pelton invented it in the 1870s. In a regular wheel for example of a mill, the energy is obtained from the weight of the water. A pelton wheel uses the impulse of the water to generate energy, not its weight. Pelton wheels are used in power plants where there's a big difference in height, but where there is relatively little water. An example might be a dam or barrage in the mountains. One of the drawbacks of a pelton wheel is the relatively hight level of wear: Unlike the Francis turbine, a pelton wheel cannot be used to pump water."
Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics
"The football competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics was the first Olympic football tournament dedicated to under-23 teams. The competition featured 16 men's national sides from the six continental confederations. The 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four and each group played a round-robin tournament. At the end of the group stage, the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage, beginning with the quarter-finals and culminating with the gold medal match at Camp Nou on 8 August 1992."
Qualification.
The following 16 teams qualified for the 1992 Olympic men's football tournament:

"Theriodonts fall into three main groups: Gorgonopsia, Therocephalia and Cynodontia. Early theriodonts may have been warm-blooded. Early forms were carnivorous, but several later groups became herbivorous during the Triassic."
"Theriodont jaws were more mammal-like than was the case of other therapsids, because their dentary (lower jaw) was larger, which gave them more efficient chewing. Several other bones that were previously on the lower jaw, moved into the ears, allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider. This made the theriodonts the most successful group of synapsids."
"Eutheriodonts refer to all theriodonts except the gorgonopsians (the most primitive group). They included the therocephalians, cynodonts and their descendants – the mammals. The name means ""true beast tooth"". The eutheriodonts have larger skulls, accommodating larger brains and improved jaw muscles."
"The theriodonts (eutheriodonts) are one of the two synapsid survivors of the great Permian–Triassic extinction event, the other being the dicynodonts. Therocephalians included both carnivorous and herbivorous forms; both died out after the Lower Triassic."
"The remaining theriodonts, the cynodonts, also included carrnivores such as ""Cynognathus"", as well as newly evolved herbivorous Traversodonts. While Traversodonts for the most part remained medium-sized to reasonably large (length of largest species up to 2 meters), the carnivorous forms became progressively smaller as the Triassic progressed."
"By the Upper Triassic the small cynodonts included the rodent-like tritylodonts (possibly related to or descended from travsersodonts), and the tiny, shrew-like, trithelodonts, which evolved into the first mammals. The trithelodonts died out during the Jurassic, and the tritylodonts survived in the Cretaceous, but the mammals continued to evolve. Many mammal groups managed to survive the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, allowing the mammals to diversify and dominate the Earth."
Laura Ingraham
"Laura Ingraham (born 19 June 1964) is an American conservative political commentator, author and radio host. Her nationally syndicated talk show ""The Laura Ingraham Show"" was broadcast for nine years on the Talk Radio Network. She has been known for her controversial statements against the left wing party."
Peptide bond
"A peptide bond is a special chemical bond that happens between two amino acids. In the reaction (called condensation), the two amino acids are combined into a ""dipeptide""."
Repenomamus
Repenomamus is the largest known mammal from the Cretaceous period. Its fossil was found in Manchuria.
"There is good evidence that it fed on dinosaurs. It is not known whether ""Repenomamus"" was a hunter or a scavenger."
Life style.
"""Repenomamus"" was carnivorous. A specimen of ""R. robustus"" has been discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile ""Psittacosaurus"" preserved in its stomach."
"This is the strongest evidence that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs, though there were earlier indications of this."
"The larger species, ""R. giganticus"", is the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous. ""R. giganticus"" was more than 1 metre (39 inches) long and weighed about 12–14 kg (26–31 lb). Its skull measures 16 cm (6.25 in) long, its body 52 cm (20.5 in), and the preserved part of its tail 36 cm (14 in)."
Discovery.
"The fossils were recovered from the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning Province of China, renowned for its extraordinarily well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs. They have been dated to 130 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous period."
"""Repenomamus"" is a genus of triconodonts, a group of mammaliaformes with no modern relatives."
Frederick William III of Prussia
Frederick William III () (3 August 1770 – 7 June 1840) was king of Prussia from 1797 to 1840.
Life.
"Frederick William was born in Potsdam in 1770 as the son of Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia and Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was considered to be a shy and reserved boy,"
"As a soldier he received the usual training of a Prussian prince, obtained his lieutenancy in 1784, became a colonel in 1790, and took part in the campaigns against France of 1792-1794. On December 24, 1793, Frederick William married Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They had ten children. In the ""Kronprinzenpalais"" (Crown Prince's palace) in Berlin, Frederick William lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became King of Prussia in 1797."
Reign.
He succeeded to the throne on 16 November 1797 and took over personal power without giving responsibility to his ministers. Unfortunately he was not able to follow a consistent course for himself.
His sense of duty can be seen from this quote:
Foods with a lot of vitamin C include the following:
Ion
An ion is an electrically charged atom or group of atoms.
"It can be made from an atom, or from a group of atoms (molecule). It is ""charged"" so it will move near electricity. This is because atoms are made of three smaller parts:"
"An ion has unequal numbers of protons and electrons. Making an ion from an atom or molecule is called ""ionization""."
"The charge on a proton is chosen as +1 (positively charged). The charge on an electron is opposite to the charge on the proton. The charge on the electron is -1 (negatively charged). An atom that is ionized makes two parts, one positive, and one negatively charged. For example, a neutral hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron. Ionizing the atom breaks it into two parts: (1) a positively charged hydrogen ion, H+ (2) a negatively charged electron."
"A liquid with ions is called an electrolyte. A gas with lots of ions is called a plasma. When ions move, it is called electricity. For example, in a wire, the metal ions do not move, but the electrons move as electricity. A positive ion and a negative ion will move together. Two ions of the same charge will move apart. When ions move they also make ""magnetic fields""."
Many ions are colourless. Elements in the main groups in the Periodic Table form colourless ions. Some ions are coloured. The transition metals usually form coloured ions.
Chemistry.
"In physics, atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called charged particles. These are ones in alpha radiation."
Ionization happens by giving atoms high energy. This is done using electrical voltage or by high-energy ionizing radiation or high temperature.
A simple ion is formed from a single atom.
Polyatomic ions are formed from a number of atoms. Polyatomic ions usually consist of all non-metal atoms. But sometimes the polyatomic ion can have a metallic atom too.
"Positive ions are called cations. They are attracted to cathodes (negatively charged electrodes). (""Cation"" is pronounced ""cat eye on"", not ""kay shun"".) All simple metal ions are cations."
"Negative ions are called anions. They are attracted to anodes (positively charged electrodes). All simple non-metal ions (except H+, which is a proton) are anions."
Transition metals can form more than one simple cation with different charges.
"Most ions have a charge of less than 4, but some can have higher charges."
"Michael Faraday was the first person to write a theory about ions, in 1830. In his theory, he said what the portions of molecules were like that moved to anions or cations. Svante August Arrhenius showed how this happened. He wrote this in his doctoral dissertation in 1884 (University of Uppsala). The university did not accept his theory at first (he only just passed his degree). But in 1903, he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the same idea."
"In Greek ""ion"" is like the word ""go"". ""Anion"" and ""cation"" mean ""up-goer"" and ""down-goer"". ""Anode"" and ""cathode"" are ""way up"" and ""way down""."

Cognitive science
"Cognitive science studies how people make their ideas and what makes thoughts logical. It is often seen as the result of several different scientific fields working together. These fields are psychology (a study of the mind), neuroscience (biological study of the brain), computer science (the creation of programs and computers), and linguistics (the study of language). It does not refer to the sum of all these disciplines. It refers to their intersection on specific problems."
Anthropology
Anthropology is the study of human beings in the past and present.
"The word anthropology has two roots: [ anthrop- ] and [ -ology ]. Anthrop- means “about human beings,” and -ology means “a type of science."" Anthropology is a type of science about human beings. A person who studies anthropology is called an anthropologist."
The main goal of anthropology is to answer the questions: What makes us human and why?
"Anthropology is a biological and historical social science that helps us learn how groups of people are the same, and how they are different in all parts of the world. Anthropologists do research in many places and study how people live now and how they may have lived in the past. They research in modern cities, small villages, tribes, and in the countryside."

"Iputhou Pakhangba Laishang () (literally, ""Iputhou Pakhangba Temple"") is an ancient Meitei temple dedicated to God Pakhangba, inside the Kangla Palace in Imphal, Manipur, India."
"After its reconstruction, it was consecrated in 2010."
Atlassian
"Atlassian Corporation is an Australian software development company for the IT industry. It is best known for its JIRA and Confluence bug tracking system. The company is headquartered in Seattle, USA. In total, the company has nine offices in six countries and serves more than 100,000 customers."
History.
"The company name comes from Atlas (), a character from Greek mythology. Until 2017, the company's logo looked like an X-shaped figure supporting the sky. However, in 2017, the logo was changed to a modern one because, according to the designers, ""The previous version of the logo was inspired by Atlas, and an example of legendary service and support."
"Atlassian was founded in 2002 by two students from the University of New South Wales, Mike Cannon-Brooks and Scott Farkuhar. They both left training to work on the project. The start-up capital was only 10 thousand dollars."
"Atlasian released its first product, JIRA (bug tracking and project management system), in 2002, and on April 25, 2004, they released Confluence, a platform for collaboration, dissemination of documentation and knowledge based on wiki technology."
"In 2007, Atlassian released Bamboo, a server for continuous integration and delivery, and acquired Cenqua, another Australian IT company, along with its software products FishEye (version control system), Crucible (code viewer) and Clover (software for Java code testing, in April 2017 Atlassian closed it, and made the code public)."
"In July 2010, Atlassian received a $60 million investment from investment company Accel Partners."
"In 2011, the company's revenue reached $102 million, and in 2014 it was $215 million."
"In 2015, Atlassian made an initial public offering on the NASDAQ and its capitalization was estimated at $4.37 billion."
Two-party system
"There are several states in the world, where politics is dominated by two parties. This is known as two-party system. According to Giovanni Sartori, the following is true for such as system:"
"The Median voter theorem describes such a system: While at first the parties have programmes that are very different from each other, over time, they will get closer. Hotelling's law also describes this in game theory."
"Note that in such systems, there may also be other parties, bur these rarely have enough influence to win majorities in elections."
"Two Examples of countries that have a two party system are the United Kingdom, and the United States."
Median voter theorem
"The median voter theorem is a theorem from political economics: Suppose there are two parties: One is a left-wing party, the other is a right-wing party. Voters either vote for the left-wing party L, or the right-wing party R. In an election, L has an interest to shift its position towards the middle, so that it can get voters from the other party R. Similarly, R has an interest to shift its position towards the middle, so it can get voters from L."
California's 1st congressional district
"California's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California. The district is represented by Republican Doug LaMalfa since 2013.

Maurice Yaméogo
"Maurice Yaméogo (31 December 1921 – 15 September 1993) was the first President of the Republic of Upper Volta, now called Burkina Faso, from 1959 until 1966."
Biography.
"""Monsieur Maurice"" incarnated the Voltaic state at the time of independence. As a member of the colonial administration, Maurice Yaméogo began his career in 1946 in the dense political landscape of Upper Volta thanks to his oratory skills. In May 1957, as part of the formation of the first Volta Government established by the framework law Defferre, he joined the coalition government formed by Ouezzin Coulibaly, as Minister of Agriculture under the label of the Movement Voltaic Democratic (MDV) . In January 1958, threatened by a motion of censure, Ouezzin Coulibaly debauched in favor of the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) Maurice Yaméogo and his allies at the assembly against the insurance of a promotion in the government. Maurice Yaméogo thus raises No. 2 of the government with the portfolio of the Interior, a key position that allows him when in September 1958 Ouezzin Coulibaly dies, to act as interim head of government."
"Maurice Yaméogo quickly imposes his choices. After the proclamation of the Republic on December 11, 1958, it operates in 1959 a surprising reversal of position vis-à-vis the proposed Federation of Mali defended by Léopold Sédar Senghor. Although the Voltaic constituent assembly wanted Haute-Volta to join the Federation, Maurice Yaméogo opted for international sovereignty and regional integration limited to the economic sphere with the Entente Council. Then Yaméogo neutralizes any parliamentary opposition. The UDV-RDA purified of its adversaries, imposes in single party. Upper Volta is even before independence, on August 5, 1960, under the yoke of his dictatorship."
"In foreign politics, jealous and admiring of the international success of his Ivorian colleague Félix Houphouët-Boigny, he challenged him by establishing an ephemeral customs union (1961-1962) with the very progressive Ghana of Kwame Nkrumah. Houphouët-Boigny quickly became his best ally in December 1965. Yaméogo signed with him an agreement to establish dual citizenship for Ivorian and Voltaic nationals. This project does not have time to succeed. On January 3, 1966, in a context of severe financial austerity measures, his corrupt regime was overthrown by a peaceful demonstration organized by the forces of the Voltaic nation: the unions, the so-called traditional chieftaincy and the clergy. The result is Maurice Yaméogo, an austerity linked to his dubious management of finances. In 1993, he died after being rehabilitated by the President of the Republic Blaise Compaore."

Don McCarthy
"Donald McCarthy, CBE (19 June 1955 – 21 July 2018) was a British entrepreneur and philanthropist. He was known for being the chairman of House of Fraser from 2006 to 2014. From 2007 until 2012 McCarthy also was chairman of Aurum, a British watch and jewellery retailer."
Smoke detector
"A smoke sensor or smoke detector is a device that can detect smoke, which may be an indicator of a fire. There are two basic systems: Simple, standalone sensors usually make a sound or flash a light when they detect smoke. More sophisticated sensors usually send a signal to an fire alarm panel, or system. Most smoke detectors use either an optical sensor, or they use a physical process called ionization. Many simple smoke sensors use batteries. Very often dead batteries are not replaced; when this happens, the smoke sensors stop working. But, the detector may ""chirp"" when the battery is low to try and stop this from happening. There are also systems which are directly connected to electrical power; these may use batteries just as a backup."
"Smoke detectors are housed in plastic enclosures, typically shaped like a disk about in diameter and thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or by physical process (ionization); detectors may use either, or both, methods. Sensitive alarms can be used to detect, and thus deter, smoking in areas where it is banned. Smoke detectors in large commercial, industrial, and residential buildings are usually powered by a central fire alarm system, which is powered by the building power with a battery backup. Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units, to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out."
Design.
Photoelectric.
"Photoelectric smoke detectors rely on detecting a lack of light to set the alarm off. The light used could be infrared, visible light, or ultraviolet. When smoke blocks out the light inside a photoelectric smoke detector, the smoke detector detects that there is less light. Below a certain brightness, whether or not it comes from smoke or not, the photoelectric smoke detector will beep."
Ionization.
"Ionization smoke detectors use radioactive elements to ionize the air. Alpha particles are released from the radioactive element onto air particles so that those air particles become charged. An ionization smoke detector will detect smoke if there is a change in voltage. If smoke enters the smoke detector, some of the alpha particles will attach to the smoke instead of the air particles. This will change the voltage inside the smoke detector, so the smoke detector will beep."
"Ionization smoke detectors are cheaper than photoelectric smoke detectors, but they cause more false alarms than photoelectric smoke detectors. Additionally, ionization smoke detectors are slower to react in real house fires."

Triatominae
"The members of Triatominae are a subfamily of Reduviidae. They are also called kissing bugs, conenose bugs, assassin bugs or triatomines. There are more than 130 species in this subfamily. Most of them feed on vertebrate blood. A few species feed on other invertebrates. They are mainly found in the Americas. There are a few species in Asia, Australia and Africa."

Blast injury
"A blast injury is an injury caused by exposure to an explosive blast. Blast injuries are divided into four main types, with a fifth type for illnesses caused by the blast, and a sixth type for the effects of psychological trauma after the blast such as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)."
Explosions.
"The type of injury and how severe it is depends on different things. This includes the type of explosion, the force of the explosion, the environment where the explosion happens, and how close the person is to the explosion."
An explosion results from the rapid release of energy. Explosions fall into four general categories:
Chemical:
"A chemical explosion is the result of a rapid chemical reaction or change of state which creates a lot of heat and usually gas. There are various types of chemical explosions including natural gas explosions, dust explosions and those caused by explosives."
Explosives are categorized as high-order (HE) explosives or low-order (LE) explosives and they each cause different injury patterns. Only (HE) explosives produce a shock wave.
Mechanical
Electrical
Nuclear
Injury classification.
"Blast injuries are divided into four classes of physical trauma primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. A fifth category, the quinary injuries, are those caused by toxic substances associated with the blast."
Primary injuries.
"Primary injuries are caused by the explosion's shock waves. Air and fluid-filled internal organs are most commonly affected, but the blast wave may also cause external injuries such as traumatic amputation."
"The structures of the internal ears are most often affected by the blast wave, with perforated ear drums the most common injury. The most common fatal injury in victims who survive the initial blast is blast lung. Blast lung can result in pulmonary contusions, bleeding and fluid build-up in the lungs with damage to airways and blood vessels."
Secondary injuries.
"Most casualties in an explosion are caused by secondary blast injuries. These injuries may be caused by fragments of the explosive device and other objects within the blast zone being propelled by the force of the explosion. These objects may strike any part of the body resulting in penetrating trauma. The severity of the penetrating trauma depends to a degree on the size of the object, the depth of penetration, and the part of the body hit."
"Secondary blast injuries are common in deliberate explosions such as those caused by terrorist bombs. The bombs are often designed with objects such as nails, or ball bearings packed in and around the explosive device to act as shrapnel."
"These injuries may also occur in accidental explosions - such as may occur in an industrial accident - when objects in the environment affected by the blast, such as shattered glass take the role of shrapnel."
Tertiary injuries.
"Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries."
"Anthropology uses a ""four-field approach"" that divides anthropology into four big kinds:"
Archaeology.
Archaeology is the study of humans from the past. People who study archaeology are called archaeologists.
"Archaeologists look at things that past people left behind to know how they lived. They look at tools, bones, and past houses to see how people in the past are not the same as people that live today."
Here are some other examples of what archaeologists like to study:
Biological Anthropology.
Biological or physical anthropology studies human bodies and how they change over time.
They look at how humans live in nature and how their bodies change because of where they live. They also study how human beings and apes and monkeys are alike. Sometimes biological anthropologists study human and animal bones to learn about how past humans lived. They are also called physical anthropologists.
Here are some other examples of what biological anthropologists like to study:
Linguistic Anthropology.
Linguistics is the study of how people talk.
"Linguistic anthropologists study sounds and how they go together to make words. Then they study what the words mean and how people use them. Linguistic anthropology also studies how language changes what people think and how people change language. No two people talk the same way, so linguistic anthropologists want to know why that happens."
Here are some other examples of what linguistic anthropologists like to study:
Socio-Cultural Anthropology.
Socio-Cultural Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures.
It looks at how human beings understand the world around them and how they act with the people around them. Socio-cultural anthropologists study living people by going to their homes and learning about who those people are and what they do. They write about people in places all over the world to see why people are different. Some socio-cultural anthropologists study medicine in these places and some look at how babies grow up in other places.
Here are some other examples of what socio-cultural anthropologists like to study:
Other Kinds of Anthropology.
"Even though there are four main kinds of anthropology, there are a lot of different kinds of anthropology within the four main kinds. Here are some examples:"
Rules of Anthropology.
"Like everything in life, anthropology has a set of rules that every anthropologist needs to follow. The rules try to make sure that no one gets hurt or mad when studying other people. Here are some of the rules:"
Notable people.
This is a list of important people who studied anthropology.
Education
Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It's also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better.
"Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen."
"Education may help and guide individuals from one class to other. Educated individuals and groups can do things like, help less educated people and encourage them to get educated."
Types of education.
"There are different ways to categorize education, for example by age or subject. One way is to divide it into ""formal education"", ""non-formal education"", and ""informal education""."
"Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or, students may go to a City college where they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this,"
"Non-formal education includes adult basic education, adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation. In nonformal education someone (who is not in school) can learn literacy, other basic skills or job skills. Home education, individualized instruction (such as programmed learning), distance learning and computer-assisted instruction are other possibilities."
Main course
"The main course is food that is served as the main dish in a multi-course meal. It is often served after the entrée. In the United States, the main course may be called the ""entrée""."
"The main course is usually the biggest dish on a menu. The main ingredient is often meat or fish. It most often follows an appetizer, soup, or salad, and is often followed by a dessert."
Richard S. Williamson
"Richard Salisbury Williamson (May 9, 1949 – December 8, 2013) was an American lawyer, diplomat and pedagogue. He previously served as Special Envoy to Sudan under George W. Bush. Williamson was a partner at Winston &amp; Strawn and was also ""Thomas J. Sharkey Distinguished Visiting Scholar"" at Seton Hall's Whitehead School of Diplomacy."
"Williamson died of a cerebral hemorrhage at a Chicago hospital on December 8, 2013, aged 64."
Paul Freeman
"Paul Freeman (born 18 January 1943) is an English movie, stage, voice, and television actor. He is best known for his role as rival archeologist René Belloq in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and as the evil wine baron, Gustav Reibmann on season 4 of ""Falcon Crest"". He also appeared in ""Hot Fuzz""."
Beşbarmaq
"Beşbarmaq (; Uzbek: norin, нарын) is the national dish of Kyrgyzstan, Bashkortostan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. It is also the main course on feasts in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. It is made from meat, with chopped noodles and onion sauce."
Progressive conservatism
"Progressive conservatism is an ideology that tries to unite conservative and progressive ideas. To deal with poverty, the ideology supports the idea of a social safety net. It also supports a limited redistribution of wealth. The people supporting progressive conservatism want to allow the government to regulate markets in the interests of both consumers and producers. Progressive conservatism first arose as a distinct ideology in the United Kingdom under Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's ""One Nation"" Toryism."
"In the UK, the Prime Ministers Disraeli, Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan, and David Cameron have been described as progressive conservatives. The Catholic Church's ""Rerum Novarum"" (1891) advocates a progressive conservative doctrine known as social Catholicism."
"In the United States, Theodore Roosevelt has been the main figure identified with progressive conservatism as a political tradition. Roosevelt stated that he had ""always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand"". Some people considered the administration of President William Howard Taft to be progressive conservative. Taft described himself as ""a believer in progressive conservatism"". President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared himself an advocate of ""progressive conservatism"". In Germany, Chancellor Leo von Caprivi promoted a progressive conservative agenda called the ""New Course"". In Canada, a variety of conservative governments have been progressive conservative, with Canada's major conservative movement being officially named the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada from 1942 to 2003. In Canada, the Prime Ministers Arthur Meighen, R.B. Bennett, John Diefenbaker, Joe Clark, Brian Mulroney, and Kim Campbell led progressive conservative federal governments."

Championship
"In sport, a championship is a competition to determine which individual or team is the champion. Different forms of competition can be called a championship. It is usually the final competition in a tournament (a series of competitions). For example, the FIFA World Cup is a tournament held every four years. The winner of the final competition of each tournament becomes that tournament's champion. In a league system, the championship is the final competition of a regular season. In some league systems, a series of playoffs is used to determine the champion of a season. There is one champion for each season. In combat sports, such as wrestling and boxing, a competitor must challenge the current champion to win the championship."
Atlas Computer (Manchester)
The Atlas Computer was a computer installed in Manchester University in 1962 that was very important in the development of computing. The Atlas computer was one of the worlds first supercomputers and possibly the most powerful computer in the world at its time.
Management information system
"A management information system is a system that allows a company to run efficiently, by providing the relevant information the company needs. Nowadays, management information systems use specialized software that runs on a computer. A management information system is usually targeted at economic aspects of running a company, while an executive information system is usually designed for managing staff. The first such systems were built in the 1960s."

"Yeah,"
"Georgia here, they're usually wrong too."
We have weird weather systems.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, like I say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly T V, five o'clock to six thirty."
"Uh, that seems like a long time for news"
but that's how long it is.
Yeah.
"And, uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news."
Uh-huh.
"And then, uh, my morning paper. I can hardly wait for it to come."
"Oh,"
Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time?
Pardon.
"Uh, do you all start planning real far ahead of time?"
"Well, no."
There is kind of a set pattern to it.
"There is, uh,"
"so, uh, the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually."
"Oh, really"
Yeah.
"Uh, we, uh, get together, at the, uh, the park, uh, the, uh, the park, and playground area of the Church I was raised in"
Yeah.
"and, uh, everybody brings lots of food"
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat
Eat a lot.
"Oh, gosh."
It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out
Yeah.
"and so we have to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh, vacation time."
Schedule vacation time
and yeah.
We
"uh, Sat, uh, Sunday afternoon or, uh, sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon."
Uh-huh.
"Usually, it is like Sunday afternoon"
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"is that one of your, uh,"
"I mean, uh,"
"Well, where I am calling from is southern Mississippi."
"So, we have got, uh, uh, my wife and I have, uh, a bit longer ways to go than most."
Yeah.
"I tell you what,"
"the first three days, I was glued to the television."
I will admit the same thing.
"And I, would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer"
"And I,"
"and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program"
Yeah.
"and I, I was just, I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing."
I tell you what.
"The uh, the war spot in"
"let's see, was it a Wednesday or Thursday?"
"Must have been Thursday, uh,"
"and Friday night I was, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open."
Uh-huh.
"Because I was watching C N N,"
"and they would, they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus,"
"and the people would be standing there in gas masks,"
"and you'd be hearing the sirens,"
"and it was just,"
I was amazed.
Uh-huh.
"I, I didn't have that experience."
"I, I don't have cable"
Oh.
"so I, I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought, I thought they did a very good job."
Uh-huh.
"Um, I've got one question for you."
I you say you take the newspaper.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I, I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting."
"We've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the TIMES HERALD, and then the MORNING NEWS, which has a very strong subscription."
"the I've got my beans, peas,"
Yeah.
"I've got some onions out,  tomatoes,"
Yeah.
I'm not real sure what they're going to do this year.
I never have much luck with tomatoes.
"I do plant a lot of beans, because it seems like, the, uh, bugs get on them so easily"
"and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that,"
"so, the only thing that I use is soap."
"I water, you know, spray the plants, because they say, supposedly, that will keep the bugs off them."
"But, uh, I don't have luck with that tomato plant,"
so I hate to spray them with anything.
"Um, what do you do?"
Do you have any tips you could give me?
"Um, my favorite one is putting on the, um, tomato plant is to put, uh, dust,"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time,"
That's true.
That's true.
My dad is a farmer
"so, I've heard him talk about that forever."
"I guess it works,"
"but, um, you have to really wash your vegetables after that"
so it won't make you sick.
Let's see what else do you do to your house?
"Well, I've done some rewiring on it."
Yeah.
"Eventually, if we stay here, I'm going to have to rewire the entire house."
"Oh, really."
"Do you plan on like adding any rooms or,"
you have enough space
Yeah.
"Right,"
"they're kind of the leaders right now, you know."
"I used to see all those commercials for Windows, you know,"
"and you're like, oh, gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name."
"Really,"
"why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price."
"Yeah, you know."
They'd sell more if they were honest.
"Exactly,"
"almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because I, I really, I've used both"
and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all.
"Yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. base."
"Uh,"
"Yeah, yeah that's true, too."
"But, uh, I don't know,"
"I'm really, I've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home."
"I, I do use a Mac at work"
"but, uh uh, I really don't, don't do much with it at home"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh,"
Apple's sort of making a
and they're ones were
"growling consumer, uh, need to worry about the Mac they're getting,"
"like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back."
They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive.
Right.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"you sound like you must, uh, work in the computer business."
"Yeah,"
"I have one,"
"this, this town was like less than ten thousand people"
and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas.
"And, you know, I didn't move out of there until I was, you know, twenty-seven"
"and that was just, you know,"
so I love the big city
"You know, I had lived in a rural area for, for so long"
"so I've enjoyed it,"
"but, uh, it can, it can get kind of tough."
Its like a rat race sometimes.
That's just something I'll never adapt to.
"I don't, I don't want to be a part of the rat race."
I want to be basically just kind of left alone.
Yeah
"If I want to sit around and mess with my garden, I'll mess with my garden,"
Yeah.
"if I want to work in the flower beds,"
Yeah.
It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well.
"I, I,"
Very much.
yeah.
I really do enjoy that.
But I haven't planted anything yet
"or, you know, I usually have gotten flowers coming out the"
"but I, I haven't done that, yet."
I've had finals this week.
"So, uh,  you know, I'm just kind of trying to, trying to stick in with that,"
Huh-uh.
"but, uh, since that's over with now, maybe I can, I can get this yard in shape."
Do you do a lot of gardening?
"Uh, landscaping is more, than the gardening,"
Yeah.
"Gardening in Texas is really interesting, though."
I grew up in Illinois
Yeah.
"and, um, Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,"
"why, you know, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has uh, watering system."
Uh-huh.
"And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, um, you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water."
Uh-huh.
"But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass"
Uh-huh.
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
"Right,"
yeah.
and and I just think it's ugly
"When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, you know, and their grass is fairly green."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant."
"I think the Saint Augustine and, uh, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"yeah,"
those two.
Yeah.
"Some people have, I think it's fescue that stays green all winter,"
Yeah.
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.
They have to water an incredible amount.
"But, um, those those lawns look nice during the winter,"
"but, you know, they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb."
"But, you know, when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one, you know,"
"it's sort of like, well,"
"I mean, you, you hate to be paranoid"
but there are really only so many things you can do.
"You can have the house alarm, uh neighborhood watch program, you know, uh, as a woman not go out at night"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"uh, you can do that which is what I choose to do."
Yeah.
One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited
Yeah.
"even, even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps,"
Uh-huh.
"it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know."
"They could basically, uh,"
"when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors  um, things like that like"
Uh-huh.
"That's,"
Uh-huh.
they did in Miami that time.
"But it's not, uh,"
"if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self-defense though."
That's not always true.
It isn't?
No.
"There was a, there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed"
Uh-huh.
"and essentially what he had done is set a, a a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home."
Uh-huh.
Huh.
The guy came in while he was home
"and, sure enough, he fell into the trap and was severely burned."
"He didn't die,"
but he was severely burned
"well, I think,"
"I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time."
"So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in."
"Yes,"
we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast.
Uh-huh.
We'll catch our news that way.
Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately?
"Lately, I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I can't remember the last time I saw it."
It's been a while.
"Yeah,"
"well, I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not"
"I don't know,"
"sometimes they come on and, and say."
"Oh, that's right."
"Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, uh, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words."
"Um, yeah."
It was really interesting.
It is interesting.
"So,"
Do you work for Texas Instruments?
"No,"
"no,"
"just, uh, doing this as a fund-raiser for our church."
"Oh, that's nice."
very definitely.
And so you've got a real balance to make there.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
"Well, I'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old."
"They aren't really that old,"
"but they are, sort of wearing out."
My mamma is a dialysis patient
Uh-huh.
"and she is only about sixty-four,"
but she's had some pretty close calls
and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
and so she's phasing out ounds like
"and, but she's also a very, very, very independent person and doesn't like having having people, uh, not being able to do things for herself when she wants to"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home,"
but my daddy keeps talking about it.
"I don't,"
"I couldn't possibly, couldn't never see him in a nursing home."
ery faint.
"And my grand daddy also doesn't like, wouldn't want to be in a nursing home."
"He's ninety, I think right on ninety right now"
Oh really.
and he's living by himself.
My grand mamma died a couple of years ago
"Oh, okay."
"so but, he's, you know,"
"as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home."
"Yeah,"
but it gets hard.
"My, my grandmother is in her mid eighties"
Uh-huh.
"Well, you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, that's right"
"and the neighbor,"
they thought it was the neighbor.
They thought it was the neighbor.
He gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip.
Yeah.
I thought that was wonderful.
"And then, uh, it, it's, it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor."
"And, uh, on Sunday, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out where they've moved it."
"On our, uh, public television, they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show."
Uh-huh.
"And it showed the latest, uh, developments from all the computer companies."
"Uh-huh,"
I've never seen that program.
"Well, you know, it's,"
"unless you're really into computers, you and software, you probably wouldn't be interested,"
Uh-huh.
"but I don't know,"
Uh-huh.
it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there.
Oh.
"And, uh, you know, what, they, they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, you know, and then they also, the hardware."
Oh.
Uh-huh.
So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
"and, I enjoyed that."
Uh-huh.
It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials.
"Oh, okay."
"It's public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the show"
"Do you hear, the, the beep in the background."
Yes.
"Oh, that's a, an ambulance or something going on here, I think."
Okay.
"Where, Where are you,"
I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually.
"and, uh,"
In Manhattan.
Are you at home now?
"Yeah,"
I'm at home.
So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.
Uh-huh.
"So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean, because there's a lot of background noise that, you know, people can hear."
So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up.
"Um, yeah,"
"and often times that,"
"I can't talk on can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call."
What time is it now where you are?
"Uh, about twenty after four."
So you're an hour ahead of where I am.
I'm in Central Central time zone.
"Okay,"
yeah
we're Eastern.
"And, um, what did, did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems?"
"No,"
I haven't done that.
"Uh, I know someone who has,"
"and, and she's, uh, very, uh, pleased with it."
"She told me some of the things you can do,"
"and it's just a, a very handy tool to have."
and then he goes home
"and, and, uh, you know, in the, in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or, or something like that,"
Right.
or they don't care.
"You know, mamma, guess what I did in school today,"
"well who cares, you know."
"An a lot of it, a lot of the parents now are so young."
True.
"You know, that they're, they still, they still don't know what's going on"
"and how are they supposed to, you know, teach their kids that are coming up, you know, what's going on."
"I mean it's just, it's a vicious cycle, that we're, you know, dead, smack dead in the center of"
Yeah.
and we have to try to swim out.
"You know, kind of like the Bermuda Triangle,"
we're just sinking
and it's almost impossible to swim back up.
Yeah.
"But, um, yeah,"
"there's definitely problems,"
Yeah
"I'm,"
"its just the solutions that, you know, they're going to be in our political system,"
"they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while, too long."
"I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with, uh, oh, especially Asian, Japanese families coming,"
"here in Plano we've got, uh, quite a few."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Uh, engineering types, people who have come from Japan,"
Right.
and they put their kids in the U S schools
and they're appalled.
Uh-huh.
"I said I don't know,"
I'll have to try it and see.
I've always watched it.
Uh-huh.
"And he said, well, fine,"
"he said, we'll just take you over to the course, he lives near Brookhaven we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it."
Uh-huh
"If you do, then we can go golf together."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, whoa,"
"great,"
I get to walk all around a little green field all day.
"But those kinds of things happen, though,"
"you, you get a little taste of it"
"and you say, Hey, this is not bad."
Uh-huh.
And you really begin to develop an interest in it.
But I am not an athlete at all.
Me either.
"You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball, and, hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball."
So I am not an athlete.
Maybe golf is a forgiving sport.
I don't know.
Yeah
"at least you're just you're competing against yourself, I guess, more than everybody else out there."
It doesn't appear to be
Uh-huh.
"I really, I, I haven't really acquired an interest in it,"
"but I'm open to try anything, you know."
Yeah
"that's, kind of the way I feel."
"The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned, my skin is very fair"
"and, uh, their dock was completely under water on the lake."
"Oh, my gosh."
So we really had a lot of rain.
"Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,"
"there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano"
Right.
"and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,"
"and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,"
"but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess."
It just
"Yeah,"
we had a lot of flash floods in the area.
"We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few."
Uh-huh.
Not more than ten
"but,"
"That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much."
"Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,"
"it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy"
"Yeah,"
"well, it's, uh, interesting,"
"uh,"
I'm going down to El Paso next week
"and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,"
"but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,"
"Well, El Paso won't be cold."
"It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?"
"No,"
"it's, it's, quite southern"
"and it's, it's rare to get real cold in, in El Paso."
Uh-huh.
"The, uh, you'll be flying in there?"
"So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
That's another thing.
You have to go to different places to do that.
Right.
"So it's, so that's nice."
"It would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up"
"and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that,"
"but, uh, uh, it didn't go through."
Uh-huh.
"But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh,"
"I don't know,"
it just doesn't make sense to me.
Right.
"I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, so I guess that's one option."
Yeah.
"That's good,"
that's good.
I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.
"Like, uh"
Uh-huh.
"have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?"
Huh.
No.
"Yeah,"
"I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle,"
you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
yeah.
That was hilarious.
"The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,"
Oh yes.
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.
"Yes,"
yes.
Unbelievable.
"Well, you know there are people, uh, referred to as savants also, uh, who can do most phenomenal things"
Yeah.
and everyone feels they are totally retarded.
"Yeah,"
"because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,"
That's right.
"but, boy there's a lots going on in there"
It's amazing
"Yeah,"
yeah
"and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease, only,"
Yes.
"an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,"
"and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then then again work with it toward a good end. Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example."
Yes
"and the,"
"Right,"
well the warmth that developed between them
"and again it, I think was a picture of relationships."
Yeah.
"Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would have occurred, uh, by accident."
"Right,"
right.
"I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie"
"But,"
"What, what about the domestic effects"
"like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it, uh, possible and even popular to, uh, criticize the government."
"And they,"
"that pendulum started to swing, uh, maybe even too far. To the point where, uh, uh, supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And that tradition is still,"
"I mean it's dying now,"
"but it's still alive as opposed to,"
"this Desert Storm stuff may have, uh  killed it."
Yeah.
"But I think that was one of the biggest,"
"that, you know, the, uh, the domestic unrest,"
Are you in the middle of anything?
No.
I'm not in the middle of anything.
"I've just,"
about the last thing I did
"about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house."
"So, I guess that,"
The whole thing?
Yeah.
"That, that was fairly large undertaking."
"A, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house."
Did the framing and all?
"Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking."
Huh.
"That was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that"
"we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that"
and.
and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
"So, it's, it's like everybody is into it,"
it's just greed. Human greed.
Yeah.
"Interestingly in Honduras, It's very pro-American."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And we have I,"
"my girlfriend used to, uh, be in the Navy"
"and she was based, uh, based in Panama."
Uh-huh.
"In Honduras, very, uh, uh, pro-American."
Uh-huh.
"And there's a lot of men, I don't know how many American, uh,"
"soldiers are there,"
but there's a lot.
"I mean, they, uh,"
"I had wondered sometimes,"
"I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort"
"and a lot of work went into a lot of that,"
"and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, you know,"
"like, uh,"
Uh-huh
"Yeah,"
"I've, you know, some of the programs I would have concern about like, um, the language teaching, you know,"
"I mean, why should we push English,"
Uh-huh
and a lot of people were down there teaching English
"and when they talked about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language, you know, to me that's a little bit marginal."
"I did teach economics at the university one night a week,"
"and the textbook was in English,"
"but basically I taught it in Spanish, because, I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test."
Oh.
"So, I mean all kinds of resources and, you know, just there,"
Yeah.
"and I'd give anything to have that right now in my, in my regular"
"I mean you, you have everything given to you."
I don't see why people wouldn't want that.
"I don't know,"
"I,"
"but then, if I was young, I wouldn't see it."
"Uh-huh,"
"well that's, that's it"
"you, you don't have, uh,  you don't have the view."
"But you know, now that it's gone, I,"
Right.
"I graduated from Texas Tech, more than two years ago, I guarantee,"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, I kind of look back at it sometimes,"
"well that was a lot of fun,"
"but, you know, I'm not sure that, that I took the greatest advantage of, you know, what, I went through there."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
I did a lot
and I experienced a lot
"and I, I feel like I got a good college education"
"but just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library,"
"I should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"the informal classes that you don't get credit for, you know ..."
"All right,"
"I guess our, we're in the process of a home repair right at this point"
"because we're, we're painting the outside of our house."
"I don't know,"
"Yeah,"
"it, it really is."
"Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way."
Uh-huh.
"So when we get like, uh, uh, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back."
"Yeah,"
so you guys can actually get ahead
Yeah
"But, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you you're not like reimbursed for or paid for."
"Like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass. Uh, and milk jugs and, uh, newspapers, you know,"
Yeah.
everyone does newspapers.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
everybody does newspapers.
"But, that, that kind of stuff."
Yeah.

"But, uh, let's see,"
"they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,"
"I, I, I tell you what, what really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"that's,"
"In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good"

That's right.
and other fees.
"That's right,"
that's right.
It really is high.
"It can get very expensive,"
"and I can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro, because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
And they don't give those sessions away.
"And nor do they give, uh, instructions away."
Right.
As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I'd be interested in golf.
"and there was discussion for a while about, uh, building a garbage burning, uh, electric generation plant"
Uh-huh.
"but it just wasn't cost effective, at the time."
Oh.
"And there's, there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city"
"but there isn't any, uh, advertising campaign."
There's just not any push to recycle.
Huh.
"I recycle my newspapers and, uh, my aluminum stuff."
"Right,"
that's what I do.
"But, uh, they make it as hard as possible,"
it's not very convenient to do.
"Right,"
when they put centers and stuff like that.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well we have those, uh, which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans."
I don't know if you all have those things around.
Yes.
"And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center,"
and you can just stop by.
"Now everything else like the uh, paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers"
"but, but for aluminum that's real nice"
Uh-huh.
and I started doing that at work.
"Um, I put out a, a trash can and, and for people to put their aluminum cans in,"
Uh-huh.
"and that's really helped a lot,"
"I mean, everybody's pitched in"
"and, you know, it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can."

"Archanes (, Godart & Olivier abbreviation: ARKH) is a former municipality in the Heraklion regional unit, Crete, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Archanes-Asterousia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of . Population 5,042 (2011). It is also the archaeological site of an ancient Minoan settlement in central Crete. The discovery of ancient roads leading from Archanes to Juktas, Anemospilia, Xeri Kara and Vathypetro indicate that Archanes was an important hub in the region during Minoan times. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Archanes spread out over the same area as the modern town of Archanes."
"In 1912, Xanthoudides noted the importance of Archanes, but Sir Arthur Evans was the first to characterize the site as palatial, declaring that Archanes was likely a Summer Palace for the Knossos kings. Spyridon Marinatos and N. Platon excavated minor areas in the region, but nothing supported Evans' theory. In 1964, Yannis Sakellarakis dug trial trenches at the Tourkoyeitonia site and uncovered the first evidence of a palace site. Since 1966, Archanes has been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society under the supervision of John Sakellarakis and Efi Sapouna-Sakellarakis."
"In the Minoan era, aqueducts delivered water to Kephala Hill from spring water sources at Archanes, which are also the source of the Kairatos River."
"Troullos is the easternmost site of the Archanes settlement. Tourkoyeitonia, in central Archanes, is the site of its palace, likely built in the Middle Minoan period. Excavations began here in 1964 by J. Sakellarakis. It contains features such as ashlar blocks, poros-stone plaques and blocks, plaster, wood, stucco floor tiles, gypsum, kouskoura slabs, mud bricks, ironstone blocks, schist plaques, blue marble flooring, incurved concave altars, wooden columns and pillars, frescoes and Polytheron doorways. A variety of Porphyrite stone lamps, vases, amphorae, cooking pots, cups, lamps, tools and every-day domestic items such as tweezers have been unearthed at the site. Southwest of Tourkoyeitonia, more of the palace is found. While little remains of the architecture, the walls that are preserved are Middle Minoan III–Late Minoan IA. Linear A tablets and the model of a house were excavated at The Archive along with MMIII-LMIA pottery and several unworked pieces of rock crystal, obsidian and steatite."
"The man-made enclosure of a spring, partially excavated in 1921 by Sir Arthur Evans, was completed by J. Sakellarakis in 1964. The floor is laid with pebbles, and the walls are poros-stone. Evidence indicates that it was built between Middle Minoan IB and Middle Minoan IIIA, destroyed during Late Minoan IA, and then restored and in various use afterward. The reservoir is within the palace grounds."
"A large paved area, dissected by walkways that form a triangle, is found in Theatre Area"" or ""Aghios Nikolaos"" (Saint Nicholas). Two stepped altars are found here, one on a walkway and one on the pavement. There is a painting of a reconstruction of this area in Sakellarakis' ""Crete Archanes"" guidebook on page 49, which does this area more justice than a written description."
"The economy revolves around grape and olive processing and marketing. Both products account for some 96% of its total agricultural products. The Agricultural Cooperative of Archanes, set up in 1931, is one of the oldest in Greece, and consists of 1119 members. A quarter of the wine production is exported to Germany, France and the Netherlands, and the rest of the production is largely marketed domestically. Since the late 1990s, attempts have been made to convert part of wine making step by step to organic and integrated farming, beginning with the cultivation of table grapes."

"Charles Stanley Albeck (born May 17, 1931) is a former professional basketball coach. Albeck has coached for several teams in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA), including the Denver Rockets, the San Diego Conquistadors, (often subbing for an absent Wilt Chamberlain), the Cleveland Cavaliers, the San Antonio Spurs, the New Jersey Nets, and the Chicago Bulls."
"Albeck graduated from Chenoa High School in Chenoa, Illinois and received his bachelor's degree at Bradley University in 1955 and his masters at Michigan State University in 1957. He married Phyllis L. Mann in 1952 and they have five children."
"He began his coaching at Adrian College in Adrian, Michigan."
Albeck's next head coaching job was at Northern Michigan University.
Albeck was head coach at the University of Denver from 1968 to 1970.
"He was the head coach of the Denver Rockets during most of the 1970–1971 season. The Rockets had begun the season under head coach Joe Belmont, but Belmont was fired after the team lost 10 of its first 13 games. Albeck replaced Belmont as the Rockets' head coach. The Rockets went 27–44 under Albeck to finish the season with a record of 30 wins and 54 losses. They tied the Texas Chaparrals for fourth place in the Western Division (28 games behind the Indiana Pacers) and on April 1, 1971 lost a one-game playoff to the Chaparrals, 115–109, to determine who would advance into the ABA Western Division semifinals. During the season Denver's average home attendance dropped to 4,139 fans per game from 6,281 the year before. One week after the playoff loss, on April 8, 1971, Albeck was replaced by Alex Hannum as Denver's head coach. Hannum resigned as coach of the San Diego Rockets to become the Rockets' head coach, general manager and president. Albeck then became player personnel director for the Rockets."
"During the 1972–1973 season Albeck was an assistant coach for the San Diego Conquistadors under head coach K.C. Jones. Albeck also served as director of player personnel for the Conquistadors. During most of the 1973–74 he served under 'Ques' head coach Wilt Chamberlain. Chamberlain missed a few games, during which Albeck filled in as the Conquistadors' head coach, winning all of them."
Albeck was an assistant coach for the Kentucky Colonels during the 1974–1975 season in which the team won the 1975 ABA Championship. Albeck returned as an assistant coach with the Colonels during their final season in 1975–1976.
"He was assistant coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, 1976–1979."
"Albeck was head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, 1979–1980."
"He was the San Antonio Spurs' head coach for three seasons, from 1980 to 1983."
"After the Spurs job, Albeck was the head coach of the New Jersey Nets from 1983 to 1985."
"Next, Albeck was head coach of the Chicago Bulls, 1985–1986. His exit from Chicago raised eyebrows around the NBA as his replacement, Doug Collins, had been hired by General Manager Jerry Krause just 2 months beforehand as a scout. The hire of Collins was kept a secret from Albeck."
"From 1986 through 1991 Albeck was head coach for Bradley University, his alma mater. He is a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, as well as a Significant Sig and a member of their Significant Sig Hall of Fame."
His all time coaching percentages is .535 for his 7 years as a head coach in the NBA.

= = = John Francis Dodge = = =
"John Francis Dodge (October 25, 1864 – January 14, 1920) was an American automobile manufacturing pioneer and co-founder of Dodge Brothers Company."
"Dodge was born in Niles, Michigan, where his father ran a foundry and machine shop. John and his younger brother, Horace, were inseparable as children and as adults. The origins of the Dodge family lie in Stockport, England, where their ancestral home still stands."
"In 1886, the Dodge family moved to Detroit, where John and Horace took jobs at a boiler maker plant. In 1894 they went to work as machinists at the Dominion Typograph Company in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. While John was the sales-minded managerial type, his brother Horace was a gifted mechanic and inveterate tinkerer. Using a dirt-proof ball bearing Horace invented and patented, in 1897 Dodge arranged a deal for the brothers to join with a third-party investor to manufacture bicycles. Within a few years, they sold the bicycle business and in 1900 used the proceeds of the sale to set up their own machine shop in Detroit."
"In their first year of business, the Dodge brothers' company began making parts for the automobile industry. In 1902 the Dodge brothers won a contract to build transmissions for the Olds Motor Vehicle Company upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. However, the following year they turned down a second contract from Olds to retool their Detroit plant at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue to build engines for Henry Ford in a deal that included a share position in the new Ford Motor Company. By 1910, John Dodge and his brother were so successful they built a new plant in Hamtramck, Michigan."
"For ten years (1903–1913), the Dodge brothers' business was a Ford Motor Company supplier, and Dodge worked as vice president of the Ford company. He left Ford in 1913, and in 1914 he and Horace formed Dodge Brothers to develop their own line of automobiles. They began building motor trucks for the United States military during the arms buildup for World War I, and in October 1917 they produced their first commercial car. At war's end, their company produced and marketed both cars and trucks."
He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1997.
"Because of his temper and often crude behavior, the red-haired Dodge was seen as socially unacceptable to most of the well-heeled elite of Detroit. Nevertheless, his wealth made him an influential member of the community and he became active in Republican Party politics in Michigan."
"The Dodge brothers were the sons of machinist Daniel Rugg Dodge (1819–1897) and Maria Duval Casto (1823–1906). Maria was Daniel's second wife. They had an elder full sister: Della Lone (1863–1936) and older half brother Charles Frontier Dodge (1855–1926), and half sister Laura Belle (1858-?) from Daniel's first marriage to Lorinda Gould (1820–1860)."
John Dodge married Canadian Ivy Hawkins (1864–1901) in September 1892. They had three children:
"Following Ivy (Hawkins) Dodge's death from tuberculosis, he secretly married Isabelle Smith (who was his housekeeper) in Walkerville, Ontario, on December 8, 1902. They separated in 1905 and quietly divorced in 1907; the marriage was kept secret until after the death of his third wife. Shortly after the divorce from Isabelle, Dodge married his secretary, Matilda Rausch (1883–1967). Dodge had three more children with Matilda:"
"In 1908, John Dodge and Matilda purchased the land for Meadow Brook Farms near Rochester, Michigan. At Meadow Brook, their eldest child, Frances, developed a love of horses that led her to acquire Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and turn it into one of the leading horse breeding operations in the United States. Dodge's daughter Isabel established Brookmeade Stable. It became a major participant in Thoroughbred horse racing and owned several Champions, including the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horses Cavalcade and Sword Dancer. Five years after Dodge's death in 1920, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and they built the Meadow Brook Hall at the Rochester estate."
His great grandson is film producer John F Dodge III.
"John and Horace contracted influenza and pneumonia while in New York City during the 1918 flu pandemic. John died on January 14, 1920, at the Ritz-Carlton, aged 55. He was interred in the Egyptian-style family mausoleum in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery guarded by two Sphinx statues."
"Horace died the following December, and in 1925 their widows sold the Dodge Brothers automobile business to Dillon Read, investment bankers, for $146 million (equivalent to $ in ). Dodge's newborn daughter Anna Margaret died of the measles before age five. His son Daniel drowned in the waters off Manitoulin Island after falling overboard while being transported to hospital following an accident involving dynamite. He had just recently married, at age 21."
"After Dodge's death, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and adopted two children with him, Richard and Barbara Wilson. Matilda Dodge Wilson was Lieutenant Governor of Michigan briefly in 1940 under Republican Governor Luren Dickinson."
"In 1957, the Wilsons donated their Meadow Brook Farm, including Meadow Brook Hall, Sunset Terrace and all its other buildings and collections, along with $2 million (equivalent to $ in ), to Michigan State University to establish an extension campus. In 1963, the Michigan State University-Oakland was renamed Oakland University."
= = = Nachman Goldstein = = =
"Nachman Goldstein of Tcherin (1825 – 1894), also known as the Tcheriner Rav (rabbi of Tcherin, a town in eastern Ukraine), was a leading disciple of Nathan of Breslov (known as ""Reb Noson""), who in turn was the chief disciple of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic dynasty."
"A child prodigy who excelled in his Torah studies even as a young boy, Goldstein was the grandson of Rabbi Aharon, the chief rabbi of Breslov in Rebbe Nachman's day, and the son of Rabbi Zvi Aryeh, the succeeding rabbi of Breslov. He grew up in the town of Breslov. However, in his youth he shied away from Reb Noson. Once Reb Noson said to him, ""Nachman, who knows? Maybe the reason Rebbe Nachman worked so hard to bring your grandfather to Breslav was because of ""you""?"" After that, Goldstein became a follower of Reb Noson, and after the latter's death, became very involved with Reb Noson's works."
"Goldstein raised his daughter's son, Abraham Sternhartz, after the latter was orphaned of his parents as a young child. As the grandson of Reb Noson's leading disciple and at the same time a great-grandson of Noson through his father's line, Sternhartz was privy to all the family traditions and stories about Rebbe Nachman's closest disciple. These formed the basis for his definitive collection of Breslov oral traditions, entitled ""Tovot Zichronot""."
"Yulia Vladimirovna Barsukova (, born 31 December 1978) is a Russian retired individual rhythmic gymnast. She is the 2000 Olympic champion in the All-Around, the 2000 Grand Prix Final All-around champion, the 1999 World All-around bronze medalist, 2000 European All-around bronze medalist and 1999 Grand Prix Final All-around bronze medalist."
"Barsukova began figure skating at age five in the Izmaylovo District of Moscow where she lived. When she was eight years old, she passed a sports club and saw girls practicing rhythmic gymnastics through the window. Her father soon enrolled her in the sport. After three years, she moved to Tagansky District high school's rhythmic gymnastics department."
"Barsukova was coached by Vera Silaeva until she was sixteen, when Silaeva took her student to Russia's head coach, Irina Viner. Viner was unimpressed initially but accepted her at the urging of Russia's national team choreographer, Veronica Shatkova."
"Barsukova began competing at international competitions following the coaching change. For six years she competed under the shadow of other Russian gymnasts, Yanina Batyrchina, Amina Zaripova, Natalia Lipkovskaya and then Alina Kabaeva. Barsukova considered quitting rhythmic gymnastics until Viner persuaded her to stay and be patient. She had her breakthrough in 1998. During an event dedicated to the 15th anniversary of Ballet Magazine, Barsukova performed along with the stars of the theater. She performed her ""Dying Swan"" ball routine and received the unofficial title of ""Miss Bolshoi Theater""."
"Barsukova won many rhythmic gymnastics titles after her emergence in major competitions as a second member of the Russian team. She won gold in hoop at the 2000 World Cup Final in Glasgow and then gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics after a hoop fumble by then-World champion, Alina Kabaeva. She was the 2000 European All-around bronze medalist and won the rope final at the 2000 European Championships (9.983). She was the oldest Olympic champion in rhythmic gymnastics—21 years, 8 months and 27 days—until fellow Russian Evgenia Kanaeva won her second gold medal at London 2012 being aged 22 years, 4 months and 7 days."
"After the Olympics, Barsukova won the all-around title at the Grand Prix Final in Deventer where she also won gold in ball, rope and ribbon final. She retired from competition following the 2000 Aeon Cup. She has participated in Russia's Channel One project ""Stars on Ice""."
"On February 15, 2015, a star-studded gala was held in Russia for the 80th founding anniversary of Rhythmic Gymnastics. The venue was held in the historical Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg.

"In 2010, the provincial government named the entire highway Mabel and Alexander Graham Bell Way in honour of Mabel Gardiner Hubbard and her husband Alexander Graham Bell, who resided and are buried at Beinn Bhreagh near Baddeck."
"The highway travels northeast from Port Hastings along the base of a group of mountains known as ""The Big Ridge"" to Whycocomagh. It then follows the north shore of Bras d'Or Lake, bypassing Baddeck on a short Super two controlled access segment. Still running in a general northeast direction, at St. Anns the highway begins ascending the west slope of Kelly's Mountain on the Cape Dauphin Peninsula. Highway 105 descends the east slope of Kelly's Mountain using a series of sharp turns including a 180° hairpin turn at New Harris Forks before crossing the Great Bras d'Or Channel of Bras d'Or Lake on the Seal Island Bridge. The road crosses Boularderie Island using another short Super two controlled access segment and then runs southeast as an uncontrolled access road through the villages of Bras d'Or and Florence. Highway 105 regains controlled access for the final to its eastern terminus at the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal in North Sydney where travellers can continue to Newfoundland."
"With some minor exceptions noted above, the highway is two lanes and uncontrolled access. In addition, there are two intersections controlled by traffic lights in Florence."
"The Cabot Trail, which is usually used to describe a different road, is signed along a portion of Highway 105 between Nyanza and St. Anns so that the signed route forms a loop."
"Highway 105 is descended from the former Trunk 5, which no longer exists; Highway 105 follows the old Trunk 5 alignment, using present Routes 205, 305 and roads named after it to serve areas bypassed by Highway 105. The 105 name was applied in 1964<br>"
"Trunk 5 was a provincial trunk road in Victoria County and the Cape Breton Regional Municipality between Boularderie East and Millville Boularderie on Boularderie Island in Nova Scotia. The route, known as Millville Highway, was the main highway before Nova Scotia Highway 105 opened. It originally extended from Sydney River to Port Hawkesbury.

"Tracey Lee Wickham (born 24 November 1962 in Rosebud, Victoria) is an Australian former middle distance swimmer. Wickham was the World Champion for the 400 m and 800 m freestyle in 1978, and won gold in both events at the 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. She is a former world record holder for the 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m freestyle. Despite her success in the pool, Wickham has battled hardship and personal tragedy throughout her life."
"Wickham began swimming at the age of eight at John Rigby’s pool in Brisbane and mastered her technique under the guidance of Peter Diamond. At the age of thirteen, she was selected to be on the Australian team for the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games but failed to reach the finals at that meet."
"In 1977, Wickham’s family moved to California, where she trained for six months with coaching legend Mark Schubert. She returned to Brisbane at the end of 1977 and she came under the guidance of coach Bill Sweetenham at the Commercial Swimming Club. On 8 February 1978, Wickham broke her first world record, the 1500 m freestyle, in a solo swim at the Fortitude Valley Pool in Brisbane, clocking 16:14.93."
"At the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Wickham won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle. That same year, she set world records in both events, and won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1978 Berlin World Championships, setting a world 400 m record of 4.06.28, which stood as the Championship record until 2007. Both world records stood until 1987, long after her retirement."
"In 1980, Australia decided against an official boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. A number of Australian athletes elected to boycott the Games personally. Wickham maintains that she withdrew from the team because of illness, as she was suffering glandular fever at the time, not because of the boycott. The 800 m freestyle was won by fellow Australian Michelle Ford at that meet."
"Wickham retired at the end of 1979 due to financial problems. The policy of amateurism was upheld by the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia during this period, meaning Wickham could neither earn money from the sport nor receive any prizes."
"Wickham returned to swimming in the early 1980s under coach Laurie Lawrence. She won gold in the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where she took the Athletes Oath at the Opening Ceremony. Her gold medal for the 400 m was presented to her by Queen Elizabeth II and Wickham retired from swimming immediately afterwards."
"Following the birth of her daughter, Wickham dived back into the water in May 1990, again with Lawrence as her coach. She competed in the 7.6 km open water race from Magnetic Island to Townsville, placing first in the female division. She also won the female division of the Lake Trasimeno 20 km marathon race. She retired for good following the birth of her son in January 1992."
"She was educated at the All Hallows' School, in Brisbane along with her sisters Julie and Kelly. Wickham married in 1986 and had two children, Daniel and Hannah. She divorced her husband in the mid-1990s."
"Her daughter, Hannah, died at the age of nineteen from synovial sarcoma on 2 October 2007. Wickham is an ambassador for Hannah’s Chance Foundation, which supports teenage cancer victims."
"On 30 December 1978, Wickham was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire."
"On 10 December 1985, she was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale in 1992."
"On 25 October 2000, she was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for outstanding contribution as a competitor in swimming."
"On 13 June 2005, she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to Australian swimming and to the development of young swimmers through teaching and coaching roles."

= = = Tarr = = =
"Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 1909–11, revised and expanded in 1914–15 and first serialized in the magazine ""The Egoist"" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regards—especially in its English form—as a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Lewis will later clarify that there ""is laughter and laughter. That of true satire is as it were tragic laughter"". Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis' own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler."
"The American first edition used a punctuation mark (resembling an equals sign: '=') between sentences (after full stops, exclamation marks or question marks; in the earlier ""Egoist"" version it had been an m-dash). It has been claimed that these were an attempt by Lewis, an artist, to introduce 'painterly strokes' into literature. This has, however, been disputed by Dr. John Constable, who believes that they are nothing more than a German punctuation mark briefly adopted by Lewis. Lewis himself wrote to Ezra Pound about this when reconstructing missing parts of the manuscript for the U.S. edition: ""Were those parallel lines = Quinn mentions kept going by the Egoist, or not? Could not they be disinterred, & used by Knopf?"" (Lewis to Pound, October 1917). Evidently not all were disinterred, as large stretches of the book as published are without them."
"Both the 1918 and 1928 versions of the novel have been in and out of print since its original publication. Oxford University Press has reissued the 1928 text, edited and with notes by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University, as part of its Oxford World Classics paperback series in 2010."

"Tony Lynn Brackens, Jr. (born December 26, 1974) is a former American college and professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He played college football for the University of Texas, and earned All-American honors. A second-round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, he played for the Jacksonville Jaguars for his entire pro football career."
"Brackens was born and raised in Fairfield, Texas. He attended Fairfield High School, and played for the Fairfield Eagles high school football team."
"Brackens attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he played for the Texas Longhorns football team from 1992 to 1995. He developed a reputation as a ferocious hitter as a defensive end. As senior in 1995, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and was also a first-team All-Southwest Conference selection. He finished his career ranked eighth on the Longhorns' all-time list with 24 sacks. He was also a key contributor to the 1995 Longhorns team that went 10-1 and won the Southwest Conference and gained a berth in the 1996 Sugar Bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies."
"He was taken in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars, for whom he played his entire professional career. His lone Pro Bowl appearance came in 2000, after the 1999 season in which he had 12 sacks and 8 forced fumbles. As of 2011, he held the all-time Jacksonville Jaguars records for several categories: sacks (55), fumble recoveries (13) and forced fumbles (28). He is also the leading tackler (all-time) among Jaguars defensive ends."
"He was released in 2004, after a series of troubling leg injuries and operations. About his release, Brackens stated, ""Mentally and physically, I thought I could probably still do it, but I didn’t want to put up with all the rule changes. All the stuff they’re doing to players takes the fun out of the game."" The moment in which he was let go was captured by NFL Films in ""Jacksonville Jaguars: Inside the Training Camp"", an unofficial version of the Hard Knocks TV series."

"The Bhagavad Guitars were an indie-rock band which formed in 1985 as Inner Circle in Canberra by Jeremy Butterworth on guitar and vocals, Kynan Hughes on bass guitar and Matt Kerr on drums and John Kilbey (under the pseudonym, John Underwood, for their first three releases to distance himself from brother Steve Kilbey and his band, the Church) on guitar and vocals. Hughes was replaced successively by Adrian Workman and then by Tony Locke. They recorded three 12 inch extended plays for Red Eye before recording a studio album, ""Introversion"", in 1991 which was shelved due to record company disputes until July 1996. Meanwhile, they issued their first album, ""Hypnotised"", in May 1992 via Karmic Hit/Shock, and disbanded in 1998. The group reformed in 2008 to record a new album, ""Unfamiliar Places"", released in May 2011."
"The Bhagavad Guitars were formed in 1985 as Inner Circle in Canberra by Jeremy Butterworth on guitar, vocals and flute, John Underwood (a.k.a. John Kilbey) on guitar and vocals, Kynan Hughes on bass guitar and Matt Kerr on drums. As teenagers they had played together in a band while students at Dickson College. In 1987 they relocated to Sydney and renamed themselves, the new name, ""was derived from a pun on the title of the Hindu book ""Bhagavad Gita""."" Butterworth later reflected, ""We started off seriously interested in Eastern thinking, different philosophies, meditation... etc but now we're more cynical."""
"In July 1988 they released their debut five-track extended play, ""Foreverglades"", which was produced by the Church's Steve Kilbey (Underwood's older brother) for Red Eye Records. Its ""featured track, 'Just to Be Sure' became a radio hit in Sydney."" They followed in October with a six-track EP, ""Headland"", where Hughes had been replaced on bass guitar by Adrian Workman."
"Red Eye compiled the two EPs, leaving off ""Shrine"" from ""Headland"", into a full-length album, also titled, ""Foreverglades"", in July 1990. They followed with a third EP, ""Party"", with six tracks, in October of that year. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed, ""The band's brand of spacious, chiming guitar-based pop called to mind the likes of The Crystal Set, The Church and UK band Simple Minds."""
"The group's album, ""Introversion"", was recorded in 1991 but did not appear until July 1996 on Karmic Hit/Shock Records. It included, ""a bonus 14-minute CD EP ""Extraversion""."" In 1992 Kilbey formed a record label, Karmic Hit, which issued the group's single, ""Hypnotise Me"" in February. They followed with their first studio album, ""Hypnotised"", in May 1992 with Tony Locke on bass guitar and lead vocals for two tracks, ""Romeo Error"" and ""Accident""."
"After the Bhagavad Guitars separated, Kilbey released three solo albums, ""Nothing More Than Something to Wear"" (February 2003) as John Kilbey, ""Catching Some Z's"" (2004) as J.L.K. and ""Good Fortunes"" (March 1999) by the Penny Drops.

"As a divisional point, Biscotasing did not last much beyond the era of construction, as Chapleau, about midway between Sudbury and Lake Superior, was selected to replace it. Soon after, the town lost its importance as a railroad town but still existed as a quiet fur trading town. The railway provided an inland access point to waterways flowing south to Lake Huron and north to James Bay, and the town subsequently developed as a centre for Indian trade in the region."
"The local water routes also helped to develop Biscotasing as a major centre for lumbering. In 1884, Public Lands Surveyor James Allan noted that timber in the area had been overrun by fires and was of very little value, consisting mostly of scrubby spruce and small pitch pine. The same year a sawmill was in operation at Biscotasing, mostly to serve the requirements of CPR construction."
"The first permanent sawmill was established by Sadler and O'Neil in the early 1890s. Robert Booth and Patrick Shannon, were also actively logging this region from 1895. Booth and Shannon produced square timber, which was taken by CPR to Papineauville for export to Britain, from the Port of Quebec in Quebec. By 1903 Booth and Shannon were the only lumber producers in Biscotasing, possibly having taken over and expanding the O'Neil mill which closed in 1898."
"The original Booth and Shannon mill was destroyed by fire 1913-06-13. It was subsequently rebuilt, at which time Robert Booth left the partnership, with Patrick's son, the firm was reorganized as P. & G. Shannon. In 1923 the mill was sold to Midland lumbermen Pratt and Shanacy. The mill closed in 1927 for lack of timber. The mill was dismantled and removed by 1938."
"Many of the old buildings in Biscotasing that survive today are from the sawmill era. A small steam locomotive, once used to switch cars of lumber from the mill to the lumber piling grounds, sat for many years, derelict on the mill property, across the tracks, opposite the Pratt and Shanacy company store. In 1958, David L. Pratt, of Toronto donated his father's steam engine for display at the Algonquin Provincial Park Logging Museum."
"From railway construction camp, to fur trade depot and lumbering centre, in 1922 Biscotasing became the first place in Northern Ontario to use aircraft (Curtiss NC) for forest fire surveillance."

"Before Frio went to sleep, he read a Tales legend again. But this one ended strangely: the hero arrives too late and the world is destroyed."
"When Frio and Kyaro wake up, they find out the machine has been stolen. Not long after they find out, a re-color of the machine appears. The one boarding it was Dr. White, Dr. Brown from 100 days into the future whose hair had turned white from extreme stress."
"There are thieves who are ruining the timeline of the Tales legends, and they have to be stopped. Dr. White now needs Frio and Kyaro to help stop the thieves and brings with him the aid of the heroes from Tales of Symphonia, Destiny, and Eternia."
"Tales of the World: Narikiri Dungeon 3 is a turn-based tactical RPG as well as a real-time RPG. Battles take place in enclosed areas that include ally parties and enemy units. Players move parties (consisting of three characters each) by selecting the sprite of the party's player-controlled character, and selecting the target location on the map. The limit of where the party can travel is indicated by dots between the target destination and the starting point of the party. When the dots are gray, the party can move to that location, as long as an obstacle does not block him/her. If it is red, then the target is out of range. The player can alter the destination of the party at any time during the player's turn. When the player ends the turn, all ally parties will move simultaneously. When one of the players' parties comes in contact with an enemy party, the player engages in a LMBS-style battle. In a typical RPG fashion, players level up their party members to gain stat increases. Like many Tales games, Narikiri Dungeon 3 includes the aspect of cooking: players can use acquired ingredients to prepare meals that affect party members, like replenishing HP, or temporarily gaining a certain stat in battle."

"""Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress"" (also titled ""Long Cool Woman"" or ""Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)"") is a song written by Allan Clarke, Roger Cook, and Roger Greenaway and performed by the British rock group The Hollies. Originally appearing on the album ""Distant Light"", it was released as a single on 17 April 1972 (on Parlophone in the United Kingdom), selling 1.5 million copies in the United States and two million worldwide. It reached No. 2 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 in September 1972. ""Billboard"" ranked it as the No. 24 song for 1972."
"On the day ""Long Cool Woman"" was recorded at AIR Studios, the group's producer, Ron Richards, was ill and, as a result, the song was produced by the group. The song is different from most other Hollies songs in that there are no three-part vocal harmonies, and the song features lead guitar and lead vocal work by Allan Clarke. Upon his return, Ron Richards mixed the recording."
"The song was written in the swamp rock style of Creedence Clearwater Revival, in terms of the vocal, rhythm, and melodic style. It came out in the spring of 1972 (the same year Creedence split up). Clarke imitated John Fogerty's vocal style, which was based on the Creedence song ""Green River"". According to Clarke, the song was written ""in about five minutes""."
"In the Hollies' native United Kingdom, the song was only a modest success for the band, peaking at number 32 on the charts. However, it was a smash hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 for two weeks behind Gilbert O'Sullivan’s ""Alone Again (Naturally)"". It was their highest charting single in that country. It also topped the charts in South Africa and peaked at number 2 in New Zealand and Australia. By this time, Clarke had already left the band, but he feels that ""it wasn't unfortunate"", since he had co-written the song. Clarke rejoined the Hollies in the summer of 1973, partly due to the success of this song."

After postings to various units, he served as the colonel of his old unit, the 9th Cavalry, for a year before retiring from the army in 1912."

"Ernesto Carlos Tornquist (31 December 1842 – 17 June 1908) was an Argentinian entrepreneur and businessman, considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century. The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world. Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in Buenos Aires, the partido of Tornquist and Tornquist its main city, in the south of Buenos Aires Province."
"Born in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a Lutheran born in Baltimore, United States and whose parents came from a German family in the city of Hamburg with roots in Karlskrona in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of Bremen in Montevideo, Uruguay, and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a Catholic, was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of yellow fever in 1871."
"Tornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evangélica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of Krefeld for two years. On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which exported wool and leather and imported agricultural machinery. In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law’s company which was now renamed, ""Ernesto Tornquist y Cia"". With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries. The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios, previously occupied by Indians. In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, ""Refineria Argentina"", in Rosario. Other initiatives included founding the ""Bieckert"" brewery, the ""Seeber"" margarine manufacturer and the ""Bianchetti"" scale manufacturer."
"On 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province. From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and Volga German immigrants. After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company ""Sansinena"" and its cold-storage plant ""La Negra"" in Riachuelo and set up the plant ""Cuartreros"" in Bahía Blanca."
"Amongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the South Georgia Islands through the ""Compañía Argentina de Pesca"", oil exploration in Mendoza, the exploitation of quebracho in Santiago del Estero and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital."
"Ernesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between Argentina and Chile in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister Estanislao Zeballos. He represented the German armaments group Krupp in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil."
"In 1903 he built the estancia, ""Sierra de la Ventana"", in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect Carlos Nordmann in Gothic style typical of German castles in the Rhine Valley. The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, Carlos Thays."
He maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents Julio A. Roca and Carlos Pellegrini and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of José Figueroa Alcorta (1906-1910).
"In 1909 he built the Plaza Hotel (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking Plaza San Martin in Buenos Aires."
He died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.

In the past I have heard that Han law stipulates that executions of men be carried out in the city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, I request to Zhaling [the tomb of the previous Tang emperor Taizong] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire."
"Gaozong received Helu's plea and agreed to his request, despite a Tang law ordering the execution of captured rebel generals and kings. In accordance with Confucian rituals, he was sent to Taizong's tomb where Gaozong spared his life, and then to the capital's Ancestral Temple where the captive was presented again, mirroring ancient rituals celebrating victorious armies. Helu felt disgraced by Taizong and committed suicide a year later while still in captivity. He was buried in a mound decorated with a stele outside the emperor's park. The tomb served as a military trophy, visible to the emperor's visitors entering the park, symbolizing the loyalty of the qaghan to the emperor and the Tang military victories against the Western Turks."
"The conquest strengthened Tang rule over modern Xinjiang, administered by the Anxi Protectorate, and led to Tang suzerainty over the regions previously under the control of the Western Turks. The fall of the Khaganate brought the Altai Mountain region under Tang control and the residing Three Qarluq tribes were governed in newly established prefectures led by tribal chiefs, now commander-in-chiefs under the Tang. Another prefecture, the Jinman Bridle Prefecture, was created for the Chuyue tribes living in the southern Dzungar basin. The Amu Darya valley, the Tarim Basin, and the area beyond the Pamir Mountains, all former suzerains of the Western Turks, were placed under Tang control."
"Su continued his career as military general, and later commanded Tang forces in a war against Baekje in 660. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent following its conquest of the Khaganate. The inhabitants of the new territory did not become sinicized like many of the other kingdoms and tribes conquered by the Tang. Tang military activity in Central Asia brought in a wave of Turkic migrants serving in the Tang military as soldiers and generals, leading to the spread of Turkic language and culture. At the same time, the prevalence of Indo-European languages in the Western Regions was on the decline. Central Asia also absorbed cultural influences from Tang China. Central Asian art incorporated Tang stylistic features, like the sancai three color glaze used in pottery. Chinese coins remained in circulation in Xinjiang after the decline of the Tang. Cultural remnants of Tang architectural influence are still visible in the Buddhist architecture of Dunhuang, on the border between the Western Regions and the Hexi Corridor."
"The sheer size of the newly conquered lands made it difficult to govern through the Tang military garrisons. The Tang emperor Gaozong appointed two puppet qaghans to rule over the Western Turks, who were later overthrown in a rebellion that began in 662. The revolt reduced Tang's western extent to Beshbalik, Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang and ended direct Tang control of Central Asia beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire from the south threatened China's hold on southern Xinjiang. Tibet invaded the Tarim Basin in 670, but Tang forces regained the area in 693 and Kashgar in 728, restoring the Anxi Protectorate and Four Garrisons. The conflict between Tibet and the Tang continued for the remainder of the Tang Dynasty."
"At its maximum extent, Tang expansion brought China into direct contact with the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Aksu in 717 and the Battle of Talas in 751. Though victorious in 717, the Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world."
"The Tang emperor Gaozong installed two puppet qaghans, the cousins Ashina Buzhen and Ashina Mishe, and controlled the region by proxy. Buzhen and Mishe were enemies of Helu who had aided Su Dingfang during his campaign against Helu and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Gaozong divided the ten tribes of the area among the two cousins. Buzhen governed half of the tribes located in the west, while Mishe governed the other half located in the east."
"The son of Buzhen, Khusrau, and the son of Mishe, Yuanqing, resided in Chang'an, the capital of Tang, while their fathers administered the former khaganate as qaghans. Empress Wu Zetian sent Yuanqing and Kusrau westward in 685 to succeed their fathers as proxy rulers."
"Neither of the qaghans were able to successfully exert control. Turkic tribes resisted Yuanqing's rule, defeating the qaghan and forcing Yuanqing to return to Chang'an. Kusrau was able to bring the western tribes temporarily under his rule, but was defeated in 690 during an invasion by the Second Turkic Khaganate, and he too was forced to escape the region with his loyalists. Later attempts to install puppet qaghans failed, and the title was reduced to a symbolic position in the Tang court."

"In Hungarian mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of Attila the Hun and ancestor of the Hungarians, is supposed to ride down the Milky Way when the Székelys (ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called ""The Road of the Warriors"" (lit. ""Road of Armies"") . The stars are sparks from their horseshoes."
"To the Māori the Milky Way is the waka (canoe) of Tama-rereti. The front and back of the canoe are Orion and Scorpius, while the Southern Cross and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out onto a lake, he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the Taniwha would attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) and scattered shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, Ranginui, was pleased by this action and placed the canoe into the sky as well as a reminder of how the stars were made."
"The Kaurna Aboriginal people of the Adelaide Plains in South Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river in the sky world. They called it Wodliparri (wodli = hut, house, parri = river) and believe that positioned along the river are a number of dwellings. In addition, the dark patches mark the dwelling place of a dangerous creature known as a ""yura""; the Kaurna call these patches Yurakauwe, which literally means ""monster water""."
Aboriginal groups from the Cape York region of Queensland see the band of light as termites that had been blown into the sky by the ancestral hero Burbuk Boon.
"Further south, the band of stars that comprise the Milky Way are seen as thousands of flying foxes carrying away a dancer known as Purupriggie."
The Aranda who come from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the sky world. This stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The stars to the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band represent a mixture of both.
"In the Kimberley area, Aborigines called the Milky Way ""Iowara"" and see in it the presence of a giant emu elongated."
= = = Dynkin system = = =
"A Dynkin system, named after Eugene Dynkin, is a collection of subsets of another universal set formula_1 satisfying a set of axioms weaker than those of σ-algebra. Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as λ-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system. These set families have applications in measure theory and probability."
"A major application of λ-systems is the π-λ theorem, see below."
"Let Ω be a nonempty set, and let formula_2 be a collection of subsets of Ω (i.e., formula_2 is a subset of the power set of Ω). Then formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
"Equivalently, formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
The second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check.
"An important fact is that a Dynkin system which is also a π-system (i.e., closed under finite intersections) is a σ-algebra. This can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under countable unions."
"Given any collection formula_16 of subsets of formula_1, there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted formula_18 which is minimal with respect to containing formula_19. That is, if formula_20 is any Dynkin system containing formula_19, then formula_22. formula_18 is called the Dynkin system generated by formula_16. Note formula_25. For another example, let formula_26 and formula_27; then formula_28."
"If formula_29 is a π-system and formula_2 is a Dynkin system with formula_31, then formula_32. In other words, the σ-algebra generated by formula_29 is contained in formula_2."
One application of Dynkin's π-λ theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure):
"Let (Ω, ""B"", ""λ"") be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets. Let μ be another measure on Ω satisfying μ[(""a"",""b"")] = ""b"" − ""a"", and let ""D"" be the family of sets ""S"" such that μ[S] = λ[S]. Let ""I"" = { (""a"",""b""),[""a"",""b""),(""a"",""b""],[""a"",""b""] : 0 < ""a"" ≤ ""b"" < 1 }, and observe that ""I"" is closed under finite intersections, that ""I"" ⊂ ""D"", and that ""B"" is the σ-algebra generated by ""I"". It may be shown that ""D"" satisfies the above conditions for a Dynkin-system. From Dynkin's π-λ Theorem it follows that ""D"" in fact includes all of ""B"", which is equivalent to showing that the Lebesgue measure is unique on ""B""."

Only galaxies with large-scale bars appear to have these grand-design inner disks — a spiral within a spiral. Models suggest that the gas in a bar can be funneled inwards, and then spiral into the center through the grand-design disk, where it can potentially fuel a central supermassive black hole (SMBH).

= = = Anita C. Hill = = =
Anita Carol Hill (born 1951) is a LGBT American minister in the Lutheran Church. She is one of the first ordained lesbian women in the church and became a pastor before the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) changed its policy on LGBT ministers.
"Hill was born in 1951 and was raised in the Roman Catholic faith in Shreveport, Louisiana. As a young adult, she lived in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, and became involved in the United Methodist Church. Hill attended Mississippi State University where she earned a bachelor's degree in science. Hill went on to gain a master's degree in religious studies and a master of divinity degree from United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and studied at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota."
"In the 1980s, Hill started out as a lay minister in the Saint Paul-Reformation Lutheran Church. By the 1990s, her congregation wanted her to be ordained despite rules against lesbian pastors in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) at the time. The church's head pastor, Paul Tidemann, created the goal for his church that it would have a non-celibate, openly gay minister by 1993. Hill was an open lesbian in a committed relationship. She was ordained on April 28, 2001, within the Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries but was later censured for her ordainment as an LGBT person. On September 18, 2010, she was formally inducted into the ELCA Clergy Roster. She left working at the church in 2012 and went on to fight a state constitutional amendment in her state which banned gay marriage."
In 2012 Hill joined ReconcilingWorks as regional director for the St. Paul area and later became its deputy director.
The Brandywine Valley Railroad is a class III railroad operating in Pennsylvania.
"It was established in 1981 by the Lukens Steel Company to operate trackage at Coatesville, Pennsylvania and the neighboring town of Modena. It was acquired, with the rest of the Lukens properties, by Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1998."
"The Brandywine Valley's main line was originally built by the Wilmington and Northern Railroad, largely following the Brandywine Creek, to connect Reading with Wilmington, Delaware. By the time of the Brandywine Valley's formation, the line had been abandoned north of Valley Station, just north of Coatesville. BVRY took over the line from this point, the site of an interchange with Amtrak's Keystone Corridor, south to Modena, below which the ex-W&N was owned by PennDOT and operated by a number of shortlines over the years."
"Under Bethlehem operation, BVRY took over operation of the Delaware Valley Railroad, then operating the remainder of the ex-Wilmington and Northern, in early 1999. This gave the railroad interchange access not only to Conrail at Coatesville (subsequently replaced by the Norfolk Southern Railway), but to CSX Transportation at the southern end of the line at Elsmere, Delaware. It also thus began to operate a connecting branch of the former Pennsylvania Railroad from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, on the W&N, to Nottingham."
"After the acquisition of Bethlehem Steel's assets by International Steel Group in 2003, Brandywine Valley began to scale back its operations. The ex-PRR line, also known as the Octoraro line, was taken over in that year by the Morristown and Erie Railroad. In 2005, the ex-W&N line south of Modena was turned over to the East Penn Railroad, reducing the Brandywine Valley to its original extent."
"With the merger of ISG in 2005, the railroad and steel plant were taken over by Mittal Steel Company, which became ArcelorMittal in 2006."
"= = = Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland = = ="
"Victor Frederick William Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland, (18 June 1897 – 30 July 1990), known as Victor Cavendish-Bentinck until 1980, was a British diplomat, businessman, and peer. He served as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee during the Second World War and was British Ambassador to Poland between 1945 and 1947."
"Cavendish-Bentinck was born in Marylebone, London on 18 June 1897. He was the second son of Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, whose father, George Cavendish-Bentinck, was a grandson of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. Although formally Victor Cavendish-Bentinck he was known informally as Bill. Like other members of his family he informally dispensed with the name ""Cavendish"", being known simply as Bill Bentinck. He was educated at Wellington College."
"Queen Elizabeth II is also descended from the 3rd Duke of Portland through her maternal grandmother Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. The Queen and the 9th Duke of Portland were third cousins, once removed."
"Cavendish-Bentinck did not pursue a university education, instead entering the diplomatic service in 1915 at the age of 18 before taking leave to fight with the Grenadier Guards in the First World War, returning to the Foreign Office in 1919. In 1922, he took charge of administrative arrangements for the Lausanne Conference. He served in the British Embassy in Paris and also in the League of Nations Department in the Foreign Office. Other postings included Athens in 1932 and Santiago in 1933. The high point of his diplomatic career came in 1939 when he was appointed chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. He managed to develop the body as a highly effective instrument of government and, as a result, became counsellor to the Services Liaison Department of the Foreign Office in 1942."
"However, he cast doubt on reports that were received regarding the Nazi genocide of the Jews. In late August 1943 the Polish Embassy in London informed the British government of the deportation and annihilation of hundreds of thousands of Jews from Lublin and Bialystok provinces. The chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, deplored Polish and Jewish information about atrocities. He wrote this information as an attempt to ‘stoke us up’ He added: ‘I feel certain that we are making a mistake in giving credence to this gas chamber story.’ This error of judgement makes his subsequent appointment as ambassador to Poland the more surprising."
"In 1945, Cavendish-Bentinck was given his final diplomatic posting on his appointment as Ambassador to Poland. When visiting the formerly German City of Stettin (Szczecin) in 1946 he was invited to talk to German civilians suffering from months of internment so their possessions and property could be taken over by Polish resettlers from territories lost to the USSR. Cavendish-Bentinck refused to do so, ignoring certain inhuman circumstances under which mainly old people, women and children had to suffer, by noting to his Polish hosts, he was ""convinced that they will complain as usual""."
"He held the position for two years before the Foreign Office applied to appoint him Ambassador to Brazil. He never took up the latter post, being obliged to resign from the Foreign Office, without a pension, as a result of the publicity surrounding his divorce. Bentinck's aristocratic background attracted press attention; Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, apparently sympathetic, remarked at that the time ""I could have saved him if his name had been Smith."""
"After his withdrawal from the diplomatic service, Cavendish-Bentinck embarked on a business career, becoming Vice-Chairman of the Committee of Industrial Interests in Germany. From this position, he was able to advance the interests of British companies such as Unilever. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group."
"In 1980 he succeeded his elder brother Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck as the 9th Duke of Portland. Upon his own death in 1990, the dukedom and the Marquessate of Titchfield became extinct because his only son had predeceased him and there were no other surviving male heirs of the 1st Duke. However, the earldom of Portland had been created in an earlier generation than the dukedom and there were surviving descendants in the male line to inherit it. That title was therefore inherited by his kinsman, Henry Noel Bentinck, who became 11th Earl of Portland, together with its subsidiary titles of Viscount Woodstock and Baron Cirencester. He was interred at the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Portland in the churchyard of St Winifred's Church at Holbeck."
"Bentick married Clothilde Bruce Quigley (died 1984), an American, on 16 February 1924. She was the daughter of James Bruce Quigley. They had two children together:"
Soon after World War II began Bentinck received a telephone call at his office from his Hungarian maid to tell him that his wife had left him and taken their children with her. They were finally divorced in 1948.
"Portland married secondly, Kathleen Elsie Barry (died 2004) on 27 July 1948. She was the daughter of Arthur Barry. This marriage produced one child:"

Running previously in the riding during the 2004 general election he received 794 votes (1.73%). Bender is self made, formerly operating Lady Godiva's in Woodstock, Ontario, as well as former operator of ""The Ganja Tree"" in Woodstock, Ontario. Bender has been involved in social protest for many years in several areas. He is a proponent of legal marijuana, regulated by the government with similar control and distribution mechanisms in place in order to stabilize the industry, removing it from the paradigm of criminality. At present he is working on a pesticide ban, the redirecting of a golf course, (in order to protect a wetland area) and is a member of the Trans National Radical Party which holds NGO in consultant status with the United Nations."
"Bender regularly contributes to many national and local newspapers as an opinion writer. He operates an online newspaper known as the ""Woodstock Ontario Independent News"".

"Mysterious Traveller is the fourth studio album by the jazz ensemble Weather Report and was released in 1974. This was their final recording with founding bassist Miroslav Vitouš, who left due to creative differences. Vitouš was replaced by Alphonso Johnson. Another addition to the line-up is drummer Ishmael Wilburn. Greg Errico was the drummer for the tour between the previously released ""Sweetnighter"" and this album, but declined an invitation to be a permanent member of the band."
"The record is the band's first that predominantly uses electric bass and incorporates liberal uses of funk, R&B grooves, and rock that would later be hallmarked as the band's ""signature"" sound. Also, the more restricted compositional format became evident on this album, replacing the more ""open improvisation"" formats used on the first three albums. It was voted as the album of the year by the readers of ""Down Beat"" for 1974, garnering Weather Report's second overall win in that category, also garnering a five-star review from that publication along the way."
"The album peaked at #2 in the ""Billboard"" Jazz album chart, #31 in the R&B album chart, and #46 in the ""Billboard"" 200 chart."
"Early copies of the album do not list ""Cucumber Slumber"" on the back cover or inner sleeve, and list ""Jungle Book"" as the final track of side one rather than side two. However, most known copies of the album include the seven tracks in the order listed above. One exception is the cassette release, with ""Blackthorn Rose"" as the second track of side one and ""American Tango"" as the second track of side two."
"The Mastersound SBM edition of ""Mysterious Traveller"" includes a previously unreleased song, ""Miroslav's Tune"", as a bonus track at the end of the album."

= = = Maria Taferl = = =
"Maria Taferl is an Austrian market municipality of 872 people in the District of Melk and the most important pilgrimage site in all of Lower Austria. After Mariazell, Maria Taferl is the most important pilgrimage destination in all of Austria."
"Maria Taferl is located in the Nibelungengau in Lower Austria on a bank over the Danube. 47.48 percent of the municipality is forested. As the Maria Taferl Market, which takes place on the so-called ""Taferlberg"" (""Taferl Mountain""), the remaining districts are found in the hilly surrounding area. To the south, the basilica is widely visible throughout the town."
"Little is known about the early settlement of Maria Taferl. The Celtic Kingdom of Noricum was located on the northern shore of the Danube. During Roman times, the Danube served as the border of the Province of Noricum. Even today in the church plaza, there is a stone of Celtic origin, on which heathen sacrifices were made. This attests to Maria Taferl's long tradition as a place of religious activity."
"Maria Taferl and the surrounding countryside belonged to the territory of the Ostarrichi during the time of the Bambergs in the Middle Ages. It then became part of the Habsburg holdings. For a long time, it was part of the land of the Lords of Weißenberg, whose seat lay in the nearby town of Münichreith. It is assumed that the various districts of the town were already established during the Middle Ages. The history of the modern market of Maria Taferl begins in the 17th century."
"The first church was built around a shrine to the Holy Mother, which is the origin of the name ""Maria Taferl."" The legends say that the statue of the Pietà at the shrine was an offering from Alexander Schinagel, a forester, who had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness. It replaced a crucifix there, which had also been the site of a miracle, for when local shepherd Thomas Pachmann tried to chop down the oak on which it was placed, he gravely injured both his legs. After a prayer to the Virgin Mary, his almost fatal wounds stopped bleeding. The old oak was destroyed by fire in 1755, which also damaged the statue."
The church building was built from 1660 to 1710. Its construction was begun under the imperial architect Georg Gerstenbrand and the Italian Carlo Lurago. Its famous cupola was built by Jakob Prandtauer from 1708 to 1710. He also designed the current appearance of Melk Abbey. The Maria Taferl church is built in the baroque style with ample amounts of gold leaf and a frescoed ceiling. In the center of the high altar is the namesake Marian stature. The building's rear houses its crypt.
"According to an inscription in the building's interior, the building of the church gave the local inhabitants new courage after the Plague, the Turkish Wars, and the Thirty Years' War had all taken their toll. It also supported the ideas of the Counter-Reformation in the heartland of the Catholic House of Habsburg. All this speaks to Maria Taferl as an important manifestation of the Catholic faith on the main traveling route of the Danube."
"There are many traditional stories of angelic processions here, which come from the 17th century. The tradition of pilgrimage to Maria Taferl also dates back to that time. In 1760 alone, there were 700 pilgrimage processions and over 19,000 masses said there. The church is also a kind of information treasure chest about its pilgrims, their origins, and their number. Within it are the gifts of the pilgrims, who came on account of illness and were cured. Another reason for Maria Taferl's importance as a pilgrimage destination was the stone cross, a gift from the citizens of Freistadt for pilgrims who died on the journey. It is also evidence of the exhausting nature of pilgrimage in those days. The murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his family lived in the nearby Artstetten Castle and is known to have regularly attended mass at Maria Taferl."
"Maria Taferl became a ""Basilica minor"" in 1947."
"By 2010, the basilica's interior should have undergone a complete restoration. It will then celebrate a double jubilee: 350 years since the laying of its cornerstone in 1660, and 300 years since its completion in 1710. The interior's last restoration was around 50 ago; the exterior was restored in 1982, and in 1998, the domes of the two towers were re-covered."
"Besides the basilica, in Maria Taferl there is also a monument for the Fallen of both World Wars. These men are honored annually at meeting of veteran's groups."
There is a folk belief that the water from the well at Maria Taferl can help with eye complaints.
"Other landmarks in the town are the Elementary School Museum, as well as the mechanical nativity, which tells the story of Maria Taferl's origins."
The municipality of Maria Taferl is divided into seven districts:
The mayor of Maria Taferl is Herbert Gruber and the Chief Officer is Daniela Lahmer. In the Municipal Council the 15 seats went to the following parties: ÖVP 10 and SPÖ 5.
"After agriculture, tourism is the most important economic activity in Maria Taferl."
"In his poetic anthology ""Al A'mal Ash-Shi'riyya"" (الأعمال الشعرية) and in preface to ""Blossoming Rose"" Tawfiq stated that he does not support poetry in prose, because it does not sound like a good verse, but at the same time Tawfiq insisted that he supported existence of this genre itself. Like other specialists of Arabic literature, Tawfiq knew the poetry of al-Mutanabbi. In his own verses Tawfiq appealed to al-Mutanabbi's qasidas and biography, using a lot of inter-textual elements. Also Tawfiq gave an estimate of al-Mutanabbi's panegyrics, raising the question of engagement of poetry and politics. Tawfiq compared al-Mutanabbi's panegyrics to Sayf al-Daula, with Mohamed Hassanein Heikal's essays to late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser."

"Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel, also known as Frederik Karel Albert Schreuel and Jan Christian Aelbert Schreuel (14 June 1773 – 1853), was a Dutch-born painter."
"Schreuel was born in Maastricht, the Netherlands, on 14 June 1773. He joined the Dutch military at a young age. He is recorded as painting by 1788 and eventually left the military to begin studying art, first in Berlin then, in 1805, in Dresden. He spent some time studying under Josef Grassi of the Dresden Academy and soon made a name for himself by painting portrait miniatures. One of his portraits, known from an oval engraving by C. Bolt, was of Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Schreuel would also copy works held at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. By 1840 he had been appointed a professor of painting by the King of Saxony."
"Schreuel is believed to have painted the portrait of the Javanese artist Raden Saleh, who was then studying in Europe, that is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The painting dates to before 1841, because Saleh is depicted dressed as a European dandy, not as a Javanese prince, which was how he dressed beginning in that year. The painting was first recorded at the Dresden Academy exhibition, at which it was a critical success. However, it has also been attributed to Saleh himself; in 2005 the Rijksmuseum was still referring to the work as a self-portrait. The pose is one traditional in self-portraits, and no other portraits by Schreuel are known to have survived, while the style of his miniatures is different; however, this would be the only unsigned painting by Saleh, he knew Schreuel (whom he called 'Schruil'), and the brushwork is freer than is characteristic of his work. According to the Tropenmuseum, they have the only known self-portrait by Saleh."

Zan Arbor, who has been conducting experiments in an attempt to break the Force into its constituent parts, is holding captive Qui-Gon Jinn and the elderly Jedi Master Noor R'aya. The three rescuers attempt to smuggle themselves into the laboratory; however, despite the fact that Qui-Gon has managed to free himself, Zan Arbor escapes with the unconscious Noor."
"Later, Obi-Wan receives a message informing him that his companion Astri Oddo, who went to pursue the bounty hunter Ona Nobis, is injured on the planet of Sorrus. Qui-Gon and Adi send their Padawans to Sorrus to bring Astri home, but Obi-Wan learns that this was merely a trap set by Ona Nobis, and wisely chooses to run away from a fight. He and Siri are ordered to return to the Jedi Temple, but he convinces Siri that they should look for Astri since she's on Sorrus. They are transported to the far desert and investigate a cave where they find Astri and her three companions tied up. However, the cave collapses — another trap set by Ona Nobis. The party are eventually rescued by a member of a tribe that Astri once helped. The two Padawans learn that Ona Nobis is headed to Belasco, the homeworld of Senator Uta S'orn, Jenna Zan Arbor's only friend."
"On Belasco, the Jedi discover that the population is suffering unusually severely from bacteria that recur in the drinking supply every seven years. They find Senator S'orn caring for sick children, but she wants nothing to do with the Jedi. Eventually, they discover that S'orn has altered Galactic Senate transcripts for Zan Arbor, and that Zan Arbor is likely on the planet. Suspecting that Zan Arbor has bioengineered the bacteria in order to make a profit selling a cure, the four Jedi infiltrate the water purification plant, obtaining dated water samples as evidence."
"Obi-Wan and Siri then follow Uta S'orn as she delivers dinner to patients at the royal grounds, in the hope that she will lead them to the hiding place of Zan Arbor and Ona Nobis. After seeing Ona Nobis eat dinner, they report back to their Masters, who confront the Leader of Belasco and ask that S'orn's quarters be searched. There, the Jedi find Jenna Zan Arbor, along with the captive Noor R'aya. Zan Arbor is quickly captured, but Obi-Wan notices that Siri has left the room, and he goes to search for her. He finds her cornered by Ona Nobis on the palace roof, and the two Padawans manage to hold off the wily bounty hunter.

"The Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy was a large, wide-bodied cargo aircraft built in the United States and used for ferrying outsized cargo items, most notably NASA's components of the Apollo program. The Pregnant Guppy was the first of the Guppy line of aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines. The design inspired other later designs, such as the jet-powered Airbus Beluga and Boeing Dreamlifter."
"In 1960, U.S. airlines were disposing of their obsolete piston-engined Boeing 377 Stratocruisers in favor of the newer jet-engined airliners. NASA was finding that barge transport of their increasingly large space program components from manufacturers on the West Coast to test and launch sites on the East Coast was slow and expensive. Aircraft broker Leo Mansdorf was stockpiling surplus Stratocruisers at Van Nuys prior to resale, and ex-USAF pilot John M. Conroy realized the potential of these aircraft to transport the large but relatively light rocket components."
"Conroy presented his plans for an extensively modified Stratocruiser to NASA, where an official commented that the bloated aircraft resembled a pregnant guppy. Although NASA was lukewarm on the concept, Conroy mortgaged his house and founded Aero Spacelines International to build and operate the concept aircraft."
"Conversion work was undertaken by On Mark Engineering. The Pregnant Guppy (registered N1024V) was built from an ex-Pan Am airframe with a five-m section from an ex-British Overseas Airways Corporation aircraft (G-AKGJ) added immediately behind the wing. The wing, engines, tail, nose, and cockpit were unchanged, but a new upper fuselage of 6 m diameter was added, giving the aircraft a ""triple-bubble"" appearance in front view. The entire rear section (including tail surfaces) was detachable to allow cargo to be loaded directly into the fuselage."
"The aircraft first flew on September 19, 1962, piloted by Conroy and co-pilot Clay Lacy. When Van Nuys traffic control realized that Conroy intended to take off, they notified police and fire departments to be on alert. However, the huge aircraft performed flawlessly, the only difference in handling being a slight decrease in speed caused by extra drag of the larger fuselage."
"Carrying the S-IV Saturn I rocket stage, the Guppy saved three weeks' transit time versus barge, for a cost of $16.00 (equivalent to $ today) per mile ()."
"In the summer of 1963, the Pregnant Guppy began flying NASA cargo. Among its early duties was transporting the first and second stages of the Gemini program's Titan II from the Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, to Cape Canaveral. As the space program grew through the late 1960s, this one aircraft clearly could not handle the whole transport load, so 25 more Stratocruisers and ex-USAF C-97s were purchased to construct four Super Guppy aircraft, which were even longer and larger than the original."
"The various Guppy aircraft served throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and beyond, initially transporting space components, and later, as NASA scaled down its operations after the success of the Apollo program, transporting airliner sections."
The Pregnant Guppy was sold to American Jet Industries and registered N126AJ for scrap and it was finally scrapped at Van Nuys in 1979.

"The great dodecahemicosacron is the dual of the great dodecahemicosahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the small dodecahemicosacron."
"Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called ""stellation to infinity"". However, he also suggested that strictly speaking they are not polyhedra because their construction does not conform to the usual definitions."

"Pagri or Phari (; ) is a town in Yadong County in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China near the border with Bhutan. the town had a population of 2,121. It is one of the highest towns in the world, being about above sea-level at the head of the Chumbi Valley."
"Thomas Manning, the first Englishman to reach Lhasa, visited Pagri from 21September until 5November 1811 and had this to say about his room in the town: ""Dirt, dirt, grease, smoke. Misery, but good mutton."" Pagri was of some military importance in the early 20th century when it was occupied by the British Tibet Expedition under Francis Younghusband in 1904. The Pagri Fortress (""Dzong"") was located here and was important for the government as it stood between Tibet and Bhutan. Pagri was a staging area en route to Gyantse and ultimately Lhasa."
"During the summer of 1912, the 13th Dalai Lama met Agvan Dorzhiev at Phari Dzong and then accompanied him to the Samding Monastery, before returning to Lhasa after his exile in India."
"Thubten Ngodup, the current Nechung Oracle, was born in Phari in 1957."
"The houses are mostly made of Tibetan traditional stone and wood. The Pagri Valley lies in an alpine steppe zone on the south side, with an average annual temperature , and an extreme maximum temperature of . Annual precipitation is about , snow and ice melt forming rich water resources, shrubs and meadows development, a good place for the development of animal husbandry. Pagri is rich in minerals, wild animals, plants, and tourism resources. It is also a trading centre but due to geographical location is prone to natural disasters. Summer flash floods, mudslides, winter avalanches, snowstorms, etc. are common, and poor facilities makes it vulnerable to disaster. During the rainy season, water levels rise causing serious flooding, reducing soil quality and arable land every year, damaging the ecological environment and a threat to the inhabitants of Pagri. To the northeast of Pagri is Mount Jomolhari."
"Owing to its extreme altitude, Pagri has an alpine climate (Köppen ""ETH"") that is too cold to permit the growth of trees, even though the altitude is still marginally too low for the formation of permafrost. Example Mount Fuji in Japan, Uelen in Russia and Longyearbyen in Svalbard Norway. The winter is severe in spite of the fact that no month has daytime maxima below , and also very dry and long, extending as late as May. Snowfall, however, is rare because of the dryness.

The feudal titles of Rainulf and Drogo of Hauteville, count of Apulia, were confirmed by the Emperor Henry III and they were made his direct vassals. Within a year, Trincanocte died and was succeeded by his infant son Herman under the regency of his cousin Richard, whom he had originally spurned, believing him to be a dangerous rival. Soon, Herman was displaced (or worse) and Richard was count."

"Halo: Spartan Assault is a 2013 twin stick shooter video game developed by 343 Industries and Vanguard Games. Part of the ""Halo"" media franchise, it was released on July 18, 2013, for Microsoft's Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 platforms. The game subsequently released on Xbox One, Xbox 360, Steam and iOS."
"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" is set between the events of ""Halo 3"" and ""Halo 4"". Players control the human soldiers Sarah Palmer and Edward Davis as they fight a splinter faction of the alien Covenant. The game launched with 25 single-player missions, with an additional campaign released as downloadable content. The console versions feature an exclusive cooperative horde mode."
"After years of rumored or cancelled handheld ""Halo"" projects, ""Spartan Assault"" was the franchise's first mobile game. The developers spent time adapting ""Halo""s distinctive elements to a touchscreen game meant to be played in short bursts. The game received mixed reviews on release, with the game praised for its success at pinpointing ""Halo""s aesthetic; the mobile versions of the game received lower average scores. ""Spartan Assault"" was followed by a sequel, """", in 2015."
"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" is a shooter game where players view gameplay from an overhead top-down perspective. The control method for the game depends on the host device. On touchscreen mobile devices, players control the character through virtual joysticks—the left stick controls movement and the right stick controls the direction of the character's fire—along with buttons along the edge of the screen. Xbox 360 and Xbox One players use a physical gamepad, while Windows players can use either a gamepad, or keyboard and mouse."
"The game features classic weapons and vehicles from the franchise. To assist players, many weapons auto-target enemies in the direction the player is firing."
"Gameplay of ""Halo: Spartan Assault"" earns the player experience points (XP), Achievements, and emblems for a ""Halo 4"" Spartan career."
"The Xbox 360 and the Xbox One versions of the game feature an additional cooperative game mode, designed to be different from that of the main campaign. Two players team up to survive against waves of enemy Flood."
"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" takes place in the 26th century between the events of ""Halo 3"" and ""Halo 4"". Following the events of ""Halo 3"", the human UNSC and alien Covenant separatists signed a ceasefire to end a decades-long war. Gameplay follows through the perspective of the Spartan supersoldiers Sarah Palmer or Spartan Davis. The campaign is divided into chapters, then further subdivided into individual missions."
"Spartans Palmer and Davis are stationed on the planet Draetheus V when it comes under attack from a rogue group of Covenant who have ignored the ceasefire. Palmer and Davis work to repel the invaders. This new Covenant leadership discovers that Draetheus' moon is actually a weapon built by an ancient race known as the Forerunners. The Covenant activates the weapon, tearing apart Draetheus and triggering an evacuation. Spartan Davis gives his life to allow the remaining human forces enough time to escape. Spartan Palmer tracks down the Covenant leader Merg Vol, kills him, sabotages the Forerunner weapon, and escapes the moon."
"In the Operation Hydra campaign, Spartan Palmer returns to X50 in search of a mysterious signal. She discovers that the signal is actually a distress signal from Spartan Davis. Palmer reaches the core of X50, but finds Davis dead; the moon is using his remains to create an unknown device, which Palmer extracts for study."
"Over the years, rumors swirled of a handheld or mobile version of ""Halo"" for the Game Boy Advance, Gizmondo, Ultra-Mobile PC, and Nintendo DS. Then-""Halo"" developer Bungie quashed speculation they were developing an Xbox Live Arcade title in 2006. When ""Halo"" overseer 343 Industries was interested in developing a mobile game, Franchise Development Director Frank O'Connor recommended an arcade shooter, having wanted for years to see a ""Halo"" game in the vein of ""Moon Patrol""."
"343 Industries Executive Producer Dan Ayoub described the challenge of adapting ""Halo"" for a portable device as crafting the right experience for the device. ""If we'd gone down the first-person shooter route, we might have built something compelling, but it couldn't on its own merit play as well as a traditional ""Halo"" game,"" O'Connor recalled. While focusing on optimizing the game for touch controls, the developers wanted to make sure the elements that made ""Halo"" distinctive—its weapon sandbox, abilities, and look—remained. The focus on a mobile game experience also meant that the developers broke up the game's missions into smaller chunks for short playthroughs. During development, the game was known by the codename ""Bootcamp""."
"Tom Salta composed ""Spartan Assault""s music. The game was the first time Salta had worked on a project where the sound had been established by another composer—Salta called the original music of Combat Evolved ""sacred ground for me"" and his inspiration to compose for video games. Previous to ""Spartan Assault"" Salta was part of the team that reorchestrated and recorded the music for """"."
"Because the game was designed to be played on mobile devices, Salta and the music team worked to make sure audio quality would be high on small mobile speakers as well as through headphones or higher-end hardware. Since there was a limited budget for the music, Salta chose which sounds and instruments he would record live. Salta starts composing on a keyboard and uses Logic."
"""Spartan Assault"" was released in North America and Europe on July 18 and 19, respectively. In the United States, the game was initially restricted to Verizon phones before being released to all Windows 8 enabled devices. An Xbox One version of the game released on December 24, 2013, followed by an Xbox 360 version on January 31, 2014. It was released on Steam on April 4, 2014, the first game in the series to be distributed on the platform. On April 16, 2015, the game was released for iOS.

"The Volkswagen Bratislava Plant is an automotive factory and co-located test track in Bratislava, Slovakia owned by Volkswagen Group."
"Funded by the ruling Communist Party to expand car production across Czechoslovakia, it agreed a partnership in 1969 with Italian automaker Alfa Romeo, but the proposed new-model was never developed beyond the clay-mock-up."
"On 1 July 1971, Bratislavské Automobilové Závody (BAZ) was founded, sub-contracted to produce Škoda Auto models, but with all pressings and parts supplied by the Czech-based partner. The factory began producing the Mladá Boleslav-designed 731 (saloon) and 732 (station wagon), as well as other BAZ marketed small (MNA) and medium-sized trucks (SNA). Later vehicles developed included the 3-door Locusta coupé."
"After developing a partnership with Tatra, the company also produced military vehicles, including the popular Praga V3S."
"BAZ vehicle production ended in 1982, when the production of the Škoda Garde was started, with the resultant development of the factory spurring the construction of new apartment blocks in the borough of Devínska Nová Ves. However, parts supply from the parent plant in the Czech Republic was slow, resulting often in a number of part-finished vehicles being held in storage, often awaiting singular parts. The factory later produced the Škoda Rapid 130/135/136, as well as a variety of parts for other car manufacturers in Czechoslovakia."
Some prototypes from BAZ can be seen in Museum of Transport in Bratislava.
"After the fall of the Iron Curtain, in May 1991 Volkswagen Group bought an 80% share of BAZ. Skoda Auto production continued, and was expanded to include other models within the VW Group portfolio, initially the Volkswagen Passat. In 1998 Volkswagen Group bought out the remaining company shares, and renamed the company Volkswagen Slovakia. Volkswagen then bought the remaining shares in Skoda Auto in 2000."
"Since VW developed their large SUV platform, the factory has become a specialist producer of all VW Group marques large SUV's, which presently include the Audi Q7 and the Volkswagen Touareg, and the co-designed Porsche Cayenne which is based on the same platform. It is also the only VW Group factory to produce the Golf Syncro four-wheel drive. Since December 2011 the factory has produced the VW up!, as well as the badge-engineered SEAT Mii and Škoda Citigo for European markets."
"The factory area of the plant currently covers an area of . Bodies are assembled and welded in one of two body shops, and then painted with one of 26 standard colours in the paint shop. The co-located Aggregate/Modules hall produces gearboxes for both on-site consumption and various models of the VW Group brands. The bodies are moved to the assembly hall, which covers an area equivalent to 21 football pitches, where the painted body is mated with the pre-assembled under-body and chassis. The VW Group and Porsche models then split."
"The Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Toureg and Up! variants are completed by installing the finishing components including wiring, wheels, seats and the steering wheel. The final assembled SUV is then transported via cable car to the co-located test track for a final on-road test. If the car then passes a further inspection, it is prepared for dealer delivery."
"Since 2016, the Bentley Bentayga has also been produced at Bratislava."
"DHL handle all shipping and distribution arrangements from the site, via railway (70%) or road. Aside from on-site body pressings, gearbox production, and various under-body and drive train components sourced from the Martin plant; 90% of parts are delivered to site from Volkswagen's component consolidation centre in Wolfsburg, Germany, shipped directly to site via 10 daily trains."
"First and second generation Porsche Cayenne models were sent direct to shipping once the body has been mated with under body. They were then shipped directly by rail to the Porsche factory in Leipzig, Germany, where interior fitting out, finishing and inspection were completed. Third generation Porsche Cayenne are being completely produced, and finished directly in Bratislava."

It is a popular tourist stop because of a colony of African penguins which settled there in 1982. Boulders Beach forms part of the Table Mountain National Park."
"These African penguins are only found on the coastlines of Southern Africa - (South Africa & Namibia). These penguins are currently on the verge of extinction. As a result, the penguins are under the protection of the Cape Nature Conservation."
"Although set in the midst of a residential area, it is one of the few sites where this vulnerable bird (""Spheniscus demersus"") can be observed at close range, wandering freely in a protected natural environment. From just two breeding pairs in 1982, the penguin colony has grown to about 3,000 birds in recent years. This is partly due to the reduction in commercial pelagic trawling in False Bay, which has increased the supply of pilchards and anchovy, which form part of the penguins' diet."

"Award miles can be earned on certain Deutsche Bahn trains, when staying in certain hotels, shopping in certain shops (such as the LH Worldshop), renting cars, investing in certain funds, opening an account with certain banks, picking up a catalogue in a Bang & Olufsen store, and others."
"For all offers see Miles & More website as offers vary between countries. However, all these offers do not earn any status miles."
"Once a member has collected the necessary number of miles, they can be used to buy flights, upgrades and products from the Lufthansa Worldshop (offer restricted to residents of some countries only)."
"Miles in a member's account can be exchanged for award flights on all the fully integrated airline partners and all of the Star Alliance carriers. The number of miles that is deducted from the account depends on the origin and destination of that flight. The number of miles that is required can be checked in this file. Additional fees and taxes will still apply for award flights (but can be paid by additional miles). Since the beginning of 2017, with “Cash & Miles” members have been able to use miles flexibly for their flights, and thus, to reduce the amount of money to be paid."
Lufthansa does add fuel surcharges hidden as fees on award tickets. This is prohibited for US based carriers. A transatlantic award flight (regardless which airline is actually flown) with Miles and More can cost up to 500 EUR in additional taxes and fees whereas the same itinerary booked with the US based Star Alliance partner (United) and their miles would cost less than 100 EUR in fees and taxes (even if the itinerary involves Lufthansa aircraft). So Miles and More may have a much lower value than US based Miles.
"In September 2016, Miles & More adjusted the flight award table, thereby reducing the international / national surcharge per flight distance for domestic European premium flights. Miles & More thereby takes over a part of the regular surcharge. Participants now pay €5 instead of €35 in economy classes and €20 instead of €43 in business class with Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SWISS and brussels airlines. The number of miles required for a flight award inside Europe was adjusted slightly, increasing by 5,000 award miles for return flights."
"Miles can be redeemed for upgrades on all fully integrated carriers of Miles & More and on the following Star-Alliance partners: All Nippon Airways (ANA), Asiana Airlines, Condor Airlines, Singapore Airlines, TAP Portugal, Thai Airways International, United Airlines. Again the number of miles required depends on the destination of the flight. The exact number is found on . Passengers are only allowed to upgrade one class of service. Only certain booking classes qualify for upgrades."
"Miles can be redeemed for rental car, hotel, shopping, banks & insurance, telecommunications & electronics industries etc. Moreover, the Miles & More GmbH also continues to expand its offers in relation to travel. The hotel booking portal Miles & More Hotels already makes it easier for users to book the accommodation they need quickly, giving members the opportunity to earn at least 1,000 miles per night or to redeem their miles. In addition to this, the Miles & More rental car service allows members to redeem miles to book rental cars. Avis car rental in US costs 47,000 miles at the minimum, finding a Hilton hotel and shorting the list based on miles is impossible, selection of hotels in Best Western is very limited (The hotels are available in Best Western but most of the hotels in the list in US are NOT available for miles)."
"Members of the programme also earn award miles when paying their purchases with their Miles & More credit card. Holders of the Miles & More Credit Card Gold benefit furthermore from unlimited mileage validity. Programme members use more than 1.4 million Miles & More Credit Cards in Germany and 22 additional countries, primarily in Europe, America and Asia."
On Miles & More all customers can build status through collecting status miles. The status miles from 1 year only count towards status. Status is important as there are many privileges and advantages that status holders receive (such as priority check-in).
There are four status levels on Miles & More:
"This is the normal status that everybody gets after they join the program. This status does not receive any officially documented privileges. A Miles & More member starts with a temporary paper-card, which is usually cut out from one of the Lufthansa magazines or printed from the internet; a plastic card is sent once the member has credited at least one award mile to their Miles & More account."
"The frequent traveller card is given to all Miles & More customers that received a total of over 35,000 status miles or had 30 flights. This status remains valid for two years and a member can requalify in any one of those two years. All status cards expire in February of the third year, i.e. if status is earned in November 2009, the status will be valid until February 2012."
As a frequent traveller a passenger receives a number of privileges:
"Having collected 100,000 Status Miles within one calendar year, Miles & More members will receive ""Senator"" Status with a validity of at least two years."
The main benefits of Senator status are:
"Having collected 600,000 HON Circle Miles within two calendar years, Miles & More members receive HON Circle Status with validity of two years."
The main perks of having HON status are:

"Kenneth McLaren DSO (sometimes known as Kenneth MacLaren), (1860–1924) was a Major in the 13th Hussars regiment of the British Army. After his military service he assisted with the growth of the Scouting movement founded by his friend Robert Baden-Powell."
"In 1898 McLaren married Leila Evelyn Landon, who died in 1904. He married Ethyl Mary Wilson in 1910 despite the advice of Baden-Powell, who considered her below his station."
"McLaren had schooled at Harrow and studied at Sandhurst before joining his regiment, the 13th Hussars in 1880. He was posted to India, where he served as regimental adjutant and later aide de camp to General Baker Russell. In South Africa he was gravely wounded at the Siege of Mafeking in March 1900, and taken prisoner by the Boers. He was created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1900."
"McLaren played polo throughout his military service, and was umpire of one of the two matches in the 1908 London Olympics."
"McLaren first met Baden-Powell (also a 13th Hussars officer) in 1881. Although McLaren was 20 at the time, Baden-Powell nicknamed him ""the Boy"", on account of his appearance. The two became fast friends, their relationship being one of the most important friendships in Baden-Powell's life."
"McLaren was recalled to military service in World War I, but retired again in 1915 due to ill-health."
"McLaren was one of the staff at Baden-Powell's Brownsea Island Scout camp in 1907. Baden-Powell convinced McLaren to be his first manager at the C. Arthur Pearson Limited office of ""The Scout"" magazine but McLaren resigned that position in March 1908."

"Baranof Warm Springs is a small, primarily seasonally-occupied community located in the city and borough of Sitka, Alaska, on the eastern side of Baranof Island, from which it likely derives its name, in the Alexander Archipelago. It is occasionally referred to simply as Baranof. Baranof Warm Springs is located at ."
"Baranof Warm Springs is located on Warm Springs Bay which is just off of Chatham Strait. Just about a half mile up from the settlement is Baranof Lake, a large glacially-fed freshwater lake. Baranof Lake is fed from small unnamed glacial run-off streams as well as the relatively large Baranof River. Between the half mile outlet between Baranof Lake and Warm Springs Bay there are a series of rapids and waterfalls that have proven to be lethal when run."
"Baranof Warm Springs is located on the southern part of a , exposure of a biotite-quartz diorite batholith that crosses northern Baranof Island."
"Baranof Warm Springs is a very small community, having only caretakers in the winter and intermittent visitors in the summer. There are around 15 seasonal homes. The community lies inside the jurisdiction of the City and Borough of Sitka. Other than property taxes and any dock fees from the new dock (2016) there is only one tax-paying commercial enterprise, the Baranof Wilderness Lodge and Resort. The city, in return, funds maintenance of a boardwalk which serves as the main thoroughfare as well as the dock for transient vessels. The community of property owners (BPOA- Baranof Property Owners Association) pools money together to pay for a seasonal (winter) caretaker for seasonally-inhabited residences, the city-owned picnic shelter (possible shelter for those needing it), the public bath house (which features three separate tubs), and the communal warm springs pools. Another caretaker is hired to tend to the Baranof Lodge from October 1 to May 1 when the owners of the Lodge return."
"Baranof Warm Springs was used frequently by the Tlingit of Angoon. People of western descent did not find the springs until 1891. It was serviced by a post office from 1907 through 1912, under the name of Baranoff."
"Baranof Warm Springs appeared on the U.S. Census twice as an unincorporated village. First in 1930 as Baranof with 25 residents and as ""Baronof"" in 1940 with 10 residents. It was later annexed into the City and Borough of Sitka."
"Baranof Warm Springs is accessible via floatplane with regularly scheduled flights leaving Sitka. The trans-island flight is 30 minutes on a clear day and an hour on an overcast one. The Alaska Marine Highway does not service Baranof Warm Springs and there is no scheduled ferry/marine passenger services to the community. Baranof Warm Springs itself does not feature any roads, and the boardwalk does not accommodate ATVs."
The primary attraction is the warm springs. There are a total of nine separate hot springs with temperatures from lukewarm to 120 degrees F. Only one is developed in a natural state and is located right up against the white water of the Baranof River. The community built a public bathhouse at the waterfront to provide an option for visitors not wanting to bathe communally and/or make the 1/4 mile hike up the trail to the natural springs.
"Small tour boats come in frequently in the summer, but also fishermen, and employees of the Hidden Falls Hatchery visit as well. The warm springs is also the terminus (or occasionally the trailhead) of the Baranof Cross-Island Trail. On the northern end of Baranof Lake there is also a Forest Service cabin that is quite popular. The cabin can only be reached by boat or float plane. The terrain is too steep to hike."
"Baranof Warm Springs is home to the Coastal Research and Education Center, a research base and educational facility operated seasonally by the Alaska Whale Foundation."

"In addition to the original variant, Just Born also markets ""Hot Tamales Fire"" (originally ""Super Hot Hot Tamales"") with a hotter flavor and darker color."
"In 2011, Just Born released ""Hot Tamales 3 ALARM"" containing a mix of three candies: orange (hot), pinkish (hotter) and dark red (hottest). In 2014, Just Born released ""Hot Tamales Tropical Heat"" that contains three candies, combining the original pungent, spicy flavor with lemon, mango and pineapple flavor."
"A spearmint version, Hot Tamales Ice, was marketed in the late 2000s, but was subsequently discontinued. It was reintroduced again in 2018 combined with the regular Hot Tamales and marketed as Hot Tamales Fire & Ice."
As listed on the original Hot Tamales box and Hot Tamales Fire boxes:
"Sugar, corn syrup, modified food starch, contains less than 0.5% of the following ingredients: dextrin, medium chain triglycerides, fruit juice from concentrate (pear, orange, strawberry, cherry, lime, lemon) sodium citrate, pectin, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, confectioners glaze, carnauba wax, white mineral oil, artificial flavors, artificial color, sodium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, red #3, red #40, yellow #5 (tartrazine), yellow #6, blue #1."

"SKEPP is an independent Belgian skeptical organization. The organization’s name is a backronym for ""Studiekring voor de Kritische Evaluatie van Pseudowetenschap en het Paranormale"" (""Study Circle for the Critical Evaluation of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal"")."
"SKEPP is a nonprofit organization emanated from the Belgian astronomical society, ""Vereniging voor Sterrenkunde"", and was founded in 1990 by, among others, Prof. Etienne Vermeersch, Prof. Willem Betz, Tim Trachet and Prof. Jean Paul Van Bendegem."
The goals of the organization are:
"SKEPP gets most of its funding from member fees. On the initiative of board member and former editor-in-chief Tom Schoepen, SKEPP has been publishing its own three-monthly magazine since 2000, ""Wonder en is gheen wonder"", a magazine for science and reason, which focuses on both pseudoscientific topics and topics related to the philosophy of science. The editors include Prof. Dr. Johan Braeckman (Ghent University), Dr. Griet Vandermassen (Ghent University), Geerdt Magiels and SKEPP founder Tim Trachet."
"In 2012, SKEPP hosted a series of lectures and discussions, featuring prominent scientists and philosophers, under the name Het Denkgelag, which has since grown out to become an independent non-profit that organises skeptical conferences. In 2015, SKEPP hosted the meant-to-be-yearly event ""Zomerschool Kritisch Denken"" (Summerschool Critical Thinking) aimed at educational professionals. Currently, SKEPP organises the monthly local editions of Skeptics in the Pub in Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven."
"Since 1996 SKEPP gives out annual awards to non-members: the ""Zesde vijs"" (the “Sixth Screw”) and the ""Skeptische Put"" (de “Skeptical Pit”)."
"The ""Zesde Vijs"" is awarded to ""someone who has distinguished themselves in the past year in spreading objective knowledge regarding pseudoscience and the paranormal, or who has made themselves noticed in the media by presenting a nuanced critical view or a thoroughly documented argumentation"". This prize has been awarded to, among others:"
"The ""Skeptische Put"" is awarded to ""someone who, according to SKEPP, has displayed exceptionally uncritical thinking and who has totally misunderstood the popularization of science and knowledge"". The ""Skeptische Put"" has been awarded to, among others:"
"Since its founding, SKEPP has become quite widely known via the Belgian media. They are often called upon to present their critical perspective on paranormal or pseudoscientific topics. In 2004 the organization made headlines when thirty skeptics at Ghent University conducted a “mass suicide” attempt by taking an overdose of homeopathically diluted snake venom, belladonna, and arsenic. The goal of this action was to demonstrate that homeopathic products contain no active ingredients. Additionally, the Belgian health insurance organization were accused of putting themselves above the law as commercial entities by reimbursing alternative treatments. According to SKEPP, by reimbursing alternative treatments, health insurance organizations will give the impression to the Belgian public that these are effective medications or treatments."
"In 2014, the Belgian court of appeal in Brussels proved SKEPP right against the appeal of the Dutch physician Robert Görter, who was called a quack by the organization in 2004."
"Since 1 October 2012 the organization has pledged to award the 1-million-euro ""Sisyphus prize"", to anyone who can demonstrate paranormal abilities under controlled conditions. This includes paranormal phenomena as well as homeopathy."
"The same challenge is also offered by various other European skeptical organizations and serves as the equivalent of the American One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which was offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation."
"As of 8 March 2014, its website describes the prize as ""the 25 000 euro prize"". Applying for the prize would cost 50 euro. It informs that ""the text and protocol are being rewritten and will soon be available again""."

"The Burgess Model I, also known as the ""Burgess I-Scout"" and the ""Coast Defense Hydroaeroplane"", was a United States reconnaissance seaplane built for the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps in 1913. It was of conventional Wright Model B design but with an engine mounted amidships in an enclosed fuselage, driving by chains two large pusher propellers mounted on the interplane struts. The undercarriage consisted of twin pontoons. The single example built, S.C. No. 17, was delivered to the Army in January 1913 at the Burgess Company and Curtis factory in Massachusetts, then transported to Florida to complete the training of two officers. After the assignment, it was disassembled and moved to the Philippines in September 1913, where it was in and out of service several times before crashing into the sea near Corregidor on January 12, 1915. It is notable as the first U.S. Army aircraft to conduct two-way radio communication with the ground in December 1914."
"The Burgess Model I was placed into service as Signal Corps Number 17 (S.C. No. 17) in January 1913 to complete the training of Lieutenants Loren H. Call and Eric L. Ellington at Palm Beach, Florida. Following this assignment it was disassembled and shipped by sea to the Philippine Aviation School near Manila, arriving in the first week of September. When it was uncrated for assembly, it was found to have been damaged so severely in transit that both its upper and lower wings needed replacing. 2d Lt. Herbert A. Dargue, a Coast Artillery officer trained as a pilot at the Philippine Aviation School, was detailed October 18 to fly the plane, based on the beach at San Jose on the south side of Corregidor in Manila Bay. After it was placed back into service in November 1913, it was found that center-of-gravity problems with its front-and-back seating arrangement and heavy pontoons made it incapable of taking off with two persons aboard. Dargue continued one-man operations and with a Coast Artillery officer devised a primitive method of signaling with small parachutes and a Very pistol to indicate misses."
"S.C. 17 was reconditioned by January 1914 with lighter pontoons that permitted two-man operation. Its hangar was supplied with a cement floor and a marine railway built down to the water to assist in launching the aircraft. The S.C. No. 17 participated in maneuvers with ground troops in February but was damaged during landing on February 20, and was out of service for a month. Between April 28 and May 15 it resumed adjusting fire for the Coast Artillery before going into storage for the rainy season."
"When he resumed flying activity in the fall of 1914, Dargue began testing a small radio transmitter-receiver built by a local unit, and was damaged again in October experimenting with antenna location. Ultimately a wire antenna was paid out behind the aircraft in flight from a reel. Further problems of engine noise, ignition interference, burnout of the signal detector by proximity of the transmitter, and loss of calibration from engine vibration were all overcome. On December 1, 1914, Dargue and 1st Lt. Joseph O. Mauborgne, the Signal Corps officer in charge of the Fort Mills radio station, began a series seven test flights of the radio. During the third, on December 11, the first two-way telegraphy communication with the ground was performed, at a range of for communication with the ground and for the return signal to the airplane, flying at an altitude of , the first radio signal received by an airplane. On the last flight, December 16, using a switch designed to alternate between receiving and transmitting modes, Mauborgne conducted the first airborne ""conversation"" with the ground."
"On January 12, 1915, Dargue and an enlisted spotter encountered strong winds over San Jose Bay. Dargue lost control attempting to avoid the cliffs on Corregidor, but was able to recover sufficiently to crash-land the plane tail first in the bay, causing a total loss. Because S.C. No. 17 was the only aircraft left in the Philippines, the Philippine Aviation School was closed and Dargue transferred back to San Diego, California."

= = = Chester Weir = = =
"Chester Weir is a weir which crosses the River Dee at Chester, Cheshire, England, slightly upstream from the Old Dee Bridge (). The weir and the associated salmon leap are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"This was originally the site of a causeway across the River Dee. The weir was built in sandstone in 1093 for Hugh Lupus, 1st Earl of Chester, for the Benedictine Abbey of St Werburgh (now Chester Cathedral). It was designed to provide a head of water for the medieval mills on the river. The mills were demolished during the 20th century and the weir was restored to serve the Chester City Council's hydro-electric power station, which operated from 1913 to 1939 on the site of the former mills."
The weir continues to provide three essential roles in maintaining the very substantial water abstractions from the River Dee. It prevents tidal water ingress up-river for all but the highest tides; it provides the water head for an abstraction immediately behind the weir and it holds back what is a long linear lake which enables that largest abstraction to be taken at Huntington for the United Utilities supply to the Wirral and surrounding areas.
"The weir can be navigated by crossing over the top during high spring tides. On the city-side of the weir is the United Kingdom's only example of a weirgate, a low height single lock gate that can be opened to provide extra draft once the water levels on each side of the weir have equalised. This allows carefully planned passage from the non-tidal River Dee, via the short tidal estuary section, onto the Dee Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal (originally the Chester Canal) at certain times of year."
"United Utilities are due to vacate the turbine building by 2013, allowing installation of a new hydro electric generating plant."

"The two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the interactive activation model (IAM) and the dual-route coding model (DRC) Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer’s conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing."
"The activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from lexical decision and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision. Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top-down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase ""A cow says..."" a person would guess ""moo"" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters)."
"The WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by Rumelhart and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for ""C"", horizontal and vertical bars for ""H"", etc.). Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word ""WORK"" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader)."
"According to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus. However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE."
"The AVM deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification."
"One of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland reportwas that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword. Rather, it depends somewhat upon the strategies that readers use during a task. If readers paid more attention to the letter in a particular ""position"", they would experience the adverse word superiority effect. This is because the reader would no longer have the benefit of having the word detector level activated with as much weight if they neglected to focus on the full word."

"Rex Hughes (September 24, 1938 – May 9, 2016) was an American college and professional basketball coach. He coached men's basketball at Long Beach City College, Kent State University, and later served as a National Basketball Association (NBA) assistant coach. He served as head coach for part of a season with the Sacramento Kings, and a single game as an interim coach with the San Antonio Spurs. Hughes also worked in NBA scouting and basketball operations with the Kings, Atlanta Hawks and Orlando Magic."
"In 1968-1969, Hughes was Head Coach at Long Beach City College, his first collegiate job after coaching in high school. His squad finished 23-5. When Hughes left to be an assistant at Nebraska, he was replaced by Lute Olson, in his first collegiate job."
"Replacing Frank Truitt at Kent State University in 1974, Hughes' teams went 6-20, 12-14 and 8-19 over the next three seasons. The team started 1-10 in 1977-1978 when he was replaced by Mike Boyd."
"In 1978-1979, Hughes was Head Coach and General Manager of the Montana Sky (Great Falls, Montana) in the short-lived Western Basketball Association. The Sky were co-owned by country singer Charlie Pride. Notably, Hughes had Cazzie Russell and Brad Davis on the roster. Hughes was hired by the Sky mid-season when Coach Bill Klukas was fired after a 3-17 start. The league folded after one season."
In 1991-1992 Hughes served as an Assistant Coach under Dick Motta with the Sacramento Kings and went 22-35 in 57 games replacing Motta as Head Coach after Motta was fired.
"In 1992-1993, Hughes was hired to serve as an Assistant Coach to Jerry Tarkanian with the San Antonio Spurs. However, just 20 games into the season at 9-11, Tarkanian was fired. Hughes was 1-0 as interim Head Coach before John Lucas (39-22) was hired."
"On March 4, 2009, Hughes became the 15th person in ""The Rex Streak"", a streak by radio talk show host Jim Rome of consecutive days interviewing someone named Rex."
"Hughes died on May 9, 2016 at the age of 77."

= = = Howard Gordon = = =
"Howard Gordon (born March 31, 1961) is an American television writer and producer."
"He is well known for his work on the Fox action series ""24"" alongside the Showtime thriller ""Homeland"", which he co-developed with Alex Gansa and Gideon Raff, and for the FX political drama ""Tyrant"", which he co-developed with Craig Wright. He also produced the NBC science fiction thriller ""Awake""."
"Gordon was born to a Reform Jewish family in Queens, New York City and graduated from Roslyn High School. After graduating from Princeton with a major in creative writing in 1984, Gordon came to Los Angeles with fellow filmmaker Alex Gansa to pursue a career in writing for television. Both broke into the industry with single episodes of ABC's """". Their ""Spenser"" work turned industry heads, and the pair joined the series ""Beauty and the Beast"" as staff writers, and were later named producers."
"In 1990, the Gansa-Gordon team was signed to a two-year deal with Witt-Thomas Productions, during which they produced several pilots. One was an ABC project called ""Country Estates"", which caught the attention of producer Chris Carter."
"Soon after, Carter invited Gordon and Gansa to join ""The X-Files"" as supervising producers; Gordon wrote or co-wrote several scripts each season, before departing from the series in 1997 to pursue other projects."
"After co-writing one episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", Gordon created his own show, the short-lived ""Strange World"" in 1999. ""Strange World"" went to seed 13 episodes in, but Gordon and ""Strange World"" writer Tim Minear's services were quickly snapped up by ""Buffy"" creator Joss Whedon on another project: ""Angel"". After two years with ""Angel"", Gordon jumped ship in 2001 for FOX's successful ""24"", where he would write several episodes in Seasons 1 & 2, then crafted the entire story arcs for Seasons 3 and 4. Gordon temporarily left ""24"" in the middle of the 2004 season to re-join Minear, this time as co-creator of another FOX series, ""The Inside"". Despite ""The Inside"" 's cancellation and short run, talk circulated of including the two Minear-Gordon series, ""Strange World"" and ""The Inside"", on a special DVD set sometime in 2006."
"Beginning in 2006, Gordon became ""24""'s showrunner, a title he held through its final season."
Gordon is also the author of the Gideon Davis novels.
"In 2010, after finishing ""24"", Gordon began co-developing (along with Gideon Raff and Alex Gansa) the thriller ""Homeland"" for Showtime. Based on the Israeli series ""Prisoners of War"", it centers on a woman (Claire Danes) who works for the CIA and is convinced a recently returned American prisoner of war (Damian Lewis) has been turned by al-Qaeda. The show premiered Sunday, October 2, 2011, at 10/9 central. It has been met with major critical acclaim and maintained a steady viewership rating throughout its first season. Showtime premiered its fourth season on October 5, 2014."
"In 2012, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing the ""Pilot"" of ""Homeland"" and the series itself won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series."
"In 2011, Gordon signed on to NBC's new Kyle Killen fantasy pilot ""Awake"" as an executive producer. When NBC picked the project up to series status, Gordon added writer and showrunner to his occupational duties on the show. The series only ran from March 1 to May 24, 2012 before it was cancelled."
"Most recently, 2015 would see him working as an executive producer on the horror-drama series ""Second Chance"" for Fox Television Network. The pilot for ""Second Chance"" is based on a script written by Rand Ravich, who also worked as an executive producer on the series."
= = = Klotho (biology) = = =
Klotho is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KL gene.
"This gene encodes a type-I membrane protein that is related to β-glucuronidases. Reduced production of this protein has been observed in patients with chronic kidney failure (CKF), and this may be one of the factors underlying the degenerative processes (e.g., arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and skin atrophy) seen in CKF. Also, mutations within this protein have been associated with ageing, bone loss and alcohol consumption. Transgenic mice that overexpress Klotho live longer than wild-type mice."
"Klotho is a transmembrane protein that, in addition to other effects, provides some control over the sensitivity of the organism to insulin and appears to be involved in ageing. Its discovery was documented in 1997 by Makoto Kuro-o ""et al."" The name of the gene comes from Klotho or Clotho, one of the Moirai, or Fates, in Greek mythology."
"The Klotho protein is a novel β-glucuronidase (EC number 3.2.1.31) capable of hydrolyzing steroid β-glucuronides. Genetic variants in ""KLOTHO"" have been associated with human aging, and Klotho protein has been shown to be a circulating factor detectable in serum that declines with age."
"The binding of certain fibroblast growth factors (FGF's) viz., FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, to their fibroblast growth factor receptors, is promoted via their interactions as co-receptors with β-Klotho."
"Klotho-deficient mice manifest a syndrome resembling accelerated human aging and display extensive and accelerated arteriosclerosis. Additionally, they exhibit impaired endothelium dependent vasodilation and impaired angiogenesis, suggesting that Klotho protein may protect the cardiovascular system through endothelium-derived NO production."
"Although the vast majority of research has been based on lack of Klotho, it was demonstrated that an overexpression of Klotho in mice might extend their average life span between 19% and 31% compared to normal mice. In addition, variations in the Klotho gene (SNP Rs9536314) are associated with both life extension and increased cognition in human populations."
"The mechanism of action of klotho is not fully understood, but it changes cellular calcium homeostasis, by both increasing the expression and activity of TRPV5 and decreasing that of TRPC6. Additionally, klotho increases membrane expression of the inward rectifier channel ROMK. Klotho-deficient mice show increased production of vitamin D, and altered mineral-ion homeostasis is suggested to be a cause of premature aging‑like phenotypes, because the lowering of vitamin D activity by dietary restriction reverses the premature aging‑like phenotypes and prolongs survival in these mutants. These results suggest that aging‑like phenotypes were due to klotho-associated vitamin D metabolic abnormalities (hypervitaminosis)."
"Recently it has been found that the decreased Klotho expression may be due to DNA hypermethylation, which may have been induced by the overexpression of DNMT3a. Klotho may be a reliable gene for early detection of methylation changes in oral tissues, and can be used as a target for therapeutic modification in oral cancer during the early stages."

Untersee (German: lower lake) may refer to:
= = = Gnadensee = = =
"The Gnadensee is part of Lower Lake Constance (), the western part of the lake."
The Gnadensee lies between Allensbach in the north and the island of Reichenau in the south. In the west it extends to the Mettnau peninsula (Radolfzell) and its eastern end borders on the Wollmatinger Ried Nature Reserve and the Reichenaudamm with its prominent avenue of poplars. The extremely small part in the northwest is called the Markelfinger Winkel. Together with the latter it has an area of 13 square kilometres. It reaches a maximum depth of 19 metres.
"The name of the Gnadensee probably dates to the period when the local judiciary was based on the island of Reichenau. If an accused person was found guilty and sentenced to death, the execution could not take place on the island. It had to be carried out on the mainland as the whole island was holy ground. As a result, the convict was taken by boat to the mainland in the direction of present-day Allensbach, in order that the sentence could be carried out. If the local ruler, the abbot, wanted to reprieve the criminal, he had a bell rung before the boat reached the far shore. This was a signal to the executioner on the mainland that the convict had received a pardon or ""Gnade"" (""mercy"" or ""grace"" in German)."
"Another explanation is that the name Gnadensee is derived from Mary, Mother of God, the ""Lady of our Grace"", and is an ellipsis of the word ""Gnaden[frau]see"" (""Lady of Grace Lake""), as the monastery in Mittelzell was dedicated to Saint Mary."

"The lake is fed by numerous small mountain streams in summer, but only one stream flows out of it into the Salzach. In winter the lake completely freezes and is used for winter sports. In summer the lake is used for pleasure boating (boats powered by combustion engines are not allowed except for the ferries that cross the width of the lake from Zell to Thumersbach, so electrically powered boats can be rented instead). The water is very clear and suitable for swimming or diving, but can be chilly."
"The southern end of the lake, near Schüttdorf, is shallower and mostly filled with water weed, making it unsuitable for boating or swimming."

"The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA), a nonprofit museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, is the only major institution in North America devoted entirely to Russian art and culture from the entire scope of Russia's history. The Museum was founded by prominent art collectors Raymond and Susan Johnson, owners of the largest collection of Russian Realist paintings outside the borders of the former Soviet Union. TMORA was incorporated as a nonprofit in 2002, and opened at its present location in 2005. The museum shows 8-10 exhibitions per year, and hosts over 50 annual events ranging from notable lecturers to classical concerts to theatrical readings. TMORA is open daily, located between Downtown Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Saint Paul Airport."
"Raymond and Susan Johnson held the first retail exhibition of Russian Realist Art in North America in 1991. The largest collectors of Soviet-era paintings outside the former USSR, the Johnsons showed their work privately until envisioning a public museum in 2002. It commenced exhibition activities open to the public in 2002, initially in loaned space in a corporate office park located in Bloomington, Minnesota. The organization initially showcased Russian Realist-style paintings from the late 19th century as well as from the Soviet era (1917–1991). Ray Johnson was appointed an Honorary Consul for the Russian Federation in 2003, and in recognition of their respective contributions ""to international cultural diversity and education,"" both Johnson (2005) and TMORA's first Director Bradford Shinkle (2009) were awarded Russia's Order of Friendship Medal, the highest civilian honor accorded to non-Russian citizens."
"In 2005, TMORA acquired and thoroughly remodeled the former Mayflower Church in south Minneapolis, a 75-year-old building that previously served as a Congregational church and funeral home. The building received special recognition for adaptive reuse from the Minnesota Heritage Preservation Commission, and opened to the public in 2007. TMORA now operates a state-of-the-art exhibition facility that includes of display galleries and administrative offices."
"The renovated gallery space has been host to over 70 exhibitions from Masterpieces of Soviet Era Painting, to historical topics like World War I and the Siege of Leningrad and Russian art forms such as Faberge, Lacquer Boxes, Nesting Dolls, and Ornaments. TMORA also presents shows by living artists, such as Leon Hushcha (a Minnesotan artist of Ukrainian descent) and Canadian-Armenian artist Garen Bedrossian."
"TMORA has established international relationships with numerous Russian cultural organizations and museums including Rossotrudnichestvo, the Russian Embassy in the United States - Washington D.C., the Russian Cultural Center, the State Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), State Russian Museum (St. Petersburg), State Museum of Yaroslaval (Yaroslaval). The museum works with both private collectors as well as institutions throughout the United States; the mutual cultural embargo established between Russia and the United States in 2010 currently prevents collections from state institutions in Russia to travel to the United States."

"After being largely ignored since Indian Independence in 1947, a large number of people have slowly started to acknowledge the pioneering work done by Mark Cubbon and other British administrators. On 23 August 2013, the statue of Mark Cubbon was garlanded for the first time since 1947, by Advocate S Umesh of the Cubbon Park Walkers’ Association. The occasion was to mark the 238th birth anniversary of Sir Mark Cubbon. Special permission was obtained from the Karnataka High Court, and Police protection was provided. The group credited Mark for being one of the chief architects of Bengaluru and Mysuru. The move was however opposed by Vatal Nagaraj, infamous for vandalizing the Cenotaph Memorial near the Hudson Memorial Church. However, the association defended their move of honoring Mark Cubbon, as his contribution to Bengaluru was undeniable. Cubbon Park was renamed as Sri Chamarajendra Park way back in 1927, but the name was never popular, and people continued to call it Cubbon Park. Further, according to historians, it would be foolish to erase history, by trying to remove all symbols of British rule, and mere symbolism cannot lead to development."

"Level Plane was an American independent record label based in New York City that was founded in early 1997 by Greg Drudy for the release of Saetia's first 7"". Drudy ran the label until it ceased to exist in 2009. It released records in a variety of styles including those by many screamo bands."
= = = Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum = = =
"Khnumhotep (pronunciation: xaˈnaːmaw-ˈħatpew) and Niankhkhnum (pronunciation: nij-daˌnax-xaˈnaːmaw) were ancient Egyptian royal servants. They shared the title of Overseer of the Manicurists in the Palace of King Nyuserre Ini, sixth pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, reigning during the second half of the 25th century BC. They were buried together at Saqqara and are listed as ""royal confidants"" in their joint tomb. They are notable for their unusual depiction in Egyptian records, often interpreted as the first recorded same-sex couple, a claim that has met considerable debate."
"Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are believed by Thomas Dowson, Greg Reeder, and some other scholars to be the first recorded same-sex couple in ancient history. The assumed romantic relationship between Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum is based on depictions of the two men standing nose to nose and embracing. Niankhkhnum's wife, depicted in a banquet scene, was almost completely erased in antiquity, and in other pictures Khnumhotep occupies the position usually designated for a wife. Their official titles were ""Overseers of the Manicurists of the Palace of the King"" (see sections Titularies, Banquents and music). Critics argue that both men appear with their respective wives and children, suggesting the men were brothers, rather than lovers."
"Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are depicted in the tomb with their respective families. It has been proposed that they were the sons of Khabaw-khufu and Rewedzawes. They appear to have had three brothers named Titi, Nefernisut, and Kahersetef. Three possible sisters are also attested. They are named Neferhotep-hewetherew, Mehewet and Ptah-heseten. Niankhkhnum's wife was named Khentikawes. The couple appear in the tomb with three sons named Hem-re, Qed-unas and Khnumhezewef, and three daughters, Hemet-re, Khewiten-re and Nebet. At least one grandson is attested, Irin-akheti, the son of Hem-re and his wife, Tjeset."
"Khnumhotep had a wife by the name of Khenut. Khnumhotep and Khenut had at least five sons named Ptahshepses, Ptahneferkhu, Kaizebi, Khnumheswef and Niankhkhnum the younger (possibly named after the tomb owner), as well as a daughter named Rewedzawes."
"Egyptian records note Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum as the heads manicurists for the royal family, but they may have held a number of different official titles and duties"
"On duty at the sun temple, Niankhkhnum or Khnumhotep may have watched over subordinate officials, such as the ""m-r pr Sna"" ""overseer of the magazines"" who in turn supervised crews of porters stocking and withdrawing material from the granaries and store-rooms"
"Care of the king's body and wardrobe in preparation for his public appearances required a large number of aides, apparently working in different ateliers each under its own leadership. In addition to the manicurists whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep supervised (discussed in the titulary section of this article), the palace had attendants under one or more men holding the title ""jrj nfr HAt"" ""keeper of the headdress,"" responsible for the king's wigs and headcloths, ""jrw Snj"" "" hairdressers, who kept him shaven, and an ""m-r n jzwj Xkrwt nswt"" ""overseer of the two chambers of king's adorners."" The post of ""Xkrt nswt"" ""adorner of the king"" was always held by women, who were legally, if not socially, equal to men in Egypt. Neferhotep-Hathor is labeled with this status at the funeral procession of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep."
"How, or how often, personnel in the hairdressers' shop, which from titulary evidence stands higher than the manicurists in 5th and 6th Dynasty prestige rankings, communicated with the latter remains unknown. No hairdressers are labeled at the funeral procession. Ptahshepses, the keeper of the headdress who became Nyussere's vizier, and Ti, overseer of the pyramids and sun temples, are two officials whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep may have worked with Both Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are attested on a harvest scene in the splendid burial estate of Ptahshepses, where they may have been quarry supervisors, yet named as ""jr ant pr aA"" ""palace manicurists,"" quite junior to titulary in their own tomb, which could mean Ptahshepses died while they were younger. A door jamb, besides ""TAtj"" ""vizier,"" displays the title ""HAt-a"" ""one whose arm is in front,"" a pure honorific Allen distinguishes from the ""m-r"" and ""jrj"" titles specifying responsibility domains we've encountered up to now. The ""jrj nfr HAt"" ""keeper of the headdress"" epithet, recorded in many of the rooms, is spelled with the mouth sign (Gardiner D21), not the eye sign (D4), so that it shares the introductory word of ""jrj-pat"" ""hereditary prince,"" another of Allen's honorifics."
"The tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum was discovered by Egyptologist Ahmed Moussa in the necropolis at Saqqara, Egypt in 1964, during the excavation of the causeway for the pyramid of King Unas. It is the only tomb in the necropolis where men are displayed embracing and holding hands. In addition, the men's chosen names (both theophorics to the creator-god Khnum) form a linguistic reference to their closeness: Niankhkhnum means ""life belongs to Khnum"" and Khnumhotep means ""Khnum is satisfied;"""
"The precise king and regnal date of this tomb are unknown; style places it in the latter 5th Dynasty under Nyuserre or Menkauhor. No human remains were discovered inside. It is believed the tomb was built in stages, first a sequence of two chambers cut into the limestone of a low escarpment in the northern area of Saqqara, then a surface-built mastaba structure added to mate with the earlier construction. This would have occurred as the two intended occupants gained resources."
"In a banquet scene, Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep are entertained by dancers, clappers, musicians and singers; in another, they oversee their funeral preparations. In the most striking portrayal, the two embrace, noses touching, in the most intimate pose allowed by canonical Egyptian art, surrounded by what would appear to be their heirs."
"Egyptian tombs feature lists of titles and epithets honoring the deceased or held during life, often giving titles for other persons who appear on a wall. For Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, the titulary may be condensed as follows:"
"Critical friend has its origins in critical pedagogy education reforms in the 1970s and arose out of the self-appraisal activity which is attributed to Desmond Nuttall. One of the most widely used definitions is from 1993,"
"Andrew Hutchinson, a public sector consultant, introduced the term to the Local Government Consortium at the University of Warwick in 1998 and it is cited in several papers produced by Professor Jean Hartley of the Local Government Consortium. The critical friend is characterised as falling between the extremes of the ""hostile witness"" and the ""uncritical lover"" whereas earlier texts go so far as to allude to Janus in discussing the concept."
"This dichotomy appealed to Hutchinson who frequently used the term while leader of the South East Midlands Citizen's Charter Quality Network run by the Cabinet Office in Whitehall. In his time running the network he came into regular contact with fellow Lancastrian and Government Minister Peter Kilfoyle MP, Public Service Minister who was responsible for the running of the networks as minister. When Kilfoyle found himself increasingly distanced from the policy agenda of Prime Minister Tony Blair and he chose to resign from Government, Hansard quotes him as saying that he wished to return to the back benches but remain a ""critical friend"" of the Government."
"He was misquoted in the ""Daily Telegraph"" as they claimed that he had said that he wished to be a ""candid friend"" to Government. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the term critical friend has its origins in the softer sounding notion of the candid friend. Nonetheless following the resignation of Peter Kilfoyle ""The Guardian"" newspaper (a popular publication amongst the intelligentsia and public sector middle management) began to popularise the term which is increasingly entering into general usage. The phrase is still most commonly used in education circles but its wider use in the public sector can to a large part be attributed to Andrew Hutchinson and his natural enthusiasm for the concept, being described as 'a natural critical friend acting with positive intent' in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of Coventry City Council, Iain Roxburgh, who is now Director of the Warwick Research Consortium. While a variety of useful and interesting quotations are to be found on the web perhaps the reason for the popularity of the phrase is best summed up by the following quotation,"
= = = Tamil historical novels = = =
Tamil historical novels are a genre of Tamil literature that began to appear in the mid-19th century.
"Prathaapa Mudaliaar Charithram (""The Life of Prathaapa Mudaliaar""), written in 1857 and published in 1879, was the first novel in the Tamil language. The novel does not involve historical characters or events but is set in royal times. Penned by Maayuram Vedanaayakam Pillai, it was a landmark in Tamil literature, which had hitherto seen writings only in poetry. The book gave birth to a new literary genre and Tamil prose began to be recognized as an increasingly important part of the language. One can see the style of any Tamil author in this novel."
"Aabathukidamaana Apavaadham -or- Kamalaambaal Charithram is written by Rajam Iyer from Vathalakundu in the later part of the 19th century is the first Tamil novel depicting the life of living people. The author worked in Tamil daily Dinamani; he live just 26 years. Considering the period in which he lived and wrote, he created waves in emancipation of women's life, incomparable to any social reformist. In this story he conducted marriage to a Brahmin widow. Had he lived further and wrote more, the style of modern Tamil prose would have been different."
"Authors like Kalki Krishnamurthy, Akilan wrote historical novels during the Indian independence movement to instil patriotic pride in the people. Most historical novels were serialised in Tamil magazines before being published in book form. The advent of netzines has seen new web based historical writers entering the arena."
"= = = Bateman, Saskatchewan = = ="
"Bateman is an organized hamlet in the southwest region of Saskatchewan, Canada, north of the Red Coat Trail. It was named after Jim Bateman, the first settler to come to the area with his family in 1908."
"Bateman was once a prosperous community, which had a peak population of more than 300 citizens in the late 1920s. In 2000, the last resident left, and many of the remaining buildings were torn down by the government of Saskatchewan."
"Upon arrival in 1908, Jim Bateman took possession of a quarter section of land on the banks of Notukeu Creek. Then in 1911, Bateman would open a post office. His daughter Lydia was sworn in as the post mistress and drove up to St. Boswells, northwest of Bateman with her father to pick up the community's first mail bag."
"During its pioneer and times of great prosperity, Bateman would have over 300 residents during the late 1920s. Bateman was also a focal point for small family grain farmers in the region. The community once boasted four grain elevators, a bank, a theatre, restaurants, two gas stations, two churches, three grocery stores, skating and curling rink, and two implement businesses. The community even had its own power plant and street light system."
"Bateman once had a school that covered grades K–12, but closed due to the consolidation of schools. In 1966, Bateman lost its grade 12 classes, and a few years after that the school would again lose grades 10 and 11, to the neighbouring town of Gravelbourg, leaving only grade nine for the high-school level, eventually being moved there as well, leaving just the elementary classes. In 1996, Bateman's school finally closed for good."
Today the once impressive brick school has been demolished due to the poor condition the building was in. All that remains of the former school is the foundation and a commemorative sign.

"The video clip for the song was one of the first ever videos screened on MTV. In a documentary for Radio New Zealand, Neil Finn expressed surprise at the song's success, stating that it ""hasn't got a proper chorus""."
"After Split Enz's dissolution in 1984, singer Neil Finn continued to perform ""One Step Ahead"" with his next group Crowded House, in particular, the group performed the song live at their 1987 concert in Daytona known as ""Spring Break '87""."
"The single's b-side ""In the Wars"" was recorded in the ""Waiata"" recording sessions, however was not originally released as a track on the album, though was later appended as track twelve in the album's 2006 re-release."

"Sunland Park Racetrack & Casino is a racino located in Sunland Park, New Mexico, a suburb of El Paso, Texas."
"Opened in 1959 as a Thoroughbred racing track, Sunland Park was the only legalized gambling venue in the region for many years. In 1999, at a time when horse racing was experiencing a decline as casinos and lotteries became commonplace, New Mexico legislators allowed slot machines at the track. Now with over 700 machines in play, racing at Sunland has benefited greatly, with purses increasing from a $35,000 daily average in the early 1990s to nearly a quarter million per day today."
"Sunland Park was the track where jockeys Jerry Bailey, Pat Valenzuela, and Cash Asmussen got their starts. Bill Shoemaker, who hails from the area, also rode at Sunland."
"The casino, open 112 hours a week, also offers many electronic table games including roulette, blackjack and Texas Hold 'Em."
"The 2018 racing season, which features both Thoroughbreds and Quarter Horses, runs from December 28 through May 5. Live racing is traditionally offered four days each week on Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Year-round Simulcast wagering is also available on racetracks across the country."
"The live racing season is highlighted by the Sunland Derby, run at 1⅛ miles for three-year-olds in late March of each year. The race was granted a Grade 3 status for the 2010 running and now is an important preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby. The race is now included in the Road to the Kentucky Derby; awarding 50 points to the winner, 20 to second, 10 to third, and 5 to forth. The 50 points awarded the winner effectively guarantees entrance into the Kentucky Derby."
"Other notable races include the $200,000 Sunland Park Oaks, 1-1/16 miles Kentucky Oaks prep for fillies; the $100,000 Harry W. Henson Handicap for fillies and mares at one mile; the $100,000 Riley Allison Derby, 6½ furlongs for three-year-olds; the $100,000 Mine That Bird Derby, 1 1/16-mile prep for the Sunland Derby; and the $150,000 Sunland Park Handicap for three-year-olds and up at 1⅛ miles."

= = = 457 visa = = =
"In Australia, the 457 visa was the most common visa for Australian or overseas employers to sponsor skilled overseas workers to work temporarily in Australia. It has been abolished since 18 March 2018 by Turnbull government and replaced by another visa category. The full title of this subclass of visa was Temporary Business (Long Stay) and was introduced soon after John Howard became Prime Minister in 1996. The title of the visa was changed to Temporary Work (Skilled) (Subclass 457) visa on 24 November 2012. Applications were processed by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP). On 18 April 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that the 457 visas will be replaced with two new visa categories."
"Holders of a 457 visa may be employed for a period of up to four years and may bring any eligible family members, including same-sex partners, who have unrestricted work and study rights in Australia. ""If your sponsor is a start-up business or has traded in Australia for less than 12 months, then the visa will be granted for 18 months."" Holders of the subclass 457 visa have no limit on the number of times they travel in and out of Australia."
"Employers must be approved by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection as an approved sponsor. Primary subclass 457 visa holders are restricted to working for their sponsor and may not work (or volunteer) for any other organisation (other than associated entities as defined by the Corporations Act). In order to change employer and sponsor, the ""new employer"" must be or become an approved 457 sponsor and then lodge a 457 nomination. Once the nomination is approved, the employer obligations will shift to the new employer and the visa applicant is restricted to working for it. There is no need to apply for a new 457 visa within the validity of the visa."
"Employees must also meet minimum levels of skill and English language requirements, in addition to character and health requirements. Some trades occupations and passport holders from certain countries may be required to do a skills assessment (see the TRA website)."
It is common for 457 visa holders to apply for a permanent Australia residents visa with a view to permanently settle in Australia and become Australian citizens.
A 457 visa holder can only work in a nominated occupation for the sponsor employer. Medical practitioners and general managers must work in their nominated occupation but they can work for employers other than their sponsor or an associated entity of their sponsor. The specific occupations to which this rule applies are listed in Exemption from the requirement to work directly for the sponsor. The worker must also not have ceased employment for more than 60 consecutive days.
"The Australian Government reviewed the 457 skilled immigrant visa and made some provisions to quicken the transition to permanent residency starting on 1 July 2012. From that date, non-resident workers on the 457 skilled immigration visa are able to transition to permanent residency if they have two years with the employer who has sponsored them and if the employer provides a full-time position in the 457 visa holder's nominated occupation."
"Furthermore, the Australian government has recognised that 457 visas deserve priority in review as they are highly responsive to the needs of the market. Overseas workers will be able to work in Australia on a six-month short term work visa before they apply for a 457 visa."
"As at 30 June 2016, the size of the subclass 457 programme was 94,890 Primary visa holders in Australia."
"An audit by the Fair Work Ombudsman conducted between Sept 2013 and June 2014 found that 40% of 457 visa holders were no longer employed by a sponsor or were being paid well below the statutory minimum wage of $53,900."
"In October 2014, the Abbott government announced that it would make it easier for businesses to apply for 457 visa workers by relaxing rules for English language competency to broaden the pool of potential workers from overseas."
"With the commencement of the Japan free trade agreement in 2015, employers no longer need to offer jobs to locals or to prove that none could fill vacancies before Japanese nationals eligible for 457 visas are employed."
"In December 2014, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection released recommendations to relax 457 visa requirements. The recommendations include extending the six month short term work visa to 12 months with no obligation to apply for a 457 visa. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) has criticized this change on the grounds that it avoids the 457 visa's requirement for English language and skills tests and employers would not be required to demonstrate they had first tried to fill job vacancies with Australian workers."
"On 18 April 2017, Malcolm Turnbull announced his intention to replace the 457 visas with 2 new categories (short term and medium term) of visas."
"One of the replacement was Temporary Skill Shortage visa, or known as 482 Visa. It allows immigration It requires candidates to obtain an IELTS (English Language) exam band score of 5 or higher, or other method of showing the English level."
"Water ingress and damaged roof timbers required roof repairs to be started in 2015, however this has stalled due to lack of funds."

This is a list of the taxonomic contributions of Major Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton.
"The natural history specimens and cultural objects collected by Major Powell-Cotton (1866–1940) on his expeditions to Africa and Asia are finely preserved in the Powell-Cotton Museum. According to the Mammal Catalogue produced by the Powell-Cotton Museum, the species of over 6400 specimens (more than 230 species) preserved in the Museum belong to the following 42 families and 149 genera:"
"The majority of the specimens fall within the scope of the genera Alcelaphus, Anomalurus, Cephalophus, Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, Colobus, Euoticus, Felis, Gazella, Gorilla, Kobus, Pan, Redunca, Sylvicapra, Syncerus and Tragelaphuse (number of the specimens exceeds 100). And, except the two presented specimens of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) collected in Swiss Alps in 1905, all the mammal specimens in the Powell-Cotton Museum were collected in Africa and Asia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, which came from the following countries or regions: Abyssinia, Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea, India, Kashmir, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Ogaden, Pakistan, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Tibet, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe."
"The large mammal specimen collection was built up on the basis of Powell-Cotton's forty years’ exploration in Africa and the Indian subcontinent, which is helpful in conducting taxonomic, zoological, ethnobiological/ethnomedical and ethnographic studies. The mammal type specimens identified from the total specimens are listed as follows:"
"The mammal species named after Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton can be distinguished by the subspecies name “cottoni” or “powelli”. The specimens collected by Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton play an important role in scientific studies because the existence of some of the cottoni species are in danger now, for example, the B/W Colobus (Colobus angolensis cottoni) was rated “Least Concern” in The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species published in 2008. The accounts of Major P. H. G. Powell-Cotton's specimen collection activities can be found in his books and articles. And, there is no difference between some of his writings and adventure stories. For example, in Black rhinoceros hunting which is included in Big Game Shooting in Africa, he vividly recorded the hunting of a black Rhino:"
"Aside from the two books titled “A Sporting Trip through Abyssinia” (1902) and “In Unknown Africa” (1904) and the book chapter titled “Black rhinoceros hunting”, his writings were published in journals and magazines, including The Antiquaries Journal (e.g. vol. 4, no. 3, 1924), The Geographical Journal (vol. 30, 1907), Journal of the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire (e.g. Jan. 1937), Journal of the Royal African Society (e.g. vol. 7, 1907), The Wide World Magazine (e.g. Feb. 1904) and Man (e.g. vol. 29, 1929). The content of these writings includes the records of mammal hunting, accounts of the biological characteristics of mammals and descriptions of local (primarily African) culture and nature."
"The mammal specimens (skulls, skeletons, skin, horns, etc.) in the Powell-Cotton Museum are exhibits as well as objects of study. Some academics from universities and research institutes such as University of Cambridge, University College London, University of Sheffield, University of Kent, University of Exeter, The University of Bradford, University of the Witwatersrand, University of California, Université Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris III, University of Melbourne, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Canterbury Christchurch University, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna used to visit this museum in order to obtain skeletal data, collect samples for DNA or dietary analysis and so on. One of the famous academic visitors is Professor Colin Groves of the Australian National University, whose research interests include but are not limited to mammalian taxonomy (especially primate taxonomy), human evolution and taxonomic history of mammals. In addition to the specimens preserved in the museums such as Natural History Museum (London), Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (Paris), Museum voor Middenafrika (Tervuren), Naturalis (Leiden), Musée Royale d’Histoire Naturelle (Brussels), Kenya National Museums (Nairobi), Zoologisches Museum A. Humboldt (Berlin) and Museum A. Koenig (Bonn), he also utilized the mammal specimens provided by the Powell-Cotton Museum and hence conducted many comparative studies, for example, he used to measure the skulls of Northern White Rhinoceros, and examine the colobus material and the specimens of musk-deer at the Museum. Some of these studies can be found in his noted book “Primate Taxonomy” which is considered to relabel museum cabinets. And, he thought highly of the Powell-Cotton Museum."

"The octahemioctacron is the dual of the octahemioctahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the hexahemioctacron."
"Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called ""stellation to infinity"". However, he also suggested that strictly speaking they are not polyhedra because their construction does not conform to the usual definitions."

Crambe abyssinica is an annual oilseed crop of the family Brassicaceae. It is mainly cultivated due to the high levels of erucic acid that are contained in its seeds. The crambe oil is used for industrial purposes and its side products can be partly used as animal feed.
"""C. abyssinica"" has its origins in eastern Africa and was domesticated in the Mediterranean region. It grows up to a height between 0.5 and 2m, depending on field conditions. Its cropping cycle is rather short, ranging from 90 to 100 days. Usually, its straight stalk is moderately branched and its leaves are of an oval shape. The plant’s flowers are small and white, arranged in racemes and have four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two shorter and four longer free stamens, what is typical for Brassicaceae. Mostly, these flowers are self-pollinated, but some cases of cross-pollination have been observed. Its indehiscent fruits enclose only one spherical seed that contains around 26% protein, 18% fibre and 35% oil. This oil content is lower than what can be extracted from rapeseed and the oil is not edible. The pericarp of the seed usually adheres to the seed even at harvest."
"Crambe has not been in cultivation for a long time. It was probably cultivated for the first time in the 1930s in the former USSR. Later the crop was tested in other regions of the USSR, in Sweden and in Poland, where crambe was grown on 25’000 ha after the second world war. Research efforts in northern and eastern Europe were increased and the agronomical characteristics and industrial uses of crambe were intensively studied. By successive selection within ""C. abyssinica,"" conventional breeding started in the 1950s in some European countries. Hereby improved strains were introduced to Canada and the United States. Further selection and crossing of different accession led to the release of new varieties in the 1970s. Through introgression of wild populations and mass selection two new cultivars were created in the 1980s which were promoted as high yielding source of erucic acid. In the 1990s a breeding program was started in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, after a period of great efforts to bring crambe into extended cultivation, interest in the crop in Europe has declined in recent years ."
"With a germination temperature of 6 °C which is also equivalent to the basal growing temperature, ""C. abyssinica"" is a winter crop in southern Europe and subtropical areas whereas it is cultivated as spring crop in northern Europe and more continental areas. The optimal growing temperature is approximately 15 °C. It tolerates annual average temperature between 5.7 and 16.2 °C and frost down to -6 °C. Because of its ability to get along with only 350mm of precipitation, ""C. abyssinica"" is considered to be relatively drought tolerant. Nevertheless, drought stress during the development stages of flowering and grain filling reduces productivity. Cultivation is possible up to an annual precipitation of 1200mm. Crambe has modest demands regarding soil properties, it tolerates soil pH from 5.0 to 7.8. Low soil depth and a high stone and gravel content decrease drought tolerance."
"Seeds of many improved varieties are available on the market and are sown at a rate of approximately 120 seeds per m and at a depth of 5-15mm. Seed maturation is uniform and the 1000 seed weight varies between 6.0 and 7.5g. Management procedures from sowing to harvesting can be conducted largely with the same machinery used for common cereals. Yield levels vary widely between 1100-1600kgha in Russia, 450-2500kgha in the U.S. and 600-2400kgha in Germany."
"""C. abyssinica"" can be easily inserted in crop rotations with a requirement of 1600 growing degree-days. Its rotation contingent should not exceed 25%. Because of similar soil requirements and increased soil borne pathogen pressure, cultivation directly after other Brassicaceae species should be avoided as well as cultivation after artificial grassland and fallows due to an enriched soil seed bank of potential weeds and regarding the limited pre-emergence weed management methods."
"""C. abyssinica"" is cultivated for a wide range of industrial purposes. The interest lies mainly in the high erucic acid content (55-60%) of its seed oil and makes the crop a competitive option to other oil plants as industrial rapeseed. The composition of crambe oil gives this product several special traits, such as high smoke point, good wettability of different materials and high viscosity. In addition, its oil has a higher biodegradability than mineral oils. Therefore, erucic acid derived compounds are used as additives in the plastic industry, high temperature hydraulic fluids, waxes, base for paints and coatings, lubricants and many other products. Furthermore, the extracted seed oil is used in pharmaceutical products and cosmetics."
"The crambe meal, which is a side product of industrial oil production, can be used as a protein supplement for animal feed. It contains approximately 46% proteins, which are of high nutritional quality. Unfortunately, the crambe seed shred also contains toxic compounds as glucosinolates, tannins and inositol phosphate. The use as forage is therefore very limited. The incorporation rate of crambe by-products into animal feed should not be higher than 5% for growing-finishing pigs, 15% for dairy cows, and 19% for sheep. It is not recommended to feed poultry."
"The A10 motorway (), also known as the Sebeș–Turda Motorway (), is a partially built motorway in the central-western part of Romania, that when completed will connect the A1 and the A3 motorways, between the cities of Sebeș and Turda, also providing access to Alba Iulia and Aiud. It is planned to be 70 km long, with a total cost of 420 million euro, which is financed in proportion of 85% from the European Union funds, the rest of 15% being insured from the state budget. The motorway is divided into four lots: works for lots 3 and 4 began on 20 May 2014, whereas for the other two lots began in 2015. Since 30 July 2018, it is operational on lots 3 and 4, from Aiud to Turda (28.9 km)."
"The construction is split into the following four segments, the contracts for which have been awarded in December 2013:"
= = = Resilience (engineering and construction) = = =
"In the fields of engineering and construction, resilience is the ability to absorb or avoid damage without suffering complete failure and is an objective of design, maintenance and restoration for buildings and infrastructure, as well as communities. A more comprehensive definition is that it is the ability to respond, absorb, and adapt to, as well as recover in a disruptive event. A resilient structure/system/community is expected to be able to resist to an extreme event with minimal damages and functionality disruptions during the event; after the event, it should be able to rapidly recovery its functionality similar to or even better than the pre-event level."
"The concept of resilience originated from ecology and then gradually applied to other fields. It is related to that of vulnerability. Both terms are specific to the event perturbation, meaning that a system/infrastructure/community may be more vulnerable or less resilient to one event than another one. However, they are not the same. One obvious difference is that vulnerability focuses on the evaluation of system susceptibility in the pre-event phase; resilience emphasizes the dynamic features in the pre-event, during-event, and post-event phases."
"Resilience is a multi-facet property, covering four dimensions: technical, organization, social and economic. Therefore, using one metric may not be representative to describe and quantify resilience. In engineering, resilience is characterized by four Rs: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. Current research studies have developed various ways to quantify resilience from multiple aspects, such as functionality- and socioeconomic- related aspects."
"The first influential quantitative resilience metric based on the functionality recovery curve was proposed by Bruneau et al., where resilience is quantified as the resilience loss as follows."
formula_1
where formula_2 is the functionality at time formula_3; formula_4 is the time when the event strikes; formula_5 is the time when the functionality full recovers.
"The resilience loss is a metric of only positive value. It has the advantage of being easily generalized to different structures, infrastructures, and communities. This definition assumes that the functionality is 100% pre-event and will eventually be recovered to a full functionality of 100%. This may not be true in practice. A system may be partially functional when a hurricane strikes and may not be fully recovered due to uneconomic cost-benefit ratio."
"Resilience index is a normalized metric between 0 and 1, computed from the functionality recovery curve."
formula_6
where formula_2 is the functionality at time formula_3; formula_4 is the time when the event strikes; formula_10 is the time horizon of interest.
"Thomas Tredgold was the introduced the concept of resilience in 1818 in England. The term was used to describe a property in the strength of timber, as beams were bent and deformed to support heavy load. Tredgold found the timber durable and did not burn readily, despite being planted in bad soil conditions and exposed climates. Resilience was then refined by Mallett in 1856 in relation to the capacity of specific materials to withstand specific disturbances. These definitions can be used in engineering resilience due to the application of a single material that has a stable equilibrium regime rather than the complex adaptive stability of larger systems."
"In his paper ""Resilience and Stability of Ecological systems"" (1973), C.S. Holling first explored the topic of resilience through its application to the field of ecology. Ecological resilience was defined as a ""measure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between state variables."" Holling found that such a framework can be applied to other forms of resilience. The application to ecosystems was later used to draw into other manners of human, cultural and social applications. The random events described by Holling are not only climatic, but instability to neutral systems can occur through the impact of fires, the changes in forest community or the process of fishing. Stability, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance. Multiple state systems rather than objects should b studied as the world is a heterogeneous space with various biological, physical and chemical characteristics."
