"I would have been, been very rude to him."
"But no, but I can't  couldn't afford to be rude to him, I've only just joined the choir."
Well in future whenever he suggests something  I think what you've got to do
There's some in here.
Okay?

"a , er you know, I don't want there to be any."
"misunderstanding, and he, he said explain."
So I had to lie.
Certainly.
"and I said erm, I'm going out with someone."
Cos I thought he hasn't taken any of my hints so far.
"Erm, and he said, oh that sort of un , misunderstanding?"
And then I thought I'd really put my foot in it  and embarrassed both of us
Ha.
"so   there was silence until we got to the tube station and he said, how long have you been going out with this man?"
Said oh  I thought oh Becky would laugh if I told her this .
You know what I mean.

"But, like I say, we're covering that, like."
You know what I mean?

"He , he's, he's not in a position to say whether he knows or not."
He says he doesn't know!
Oh!
"No, well I"
It's nothing to do with him!
It's not his department.
"But he said there is a gang going round, and some are putting the chimneys on  and the others are going in and doing the flues."
"And he said, it looks as though they've put the chimney on and found that the flue is the ba the boiler's in the bathroom, so they've had to come down here."
Said because it shouldn't have a chimney on it!
"But he said, I don't know it's no , nothing to do with me!"
It's the
No.
Bri it's the British Gas that's doing it!
Oh  well that's right he's gotta blame somebody!
"But he said, I would do it because I know, I've worked for the Gas board!"
Mm.

"I said, well there's one thing certain, I can't!"
"Perhaps , pay good money for it!"

"and I've 'oovered up,"
and dusted and polished.
"That kitchen floor could do with washing, I saw a mop, but didn't see no bucket."
"I don't whether she's got one, but I thought, I didn't have time to do it this morning."
Mm.
"So I just run round with 'oover and dusted and polished, then I made a cup of tea."

But anyway  there's the insurance point of view.
"But anyway, any  I mean  that's the easy, and I mean, if, if people who are willing to drive can have experience in driving  before they take passengers out."

Yeah but it was bigger than the plate.
You had to fold it in half to get it on.
That's what I said to John I said you've got your dinner in between an omelette.
Yeah.
That's right.
I thought I could call it erm  a Spanish omelette.
What I tried to do was one of those
Did you have
ploughman's things.
did you have a surplus of eggs or something?
Pardon me.
"Well  erm, I knew you wouldn't eat sort of sliced ham on its own with erm  vegetables."
So  I knew you would eat it like that in an omelette.
Mm.
"I mean, if it had of been smaller."
"Well, I'll have a go but  I may not eat all this but  if it was smaller it's really tasty as well."
Mm.
But you liked those erm  were they countryman's or ploughman's in a packet and you just throw them into the pan and cook it for about fifteen minutes?
And that was just potatoes and eggs wasn't it?
And some cheese.
And bacon.
Don't remember.
Oh.
"What I want to do, I want to cut the shopping down as much as I possibly can."
Well I think eight pounds is a good start.
But when I go to the shops and I spend  seventy pound for a week.
We have to keep making trips back to the shop because we need  bread or milk or something else that we've forgotten.
That's the only thing.
Oh yeah.
If you could work it out and see how much it would be
Yeah.
and see if it's  any
Yeah.
"cheaper because  food's no erm  problem  I'll be taking loads with me anyway, which we would do anyway."
We'd be  on anyway
Yeah.

Well food's not that expensive out there.
"It's, it's the"
"same as  here isn't it, really?"
"Yeah but I mean the fruit and veg out there, that was"
Mm.
rea I mean that was cheaper wasn't it?
Seemed to be anyway somewhat.
Well they  do it by the kilo which  works out cheaper.
"The price per pound was the  same, I think."
I worked it out.
But  I dunno!
"I just thought that it seemed to be, you know?"
"Anyway, we don't eat much when we're in heat anyway do you?"
"The hot weather it doesn't, they don't really   do mashed potatoes and"
Yeah.
like Carol's doing and    those revolting French sausages!
"Went into the supermarket and it said   and it said  pour, not it said erm  pour le animal, well any fool would have thought that was poor   the animals, and Carol said that looks nice, we'll,we'll have a pile of that!"

He said oh I've invited Aunty Joan but nobody else cos I didn't fancy  any of the others.
And has he invited Joan to the day do and that?
Yeah.
But he hasn't invited any  to the night .
I think I might have  his conscience by saying that I don't mind.
Well for what they see  I can understand him asking Joan and Graham  erm  maybe they've gotta watch how much they're
I know but an extra four people's not gonna cost that much more is it?
Shut up.

What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Well there are special beds.
Oh you mean a bed?
Well

D'ya mean a special kind of mattress be
"Well, she just asked about a bed, so I told her that  we were"
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
But why's
"She di na she just said a bed, and so"
Yes.
"I told her there were special beds that we have  are very useful, in fact  very necessary in some, some cases, and are  painfully short of them."
Aha.
And a Nimbas bed  costs two thousand pound.
"And there's another one on the market which I can't remember the name of, which costs a lot more."
Mhm.
"Something like, five thousand."
But I can't remember the name.
"Anyway, I said I'd  make enquiries as to what a is wanted."

An obstetric outpatients
The instructors

Oh right.
"Did they record it or that, no?"
Which is a good job.
Mm.
Cos most of us were petrified anyway.
And that's a bit like that erm  the teaching skills that I had to do that time when I was on the course.
Mm?
Erm  and I had to think up  something  that I do as a hobby er to teach other people.
"I, I did those little flowers you see  and took them in."
And er  it is quite nervewracking really to sit there.
Specially when the instructors come over and they're sort of sitting watching as well.
"Well  the bad thing was, as soon as I picked my cards up I dropped them all  you know?"
Mm.
All your flash cards?
Good morning yeah.
"Good morning ladies and gentlemen pshoow and they, they went all over the place."
So I had to pick them back up  mm sorry.
Bit of nerves.
"Be back to front now, this morning yeah?"
John wants me to er  sew his trousers for him.
Oh.
I'm waiting on him  picking up the machine.
It tickles me the way they call it portable and you can hardly lift it.
"we took Patricia in to, we give her a lift as far as Longbridge today."
She was going back to get her coat changed.
And then she was going to the careers office.
And erm they were going to send her for an interview straight away.
I told her to be home reasonably early but she's not home yet.
Well
"I said my share'll be about twenty five grand roughly so he's quite happy with that, yeah."

"That's true, yeah it's all worked itself out hasn't it"
really.
I took the two videos off the shelf and re-boxed them and as soon as

No my friend's in the trade I said they're basically working but they've got a halt on somewhere because they've come back  you'll have to sort out the  you've got but er they're only one ten
Yeah.
I think they both actually probably work it's just they couldn't figure out the  programming on them.
you know?
Yes.
Yeah.
I mean if I'd had the money
I think so.
"first did it, you know and er"
Yeah.
"And Jim, when he comes in, they're both, they're both all, I've pr priced them up on the top and er"
Oh.
Well they've not warmed them up.
If I'd known you was coming I would have done that bit of chicken.
I've got some sausage rolls here.
"I needed some change so I got two sausage rolls, I'm gonna wire them up on microwave in a bit right?"
Er   mixed with some beans and
Er got bread Bill.
Oh aye .
"Oh what's, what's the difference between a penis and a works bonus?"
I don't know.
The wife don't mind blowing the works bonus.
I were told that other day.
I like that one.
Do you wanna hear another one?
Steve'll like that one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Er why d why do women parachutists wear jockstraps?
To stop them whistling on the way down.
Tt
"told that one as well  and why, why do  oh what's other one?"
Why  why don't blind people parachute?
Don't know.
Scares the shit out of guide dogs.
"Cos I read these in a paper  and I thought hey these are very good ones here, I thought  I'll get them, I'll remember them."
You get worse.
"It's like our Albert, he tells that many jokes I can never remember half of what he tells me."
He told me one twice
I still can't remember the bleeder.
"He's pillock brained, your father, yesterday."
"There he is with the car, drives straight into the garage and the aerial goes ping!"
So he's waiting for you to come up and have a look at it.
La laces are a thing of the past.

Obviously another time saving device.
Yeah.
To save you what  say thirty seconds?
Oh at least.

"Not at this time of the day, no."
Not on a Monday.
Rest of the week.
Exactly.

I thought you were going out?
I  I'm  finishing early but I'm not go going out.
Watch you don't er swallow that the wrong way.
I didn't even have anything in me mouth.
Sharp intake of breath.

Yeah.
"Oh   I told you didn't I that  er the fellow with the Portakabins that does work for the B B C, he had the Portakabin and then your tables are two pound each, and your chairs range from fifty pence to one pound fifty."
I think the ones that are fifty pence are those blue and white striped ones off the  prom at Prestatyn
job lot.
And er  he didn't say how much the toilet was but that'll probably be separate.
"You know, it's a separate thing so there must be a separate price, it would cost a bloody fortune."
So you got .
"Oh no you do , you  no, no!"
Well yes.
"Well  no, no, no."
You play    four on the team  the four on the team play a go right?

Unless you're not bothered.
"Unless, unless, unless, unless you won and then you get best ."
"Well no, you ge if you won and give the rest a game."
See we're not bothered.
"We're, we're, I mean we're not  we're not that bothered  really  ."
"Yeah, but no  could we?"

"Well having said, what, what is it all about?"
"It's because  the  no, no water heater should be in the bathrooms!"
So where's that gonna go then?
"Well it must either go in the kitchen or in the cupboard somewhere, but you know?"
That's what they've er  put it to.
what you said to me.
Oh yeah.
Oh well we'll have to move won't we?
Yeah.
"It's working, like gas-wise, like I say, it is  it's virtually, it's just the ventilation clearing out the  the fumes  which are given"
Mm.

Do you see what I mean?
"Well it is  isn't there a, there's a chimney above there isn't there?"
Yeah.
"That's right, yeah, but  but now  like I said, you're gonna have to , to have your certain pipes."
"Like, have you seen them all going round?"
They got long poles on the back step.
Will it'll be longer than that ?
No  cos they haven't done this one  because it shouldn't be in here!
Even in the fire?
Yeah.
Right.
"Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't be in here, like, that's why they haven't  that's why they've put it there."
That's why they hung on the to the shipment cos these aren't supposed to be in  the bathrooms.
Right.
When are you going to prune them?
"Well, when I plant that other one where you want it planted, that's"
I wonder when er  John  's going to have the erm
Wheelbarrow ready.
Yes.
Oh!
Said in yesterday's paper  that someone had had a wheelbarrow  valued at thirty pounds stolen from a back garden  and it was somewhere at Kirk Hill.
Where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible.
"So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds."
Mm.
"Cos it didn't, it didn't say  a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow."
Well those er  four tapes
So we'll have to get it
"those four tapes, incidentally, I saw, you know the  compil the Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and  Tchaikovsky, I saw them for fifteen pound."
What four tapes?
"The four, not tapes, compact discs."
The set of four that we sent  so they were fifteen pound in  there.
That who sent to you?
That Shirley and  Gareth sent me for Christmas.
Ah ah!
The
I wish you'd think of something you would like for your birthday.
"I told you, I want a  I would like a fiddle."
D'ya know I  and you need binoculars to go to  Rome with.
Take a couple of them.
Well I can't see very well through binoculars.
The Sistine Chapel.
We mustn't take those big ones with us.
Oh Jim  they're too heavy.
I know.
"You,an easier camera  ."
"It doesn't need a camera, it needs you!"
no no no but I'm pa if
So go on yo
I were in power there wouldn't be any money  no need for it!
Then you
Well I
wouldn't have all
I
the arguments!
I know that!
So you wouldn't
Yeah.
say that at all!
No.
Yeah.
And what would you do
But in the case of these people that  start off
So why why should
"Fair do's they start off in University, clever blokes  and a lot of them worked in the mines, Shinwells  what's his name?"
Beven  miners
Just for money!
Well I won't say  Beven  because it's a bloody shame what happened to him!
But never the less  a lot of them started off like that didn't they?
Another one is Foot.
Ah but er he
"And  as they get into, as you say, power and I quite agree  somebody has a talk with them so look here"
We know
we know you're a socialist
But you still earned a few bob to get on.
"But er, you you we're gonna make you a nice one and join the bloody club  so you'll be  an armchair socialist  and we look after you  and that's what they are!"
Callaghan is another example  two or three homes  big Jim with all his bloody money what does he care about working people?
"And this feller Kinnock's the same, you can see the style of them!"
I think he must be
Was Bleep in?
Yeah  he had a big do with the council man.
Why?
The council bloke come down
"Oh, what is Val's accent?"
Well west

Yeah.
to be exact.
"Well  I don't know  well that'll be on there if they want to know anyway now, you've just said it."
Mm  erm  yeah the council bloke come down and went in while his father was there
I see you've got no carpets down anywhere  the door's not painted  and he said you've been living here for two years!
Well what's the council man got to do with that?
Well they got a grant you see.
Well carpets ain't got nothing to do with it surely?
Yes they have  that's when I  the house is finished.
Oh.
"When your carpets were down, you moved in  so he's coming back December the eighth."
I thought he would have to tell them  got his carpets down.
He had a carpet just put down in his lounge.
Well he's got a lot to do then.
He was belly aching .
Cor!
How's how's the thing between Blue and
Completely  by now.
Good heavens!
Even the first day back  there was hardly any atmosphere at all very serious mood they were  but Kim keeps well out of it.
Oh I think she's the trouble maker there myself.
Yeah  she'll just keep well out of it.
I think  that's what started it all off I think she's running off.
Yeah.
Oh whatever you done?
Yeah?
"So in a way yo you're doing  different hours and all  so your pay, was that based on forty hour week?"
Or was that just based on  you being there whenever  you had to be there.
"Don't forget he's only started th , the job's only started a week!"
I'm just asking dear!
I'm paying for supper.
Yeah.
They're paying me for forty hours.
And anything you do above forty hours you can extra for?
Yeah.
"But, saying that  means you got a lot"
You don't have forty hours only to do.
I have.
"Because  the hour, the hours  forty  but   there's loads to be done ."
Yeah.
I'm getting them sorted out with Roy
"Well erm  have you had your pay yet from them, no?"
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
"So you, well then you'll still not know what you're going out with because you still have a few days from last week to get ."
"So you don't know what you'll start with, you'll actually bring in."
I will do.
Do you?
On my pay slip.
It doesn't make any difference  .
Do you remember the  form David got with the tax form and all?
"He's gonna give it into  Mericlean and Mericlean , just said we'll have to send it off  to the tax office to get your tax code changed."
"It's er, the tax code on his P forty five is ."
Well
His

And the bedrooms!
"You can't compare it, it's the rolls royce of caravans."
"That's, that Darren said oh aye, he's the one, he's in the maroon one he said."
He's in the rolls royce.
Top of the range he said.
Beautiful thing.
Good god there's a mirror in the sitting room as big as that wall.
You'll see it when you go over there.
Beautiful thing.
"Yes,"
And I said I've bought a box of matches for him to go down and light this fire  thinking you know he might need two or three matches at a time.
But er  well I gave him a box of matches to go with him and I thought oh well  he'll have plenty of matches then.
"And I took them in, he says  what do you buy them for?"
He said.
I've got loads of matches.
In this caravan everything's electronic.
"Fridge, light switches ooh  beautiful thing it is."
Ten times the price of ours I expect.
"A caravan is a caravan after all, isn't it?"
But for what we want it for  ours is good enough.
Good enough.
That's what I'm saying perhaps  they must let it out though.
If we were having
Why's Malcolm got it?
"if we were having a caravan like that, I'd be too frightened to let it."
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't
Well there we are.
let it.
There we are.
I couldn't afford to pay for it then could I?
Is everyone okay about that?

Was that was that  theory?
Was it that?
"I can't remember what the  off the top of my head, no."
"chapter six is,."
"Right, er"
as questions lead to  shouting and then crawling back to his   Then a little bit about language and an experiment that they did .
"Right, sounds like there's a bit on topics in there so it might be worth having a look at anyway."

What do you think the score's gonna be against Birmingham?
Three one to Palace.
Three one to Palace?
Be great if that is.
We will score first.
They will equalize and we'll score two more.
We have got to get another goalgetter.
I mean old erm   does his bit  crossing and splitting defences and getting goals but not scoring them.
"What do you mean, getting goals and then not"
"Now, well now  it's just now we've got nobody who, who score actually really scores goals  except Thomas I would say at the moment."
We really do need somebody who regularly pops them in.
What about Gabbiadini?
What about Gabiadini?
Well  he's coming along.

Why are we going this way then?
"Are, are Manchester United not the most cockiest fans going aren't they?"
They really are cocky .
Yeah.
"Leeds, I like Man United, I don't, I don't hate them or anything I just, they get a bit I dunno."
"Mind you not that they've had an awful lot of success recently but they are, really are a cocky lot."
Leeds are aggressive so you're always quite glad that you've beaten them but .
Is it Brian?
"No, this one's driving a car."
He were looking at that bus.
He might be another one of them from the er   from the council.
"Yeah, well it's, they've done nowt but look at it for last three month."
I like his registration .
Well he parked car there
Mm.
"walked up there right to your house, eyed bus up  and then walked back again."
"Yeah because what they did they  they've done it a few a times though different people, look and see how far it is before it's a blind spot."
Your Bill nearly hit it other week he were telling me.
"I dunno but like er  say the d a driver's coming this way, he wants to see how far down the road it is before it's a blind spot again."
"And if they're from the council or whatever, or whoever does the roads or whatever  they'll probably get in contact with him again."
I should imagine they are from the council.
That weren't too bad that one.
Oh
That was only a oner.
It sounded better.

Wouldn't mind if I could just bloody bring it up.

Yeah.
"You know, all the rusting and everything, they've improved now."
"The Me if he had a Metro now he'd, you'd get a better deal but they said that"
They're cheap though aren't they?
Well yes but not cheap if you have to keep replacing them and
Think he'll probably buy a new car  probably.
photographic  photo service.
How do you spell sergeant?
I've always wondered that.
Is that how you act is that sergeant?
Erm  yes.
It's not S A R?
Er  I think the American version is and I think that's the English version and that's right.
So his name is actually somebody sergeant?
Yeah.
"Ooh I wouldn't mind buying that, look."
"For sale, doesn't say a price though, but look, doesn't half look new doesn't it?"
Where?
Complete new Opel body I reckon he's got there.
T registration but  Opel Manta.
Nice.
Genesis.
Who's that?
Oh that's Phil Collins isn't it.
"This corner here gets worse and worse, traffic lights and yet the traffic"
Yeah.
gets further and further back.
And yet  two or three years ago it used to stop up there.
"Now you stop further, now you're almost stopping on the lights."
"Tell me darling, what have you really had to eat today while I've been away?"
While you've been away?
Had erm  a chopped piece of raw carrot
that's about it.
Are you on a diet?
No.
wait for
Cos I always wait for him if I have a meal that's why.
I'm ever so considerate.
"Did I tell you Steve's car conked out last week, again?"
The Capri?
Yeah.
Points.
No.
Points?
Yeah he had to put new points in.
"Last night he had to put new plugs in, they were brand new before he crashed it weren't they?"
It's probably cos
Could've been.
They refused point blank and he had to take it to another garage.
Did you send another bill?
Yeah.
"No i I phoned insurance up and told them what they'd said, cos I got Maggie to phone, it were Maggie that said, they told Maggie that they were gonna put a second hand wheel on and everything instead of a brand new one so she told insurance  about it ."
"They went mad, they told us that we'd got to take it to National Tyres, took it there, twenty three pound fifty it cost us."
"What's that for, tracking?"
"Tracking and balancing it, none of it were done."
"They had to do the lot so they give us an invoice, we took it in to insurance and they're gonna write a cheque, deduct it off that thing"
Mm.
and send us the cheque back.
Cos they should've done it.
Send you cheque back?
Yeah.
Yes.
activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing.
"Yes cos most,o most of that one barrier, it said on the news that they're o automatic."
That's right.
So
They have er special cameras which  they take the line of the trains both sides.
Mhm.
"And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers  the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you."
So it's a very silly thing to do.
Yes.
Like if it's one metre away and there's a car going across.
Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd probably get across.
"But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come"
"If, if the barriers were down er and you were still on the railway  er th ah  there's only way you can escape."
Go round by the barrier pole.
"Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in Driffield."
Yes.
The barriers
Er

they've got full barriers you see.
Full barriers.
Double are safe.

because he wore a duffel coat instead
Well it's like
That man underneath a duffel coat
What did Ken  say about this chap from Vauxhalls?
"Convena did all his work  and they asked him to go to London  you know, there's some was on years ago  so he goes to the headquarters and he said he just couldn't believe it, he turned on him and said  you're a shallow bloody hypocrite he said!"
Those lads down there they're fighting  living on their ruddy  strike pay  and look at you lot!
He said they were there the whisky was flowing  you know hypocrites!
"And he said, oh come on you're here have a bloody good"
Well
time you know.
on your argument then  anybody who  who works their way up through the ranks and gets to the top  has gotta become corrupted!

"I remember the problem was last time sending those little plans out, the Ormskirk you know?"
"Give them the drawing number so we sent a transmittal note, course we never got a transmittal note back."
It's best to avoid that.
Yeah.
"Erm  right well I think the thing to do is, on  beyond that is to make sure we work through the checklist."
Okay?
"Erm  Now layouts, site layouts."

standard thing that goes to all of them
"we need to write them, warn yeah, and we ask them to let us know what they've got planned don't we?"
Yeah.
So you could send them a letter with a little diagram that
Yeah.
"I wonder how good that is, yes I think that's alright isn't it?"
"Then they wouldn't  they'd understand what we, that meant wouldn't they?"
Yeah but that's got specific things on .
True.
"Yeah well all we did for Ormskirk was, it was just an O S map and we just drew a bloody great circle round it"
and said this is the study area.
That's probably the best thing isn't it?
Yeah.

"Isn't it more difficult now though, if you're homeless?"
Ya.
How do you get time to study?
"Well, you know I, just doesn't really matter any more, the point is surviving."
"But I mean, when I was living with her we just had all these arguments cos, you know, I just never got any peace!"
"There are  sometimes I could find this quiet little  place somewhere and just think, you know, it's really nice."
"But, what about your family?"

And there's so many homeless people that
Mm.

Do you blame them?
"yeah you haven't got, you touch fucking little shit head"
what
"shit head, shit head"
fuck you
"right, oh you don't live on bother, you fucking cheap oh big Jim blouse, cheap back and side"
is that enough information
what?
is that enough?
enough what?
you got enough?
"eh, I, I was supposed to do   well I was suppose to do ten, do you know how many I've done?"
no
"one side, not even one, one side, I'm doing now"
"no, oh Rick, Rick borrow  bikes weren't we?, so how come I done it?"
should of put it on your bike
"oh what?, what?, bung it on and drop it"
"Oh I have really, not, what I've done is I've taped one, one whole side and then I taped over it again by mistake"
oh
"what did  say, she ain't come yet?"
what about if she lets us keep the walkman
mm?
what about if she lets us keep the walkman's
"yeah, yeah, that'll be wicked"
"she wouldn't, I know she ain't  never do that"
is your tape recording?
yeah
oh no
"when a country makes a produc a product, whether it'll be fruit or food or, er clothes and sells them to another country  what is that called?"
"don't look at him, I've written the answer down  when a country buys the two, Mark take your coat off, give me your walkman, not suppose to bring to school"
it's a thing sir
they make
animals and crops
Yeah within the nearest place with  a biggish
With a  yeah.
football team possibly yeah.
Anyway
Right.
Right so er
I think that's everything.
Yeah.
"So if I get it laid out again then, you know"
"Yeah fine erm but as I say it's just sort of you know kind of minor layout changes, that's all I was suggesting"
Yeah.
"so you know at a pinch you could probably run it like that and I don't suppose anybody would notice the difference but, you know, just in terms of you know making things look attractive"
Right.
"erm  so  you know but you may find if you give, print off a few and give them to a few people over the weekend"
Mm.
you may find that some additional changes occur to you
Mm.
which you might want to incorporate anyway so you may not want to print off another version anyway
Yeah.
so er
"Erm oh yeah the other thing was  it's two sided at the moment, is that"
Mm.
best or do you think
Erm generally speaking the consensus is it helps if it's sort of on one side
Oh right.
but how you do your original is up to you I mean it's just what we ask for from reprographics and you know they do single sided
Okay yeah.
"double sided, collated, stapled"
"different coloured paper and all, you know, all this sort of thing"
Yeah.
"so er erm  er  so that's  no, is there anything else we need to worry about  with regard to that?"
Er no I don't think so.
Pretty good!
So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all wasn't it really?
Eh?
All that
And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so
Have you got to pass for the stage then?
Yeah.
I used an
What
old one.
"So  those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I just turned mine  turned mine round she saw it and went  she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't  thought it perhaps a different pass but it wasn't  just turned it round on her."
"I bet your  friends a will be  sick then, won't they?"
"I just think that when you're up there it's like the stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long one!"
And there must have been about ten thousand there last time.
They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in  and you can spin round.
Oh yeah!
"They had one of those in there  but I didn't have a go on it though, it was about three quid to go on!"
Those lasers  lasers that   the .
Velcro walls?
"No, they didn't have that there."
"A huge octopus,octopus  -ish, had these massive  tentacles that's going right the way across the ceiling!"
Video screens.
Very good!
They're all gonna be pissed on Friday cos we got in for nothing!
Why is your voice so quiet?
Cos  the washing machine out there  it's .
What sort of smoke  from the machine?
Hiss!
Oh it's ?
No !
What hissing?
Proper smoke machine.
"But the people who  Q T S course, have got a lot of work."
Have they?
"Mm, much more than me."
I'm glad I'm not doing that.
Really?
Loads of assignments have been set already.
"They're really quite heavily bogged down, and they were to do them all, er one day at school."
"Really, bloody hell."
Yeah the teachers seem to do nothing do they?
Really?
"I mean, Ann finished lectures, Ann's finished lectures yesterday, she's a secondary teacher and she doesn't have a lecture again until after Christmas."
Really?
"And she's got another two weeks off now, until she goes into schools and then she's in the schools full-time, but even so, she won't have, she didn't have exams."
"She had exams last January, didn't she, and she hasn't had exams since last January, she won't have until next  during June."
Really?
"And like, she has, like, although she's doing secondary teaching, she has it easier than anybody."
Mm.
"At this stage, anyway."
"I mean, it'll probably get harder."
"I wouldn't mind doing that, if there was, if I could do secondary teaching."
Really?
Mm.
"But I wouldn't wanna do primary or junior, just"
"Well do, would you be, is it T T S, secondary, T T S, weren't it?"
"No, but"
primary
"Well, in T T S"
T T S they can't do secondary.
Only do primary and junior.
"Oh, no in, in our college they're doing secondary."
"Cos I asked them about it, and they said  I'd much rather be doing that."
"Mm, yeah I would really."
Yeah.
Go on then.
"Why people think it's noisy for us on a double main road, but it ain't really."
"Well, you get used it in don't ya."
"When our Norma come and stop here, she she was,"
Used to sleep
I don't know how you sleep all night with all that traffic going up and down.
No.
But we never hear it.
You don't hear it.
"No, we didn't."
"I remember one  first night we stopped there, buses were coming at crack of dawn,"
Yeah.
"it must have been about four or five o'clock in morning, and now we never hear any traffic."
No.
No.
Perhaps you get used to.
Yeah.
"But we don't hear many people, on a road like that."
No.
"I were thinking about that bungalow, and, well actually it's as far from  our road, nearly as far from our road to there, as what is it from bungalow window to road."
Where to  yeah.
it really is
"Know, thinking about people walking back as far as t' shopping my point."
"There nowt much difference in, from t' garden"
"I think the only trouble over there, is your to gonna have people parking in front of ya gate, like when they go to the chip shop."
They won't
Yeah.
"They won't 'cos 'cos er, I'm afraid if they do, I shall be out straight away at 'em."
"Well, it's only a matter of parking at, parking your own car as well"
"I'll clamp the bugger, I'll buy a wheel clamp and wheel clamp it."
Park here at your risk.
"And everything's very nice , lovely!"
Mm.
"Because you want the right size  join  what you put in  they hadn't got any, no more of these"
No I said to Geoff well I hope he don't come back.
Who?
They're supposed to
"That bloke, I don't want him coming"
.
"Well dear you won't worry, I'll shall soon tell him to !"
"You ought to  you ought to say to him, I shall ring the police, you come round here any more!"
"people in the, in the  bay I wouldn't"
No I'm not!
"I don't want him, it worried me that he might come and bother your mother."
Yeah.
No!
There's no  this time.
I can stick up for myself!
Oh!
So he won't  you just don't
I did that
I know you can.
old bloke!
"End of the day   and if you don't let him in, he don't have to have any"
No.
anyway!
"Well I tell you something if he ke , if he does start to hassle us I shall ring the police and I shall tell them!"
Mm.
I should use
"I shan't have no qualms about it, I shall say well he's hassling  me and my mother-in-law and we can do without it!"
"That old boy that I spoke to, when his  he was with his daughter, I said you give me my bloody keys and you  money!"
I gotta move!
I said well there's a wheelbarrow down there mate!
Ours is gonna us about a thousand pound for insurance.
Oh.
"Well, a thousand pounds not a lot, Karen, but er  it all depends what the, what what you gonna be insured for?"
It's not.
"I mean, even that, you're gonna you you gonna be insured for breaking in and break-ins and"
"Yeah, I think it's everything."
I think it's
"That's what I mean, so what you're actually getting for your, thousand pound isn't a lot of money."
No.
"I think it's covered for like, like you say, like for some reason, say you had a fire, and you had to stop work."
Yeah.
I think it's covered for that.
"Covered for personal injury, er, covered for hundred thousand, for like, that's what trailers,they've got  trailers in."
It's covered for everything.
"I mean, you imagine somebody breaking in and setting fire to a trailer."
"I mean, it's a lot of money when you think Norma's paying nine hundred pound just for her car."
For that Cabriolet.
"To me, you think phew a thousand pound, but cer I mean, it's it ain't really very much, no."
It's a high insurance for a car.
What for car?
yeah.
Right
"What how how comes that, then?"
"Because, well, Cabriolet's are classed as dangerous, aren't they, because they're  soft roofed."
"Oh, aye."
It's not got no
"Aye, this"
"Yeah,she's only been driving a year, two years."
"Soft top, yeah."
Yeah.
"Well, I mean, look at our Connie's."
Yeah.
I didn't know women were allowed to go.
"and er just at the very end all you could see was her  and your man, the hologram  and he'd just been killed about five minutes earlier."
So he could have saved himself but he didn't want to.
The hologram?
Aye.
And did he not save himself then?
No.
Did he die?
But then how can  go on.
Cos he's still he's still a hologram.
Hologram.
So that's how he died then?
Aye.
Well it's funny
Remember he tried to stab his wife
I cried my eyes out at that!
at the very start of last night there was this guy water skiing
"big massive fat woman right, and she was just walking about this conference, you know where she's not supposed to be, and all these shoulders  stab her right?"
And then
Shoulders?
"Soldiers, right, stab her and they're all dying and then you see the head like  it's just all dressed up in these things and it's Arnie underneath it  and he takes the head off"
and it closes up again and he goes  chew this or something  blows up and then Arnie gets
"No there's a scene in Terminator, he's like wood and metal, in this new Terminator"
Yeah
it is absolutely brilliant the way they do it.
What was that what was that
Well you'd run a mile
Oh aye.
That one er under the water
The Little Mermaid  no.
"it is fucking brilliant,in a monkey suit."
Oh a cartoon?
Do they still do it?
the P E teacher is supposedly collecting aluminium cans and  we've been through various daft schemes of stopping the children from throwing the cans everywhere because we've got this coke machine.
And we even had one where they paid a ten p deposit  on a can so they paid forty p instead of thirty or whatever.
And I got hardly any cans back.
Or they did was b buy them from the school canteen where they were still thirty!
And the coke machine wasn't used.
Well why not er encourage the canteen to charge forty
They didn't  but then they had
as well?
"Well, they won't because they they they have to make money in order to survive."
The more money they make the better for them.
They have to run it as a business now.
For profit I'm afraid.
Er oh I did have one Polish lad who's now left who used to go round looking for all the cans and he'd  then collect the ten p's!
scheme folded.
Through lack of support.
So what else is mentioned here?
I think that  still holds.
"And I can check, I will go and ."
And car batteries is the same.
Other batteries I'll check.
Pills er  you check
Yeah.
.
Furniture erm  yeah I think that's.
Is there a second hand furniture shop now in Bishop's Stortford?
There is one isn't there?
Is there one down by the Causeway?
Yes there is.
Who is going to check that?
Well I can check it.
Yeah.
can see that coming now.
But Birmingham must have won today cos they had equal top  must have won I would have thought.
That's good.
Chelsea won one nil.
How do you know?
You'd have thought Forest would have beaten Chelsea wouldn't you?really annoyed after being
Yeah.
I suppose so.
What are you gonna buy mum?
He's gone the whole hog that guy  hanging down to his
Oh.
So what are you gonna buy her?
Newbury Fruits?
"Or something like that, er"
They did very well with those little tulip hand out  things didn't they?
"There's a lot of people who er don't, who would not have gone to the bother of going into the shop and buying a one pound or two pound or four pound"
But why did they do well out of them if they were free?
Well yeah they're free but they've got their advert on it haven't they?
Tulip
"tulip tulip, I mean  you're like a roving little advert aren't you?"
"I mean it, it draws your eye those little pictures doesn't it?"
You
"Oh he's got, he's got the hanging one at the front hasn't he?"
And he's got a badge on the right hand side as well.
Yeah.
So he really is
You see that guy next to us?
He's got a Palace earring hasn't he?on one of his ears.
Oh my goodness.
On his left ear.
"He's nice though isn't he, wasn't he, he did say something"
Yeah.
See they'll maintain that
Yeah that's right!
Social security .
I said you're paid the same.
No.
Social security is when you haven't got no money  and he has got money.
Well I ain't got any but they won't give me any!
Well that's like when older people when they save for their  retirement and that  you know
Yeah.
they can't get things cheap like bus passes and all that can they?
No.
"Well  Well I think, I, I don't think it pays you to save up  er"
No.
for your retirement and so you'll be comfortable off  cos you might as well live off your state like everybody else.
Yeah.
You might
"as well enjoy your money as you go along, why bother to have any!"
They were saying on the television the other day
Why bother!

"Well I certainly isn't going to, Sarah!"
The new tax law thing
I shall get as much out the system as I can mate!
Me me.
Well I told you that.

Help!
"bring this new tax, but instead of poll tax and community charge and that  it's gonna be like a new erm  property tax."
"Oh yeah, I think I've heard of that."
"And er  what they're saying that, sort of, you get people, shall we say, older people who"
He's
are retired so they got no income  and then perhaps been left the house
Yeah.
right?
"So he's walking about, the shorts are this wide"
the rest of it's like this here  he runs into the water and he's    into the water like   Him and Bobby  used to
God love him.

Petey  and Bobbie  used to dive off the top board like
Aye.

Total wanker
"I mean there's Jody  and all those  like and they're a real dipstick, they have balls but that wee kid is just so  unbelievably stupid like, he was just like"
Who?

You just flip on your back like and
"you get these jocks that get up there, big  and they think they are so cool and then"
"Big fat massive hairy chest, hairy chest, tiny swimming trunks"
Yeah.
"that is my seat by the way, erm"
"hairy chest, bit of a sun tan, they've bee they were away last summer"
hanging over the
"oh like  totally over, that's why he doesn't need to wear t too many swimming trunks cos you can't see anything anyway"
"runs along  splash, doesn't even make it, make it round, he just  and goes like this and then, and then lands in the water like that."
Well this guy's jumped off the second board and done a belly flop
Ooh fuck!
Ooh
"and he  he got up and he was totally, totally red."
It was totally red
"oh  ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, and everybody in the whole pool heard it just go   everybody was going  ooh!"
Oh fuck!
Betty.
Mm.
Unfortunately there seems to be a resurgence of  of this now doesn't there  in Europe?
Yes.
This right wing element which is
Terrible!
"It's frightening really because you think well  you know, I mean  you said the years well that couldn't happen"
Well
again but  but how long does it take before it does happen again?
"I mean, do the other  do these things happen in cycles and tha you know, is it possible that it'll happen again on a greater scale?"
A grand
Well
"scale, if you like?"
"it er  I mean, it's  having grounds now because of the recession!"
Yes.
"That is, that"
Yes.
is what brought it about er in
Setting the stage for
"in one way, in in"
"Although it hasn't  it hasn't come to that in Germany, I mean we'll probably be the poor man of Europe at the moment aren't we?"
In this country?
"Ah but, I mean it's biting in Germany now because they've got all East Germans!"
"That's  yes, yes, that's true."
Biting before that weren't it?
Where
Erm
"they've had to close down the spi ,and that."
"and of course, when, when they  when"
This of course is exacerbated.
but  the going gets tough it's  it's easy to blame minority groups and this is what happened before wasn't it?
"Like on the ruddy  that's all they're doing now, bringing all these Turks and God knows what!"
That's right.

You see one stayed but he was there before him and the other one carried on.
No they would never they would never blend together.
Mm.
Like whiskies  blend .
No no they would never.
They were they were very very fine people.
And and the tinkers that came there.
Mhm.
Er wouldn't want to but from from  there was there was one lot.
And there were and the women folk would have their haberdashery and the men were tin smiths.
They would make pails and basins like you were being requiring in your sc er scullery or in the milk house as you would keep milk there.
So they were all and very industrious looking.
But they had for the winter time they their houses to go to.
Mm.
And they were just coming round in the summer.
Mm.
And their horses and my word they fairly looked after their animals mhm.
Did the crofting people have any special name for the the tinkers?
Not really no.
You've never heard the term summer walker?
Er er no no I could never say that.
Or mystery folk or?
Er well
Celts.
as the years came on they were beginning to get mystery fo folk but er not in my time.
Well that sort of people that was coming.
"I know erm  I thought I wrote to the electricity board in, I wrote to somebody  about erm how er things should be labelled about how efficient they are when using electricity."
You took part in the er electricity efficiency didn't you?
Yes.
"Yeah but didn't, we didn't write to our MPs though."
I thought we were
"supposed to write to somewhere else  was it  the department of the environment or  now what would it be, energy?"
"We wrote, wrote to them cos I've got a reply to that letter somewhere with a great wad of information"
about various fridges and
"Yeah, yeah"
and things.
Yeah
So I can't really say we've written to the MP can we?
We haven't found out about company car fleets have we?
We tried.
Well I tried and then I was let down by the group.
I don't remember anything about that one
We arranged it  two days or three days and each was cancelled
March ninety one?
. In March this year?
It was this year.
Last year.
Last year.
I didn't think we'd done anything about that this year.
But that was last year.
Yeah.
But we haven't done a march  ninety one then.
Scanned the local press for power station applications or authorizations  H M I P.
Written to Michael Heseltine about acid rain?
May ninety one.
Written to your MP to ask him her to press for strict E C standards for C O two emissions from vehicles May ninety one.
when was that?
Wasn't that on the talk?
Mm.
They were talking  pedestrianizing
"I think that's been on, on the cards for a long time hasn't it?"
Yeah.
Pedestrianizing and they've never done it.
Sorry!
Erm  Wh have we done anything about the environmental charter?
Because I  started doing it a long time ago
"Yeah, yeah Bob did that didn't he?"
It vaguely Yeah and we presented it and then it fizzled.
The group  fizzled out because we presented the charter.
And that was the aim of
It asks here have they adopted it?
Erm
wouldn't or we aim to still try.
Well  .
"I I think, I've a funny feeling that  did  adopt it but quite how much that means I don't understand."
"Well it's awful, having to do this  questionnaire we, we've done ."
All these workshops that have been going on that we haven't been to.
Well they just kind of recognized the principles don't they but they don't ensure that they'll actually put them into practise.
That's what adopting means  it's not actually committing .
"Yes I thought they had, yes."
How about these questions.
Does the group have a constitution?
No.
Does the group have an office?
No.
We've got our plastic box!
Plastic?
"I know I know everybody will be disappointed but I couldn't get  cardboard ones, stick it all in."
We bought the storage boxes anyway to keep all the .
No but you can't really I mean that's what  supposed to have it like an actual proper office.
okay
"Hey bud, where you going?"
I was supposed to be going home
"Example a thousand pound  normally two and forty eight pounds, now only forty eight pounds"
What?
D'you think it's the wheel of fortune?
"Well it says it is, it's been"
It's a whole page spread  from such an established reputable company.
"All prices are fully inclusive of double glazing, grade one security p v c delivered ."
I don't know.
It doesn't say anywhere there's a guarantee  .
Cheshire.
I wonder if it's the same address as when we got ours?
Well we should have guarantee somewhere in the box there
"I mean it's it's, how long is it since it was supposed to have gone bust?"
Well it's years since I thought it had gone bust
I thought it was about ten years
Wasn't there somebody from  who got
I can't remember.
"When we got that, when we had ours and er they said if you if you found someone else who would like who would have  you would get seventy five pounds back and you gave the thing, who was it who was thinking about it?"
Was it erm what did they call?
Isabel?
Isabel?
.
Wasn't it her?
"It might have been, I can't remember"
Wasn't it just before or after her husband died?
It's been that long I don't know.
Her husband died when we were .
It couldn't have been that.
No.
Well I phoned Shirley and she said she's fine.
You will
the reason why we're the reason why we're doing this now is is to
Right.
try and achieve that objective.
Mm.
Not t to drop it straight on them but to say.
"look, this is one we're introducing this is the way we in in intend to use it."
Mm.
"I mean there might be the odd situation, the big job, where the Q S would need to go and"
Right.
get involved in the measures on some of your work.
Well he doesn't.
That's what I'm saying.
He hasn't done yet.
"You can't have that, he doesn't."
Have a word with Dave  and ask him himself
Dave Dave was a party to this s
"D Dave, Dave wrote this"
procedure.
did the change.
Well you may be certain he didn't consult with me.
Yeah.
And that's the point I'm making.
Mm.
"These procedures should be manag you know part of management consultation, not part of the  Dave writes it, if he like says, well that's what we'll do for B E S, and then, and then I'm told, oh, that's what we do for B E S, I tell staff, and that causes a great deal of unrest in staff."
Hey Jim why?
Why
back on him?
Jim.
Cos I haven't had an opportunity to do it to
"Why should B E S be a different, a different situation from bridges or works?"
"Well in, in theory certainly probably there is no reason for it, but in practice, it hasn't happened yet this is the point."
It would be beager
"It would be beager , but what is G and E say itself"
G isn't it?
"Yeah, so you've really got to protect, you've got to protect that I, okay, so can you put bigger in a sentence Trevor?"
"Erm, er er the man was bigger than the boy"
"A man was bigger than the boy, good."
Charlie the next one
Erm parents
Yes
I love my parents
"Oh I am pleased, I love my parents, good, spare, spare"
"I let someone borrow my spare pencil, I let someone borrow my spare pencil"
Prepare
"Prepare, what does that mean?"
"Erm, you prepare something"
Can you put it in a sentence for me?
I prepare for my music exam
"I prepare for my music exam, if you're going to do prepare, what are you going to put on the end?"
"Yes I would care for when I had to do something, rather than just go straight into that, good"
Giggle
"Giggle, mm, we know all about that don't we?"
I giggle when somebody
I giggle when somebody
erm
"no if you say giggle you're actually saying the present tense, so giggles"
Giggles
"giggles would be better, because it sounds as if they've already chosen"
"we all have a giggle, yes it can be a giggle until, if you're using giggle and a giggle what sort of word is it?"
"a noun, yeah, if you use giggles, then Ashley what sort of words is it then?"
"What, oh dear, oh"
"It's not an oh dear word, no"
It's a verb
Has Barney got little little legs
Mm.
a little bit bigger don't ya.
Look at that flaming dog.
"Come on, come on, throw them over there."
"I wonder if there's any way you can actually check, you know, where he is, is there any way that"
"Watch me tea, now."
"straight out, or,"
"Well, what what do you think erm,"
Are you worried about how much money it's gonna cost ya.
"No, because money's cost us less."
"Er, you know when they said we had to pay two hundred and fifty one for er, administration and search and survey."
"It's come back, and it's under two hundred."
"Can I have a cup of tea, please."
Then they said I've got to pay five hundred pounds for
"Do what, love."
I don't think Allied Dunbar will deal with anybody that's dodgy.
No.
"Er,"
"Now, watch that tea."
Yeah.
That's what he said.
Are you ready.
I don't think they'd deal with anybody that dodgy.
Er.
Bert.
"Are you doing alright, are ya."
"What they do, they look they look around and they weigh up up pros and cons up, and it it's like these insurance brokers, they ring all over to buy cheapest insurance for you, well, that's what Allied Dunbar are doing."
"Well, well, this is a broker, but it's a  broker, so that's"
Yeah.
"You see, what it is, it's where they've been behind with their mortgage, we will pay a slightly higher rate, but it's only"
Yeah.
"I don't want any more s in instances where the quantity surveyor thinks he's got a certain fee that he's working to, only to find out later"
Hear hear.
on that somebody's knocked it down by half and not told him.
"Because that causes all sorts of problems on the  report and, and bad blood all round."
Course it did
It's not what team work's
"I mean I, no."
"I would reiterate that my objective is a very simple one, and that is to give the client the most cost-effective service we can."
"Er with this instruction, it will get picked up on the quality"
Co in accordance
er check list.
Good.
Good.
"Could I could I, could I ask that B E S be taken off the distribution codes."
We do not use quantity surveyors for that purpose and indeed the quantity surveyor is not geared up to do any measurement for us.
So you want that
The answer to that is
rewriting then?
No.
Because I think that there should be no reason why the Q S shouldn't provide you with that service in the same way as he provides anybody else Jim.
Unless there's
"But he's, but he's not geared up to do it."
But you've got erm a  Q S then.
We have.
I'm not too sure that means  .
"Well I think, I think  bloody robots"
we all were.
in there like.
electrical  away isn't it?
Mis yeah.
Mister Metal.
That's wound the buggers up.
If we do this it will be a lot more meaningful.
Is that acceptable?
Yeah.
One point
Fine.
that occurred to me where we could
"perhaps give them some flexibility, is that we could say, if that's not acceptable to you, we will delay invoicing."
"Cos now we don't have to pay interest on our fees,i if, if, if a jam's spread over six months a a a and it might risk and slip to nine months, we might do better to offer to jam spread it over nine months and only invoice for part of the money."
Mm.
Don't like the sound of that.
Er
"the project engineer sits down and manually, let's be honest."
No.
Cos he's gonna just divide it by the number and it's it's
It's it's a very minor part of the operation.
Mm.
I think you've got a little bit careful with lots of our jobs which have got
very very small fees attached to them.
Yeah.
Yes.
which
"It's, it's hardly worth doing."
"at the present time we're saying to  on the monthly report we're saying to the client, we've spent three thousand out of five thousand, and their anticipated final cost is going to be five thousand."
Yeah.
And i he knows when we're actually gonna finish the job and therefore
Mm.
he can almost do that sum himself.
Yes.
I agree.
Er er I think on a bigger job i it it's perhaps a different story.
The trouble is Dennis a lot of our
little jobs.
Well Traidcraft's got loads to sell.
Not doing very well are you
No!
because I have this  erm dilemma.
Whether to just photocopy off a very good  original
Yeah
or do we print the whole lot.
And we came to the conclusion it was cheaper to print
Oh
than photocopy.
What  it's a bit slow isn't it?
"Yeah it depends, well you can get get it to run through copies but  the problem is that the cartridges for these printers they, they cost about fifty pounds."
Mm
They're not cheap.
So if I can do one run and then photocopy it.
Mm.
It a is actually a lot better because you can get them usually get them down to about  five p a copy.
"Well won't you lose, lose definition on the drawing though with a laser printer?"
No.
No?
No it's even better
Oh that's alright.
"Okay, no it's, I'm just going by the one at school and it, because it's all made up of little dots you"
"No, this is a laser printer."
This does it absolutely  it's not a dot printer it's it is a laser printer .
"Oh, well he keeps calling it his laser printer!seen it in action we don't see that well."
"So you, you said you could do it for five p a copy?"
"Well I r , I r , I reckon I reckon you can down to that, yeah."
That's printing both sides.
Yeah.
double sided printer and I I'll try and get that verified but
I think we could sell it I think we could sell it for
A word.
"It was, well it is, you, you stick in pieces of articles, into a book, you're collecting them."
Just any articles?
"Well, they have to correspond to the lecture, so  the lecture this week was, world population."
Had to so it.
"Like the world,"
And business?
the world.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And then, you have to get to about three to four articles on that."
I don't know where I'm gonna get them from.
And then
World in
"It, it gets a bit easier, because they go on to like health, age, I know I'll be able to find loads to stuff on age, won't I?"
"World population, erm probably what I'm gonna have to do is, although they, they said you can't do it  don't get any ideas about doing it with  because it's not possible."
It is possible
Mm.
"cos if I find that I can't find something, I'll just have to look like"
Keep looking as you're going along
"Yeah, do you know what I mean?"
"So, that's what  is."
"And it's just like, and they want you to make some comment on what you've worked out, which is no problem really, is it?"
"Do you know that newspaper that they brought out, the European, and it's like, just to, just to"
Yeah.
take you through the whole of Europe.
Yeah.
"like world issues, then,"
Yeah.
Because
"I know the Telegraph always have a lot of foreign, foreign news."
"But that's what, but The Sunday Times has always got a world news section at the back in it."
They seemed quite wide to me when they were leaning against the wall.
Wouldn't Sue do them?
She hasn't got a
hasn't she?
"I bet she had, I bet she had er"
no I know she's got a
You really want one with a three
I thought she had a band saw no
I was gonna say you wobbling all over the place aren't you?
And what about Duckman Peters wouldn't they do it for you?
"Er, mm, the other time I took stuff down there"
"huge, to that their costs mm"
I'll have to pay
mm you've got to pay for the teeth and the saw
thirty pound a tooth
"Yeah, god worse than"
erm
"mm, how many have you got to now cut?"
"and you mean to tell me with all that equipment the machine that they've got at the college, you couldn't get it done there?"
"I haven't got anything that deep, the"
only goes to about five inches
"What can you do, can you do half at a time, can you"
No
Why?
"at one time you could of done, but now, you've got to take the guards off"
To reverse them
and turn it over
"Well I don't see how, all you've got to do is turn it upside down, you could still run it through the same way"
To make your first cut
Yeah
you have to take the guard off and the
"knife at the back of the saw, they, it is a bit dangerous, erm  where's the guard goes at the top"
"if you said I made a suggestion, what sort of word would that be?"
"Come on, you're all asleep, now a suggestion what would that be?"
A nou
"Yes come on Charlie be brave, a noun, yes, a something isn't it, a, if you write a or the in front of a word it's usually a noun, okay, so just keep listening for the a and the."
"The next one, Trevor"
Erm beware
"Beware, right and a sentence please"
Beware of Frankenstein
Beware of Frankenstein.
Charlie
Erm
third one down
I had a nightmare last night
You had a nightmare last night.
What happened in your nightmare?
Don't know
Come back to life again
because when you woke up this morning
and the next one
Juggle
Juggle
"Erm, I know a clown that juggles"
I know a clo a clown that juggles.
"Why couldn't you actually have J U G, one G, L E?"
why couldn't you have the spelling J U G L E?
Something would happen to the L
Something would happen not to the L but to the vowel.
"Hello  I'm terribly busy Norma actually, I've got a full lesson at the minute, erm, I'll, I'll try and, and sort that out as soon as I've finished this lesson"
"okay, thanks for telling me Norma"
"thank you, bye ."
Jugle
"Yes because what happens when you've got just a very thin L, the magic E can even work through it, U, right, so it will be jugle , yeah,jugle , that wouldn't be the right pronunciation at all, okay, let's go on to the next one"
"Most graphs will keep going on up, and there's a tendency for people to make them come back down again"
Mm.
or at least to where they started.
That means it's going backwards.
"Erm  now you don't do, paper three, you don't do  velocity time graphs, but you probably do them in physics don't you?"
You would do them in physics.
It's just like pure coincidence.
Aha!
Oh that's a good one that.
Revising it yesterday to be honest.
That's a good one.
got all pictures in it.
"Yes it has, but these are, those are, I've seen those before and they are very nice graphs, I would recommend them to anyone."
Right.
"So, you were revising them yesterday."
Should I
"Well the big thing, ah."
"See, it's very easy to get confused between distance against time, speed against time, and even acceleration against time."
"Yeah, because I mean it had them in our exam,"
Right.
"in our mock, we had like those four pictures, and you had to say which was"
"It comes up time and time again, and you have to know the difference between the different types."
"So  you also, when you get used to each type individually, need to then be able to switch between"
Mm.
between one and the other.
Yeah.
"So if we've got erm  acceleration against time and we get, no, no peeping."
No peeping.
"We get a flat one, what does that mean?"
"It's  Every one second, you've gone further."
We haven't gone anywhere
we've measured the acceleration.
"Thank you, it's a verb, right, to do something, so it's the same spelling that can be used in different ways."
What about the next one
Goggles
Goggles
I wore my goggles in the swimming pool
"I wore my goggles in the swimming pool, good"
"Right, the next one"
"Erm, trigger"
Yes
A man pulled the trigger on his gun and shot him
yes absolutely
Luggage
Luggage
"Erm, I had to have my luggage checked at the airport"
"I had to have my luggage checked at the airport, you see what's happened to the end of that word, look at it  right, you've got age at the end because what rule is working there?"
Got a double G
Pardon?
Got a double g
"No have a look, you're only looking at the beginning of it  here try again"
It's got the E on the end
And what sort of E is that?
"Not the magic, magic E"
"Yes it's the magic E, isn't it, and what's it making that A say?"
"A as opposed to U isn't it, so it's really like lugg age so if you say it quickly together it becomes luggage, yeah, okay, the next one, oh sorry put it in a sentence"
Suggest
Suggest
"erm, I, I have to suggest that the erm the had er"
"mm, that's right, I had to suggest the captain's orders."
I suggested
"how, what would you put on the end of suggested?"
E D
"E D, even though when we say it, it sounds like"
"Changes in job specifications, personnel changes."
Reinforced ones
Alright  changes in job spec
I  procedures were introduced.
Any others?
backlog
Okay.
"Yeah, erm"
By examining people's body language .
"We're not going to that one now, cos I haven't examined your body language I'm not really interested."
"Erm right, difficult one that it's like the body language after what?looking at  do some work."
Amazing
"Yes, thank you for that precise definition there."
"What was that, sorry?"
"Yeah you wanna see if they can do it or not you can tell if somebody, if you give somebody something to do  body language you can normally"
Yeah  sit at their desk .
"Now the thing about positives, when  identify you know somebody might have training."
Now be positive about it.
When they've been promoted to a high ranking job.
"Right, promotion."
"And if you've got somebody who's gonna be promoted or you think might be promoted in a couple years' time, or even yeah less than that, well what should you be doing?"
you ever heard a succession plan is?
"Er you probably don't do it  erm  you know er so brazenly probably the back of your mind but again key staff, you are key staff er yeah if you actually prepare somebody to take over your job when you're not there sort of thing."
So in a way it's a succession plan.
What other things might come out?
What do we do once a year?
Review.
What?
Review.
Review.
"Anything else, appraisals, yeah things like that?"
Anyone else .
It just cannot work every time.
Right.
"The on the, the, the, the procedures should be flexible er written in such a flexible way"
Yeah.
that those idiosyncrasies of the different sections can be accommodated.
Th they should reflect the best practice shouldn't they?
Yes.
"The best practice in, sometimes in M and E is, is quite different from the best practice in the"
Mm.
civils.
Right.
Le okay.
"We can talk genera generalities till the, the cows come home."
"I believe that, that that procedure could apply to you the same as it can to Roger and Terry"
Yeah.
and Dennis and Alan.
"Er and if, if y if there is a resource problem then you David and I need to address that"
Mm.
erm and find a solution.
"If when we address it we find that th the procedure is inappropriate, then we should change the procedure."
I agree with you .
Mm?
Yeah.
Okay?
"Er D two stop three, receipt of appointment contracts."
"Erm what we're trying to do here is to get the clerical sections more involved in the projects, and in passing the paper backwards and forwards."
"Er and we're identifying that the clerical sections are required to do a certain number of things when the project arrives, like erm recording the project in the index book, creating a correspondence file, creating project admin wallets, and the like."
So it's sort of er three things we're trying to do there.
"What, what was the reference of the urgent work one?"
"I, I've got that down as D two point three"
Was it three point two?
Mm.
because it will be very complex.
"If you want to, if you start building a system that's gonna record every variation that's issued to the client and"
Make it simple.
print it all back again.
M see if we can make it
Yeah.
fairly simple.
"Could I just say at this point, this, this is one area where I would envisage us looking critically at what we're doing and, and, and, and altering things quite significantly over the next six months."
Keep it simple and build up on it
Beca
if we need to rather
Yeah.
than go the other way.
"Mainly because we're doing, we're trying to read the client's mind at the moment."
And w we we're putting together what we think the client wants.
"What I'm looking for is feedback from the clients which say, yeah, these reports are alright as far as they go but really I don't want all that information or I want this information."
Or
"And I would hope that we, we we enter into that with th that spirit and"
Mm.
"we're prepared to look at the the client reports and change them so that they become as good as we, we can get them."
Yeah.
Is there anything within these
It is the first step.
for the prediction of fees?
I mean we've just
Yes.
got something back from Intercity  on the P S work where they're wa wishing us to predict to certain date what we're gonna be spending over the next six months.
Nine months.
the football ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well
"They're not very flattering  they didn't er, you weren't rated very highly I'm afraid  I think er  you tried to get away from the traditional type of"
Oh I see these one that they send in
Mm
Yes I er
by the thousands
I don't go a lot on them myself
"Oh poetry   some of those poems that Bon had in her Touchstones book, especially the ones, the war, about the war, I read some of those and it made me cry, it was so sad."
"Oh the, the er the ones by erm what's name"
about the gas and that
Oh to be honest I can't remember the
"Mm, very poignant"
"Mm, but er"
anti war
what was the one about the erm  oh  it was about the assembling of the gun
"Oh yes, oh"
do you remember that?
And it's all about the parts naming oh naming the parts
That's right yes
and er
Oh yes that one's come back to me that one now
Mm
horrible.
"There's a chap going on about the, the fake and the furniture of these two chairs"
Mm
which are supposed to be erm
Come here
seventeenth century
come here scallywag
"They said to this, the er, the shape of the stretchers going from side to side where you, where you can put your feet usually"
Mm
you've got all this wear on them you see and the bow of these stretchers said that no one would a able to get their feet on
and the guy that's faked it has done all this
"No, it even says in here, it says look, there well may be groups of supporters in different categories who'd like to arrange seats together, unfortunately not be able to do this unless you are prepared to wait until the end of the main selling period"
Alright
They won't be able to do that to be honest cos they're not gonna go are they?
I don't know
"Eighty thousand, eighty thousand"
Oh about time to
"Boo, who's he?"
"Come on, come on"
You want a chew?
Take one of these they'll make you feel better  oh no don't this is

"If they got, if they're not gonna win tonight, if they don't beat Bolton I'm gonna tear my season ticket up look  ah"
You're not even a season holder are you?
So you're looking for attention probably more than anything.
So attention seeking's one thing.
Have a good time.
Sorry?
To have a good time.
"Okay, you could  what, what would you be hoping to achieve during that good time?"
"Have a few laughs, what else though?"
What other things do you hope or do you think might happen shall we say?
To meet some nice people to go on holiday with.
"Right, meeting people."
Things like romance are very important with holidays.
"I mean, you all know about the image the cruiseliners have with wealthy widows and things like that."
"The Club Eighteen Thirty idea is much along similar lines, and if you look at a Club Eighteen Thirty brochure, the sort of activities people do together, bringing people together."
So this is all an important element.
Cuisine.
"Right, cuisine could be an important motivating factor."
Er basically stuffing yourself to excess for two weeks.
Drinking yourself to excess for two weeks for peanuts.
"Again, that would be something."
"But in general the people who are doing some of those things, a lot of it's probably escapism  certain type, complete break from their work."
What other things do you think you would hope to get as a result of your holiday?
Time to relax.
Right.
"Okay time to perhaps to relax, to reflect."
see various water sports
"Okay, so you can improve your prowess at windsurfing."
"And certainly there's the fitness, activity side, that can be an important motivating thing."
What else will you do on holiday?
All we've talked about so far is drinking and lying on a beach.
Sorry?
Sightseeing.
"Right, sightseeing."
The
I
only re yes by all means
our project quality plan check list reflects that.
.
Naturally your
Mm.
your way out is to get
"D Dave  to write a letter, saying for all projects I wish him to do"
Y no.
No.
No.
"Terry, Terry there's no point."
"All all that, all that"
That is stupid.
All that Jim's trying to do
the reason why
Is to change
"I, I don't mean that in a disrespectful way."
No.
No.
I know but
"It, it, it, it is stupid in, in so far as the more sens if we were gonna do that, all you'd do is you'd write"
the procedures in a different way.
Yeah.
The procedures
"were written in this way, because erm there was a move from a certain part of the organization to exclude the Q Ss from elements of work on an unreasonable to an unreasonable extent."
"Now if we work as a team and we work very sensibly and reasonably, it may wo may well be that the most sensible way of working is for the project engineer to decide who's gonna do the site measure."
But at the end of the day these guys sign off price correct.
"These guys therefore must have a facility of ensuring that the price is correct, from an internal control point of view I want them to be involved in certifying that the price is correct."
That is how we came to the conclusion that they should be
"I, I, I  I certainly think there's a great deal of sense in it all."
Mhm.
By plant well will be by plant .
Right.
"Erm M for mother four stop one, payment application by contractors."
"Erm there are quite a few in, in this series which follow the same sort of thing is that er, all projects all jobs on site er will have a quantity surveyor from Dave  's section."
Erm and will
Eh?
Nominated.
to do all the post-contract measure work.
Nominated.
Come on.
"Let's, what you're doing is you're winding them up Den."
I'm not.
I can't believe Dennis would be mischievous enough to wind anybody up on p on a subject that he's so disinterested in.
"That's, that isn't"
Yes.
Go on.
I've been told to change these procedures to.
just taken the knife out of your back.
Right.
"The project Q S is responsible for agreeing all site measurements, normally attaining these personally."
"However when specifically requested by the project Q S, the resident engineer or the project engineer may obtain this information."
"A project Q S is responsible for agreeing all valuations and for processing all invoices for payment for physical work, and passing these to the client for payment."
So what's the change?
"Because on many jobs certainly smaller jobs, er the resident engineer or the project engineer would"
be doing the
"And normally normally they will do that and in, in the future"
Well
Yes it will.
"they can say, yeah,th the project Q S is just gonna say, measure me all"
That's right.
I haven't time to go and do that.
I don't want  otherwise you finish up with five separate er management procedures .
But also  is it necessary.
Jim
So we can make
let's issue that.
Because
"You, David and I need to sort out what we need to do to implement it"
Yeah.
and we will then implement it.
For you.
We've also gotta recognize clearly Dennis that civils and M and E cannot be stereotyped they are very very different engineering .
I'm s not suggesting they could.
And some management procedures cannot work very well in M and E as they can in civils.
Not because
Mm.
"you know we don't want to  in, in, in the civils team or what have you."
Indeed it works very well.
But in some cases some procedures cannot be worked on M and E
Yeah.
engineering.
They've got totally different algorithms.
Well it is supposed to be talking about managing the system and not d not taking people's e professional expertise away from them.
I mean but if
Yes.
if we are gonna have
It is a problem.
"procedures which are, don't quite fit you, then I think what we ought to be looking for is a certain amount of common ground between your procedure and our procedure, so there is not something, you're doing something completely different to the way the rest of us are doing it."
No.
I totally agree with you.
It's gotta be married together.
Totally agree with you.
"cannot stereotype every function, under a management procedure."
"As for the fourth , who brought up the tail , I had seen his like before , and knew him at once to be a sheriff 's officer ."
"I had no sooner seen these people coming than I made up my mind -LRB- for no reason that I can tell -RRB- to go through with my adventure ; and when the first came alongside of me , I rose up from the bracken and asked him the way to Aucharn ."
"He stopped and looked at me , as I thought , a little oddly ; and then , turning to the lawyer , `` Mungo , '' said he , `` there 's many a man would think this more of a warning than two pyats ."
"Here am I on my road to Duror on the job ye ken ; and here is a young lad starts up out of the bracken , and speers if I am on the way to Aucharn . ''"
"`` Glenure , '' said the other , `` this is an ill subject for jesting . ''"
"These two had now drawn close up and were gazing at me , while the two followers had halted about a stone-cast in the rear ."
`` And what seek ye in Aucharn ? ''
"said Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure , him they called the Red Fox ; for he it was that I had stopped ."
"`` The man that lives there , '' said I. `` James of the Glens , '' says Glenure , musingly ; and then to the lawyer : `` Is he gathering his people , think ye ? ''"
"`` Anyway , '' says the lawyer , `` we shall do better to bide where we are , and let the soldiers rally us . ''"
"`` If you are concerned for me , '' said I , `` I am neither of his people nor yours , but an honest subject of King George , owing no man and fearing no man . ''"
"`` Why , very well said , '' replies the Factor ."
"`` But if I may make so bold as ask , what does this honest man so far from his country ?"
and why does he come seeking the brother of Ardshiel ?
"I have power here , I must tell you ."
"I am King 's Factor upon several of these estates , and have twelve files of soldiers at my back . ''"
"`` I have heard a waif word in the country , '' said I , a little nettled , `` that you were a hard man to drive . ''"
"He still kept looking at me , as if in doubt ."
"`` Well , '' said he , at last , `` your tongue is bold ; but I am no unfriend to plainness ."
"If ye had asked me the way to the door of James Stewart on any other day but this , I would have set ye right and bidden ye God speed ."
"But to-day -- eh , Mungo ? ''"
And he turned again to look at the lawyer .
But just as he turned there came the shot of a firelock from higher up the hill ; and with the very sound of it Glenure fell upon the road .
"`` O , I am dead ! ''"
"he cried , several times over ."
"The lawyer had caught him up and held him in his arms , the servant standing over and clasping his hands ."
"And now the wounded man looked from one to another with scared eyes , and there was a change in his voice , that went to the heart ."
"`` Take care of yourselves , '' says he ."
`` I am dead . ''
"He tried to open his clothes as if to look for the wound , but his fingers slipped on the buttons ."
"With that he gave a great sigh , his head rolled on his shoulder , and he passed away ."
"The lawyer said never a word , but his face was as sharp as a pen and as white as the dead man 's ; the servant broke out into a great noise of crying and weeping , like a child ; and I , on my side , stood staring at them in a kind of horror ."
"I do n't mind ; I ai n't a little girl , I 'm older than you and Daisy ; so now , '' cried Nan , ungratefully ."
"`` Do n't preach , Deacon , you bully Posy every day of your life , '' called out the Commodore , who just then hove in sight ."
"`` I do n't hurt her ; do I , Daisy ? ''"
"and Demi turned to his sister , who was `` pooring '' Nan 's tingling hands , and recommending water for the purple lump rapidly developing itself on her forehead ."
"`` You are the best boy in the world , '' promptly answered Daisy ; adding , as truth compelled her to do , `` You hurt me sometimes , but you do n't mean to . ''"
"`` Put away the bats and things , and mind what you are about , my hearties ."
"No fighting allowed aboard this ship , '' said Emil , who rather lorded it over the others ."
"`` How do you do , Madge Wildfire ? ''"
"said Mr. Bhaer , as Nan came in with the rest to supper ."
"`` Give the right hand , little daughter , and mind thy manners , '' he added , as Nan offered him her left ."
`` The other hurts me . ''
`` The poor little hand !
what has it been doing to get those blisters ? ''
"he asked , drawing it from behind her back , where she had put it with a look which made him think she had been in mischief ."
"Before Nan could think of any excuse , Daisy burst out with the whole story , during which Stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and milk ."
"When the tale was finished , Mr. Bhaer looked down the long table towards his wife , and said with a laugh in his eyes , `` This rather belongs to your side of the house , so I wo n't meddle with it , my dear . ''"
"Mrs. Jo knew what he meant , but she liked her little black sheep all the better for her pluck , though she only said in her soberest way , `` Do you know why I asked Nan to come here ? ''"
"`` To plague me , '' muttered Stuffy , with his mouth full ."
"`` To help make little gentlemen of you , and I think you have shown that some of you need it . ''"
"Here Stuffy retired into his bowl again , and did not emerge till Demi made them all laugh by saying , in his slow wondering way , `` How can she , when she 's such a tomboy ? ''"
"`` That 's just it , she needs help as much as you , and I expect you set her an example of good manners . ''"
`` Is she going to be a little gentleman too ? ''
asked Rob .
"`` She 'd like it ; would n't you , Nan ? ''"
added Tommy .
"`` No , I should n't ; I hate boys ! ''"
"said Nan fiercely , for her hand still smarted , and she began to think that she might have shown her courage in some wiser way ."
"`` I am sorry you hate my boys , because they can be well-mannered , and most agreeable when they choose ."
"Kindness in looks and words and ways is true politeness , and any one can have it if they only try to treat other people as they like to be treated themselves . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer had addressed herself to Nan , but the boys nudged one another , and appeared to take the hint , for that time at least , and passed the butter ; said `` please , '' and `` thank you , '' `` yes , sir , '' and `` no , ma'am , '' with unusual elegance and respect ."
"Nan said nothing , but kept herself quiet and refrained from tickling Demi , though strongly tempted to do so , because of the dignified airs he put on ."
"She also appeared to have forgotten her hatred of boys , and played `` I spy '' with them till dark ."
"I told him not at all ; that I had seen much to admire among the Highlanders ; and if he came to that , Mr. Campbell himself was a Highlander ."
"`` Ay , '' said he , `` that 's true ."
It 's a fine blood . ''
`` And what is the King 's agent about ? ''
I asked .
`` Colin Campbell ? ''
says Henderland .
`` Putting his head in a bees ' byke ! ''
"`` He is to turn the tenants out by force , I hear ? ''"
"said I. `` Yes , '' says he , `` but the business has gone back and forth , as folk say ."
"First , James of the Glens rode to Edinburgh , and got some lawyer -LRB- a Stewart , nae doubt -- they all hing together like bats in a steeple -RRB- and had the proceedings stayed ."
"And then Colin Campbell cam ' in again , and had the upper-hand before the Barons of Exchequer ."
And now they tell me the first of the tenants are to flit to-morrow .
"It 's to begin at Duror under James 's very windows , which doesnae seem wise by my humble way of it . ''"
`` Do you think they 'll fight ? ''
I asked .
"`` Well , '' says Henderland , `` they 're disarmed -- or supposed to be -- for there 's still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places ."
And then Colin Campbell has the sogers coming .
"But for all that , if I was his lady wife , I wouldnae be well pleased till I got him home again ."
"They 're queer customers , the Appin Stewarts . ''"
I asked if they were worse than their neighbours .
"`` No they , '' said he ."
`` And that 's the worst part of it .
"For if Colin Roy can get his business done in Appin , he has it all to begin again in the next country , which they call Mamore , and which is one of the countries of the Camerons ."
"He 's King 's Factor upon both , and from both he has to drive out the tenants ; and indeed , Mr. Balfour -LRB- to be open with ye -RRB- , it 's my belief that if he escapes the one lot , he 'll get his death by the other . ''"
"So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day ; until at last , Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company , and satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell 's -LRB- `` whom , '' says he , `` I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted Zion '' -RRB- , proposed that I should make a short stage , and lie the night in his house a little beyond Kingairloch ."
"To say truth , I was overjoyed ; for I had no great desire for John of the Claymore , and since my double misadventure , first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper , I stood in some fear of any Highland stranger ."
"Accordingly we shook hands upon the bargain , and came in the afternoon to a small house , standing alone by the shore of the Linnhe Loch ."
"The sun was already gone from the desert mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side , but shone on those of Appin on the farther ; the loch lay as still as a lake , only the gulls were crying round the sides of it ; and the whole place seemed solemn and uncouth ."
"We had no sooner come to the door of Mr. Henderland 's dwelling , than to my great surprise -LRB- for I was now used to the politeness of Highlanders -RRB- he burst rudely past me , dashed into the room , caught up a jar and a small horn-spoon , and began ladling snuff into his nose in most excessive quantities ."
"Then he had a hearty fit of sneezing , and looked round upon me with a rather silly smile ."
"`` It 's a vow I took , '' says he ."
"They liked this , and played hard till bedtime , when most of them turned in and slept like dormice ."
"Dan , however , had a plan in his head , and when he and Nat were alone , he unfolded it ."
`` Look here ! ''
"he said , taking from under his bed a bottle , a cigar , and a pack of cards , `` I 'm going to have some fun , and do as I used to with the fellows in town ."
"Here 's some beer , I got if of the old man at the station , and this cigar ; you can pay for 'em or Tommy will , he 's got heaps of money and I have n't a cent ."
"I 'm going to ask him in ; no , you go , they wo n't mind you . ''"
"`` The folks wo n't like it , '' began Nat ."
`` They wo n't know .
"Daddy Bhaer is away , and Mrs. Bhaer 's busy with Ted ; he 's got croup or something , and she ca n't leave him ."
"We sha n't sit up late or make any noise , so where 's the harm ? ''"
"`` Asia will know if we burn the lamp long , she always does . ''"
"`` No , she wo n't , I 've got a dark lantern on purpose ; it do n't give much light , and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming , '' said Dan ."
"This idea struck Nat as a fine one , and lent an air of romance to the thing ."
"He started off to tell Tommy , but put his head in again to say , `` You want Demi , too , do n't you ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ; the Deacon will rollup eyes and preach if you tell him ."
"He will be asleep , so just tip the wink to Tom and cut back again . ''"
"Nat obeyed , and returned in a minute with Tommy half dressed , rather tousled about the head and very sleepy , but quite ready for fun as usual ."
"`` Now , keep quiet , and I 'll show you how to play a first-rate game called ` Poker , ' '' said Dan , as the three revellers gathered round the table , on which were set forth the bottle , the cigar , and the cards ."
"`` First we 'll all have a drink , then we 'll take a go at the ` weed , ' and then we 'll play ."
"That 's the way men do , and it 's jolly fun . ''"
"The beer circulated in a mug , and all three smacked their lips over it , though Nat and Tommy did not like the bitter stuff ."
"The cigar was worse still , but they dared not say so , and each puffed away till he was dizzy or choked , when he passed the `` weed '' on to his neighbor ."
"Dan liked it , for it seemed like old times when he now and then had a chance to imitate the low men who surrounded him ."
"He drank , and smoked , and swaggered as much like them as he could , and , getting into the spirit of the part he assumed , he soon began to swear under his breath for fear some one should hear him ."
`` You must n't ; it 's wicked to say ` Damn ! ' ''
"cried Tommy , who had followed his leader so far ."
"`` Oh , hang !"
"do n't you preach , but play away ; it 's part of the fun to swear . ''"
"`` I 'd rather say ` thunder turtles , ' '' said Tommy , who had composed this interesting exclamation and was very proud of it ."
"`` And I 'll say ` The Devil ; ' that sounds well , '' added Nat , much impressed by Dan 's manly ways ."
"Dan scoffed at their `` nonsense , '' and swore stoutly as he tried to teach them the new game ."
"But Tommy was very sleepy , and Nat 's head began to ache with the beer and the smoke , so neither of them was very quick to learn , and the game dragged ."
"When the Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and put away , and then everybody adjourns to the dance , the Queen walking in front while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her , carrying two little pots , one of which contains the juice of wallflower and the other the juice of Solomon 's Seal ."
"Wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit , and Solomon 's Seal juice is for bruises ."
"They bruise very easily , and when Peter plays faster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits ."
"For , as you know without my telling you , Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra ."
"He sits in the middle of the ring , and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays without him ."
` P. P. ' is written on the corner of the invitation-cards sent out by all really good families .
"They are grateful little people , too , and at the princess 's coming-of-age ball -LRB- they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month -RRB- they gave him the wish of his heart ."
-LSB- Illustration : When her Majesty wants to know the time -RSB- The way it was done was this .
"The Queen ordered him to kneel , and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart ."
"Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of his heart , but for a long time he hesitated , not being certain what it was himself ."
"` If I chose to go back to mother , ' he asked at last , ` could you give me that wish ? '"
"Now this question vexed them , for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music , so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said , ` Pooh !"
ask for a much bigger wish than that . '
` Is that quite a little wish ? '
he inquired .
"` As little as this , ' the Queen answered , putting her hands near each other ."
` What size is a big wish ? '
he asked .
She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length .
"Then Peter reflected and said , ` Well , then , I think I shall have two little wishes instead of one big one . '"
"Of course , the fairies had to agree , though his cleverness rather shocked them , and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother , but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her disappointing ."
His second wish he would hold in reserve .
"They tried to dissuade him , and even put obstacles in the way . '"
"I can give you the power to fly to her house , ' the Queen said , ` but I ca n't open the door for you . '"
"` The window I flew out at will be open , ' Peter said confidently ."
` Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back . '
` How do you know ? '
"they asked , quite surprised , and , really , Peter could not explain how he knew . '"
"I just do know , ' he said ."
"So as he persisted in his wish , they had to grant it ."
"The way they gave him power to fly was this : They all tickled him on the shoulder , and soon he felt a funny itching in that part , and then up he rose higher and higher , and flew away out of the Gardens and over the housetops ."
"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his own home he skimmed away over St. Paul 's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent 's Park , and by the time he reached his mother 's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird ."
"`` God bless you , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' he said softly and tenderly ."
After all it was not a hard thing to fight for a land that bore daughters like this .
He stood on the rear platform and waved to them as the train pulled out .
"Rilla was standing by herself , but Una Meredith came to her and the two girls who loved him most stood together and held each other 's cold hands as the train rounded the curve of the wooded hill ."
Rilla spent an hour in Rainbow Valley that morning about which she never said a word to anyone ; she did not even write in her diary about it ; when it was over she went home and made rompers for Jims .
In the evening she went to a Junior Red Cross committee meeting and was severely businesslike .
"`` You would never suppose , '' said Irene Howard to Olive Kirk afterwards , `` that Walter had left for the front only this morning ."
But some people really have no depth of feeling .
I often wish I could take things as lightly as Rilla Blythe . ''
"CHAPTER XVI REALISM AND ROMANCE `` Warsaw has fallen , '' said Dr. Blythe with a resigned air , as he brought the mail in one warm August day ."
"Gertrude and Mrs. Blythe looked dismally at each other , and Rilla , who was feeding Jims a Morganized diet from a carefully sterilized spoon , laid the said spoon down on his tray , utterly regardless of germs , and said , `` Oh , dear me , '' in as tragic a tone as if the news had come as a thunderbolt instead of being a foregone conclusion from the preceding week 's dispatches ."
"They had thought they were quite resigned to Warsaw 's fall but now they knew they had , as always , hoped against hope ."
"`` Now , let us take a brace , '' said Susan ."
`` It is not the terrible thing we have been thinking .
I read a dispatch three columns long in the Montreal Herald yesterday that proved that Warsaw was not important from a military point of view at all .
"So let us take the military point of view , doctor dear . ''"
"`` I read that dispatch , too , and it has encouraged me immensely , '' said Gertrude ."
`` I knew then and I know now that it was a lie from beginning to end .
"But I am in that state of mind where even a lie is a comfort , providing it is a cheerful lie . ''"
"`` In that case , Miss Oliver dear , the German official reports ought to be all you need , '' said Susan sarcastically ."
`` I never read them now because they make me so mad I can not put my thoughts properly on my work after a dose of them .
Even this news about Warsaw has taken the edge off my afternoon 's plans .
Misfortunes never come singly .
I spoiled my baking of bread today -- and now Warsaw has fallen -- and here is little Kitchener bent on choking himself to death . ''
"Jims was evidently trying to swallow his spoon , germs and all ."
Rilla rescued him mechanically and was about to resume the operation of feeding him when a casual remark of her father 's sent such a shock and thrill over her that for the second time she dropped that doomed spoon .
"`` Kenneth Ford is down at Martin West 's over-harbour , '' the doctor was saying ."
"`` His regiment was on its way to the front but was held up in Kingsport for some reason , and Ken got leave of absence to come over to the Island . ''"
"`` I hope he will come up to see us , '' exclaimed Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` He only has a day or two off , I believe , '' said the doctor absently ."
Nobody noticed Rilla 's flushed face and trembling hands .
Even the most thoughtful and watchful of parents do not see everything that goes on under their very noses .
"Come away now , you must not stand any longer ."
Come and rest while I fetch a dish to put the flowers in till you want them ; '' and Mrs. Pecq turned her round with her small Maying safely done .
"`` I did n't think I 'd ever be able to do even so much , and here I am walking and sitting up , and going to drive some day ."
Is n't it nice that I 'm not to be a poor Lucinda after all ? ''
and Jill drew a long sigh of relief that six months instead of twenty years would probably be the end of her captivity .
"`` Yes , thank Heaven !"
"I do n't think I could have borne that ; '' and the mother took Jill in her arms as if she were a baby , holding her close for a minute , and laying her down with a tender kiss that made the arms cling about her neck as her little girl returned it heartily , for all sorts of new , sweet feelings seemed to be budding in both , born of great joy and thankfulness ."
"Then Mrs. Pecq hurried away to see about tea for the hungry boys , and Jill watched the pleasant twilight deepen as she lay singing to herself one of the songs her friend taught her because it fitted her so well ."
"`` A little bird I am , Shut from the fields of air , And in my cage I sit and sing To Him who placed me there : Well pleased a prisoner to be , Because , my God , it pleases Thee !"
"`` Naught have I else to do ; I sing the whole day long ; And He whom most I love to please Doth listen to my song , He caught and bound my wandering wing , But still He bends to hear me sing . ''"
"`` Now we are ready for you , so bring on your flowers , '' said Molly to the boys , as she and Merry added their store of baskets to the gay show Jill had set forth on the long table ready for the evening 's work ."
"`` They would n't let me see one , but I guess they have had good luck , they look so jolly , '' answered Jill , looking at Gus , Frank , and Jack , who stood laughing , each with a large basket in his hands ."
`` Fair to middling .
Just look in and see ; '' with which cheerful remark Gus tipped up his basket and displayed a few bits of green at the bottom .
`` I did better .
"Now , do n't all scream at once over these beauties ; '' and Frank shook out some evergreen sprigs , half a dozen saxifrages , and two or three forlorn violets with hardly any stems ."
"`` I do n't brag , but here 's the best of all the three , '' chuckled Jack , producing a bunch of feathery carrot-tops , with a few half-shut dandelions trying to look brave and gay ."
"`` Oh , boys , is that all ? ''"
`` What shall we do ? ''
"`` We 've only a few house-flowers , and all those baskets to fill , '' cried the girls , in despair ; for Merry 's contribution had been small , and Molly had only a handful of artificial flowers `` to fill up , '' she said ."
`` It is n't our fault : it is the late spring .
"We ca n't make flowers , can we ? ''"
"asked Frank , in a tone of calm resignation ."
"`` Could n't you buy some , then ? ''"
"said Molly , smoothing her crumpled morning-glories , with a sigh ."
`` Who ever heard of a fellow having any money left the last day of the month ? ''
"demanded Gus , severely ."
`` Or girls either .
"I spent all mine in ribbon and paper for my baskets , and now they are of no use ."
It 's a shame ! ''
"lamented Jill , while Merry began to thin out her full baskets to fill the empty ones ."
`` Hold on ! ''
"I believe in Him now -- I have to -- there 's nothing else to fall back on but God -- humbly , starkly , unconditionally . '' ''"
"` Our help in ages past ' -- ` the same yesterday , to-day and for ever , ' '' said the minister gently ."
`` When we forget God -- He remembers us . ''
There was no crowd at the Glen Station the next morning to see Walter off .
It was becoming a commonplace for a khaki clad boy to board that early morning train after his last leave .
"Besides his own , only the Manse folk were there , and Mary Vance ."
"Mary had sent her Miller off the week before , with a determined grin , and now considered herself entitled to give expert opinion on how such partings should be conducted ."
"`` The main thing is to smile and act as if nothing was happening , '' she informed the Ingleside group ."
`` The boys all hate the sob act like poison .
Miller told me I was n't to come near the station if I could n't keep from bawling .
"So I got through with my crying beforehand , and at the last I said to him , ` Good luck , Miller , and if you come back you 'll find I have n't changed any , and if you do n't come back I 'll always be proud you went , and in any case do n't fall in love with a French girl . '"
"Miller swore he would n't , but you never can tell about those fascinating foreign hussies ."
"Anyhow , the last sight he had of me I was smiling to my limit ."
"Gee , all the rest of the day my face felt as if it had been starched and ironed into a smile . ''"
"In spite of Mary 's advice and example Mrs. Blythe , who had sent Jem off with a smile , could not quite manage one for Walter ."
But at least no one cried .
"Dog Monday came out of his lair in the shipping-shed and sat down close to Walter , thumping his tail vigorously on the boards of the platform whenever Walter spoke to him , and looking up with confident eyes , as if to say , `` I know you 'll find Jem and bring him back to me . ''"
"`` So long , old fellow , '' said Carl Meredith cheerfully , when the good-byes had to be said ."
`` Tell them over there to keep their spirits up -- I am coming along presently . ''
"`` Me too , '' said Shirley laconically , proffering a brown paw ."
Susan heard him and her face turned very grey .
"Una shook hands quietly , looking at him with wistful , sorrowful , dark-blue eyes ."
But then Una 's eyes had always been wistful .
"Walter bent his handsome black head in its khaki cap and kissed her with the warm , comradely kiss of a brother ."
"He had never kissed her before , and for a fleeting moment Una 's face betrayed her , if anyone had noticed ."
But nobody did ; the conductor was shouting `` all aboard '' ; everybody was trying to look very cheerful .
Walter turned to Rilla ; she held his hands and looked up at him .
She would not see him again until the day broke and the shadows vanished -- and she knew not if that daybreak would be on this side of the grave or beyond it .
"`` Good-bye , '' she said ."
On her lips it lost all the bitterness it had won through the ages of parting and bore instead all the sweetness of the old loves of all the women who had ever loved and prayed for the beloved .
"`` Write me often and bring Jims up faithfully , according to the gospel of Morgan , '' Walter said lightly , having said all his serious things the night before in Rainbow Valley ."
But at the last moment he took her face between his hands and looked deep into her gallant eyes .
"`` If he had been well spanked in his younger days he might have more sense now , '' retorted Susan ."
"`` But I suppose princes are never spanked , more is the pity ."
I see the Allies have sent him an ultimatum .
I could tell them that it will take more than ultimatums to skin a snake like Constantine .
"Perhaps the Allied blockade will hammer sense into his head ; but that will take some time I am thinking , and in the meantime what is to become of poor Serbia ? ''"
"They saw what became of Serbia , and during the process Susan was hardly to be lived with ."
"In her exasperation she abused everything and everybody except Kitchener , and she fell upon poor President Wilson tooth and claw ."
"`` If he had done his duty and gone into the war long ago we should not have seen this mess in Serbia , '' she avowed ."
"`` It would be a serious thing to plunge a great country like the United States , with its mixed population , into the war , Susan , '' said the doctor , who sometimes came to the defence of the President , not because he thought Wilson needed it especially , but from an unholy love of baiting Susan ."
"`` Maybe , doctor dear -- maybe !"
But that makes me think of the old story of the girl who told her grandmother she was going to be married .
"` It is a solemn thing to be married , ' said the old lady ."
"` Yes , but it is a solemner thing not to be , ' said the girl ."
"And I can testify to that out of my own experience , doctor dear ."
And I think it is a solemner thing for the Yankees that they have kept out of the war than it would have been if they had gone into it .
"However , though I do not know much about them , I am of the opinion that we will see them starting something yet , Woodrow Wilson or no Woodrow Wilson , when they get it into their heads that this war is not a correspondence school ."
"They will not , '' said Susan , energetically waving a saucepan with one hand and a soup ladle with the other , `` be too proud to fight then . ''"
"On a pale-yellow , windy evening in October Carl Meredith went away ."
He had enlisted on his eighteenth birthday .
John Meredith saw him off with a set face .
His two boys were gone -- there was only little Bruce left now .
He loved Bruce and Bruce 's mother dearly ; but Jerry and Carl were the sons of the bride of his youth and Carl was the only one of all his children who had Cecilia 's very eyes .
As they looked lovingly out at him above Carl 's uniform the pale minister suddenly remembered the day when for the first and last time he had tried to whip Carl for his prank with the eel .
That was the first time he had realised how much Carl 's eyes were like Cecilia 's .
Now he realised it again once more .
Would he ever again see his dead wife 's eyes looking at him from his son 's face ?
"What a bonny , clean , handsome lad he was !"
It was -- hard -- to see him go .
John Meredith seemed to be looking at a torn plain strewed with the bodies of `` able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five . ''
"Only the other day Carl had been a little scrap of a boy , hunting bugs in Rainbow Valley , taking lizards to bed with him , and scandalizing the Glen by carrying frogs to Sunday School ."
It seemed hardly -- right -- somehow that he should be an `` able-bodied man '' in khaki .
Yet John Meredith had said no word to dissuade him when Carl had told him he must go .
"But no one has really seen it , except just three or four , and they have not only seen it but slept in it , and unless you sleep in it you never see it ."
"This is because it is not there when you lie down , but it is there when you wake up and step outside ."
"In a kind of way everyone may see it , but what you see is not really it , but only the light in the windows ."
You see the light after Lock-out Time .
"David , for instance , saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime , and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple , which is the name of his father 's office ."
"Angela Clare , who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop , saw more than one light , she saw hundreds of them all together , and this must have been the fairies building the house , for they build it every night and always in a different part of the Gardens ."
"She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others , though she was not quite sure , for they jumped about so , and it might have been another one that was bigger ."
"But if it was the same one , it was Peter Pan 's light ."
"Heaps of children have seen the fight , so that is nothing ."
But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built .
"Maimie was always rather a strange girl , and it was at night that she was strange ."
"She was four years of age , and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind ."
"She was pleased when her brother Tony , who was a magnificent fellow of six , took notice of her , and she looked up to him in the right way , and tried in vain to imitate him and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about ."
"Also , when she was batting she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes ."
She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime .
"But as the shades of night fell , Tony , the swaggerer , lost his contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully , and no wonder , for with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look ."
It was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony 's uneasy glances .
Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys -LRB- which he always took away from her next morning -RRB- and she accepted them with a disturbing smile .
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was -LRB- in brief -RRB- that they knew they were about to be sent to bed .
It was then that Maimie was terrible .
"Tony entreated her not to do it to-night , and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her , but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile ."
And by-and-by when they were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying `` Hsh !
what was that ? ''
Tony beseeches her !
"`` It was nothing -- do n't , Maimie , do n't ! ''"
and pulls the sheet over his head .
`` It is coming nearer ! ''
"she cries ; `` Oh , look at it , Tony !"
"It is feeling your bed with its horns -- it is boring for you , oh , Tony , oh ! ''"
"and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations , screeching ."
"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly , not shamming , you know , but really sleeping , and looking like the sweetest little angel , which seems to me to make it almost worse ."
"But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens , and then Tony did most of the talking ."
I came here and told your aunt not to let it occur again .
She has let it occur again .
"Where 's your aunt , miss ?"
"I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of my mind ... a piece of J. A. Harrison 's mind , miss . ''"
"`` If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert , she is not my aunt , and she has gone down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill , '' said Anne , with due increase of dignity at every word ."
`` I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats ... she is my cow and not Miss Cuthbert 's ... Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was a little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell . ''
"`` Sorry , miss !"
Sorry is n't going to help matters any .
"You 'd better go and look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats ... trampled them from center to circumference , miss . ''"
"`` I am very sorry , '' repeated Anne firmly , `` but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in ."
It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition . ''
"`` My fence is all right , '' snapped Mr. Harrison , angrier than ever at this carrying of the war into the enemy 's country ."
`` The jail fence could n't keep a demon of a cow like that out .
"And I can tell you , you redheaded snippet , that if the cow is yours , as you say , you 'd be better employed in watching her out of other people 's grain than in sitting round reading yellow-covered novels , '' ... with a scathing glance at the innocent tan-colored Virgil by Anne 's feet ."
Something at that moment was red besides Anne 's hair ... which had always been a tender point with her .
"`` I 'd rather have red hair than none at all , except a little fringe round my ears , '' she flashed ."
"The shot told , for Mr. Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald head ."
"His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly at Anne , who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage ."
"`` I can make allowance for you , Mr. Harrison , because I have an imagination ."
I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a cow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you for the things you 've said .
I promise you that Dolly shall never break into your oats again .
I give you my word of honor on THAT point . ''
"`` Well , mind you she does n't , '' muttered Mr. Harrison in a somewhat subdued tone ; but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him growling to himself until he was out of earshot ."
"Grievously disturbed in mind , Anne marched across the yard and shut the naughty Jersey up in the milking pen ."
"`` She ca n't possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down , '' she reflected ."
`` She looks pretty quiet now .
I daresay she has sickened herself on those oats .
"I wish I 'd sold her to Mr. Shearer when he wanted her last week , but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had the auction of the stock and let them all go together ."
I believe it is true about Mr. Harrison being a crank .
Certainly there 's nothing of the kindred spirit about HIM . ''
Anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits .
"Marilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the house , and the latter flew to get tea ready ."
"Howbeit , if he is to marry , marry him in the name of Mary , and be done ! ''"
"`` Nay , he is a brave lad -- I know it , '' said Lord Foxham ."
"`` Content ye , then , Sir Richard ."
"I have compounded this affair with Master Hamley , and to-morrow ye shall wed. '' Whereupon Dick judged it prudent to withdraw ; but he was not yet clear of the refectory , when a man , but newly alighted at the gate , came running four stairs at a bound , and , brushing through the abbey servants , threw himself on one knee before the duke ."
"`` Victory , my lord , '' he cried ."
"And before Dick had got to the chamber set apart for him as Lord Foxham 's guest , the troops in the holm were cheering around their fires ; for upon that same day , not twenty miles away , a second crushing blow had been dealt to the power of Lancaster ."
"CHAPTER VII -- DICK 'S REVENGE The next morning Dick was afoot before the sun , and having dressed himself to the best advantage with the aid of the Lord Foxham 's baggage , and got good reports of Joan , he set forth on foot to walk away his impatience ."
"For some while he made rounds among the soldiery , who were getting to arms in the wintry twilight of the dawn and by the red glow of torches ; but gradually he strolled further afield , and at length passed clean beyond the outposts , and walked alone in the frozen forest , waiting for the sun ."
His thoughts were both quiet and happy .
"His brief favour with the Duke he could not find it in his heart to mourn ; with Joan to wife , and my Lord Foxham for a faithful patron , he looked most happily upon the future ; and in the past he found but little to regret ."
"As he thus strolled and pondered , the solemn light of the morning grew more clear , the east was already coloured by the sun , and a little scathing wind blew up the frozen snow ."
"He turned to go home ; but even as he turned , his eye lit upon a figure behind , a tree ."
`` Stand ! ''
he cried .
`` Who goes ? ''
The figure stepped forth and waved its hand like a dumb person .
"It was arrayed like a pilgrim , the hood lowered over the face , but Dick , in an instant , recognised Sir Daniel ."
"He strode up to him , drawing his sword ; and the knight , putting his hand in his bosom , as if to seize a hidden weapon , steadfastly awaited his approach ."
"`` Well , Dickon , '' said Sir Daniel , `` how is it to be ?"
Do ye make war upon the fallen ? ''
"`` I made no war upon your life , '' replied the lad ; `` I was your true friend until ye sought for mine ; but ye have sought for it greedily . ''"
"`` Nay -- self-defence , '' replied the knight ."
"`` And now , boy , the news of this battle , and the presence of yon crooked devil here in mine own wood , have broken me beyond all help ."
"I go to Holywood for sanctuary ; thence overseas , with what I can carry , and to begin life again in Burgundy or France . ''"
"`` Ye may not go to Holywood , '' said Dick ."
`` How !
May not ? ''
asked the knight .
"`` Look ye , Sir Daniel , this is my marriage morn , '' said Dick ; `` and yon sun that is to rise will make the brightest day that ever shone for me ."
"Your life is forfeit -- doubly forfeit , for my father 's death and your own practices to meward ."
But I myself have done amiss ; I have brought about men 's deaths ; and upon this glad day I will be neither judge nor hangman .
"An ye were the devil , I would not lay a hand on you ."
"`` It is ten o'clock ; into bed , every man of you , '' said Mr. Bhaer , looking at his watch ."
"`` And , thank Heaven !"
"there will be no empty ones to-night , '' added Mrs. Bhaer , watching , with full eyes , Robby going up in his father 's arms , and Nan escorted by Daisy and Demi , who considered her the most interesting heroine of their collection ."
"`` Poor Aunt Jo is so tired she ought to be carried up herself , '' said gentle Franz , putting his arm round her as she paused at the stair-foot , looking quite exhausted by her fright and long walk ."
"`` Let 's make an arm-chair , '' proposed Tommy ."
"`` No , thank you , my lads ; but somebody may lend me a shoulder to lean on , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` Me !
me ! ''
"and half-a-dozen jostled one another , all eager to be chosen , for there was something in the pale motherly face that touched the warm hearts under the round jackets ."
"Seeing that they considered it an honor , Mrs. Jo gave it to the one who had earned it , and nobody grumbled when she put her arm on Dan 's broad shoulder , saying , with a look that made him color up with pride and pleasure , `` He found the children ; so I think he must help me up . ''"
"Dan felt richly rewarded for his evening 's work , not only that he was chosen from all the rest to go proudly up bearing the lamp , but because Mrs. Jo said heartily , `` Good-night , my boy !"
God bless you ! ''
as he left her at her door .
"`` I wish I was your boy , '' said Dan , who felt as if danger and trouble had somehow brought him nearer than ever to her ."
"`` You shall be my oldest son , '' and she sealed her promise with a kiss that made Dan hers entirely ."
"Little Rob was all right next day , but Nan had a headache , and lay on Mother Bhaer 's sofa with cold-cream upon her scratched face ."
"Her remorse was quite gone , and she evidently thought being lost rather a fine amusement ."
"Mrs. Jo was not pleased with this state of things , and had no desire to have her children led from the paths of virtue , or her pupils lying round loose in huckleberry fields ."
"So she talked soberly to Nan , and tried to impress upon her mind the difference between liberty and license , telling several tales to enforce her lecture ."
"She had not decided how to punish Nan , but one of these stories suggested a way , and as Mrs. Jo liked odd penalties , she tried it ."
"`` All children run away , '' pleaded Nan , as if it was as natural and necessary a thing as measles or hooping cough ."
"`` Not all , and some who do run away do n't get found again , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` Did n't you do it yourself ? ''
"asked Nan , whose keen little eyes saw some traces of a kindred spirit in the serious lady who was sewing so morally before her ."
"Mrs. Jo laughed , and owned that she did ."
"`` Tell about it , '' demanded Nan , feeling that she was getting the upper hand in the discussion ."
"Mrs. Jo saw that , and sobered down at once , saying , with a remorseful shake of the head , `` I did it a good many times , and led my poor mother rather a hard life with my pranks , till she cured me . ''"
`` How ? ''
and Nan sat up with a face full of interest .
"`` I had a new pair of shoes once , and wanted to show them ; so , though I was told not to leave the garden , I ran away and was wandering about all day ."
"It was in the city , and why I was n't killed I do n't know ."
Such a time as I had .
"Then the dirty-handed society went off the wash , followed by the Professor , trying to calm the anxiety of Rob , who had been told by Tommy that all water was full of invisible pollywogs ."
"`` I like your plan very much , only do n't be too generous , Teddy , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , when they were left alone ."
"`` You know most of the boys have got to paddle their own canoes when they leave us , and too much sitting in the lap of luxury will unfit them for it . ''"
"`` I 'll be moderate , but do let me amuse myself ."
"I get desperately tired of business sometimes , and nothing freshens me up like a good frolic with your boys ."
"I like that Dan very much , Jo ."
"He is n't demonstrative ; but he has the eye of a hawk , and when you have tamed him a little he will do you credit . ''"
`` I 'm so glad you think so .
"Thank you very much for your kindness to him , especially for this museum affair ; it will keep him happy while he is lame , give me a chance to soften and smooth this poor , rough lad , and make him love us ."
"What did inspire you with such a beautiful , helpful idea , Teddy ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Bhaer , glancing back at the pleasant room , as she turned to leave it ."
"Laurie took both her hands in his , and answered , with a look that made her eyes fill with happy tears , `` Dear Jo !"
"I have known what it is to be a motherless boy , and I never can forget how much you and yours have done for me all these years . ''"
CHAPTER XII .
"HUCKLEBERRIES There was a great clashing of tin pails , much running to and fro , and frequent demands for something to eat , one August afternoon , for the boys were going huckleberrying , and made as much stir about it as if they were setting out to find the North West Passage ."
"`` Now , my lads , get off as quietly as you can , for Rob is safely out of the way , and wo n't see you , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , as she tied Daisy 's broad-brimmed hat , and settled the great blue pinafore in which she had enveloped Nan ."
"But the plan did not succeed , for Rob had heard the bustle , decided to go , and prepared himself , without a thought of disappointment ."
"The troop was just getting under way when the little man came marching downstairs with his best hat on , a bright tin pail in his hand , and a face beaming with satisfaction ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"now we shall have a scene , '' sighed Mrs. Bhaer , who found her eldest son very hard to manage at times ."
"`` I 'm all ready , '' said Rob , and took his place in the ranks with such perfect unconsciousness of his mistake , that it really was very hard to undeceive him ."
"`` It 's too far for you , my love ; stay and take care of me , for I shall be all alone , '' began his mother ."
`` You 've got Teddy .
"I 'm a big boy , so I can go ; you said I might when I was bigger , and I am now , '' persisted Rob , with a cloud beginning to dim the brightness of his happy face ."
"`` We are going up to the great pasture , and it 's ever so far ; we do n't want you tagging on , '' cried Jack , who did not admire the little boys ."
"`` I wo n't tag , I 'll run and keep up ."
O Mamma !
let me go !
"I want to fill my new pail , and I 'll bring 'em all to you ."
"Please , please , I will be good ! ''"
"prayed Robby , looking up at his mother , so grieved and disappointed that her heart began to fail her ."
"`` But , my deary , you 'll get so tired and hot you wo n't have a good time ."
"Mrs. Milton White says she never met a perfect person , but she 's heard enough about one ... her husband 's first wife ."
Do n't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect ? ''
"`` It would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife , '' declared Mr. Harrison , with a sudden and inexplicable warmth ."
"When tea was over Anne insisted on washing the dishes , although Mr. Harrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks yet ."
"She would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also , but no broom was visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there was n't one at all ."
"`` You might run across and talk to me once in a while , '' suggested Mr. Harrison when she was leaving . ''"
'T is n't far and folks ought to be neighborly .
I 'm kind of interested in that society of yours .
Seems to me there 'll be some fun in it .
Who are you going to tackle first ? ''
"`` We are not going to meddle with PEOPLE ... it is only PLACES we mean to improve , '' said Anne , in a dignified tone ."
She rather suspected that Mr. Harrison was making fun of the project .
"When she had gone Mr. Harrison watched her from the window ... a lithe , girlish shape , tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset afterglow ."
"`` I 'm a crusty , lonesome , crabbed old chap , '' he said aloud , `` but there 's something about that little girl makes me feel young again ... and it 's such a pleasant sensation I 'd like to have it repeated once in a while . ''"
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' croaked Ginger mockingly ."
Mr. Harrison shook his fist at the parrot .
"`` You ornery bird , '' he muttered , `` I almost wish I 'd wrung your neck when my brother the sailor brought you home ."
Will you never be done getting me into trouble ? ''
"Anne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to Marilla , who had been not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of starting out to look for her ."
"`` It 's a pretty good world , after all , is n't it , Marilla ? ''"
concluded Anne happily .
`` Mrs. Lynde was complaining the other day that it was n't much of a world .
She said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant you were sure to be more or less disappointed ... perhaps that is true .
But there is a good side to it too .
The bad things do n't always come up to your expectations either ... they nearly always turn out ever so much better than you think .
I looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant experience when I went over to Mr. Harrison 's tonight ; and instead he was quite kind and I had almost a nice time .
"I think we 're going to be real good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other , and everything has turned out for the best ."
"But all the same , Marilla , I shall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she belongs ."
And I do NOT like parrots ! ''
"IV Different Opinions One evening at sunset , Jane Andrews , Gilbert Blythe , and Anne Shirley were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs , where a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road ."
"Jane had been up to spend the afternoon with Anne , who walked part of the way home with her ; at the fence they met Gilbert , and all three were now talking about the fateful morrow ; for that morrow was the first of September and the schools would open ."
Jane would go to Newbridge and Gilbert to White Sands .
"We promised Ed to stand by Bob , so I did as well as I knew how ; '' and Jack seemed to think that was about all there was to say ."
`` I never saw such a fellow for keeping a promise !
"You stick to it through thick and thin , no matter how silly or hard it is ."
"You remember , mother , last summer , how you told him not to go in a boat and he promised , the day we went on the picnic ."
"We rode up , but the horse ran off home , so we had to come back by way of the river , all but Jack , and he walked every step of five miles because he would n't go near a boat , though Mr. Burton was there to take care of him ."
I call that rather overdoing the matter ; '' and Frank looked as if he thought moderation even in virtue a good thing .
`` And I call it a fine sample of entire obedience .
"He obeyed orders , and that is what we all must do , without always seeing why , or daring to use our own judgment ."
"It is a great safeguard to Jack , and a very great comfort to me ; for I know that if he promises he will keep his word , no matter what it costs him , '' said Mamma warmly , as she tumbled up the quirls with an irrepressible caress , remembering how the boy came wearily in after all the others , without seeming for a moment to think that he could have done anything else ."
`` Like Casabianca ! ''
"cried Jill , much impressed , for obedience was her hardest trial ."
"`` I think he was a fool to burn up , '' said Frank , bound not to give in ."
`` I do n't .
"It 's a splendid piece , and every one likes to speak it , and it was true , and it would n't be in all the books if he was a fool ."
"Grown people know what is good , '' declared Jill , who liked heroic actions , and was always hoping for a chance to distinguish herself in that way ."
"`` You admire ` The Charge of the Light Brigade , ' and glow all over as you thunder it out ."
Yet they went gallantly to their death rather than disobey orders .
"A mistake , perhaps , but it makes us thrill to hear of it ; and the same spirit keeps my Jack true as steel when once his word is passed , or he thinks it is his duty ."
"Do n't be laughed out of it , my son , for faithfulness in little things fits one for heroism when the great trials come ."
One 's conscience can hardly be too tender when honor and honesty are concerned . ''
"`` You are right , mother , and I am wrong ."
"I beg your pardon , Jack , and you sha 'n' t get ahead of me next time . ''"
"Frank made his mother a little bow , gave his brother a shake of the hand , and nodded to Jill , as if anxious to show that he was not too proud to own up when he made a mistake ."
"`` Please tell on , Jack ."
"This is very nice , but I do want to know all about the other , '' said Jill , after a short pause ."
`` Let me see .
"Oh , I saw Bob at church , and he looked rather blue ; so , after Sunday School , I asked what the matter was ."
"He said Jerry bothered him for some money he lent him at different times when they were loafing round together , before we took him up ."
He would n't get any wages for some time .
"The Captain keeps him short on purpose , I guess , and wo n't let him come down town except on Sundays ."
"He did n't want any one to know about it , for fear he 'd lose his place ."
So I promised I would n't tell .
"It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation ; some time that night , or at latest before noon of the morrow , we should sight the Treasure Island ."
We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea .
"The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily , dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray ."
All was drawing alow and aloft ; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure .
"Now , just after sundown , when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth , it occurred to me that I should like an apple ."
I ran on deck .
The watch was all forward looking out for the island .
"The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself , and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship ."
"In I got bodily into the apple barrel , and found there was scarce an apple left ; but sitting down there in the dark , what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship , I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by ."
"The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it , and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak ."
"It was Silver 's voice , and before I had heard a dozen words , I would not have shown myself for all the world , but lay there , trembling and listening , in the extreme of fear and curiosity , for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone ."
"11 What I Heard in the Apple Barrel `` NO , not I , '' said Silver ."
"`` Flint was cap'n ; I was quartermaster , along of my timber leg ."
"The same broadside I lost my leg , old Pew lost his deadlights ."
"It was a master surgeon , him that ampytated me -- out of college and all -- Latin by the bucket , and what not ; but he was hanged like a dog , and sun-dried like the rest , at Corso Castle ."
"That was Roberts ' men , that was , and comed of changing names to their ships -- ROYAL FORTUNE and so on ."
"Now , what a ship was christened , so let her stay , I says ."
"So it was with the CASSANDRA , as brought us all safe home from Malabar , after England took the viceroy of the Indies ; so it was with the old WALRUS , Flint 's old ship , as I 've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
"cried another voice , that of the youngest hand on board , and evidently full of admiration ."
"`` He was the flower of the flock , was Flint ! ''"
"`` Davis was a man too , by all accounts , '' said Silver ."
"`` I never sailed along of him ; first with England , then with Flint , that 's my story ; and now here on my own account , in a manner of speaking ."
"I laid by nine hundred safe , from England , and two thousand after Flint ."
That ai n't bad for a man before the mast -- all safe in bank .
"` Tai n't earning now , it 's saving does it , you may lay to that ."
Where 's all England 's men now ?
I dunno .
Where 's Flint 's ?
"Why , most on 'em aboard here , and glad to get the duff -- been begging before that , some on 'em ."
"Old Pew , as had lost his sight , and might have thought shame , spends twelve hundred pound in a year , like a lord in Parliament ."
Where is he now ?
"I should , I think , have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face ."
"It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness -- a haggard old man 's smile ; but there was , besides that , a grain of derision , a shadow of treachery , in his expression as he craftily watched , and watched , and watched me at my work ."
"26 Israel Hands THE wind , serving us to a desire , now hauled into the west ."
We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet .
"Only , as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther , time hung on our hands ."
"The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to ; after a good many trials I succeeded , and we both sat in silence over another meal ."
"`` Cap'n , '' said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile , `` here 's my old shipmate , O'Brien ; s ` pose you was to heave him overboard ."
"I ai n't partic ` lar as a rule , and I do n't take no blame for settling his hash , but I do n't reckon him ornamental now , do you ? ''"
"`` I 'm not strong enough , and I do n't like the job ; and there he lies , for me , '' said I. `` This here 's an unlucky ship , this HISPANIOLA , Jim , '' he went on , blinking ."
`` There 's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA -- a sight o ' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol .
"I never seen sich dirty luck , not I ."
"There was this here O'Brien now -- he 's dead , ai n't he ?"
"Well now , I 'm no scholar , and you 're a lad as can read and figure , and to put it straight , do you take it as a dead man is dead for good , or do he come alive again ? ''"
"`` You can kill the body , Mr. Hands , but not the spirit ; you must know that already , '' I replied ."
"`` O'Brien there is in another world , and may be watching us . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
says he .
"`` Well , that 's unfort ` nate -- appears as if killing parties was a waste of time ."
"Howsomever , sperrits do n't reckon for much , by what I 've seen ."
"I 'll chance it with the sperrits , Jim ."
"And now , you 've spoke up free , and I 'll take it kind if you 'd step down into that there cabin and get me a -- well , a -- shiver my timbers !"
"I ca n't hit the name on ` t ; well , you get me a bottle of wine , Jim -- this here brandy 's too strong for my head . ''"
"Now , the coxswain 's hesitation seemed to be unnatural , and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy , I entirely disbelieved it ."
The whole story was a pretext .
He wanted me to leave the deck -- so much was plain ; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine .
"His eyes never met mine ; they kept wandering to and fro , up and down , now with a look to the sky , now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien ."
"All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty , embarrassed manner , so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception ."
"I was prompt with my answer , however , for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end ."
`` Some wine ? ''
I said .
`` Far better .
Will you have white or red ? ''
Then pare your squash and potatoes . ''
"`` There is only one potato , '' giggled Sally ."
"`` Cut it in four pieces , so it will go into the little kettle , and put the bits into cold water till it is time to cook them . ''"
`` Do I soak the squash too ? ''
"`` No , indeed !"
"Just pare it and cut it up , and put in into the steamer over the pot ."
"It is drier so , though it takes longer to cook . ''"
"Here a scratching at the door caused Sally to run and open it , when Kit appeared with a covered basket in his mouth ."
`` Here 's the butcher boy ! ''
"cried Daisy , much tickled at the idea , as she relieved him of his load , whereat he licked his lips and began to beg , evidently thinking that it was his own dinner , for he often carried it to his master in that way ."
"Being undeceived , he departed in great wrath and barked all the way downstairs , to ease his wounded feelings ."
"In the basket were two bits of steak -LRB- doll 's pounds -RRB- , a baked pear , a small cake , and paper with them on which Asia had scrawled , `` For Missy 's lunch , if her cookin ' do n't turn out well . ''"
"`` I do n't want any of her old pears and things ; my cooking will turn out well , and I 'll have a splendid dinner ; see if I do n't ! ''"
"cried Daisy , indignantly ."
`` We may like them if company should come .
"It is always well to have something in the storeroom , '' said Aunt Jo , who had been taught this valuable fact by a series of domestic panics ."
"`` Me is hundry , '' announced Teddy , who began to think what with so much cooking going on it was about time for somebody to eat something ."
"His mother gave him her workbasket to rummage , hoping to keep him quiet till dinner was ready , and returned to her housekeeping ."
"`` Put on your vegetables , set the table , and then have some coals kindling ready for the steak . ''"
"What a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little pot ; to peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer ; to whisk open the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on , and at last when the coals were red and glowing , to put two real steaks on a finger-long gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork ."
"The potatoes were done first , and no wonder , for they had boiled frantically all the while ."
"The were pounded up with a little pestle , had much butter and no salt put in -LRB- cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment -RRB- , then it was made into a mound in a gay red dish , smoothed over with a knife dipped in milk , and put in the oven to brown ."
"So absorbed in these last performances had Sally been , that she forgot her pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato , then a wail arose , for alas !"
alas !
the little pies were burnt black !
"`` Oh , my pies !"
My darling pies !
They are all spoilt ! ''
"cried poor Sally , wringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work ."
"The tart was especially pathetic , for the quirls and zigzags stuck up in all directions from the blackened jelly , like the walls and chimney of a house after a fire ."
"`` Dear , dear , I forgot to remind you to take them out ; it 's just my luck , '' said Aunt Jo , remorsefully ."
"`` Do n't cry , darling , it was my fault ; we 'll try again after dinner , '' she added , as a great tear dropped from Sally 's eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart ."
The door was opened almost at once by the maid .
`` Is Dr. Livesey in ? ''
I asked .
"No , she said , he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire ."
"`` So there we go , boys , '' said Mr. Dance ."
"This time , as the distance was short , I did not mount , but ran with Dogger 's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long , leafless , moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens ."
"Here Mr. Dance dismounted , and taking me along with him , was admitted at a word into the house ."
"The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library , all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them , where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat , pipe in hand , on either side of a bright fire ."
I had never seen the squire so near at hand .
"He was a tall man , over six feet high , and broad in proportion , and he had a bluff , rough-and-ready face , all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels ."
"His eyebrows were very black , and moved readily , and this gave him a look of some temper , not bad , you would say , but quick and high ."
"`` Come in , Mr. Dance , '' says he , very stately and condescending ."
"`` Good evening , Dance , '' says the doctor with a nod ."
"`` And good evening to you , friend Jim ."
What good wind brings you here ? ''
"The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson ; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other , and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest ."
"When they heard how my mother went back to the inn , Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh , and the squire cried `` Bravo ! ''"
and broke his long pipe against the grate .
"Long before it was done , Mr. Trelawney -LRB- that , you will remember , was the squire 's name -RRB- had got up from his seat and was striding about the room , and the doctor , as if to hear the better , had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll ."
At last Mr. Dance finished the story .
"`` Mr. Dance , '' said the squire , `` you are a very noble fellow ."
"And as for riding down that black , atrocious miscreant , I regard it as an act of virtue , sir , like stamping on a cockroach ."
"This lad Hawkins is a trump , I perceive ."
"Hawkins , will you ring that bell ?"
Mr. Dance must have some ale . ''
"`` And so , Jim , '' said the doctor , `` you have the thing that they were after , have you ? ''"
"`` Here it is , sir , '' said I , and gave him the oilskin packet ."
"The doctor looked it all over , as if his fingers were itching to open it ; but instead of doing that , he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat ."
"`` Squire , '' said he , `` when Dance has had his ale he must , of course , be off on his Majesty 's service ; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house , and with your permission , I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup . ''"
"`` As you will , Livesey , '' said the squire ; `` Hawkins has earned better than cold pie . ''"
"So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable , and I made a hearty supper , for I was as hungry as a hawk , while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed ."
"`` And now , squire , '' said the doctor ."
"asked Sally , all impatience to begin ."
"`` Shut the lower draught of the stove , so that the oven may heat ."
"Then wash your hands and get out the flour , sugar , salt , butter , and cinnamon ."
"See if the pie-board is clean , and pare your apple ready to put in . ''"
"Daisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could be expected , from so young a cook ."
"`` I really do n't know how to measure for such tiny pies ; I must guess at it , and if these do n't succeed , we must try again , '' said Mrs. Jo , looking rather perplexed , and very much amused with the small concern before her ."
"`` Take that little pan full of flour , put in a pinch of salt , and then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate ."
"Always remember to put your dry things together first , and then the wet ."
It mixes better so . ''
`` I know how ; I saw Asia do it .
Do n't I butter the pie plates too ?
"She did , the first thing , '' said Daisy , whisking the flour about at a great rate ."
`` Quite right !
"I do believe you have a gift for cooking , you take to it so cleverly , '' said Aunt Jo , approvingly ."
"`` Now a dash of cold water , just enough to wet it ; then scatter some flour on the board , work in a little , and roll the paste out ; yes , that 's the way ."
"Now put dabs of butter all over it , and roll it out again ."
"We wo n't have our pastry very rich , or the dolls will get dyspeptic . ''"
"Daisy laughed at the idea , and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand ."
"Then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin , and having got her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it ."
"Next the apple was sliced in , sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it , and then the top crust put on with breathless care ."
"`` I always wanted to cut them round , and Asia never would let me ."
How nice it is to do it all my ownty donty self ! ''
"said Daisy , as the little knife went clipping round the doll 's plate poised on her hand ."
"All cooks , even the best , meet with mishaps sometimes , and Sally 's first one occurred then , for the knife went so fast that the plate slipped , turned a somersault in the air , and landed the dear little pie upside down on the floor ."
"Sally screamed , Mrs. Jo laughed , Teddy scrambled to get it , and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen ."
"`` It did n't spill or break , because I pinched the edges together so hard ; it is n't hurt a bit , so I 'll prick holes in it , and then it will be ready , '' said Sally , picking up the capsized treasure and putting it into shape with a child-like disregard of the dust it had gathered in its fall ."
"`` My new cook has a good temper , I see , and that is such a comfort , '' said Mrs. Jo ."
"`` Now open the jar of strawberry jam , fill the uncovered pie , and put some strips of paste over the top as Asia does . ''"
"`` I 'll make a D in the middle , and have zigzags all round , that will be so interesting when I come to eat it , '' said Sally , loading the pie with quirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild ."
`` Now I put them in ! ''
"she exclaimed ; when the last grimy knob had been carefully planted in the red field of jam , and with an air of triumph she shut them into the little oven ."
`` Clear up your things ; a good cook never lets her utensils collect .
"The woman had been surprised before at the disappearance of her food , but she was more astonished still when , instead of the plank , she beheld a baby ."
"However , she was fond of children and had none of her own , so she made up her mind that she would keep it and take care of it ."
"The baby grew and throve as no baby in that country had ever done , and in four days he was a man , and as tall and strong as any brave of the tribe ."
"` You have treated me well , ' he said , ` and meat shall never fail to your house ."
"But now I must go , for I have much work to do . '"
Then he set out for his home .
"It took him many days to get there , and when he saw his son sitting in his place his anger was kindled , and his heart was stirred to take vengeance upon him ."
"So he went out quickly into the forest and shed tears , and each tear became a bird ."
"` Stay there till I want you , ' said he ; and he returned to the hut . '"
"I saw some pretty new birds , high up in a tree yonder , ' he remarked ."
And the son answered : ` Show me the way and I will get them for dinner . '
"The two went out together , and after walking for about half an hour they old man stopped ."
"` That is the tree , ' he said ."
And the son began to climb it .
Now a strange thing happened .
"The higher the young man climbed the higher the birds seemed to be , and when he looked down the earth below appeared no bigger than a star ."
"Sill he tried to go back , but he could not , and though he could not see the birds any longer he felt as if something were dragging him up and up ."
"He thought that he had been climbing that tree for days , and perhaps he had , for suddenly a beautiful country , yellow with fields of maize , stretched before him , and he gladly left the top of the tree and entered it ."
"He walked through the maize without knowing where he was going , when he heard a sound of knocking , and saw two old blind women crushing their food between two stones ."
"He crept up to them on tiptoe , and when one old woman passed her dinner to the other he held out his hand and took it and ate if for himself ."
"` How slow you are kneading that cake , ' cried the other old woman at last ."
"` Why , I have given you your dinner , and what more do you want ? '"
replied the second .
"` You did n't ; at least I never got it , ' said the other . '"
I certainly thought you took it from me ; but here is some more . '
And again the young man stretched out his hand ; and the two old women fell to quarrelling afresh .
"But when it happened for the third time the old women suspected some trick , and one of them exclaimed : ' I am sure there is a man here ; tell me , are you not my grandson ? '"
"` Yes , ' answered the young man , who wished to please her , ` and in return for your good dinner I will see if I can not restore your sight ; for I was taught in the art of healing by the best medicine man in the tribe . '"
"And with that he left them , and wandered about till he found the herb which he wanted ."
"Then he hastened back to the old women , and begging them to boil him some water , he threw the herb in ."
"As soon as the pot began to sing he took off the lid , and sprinkled the eyes of the women , and sight came back to them once more ."
"There was no night in that country , so , instead of going to bed very early , as he would have done in his own hut , the young man took another walk ."
"There he sat , lighted up by the flames from the burning house opposite , both hands holding tightly on his red cap , in which lay the treasure ; and now he knew what his heart really valued most -- to whom he really belonged ."
"But when the fire was put out , and the Goblin thought it over -- then -- ' I will divide myself between the two , ' he said . '"
"I can not quite give up the grocer , because of the jam ! '"
And it is just the same with us .
We also can not quite give up the grocer -- because of the jam .
The House in the Wood From the German of Grimm .
A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the borders of a great forest .
"One morning as he was going to his work , he said to his wife , ` Let our eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the wood ; and so that she shall not lose her way , I will take a bag of millet with me , and sprinkle the seed on the path . '"
"When the sun had risen high over the forest , the girl set out with a basin of soup ."
"But the field and wood sparrows , the larks and finches , blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago , and the girl could not find her way ."
"She went on and on , till the sun set and night came on ."
"The trees rustled in the darkness , the owls hooted , and she began to be very much frightened ."
Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between the trees .
"` There must be people living yonder , ' she thought , ` who will take me in for the night , ' and she began walking towards it ."
Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows .
"She knocked at the door , and a gruff voice called , ` Come in ! '"
"The girl stepped into the dark entrance , and tapped at the door of the room ."
"` Just walk in , ' cried the voice , and when she opened the door there sat an old gray-haired man at the table ."
"His face was resting on his hands , and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground ."
"By the stove lay three beasts , a hen , a cock , and a brindled cow ."
"The girl told the old man her story , and asked for a night 's lodging ."
"The man said : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"` Duks , ' answered the beasts ; and that must have meant , ` We are quite willing , ' for the old man went on , ` Here is abundance ; go into the back kitchen and cook us a supper . '"
"The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen , and cooked a good meal , but she did not think of the beasts ."
"She placed the full dishes on the table , sat down opposite the gray-haired man , and ate till her hunger was appeased ."
"When she was satisfied , she said , ` But now I am so tired , where is a bed in which I can sleep ? '"
"The beasts answered : You have eaten with him , You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Sleep then as you ought !"
"Then the old man said , ` Go upstairs , and there you will find a bedroom ; shake the bed , and put clean sheets on , and go to sleep . '"
"The maiden went upstairs , and when she had made the bed , she lay down ."
"After some time the gray-haired man came , looked at her by the light of his candle , and shook his head ."
"And when he saw that she was sound asleep , he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar ."
"The woodcutter came home late in the evening , and reproached his wife for leaving him all day without food ."
"I could not help wondering who it was that had `` got itt , '' and what `` itt '' was that he got ."
A knife in his back as like as not .
"`` Not much instruction there , '' said Dr. Livesey as he passed on ."
The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries .
"There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money , as in common account-books , but instead of explanatory writing , only a varying number of crosses between the two ."
"On the 12th of June , 1745 , for instance , a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone , and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause ."
"In a few cases , to be sure , the name of a place would be added , as `` Offe Caraccas , '' or a mere entry of latitude and longitude , as `` 62o 17 ' 20 '' , 19o 2 ' 40 '' . ''"
"The record lasted over nearly twenty years , the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on , and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions , and these words appended , `` Bones , his pile . ''"
"`` I ca n't make head or tail of this , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
"`` The thing is as clear as noonday , '' cried the squire ."
`` This is the black-hearted hound 's account-book .
These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered .
"The sums are the scoundrel 's share , and where he feared an ambiguity , you see he added something clearer ."
"` Offe Caraccas , ' now ; you see , here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast ."
God help the poor souls that manned her -- coral long ago . ''
`` Right ! ''
said the doctor .
`` See what it is to be a traveller .
Right !
"And the amounts increase , you see , as he rose in rank . ''"
"There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French , English , and Spanish moneys to a common value ."
`` Thrifty man ! ''
cried the doctor .
`` He was n't the one to be cheated . ''
"`` And now , '' said the squire , `` for the other . ''"
"The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal ; the very thimble , perhaps , that I had found in the captain 's pocket ."
"The doctor opened the seals with great care , and there fell out the map of an island , with latitude and longitude , soundings , names of hills and bays and inlets , and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores ."
"It was about nine miles long and five across , shaped , you might say , like a fat dragon standing up , and had two fine land-locked harbours , and a hill in the centre part marked `` The Spy-glass . ''"
"There were several additions of a later date , but above all , three crosses of red ink -- two on the north part of the island , one in the southwest -- and beside this last , in the same red ink , and in a small , neat hand , very different from the captain 's tottery characters , these words : `` Bulk of treasure here . ''"
"Over on the back the same hand had written this further information : Tall tree , Spy-glass shoulder , bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet ."
"The bar silver is in the north cache ; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock , ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it ."
"The arms are easy found , in the sand-hill , N. point of north inlet cape , bearing E. and a quarter N. J.F. ."
"If we had been allowed to sit idle , we should all have fallen in the blues , but Captain Smollett was never the man for that ."
"All hands were called up before him , and he divided us into watches ."
"The doctor and Gray and I for one ; the squire , Hunter , and Joyce upon the other ."
"Tired though we all were , two were sent out for firewood ; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth ; the doctor was named cook ; I was put sentry at the door ; and the captain himself went from one to another , keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted ."
"From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes , which were almost smoked out of his head , and whenever he did so , he had a word for me ."
"`` That man Smollett , '' he said once , `` is a better man than I am ."
"And when I say that it means a deal , Jim . ''"
Another time he came and was silent for a while .
"Then he put his head on one side , and looked at me ."
`` Is this Ben Gunn a man ? ''
he asked .
"`` I do not know , sir , '' said I. `` I am not very sure whether he 's sane . ''"
"`` If there 's any doubt about the matter , he is , '' returned the doctor ."
"`` A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island , Jim , ca n't expect to appear as sane as you or me ."
It does n't lie in human nature .
Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for ? ''
"`` Yes , sir , cheese , '' I answered ."
"`` Well , Jim , '' says he , `` just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food ."
"You 've seen my snuff-box , have n't you ?"
"And you never saw me take snuff , the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese -- a cheese made in Italy , very nutritious ."
"Well , that 's for Ben Gunn ! ''"
Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze .
"A good deal of firewood had been got in , but not enough for the captain 's fancy , and he shook his head over it and told us we `` must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier . ''"
"Then , when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog , the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects ."
"It appears they were at their wits ' end what to do , the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came ."
"But our best hope , it was decided , was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA ."
"From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen , two others were wounded , and one at least -- the man shot beside the gun -- severely wounded , if he were not dead ."
"Every time we had a crack at them , we were to take it , saving our own lives , with the extremest care ."
"And besides that , we had two able allies -- rum and the climate ."
"As for the first , though we were about half a mile away , we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night ; and as for the second , the doctor staked his wig that , camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies , the half of them would be on their backs before a week ."
"`` So , '' he added , `` if we are not all shot down first they 'll be glad to be packing in the schooner ."
"It 's always a ship , and they can get to buccaneering again , I suppose . ''"
"Tony could always outdistance her easily , but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now , and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide ."
"`` Brave , brave ! ''"
"her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock ; instead of hiding , her hero had run out at the gate !"
"At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly , as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled , and then for very disdain she could not sob ; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid in Tony 's stead ."
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out .
"Twilight came on , and scores and hundreds of people passed out , including the last one , who always has to run for it , but Maimie saw them not ."
She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears .
When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart .
It was the stillness of the Gardens .
"Then she heard clang , then from another part clang , then clang , clang far away ."
It was the Closing of the Gates .
"Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice say , `` So that 's all right . ''"
"It had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above , and she looked up in time to see an elm tree stretching out its arms and yawning ."
"She was about to say , `` I never knew you could speak ! ''"
"when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm , `` I suppose it is a bit coldish up there ? ''"
"and the elm replied , `` Not particularly , but you do get numb standing so long on one leg , '' and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off ."
Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing and she stole away to the Baby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca Holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her .
She was not in the least cold .
"She was wearing a russet-coloured pelisse and had the hood over her head , so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls ."
The rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball .
She was about forty round the waist .
"There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk , when Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk ."
"They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly , but that was because they used crutches ."
"An elderberry hobbled across the walk , and stood chatting with some young quinces , and they all had crutches ."
The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs .
"They were quite familiar objects to Maimie , but she had never known what they were for until to-night ."
She peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy .
He was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees .
"The way he did it was this , he pressed a spring in the trunk and they shut like umbrellas , deluging the little plants beneath with snow ."
"`` Oh , you naughty , naughty child ! ''"
"Maimie cried indignantly , for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears ."
"Fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot , but the chrysanthemums heard her , and they all said so pointedly `` Hoity-toity , what is this ? ''"
"This was a very important point , and needed much discussion ."
A thousand names were proposed and rejected for a thousand silly reasons .
"One was another reminded the queen of somebody she did not like ; but at length an idea flashed into the queen 's head , and she called out : ' I know !"
We will call her Muffette . '
"` That is the very thing , ' shouted the frog , jumping high into the air ; and so it was settled ."
The princess Muffette was about six months old when the frog noticed that the queen had begun to grow sad again .
` Why do you have that look in your eyes ? '
"she asked one day , when she had come in to play with the baby , who could now crawl ."
"The way they played their game was to let Muffette creep close to the frog , and then for the frog to bound high into the air and alight on the child 's head , or back , or legs , when she always sent up a shout of pleasure ."
"There is no play fellow like a frog ; but then it must be a fairy frog , or else you might hurt it , and if you did something dreadful might happen to you ."
"Well , as I have said , our frog was struck with the queen 's sad face , and lost no time in asking her what was the reason . '"
"I do n't see what you have to complain of now ; Muffette is quite well and quite happy , and even the Lion Fairy is kind to her when she sees her ."
What is it ? '
` Oh !
if her father could only see her ! '
"broke forth the queen , clasping her hands ."
` Or if I could only tell him all that has happened since we parted .
"But they will have brought him tidings of the broken carriage , and he will have thought me dead , or devoured by wild beasts ."
"And though he will mourn for me long -- I know that well -- yet in time they will persuade him to take a wife , and she will be young and fair , and he will forget me . '"
"And in all this the queen guessed truly , save that nine long years were to pass before he would consent to put another in her place ."
"The frog answered nothing at the time , but stopped her game and hopped away among the cypress trees ."
"Here she sat and thought and thought , and the next morning she went back to the queen and said : ' I have come , madam , to make you an offer ."
"Shall I go to the king instead of you , and tell him of your sufferings , and that he has the most charming baby in the world for his daughter ?"
"The way is long , and I travel slowly ; but , sooner or later , I shall be sure to arrive ."
"Only , are you not afraid to be left without my protection ?"
Ponder the matter carefully ; it is for you to decide . '
"` Oh , it needs no pondering , ' cried the queen joyfully , holding up her clasped hands , and making Muffette do likewise , in token of gratitude ."
But in order that he may know that you have come from me I will send him a letter . '
"And pricking her arm , she wrote a few words with her blood on the corner of her handkerchief ."
"Then tearing it off , she gave it to the frog , and they bade each other farewell ."
"It took the frog a year and four days to mount the ten thousand steps that led to the upper world , but that was because she was still under the spell of a wicked fairy ."
"By the time she reached the top , she was so tired that she had to remain for another year on the banks of a stream to rest , and also to arrange the procession with which she was to present herself before the king ."
"till you wondered that it was not out of breath , or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage ."
"`` Now , that bird , '' he would say , `` is , maybe , two hundred years old , Hawkins -- they live forever mostly ; and if anybody 's seen more wickedness , it must be the devil himself ."
"She 's sailed with England , the great Cap'n England , the pirate ."
"She 's been at Madagascar , and at Malabar , and Surinam , and Providence , and Portobello ."
She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships .
"It 's there she learned ` Pieces of eight , ' and little wonder ; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em , Hawkins !"
"She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa , she was ; and to look at her you would think she was a babby ."
"But you smelt powder -- did n't you , cap'n ? ''"
"`` Stand by to go about , '' the parrot would scream ."
"`` Ah , she 's a handsome craft , she is , '' the cook would say , and give her sugar from his pocket , and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on , passing belief for wickedness ."
"`` There , '' John would add , `` you ca n't touch pitch and not be mucked , lad ."
"Here 's this poor old innocent bird o ' mine swearing blue fire , and none the wiser , you may lay to that ."
"She would swear the same , in a manner of speaking , before chaplain . ''"
And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men .
"In the meantime , the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another ."
The squire made no bones about the matter ; he despised the captain .
"The captain , on his part , never spoke but when he was spoken to , and then sharp and short and dry , and not a word wasted ."
"He owned , when driven into a corner , that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew , that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well ."
"As for the ship , he had taken a downright fancy to her ."
"`` She 'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife , sir ."
"But , '' he would add , `` all I say is , we 're not home again , and I do n't like the cruise . ''"
"The squire , at this , would turn away and march up and down the deck , chin in air ."
"`` A trifle more of that man , '' he would say , `` and I shall explode . ''"
"We had some heavy weather , which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA ."
"Every man on board seemed well content , and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise , for it is my belief there was never a ship 's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea ."
"Double grog was going on the least excuse ; there was duff on odd days , as , for instance , if the squire heard it was any man 's birthday , and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy ."
"`` Never knew good come of it yet , '' the captain said to Dr. Livesey ."
"`` Spoil forecastle hands , make devils ."
That 's my belief . ''
"But good did come of the apple barrel , as you shall hear , for if it had not been for that , we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery ."
This was how it came about .
We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after -- I am not allowed to be more plain -- and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night .
"Wait till I go , and then we will stay all day , and pick as many berries as you want . ''"
"`` You never do go , you are so busy , and I 'm tired of waiting ."
I 'd rather go and get the berries for you all myself .
"I love to pick 'em , and I want to fill my new pail dreffly , '' sobbed Rob ."
"The pathetic sight of great tears tinkling into the dear new pail , and threatening to fill it with salt water instead of huckleberries , touched all the ladies present ."
"His mother patted the weeper on his back ; Daisy offered to stay home with him ; and Nan said , in her decided way , `` Let him come ; I 'll take care of him . ''"
"`` If Franz was going I would n't mind , for he is very careful ; but he is haying with the father , and I 'm not sure about the rest of you , '' began Mrs. Bhaer ."
"`` It 's so far , '' put in Jack ."
"`` I 'd carry him if I was going wish I was , '' said Dan , with a sigh ."
"`` Thank you , dear , but you must take care of your foot ."
I wish I could go .
"Stop a minute , I think I can manage it after all ; '' and Mrs. Bhaer ran out to the steps , waving her apron wildly ."
"Silas was just driving away in the hay-cart , but turned back , and agreed at once , when Mrs. Jo proposed that he should take the whole party to the pasture , and go for them at five o'clock ."
"`` It will delay your work a little , but never mind ; we will pay you in huckleberry pies , '' said Mrs. Jo , knowing Silas 's weak point ."
"His rough , brown face brightened up , and he said , with a cheery `` Haw !"
haw ! ''
"`` Wal now , Mis ' Bhaer , if you go to bribin ' of me , I shall give in right away . ''"
"`` Now , boys , I have arranged it so that you can all go , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , running back again , much relieved , for she loved to make them happy , and always felt miserable when she had disturbed the serenity of her little sons ; for she believed that the small hopes and plans and pleasures of children should be tenderly respected by grown-up people , and never rudely thwarted or ridiculed ."
`` Can I go ? ''
"said Dan , delighted ."
`` I thought especially of you .
"Be careful , and never mind the berries , but sit about and enjoy the lovely things which you know how to find all about you , '' answered Mrs. Bhaer , who remembered his kind offer to her boy ."
`` Me too !
me too ! ''
"sung Rob , dancing with joy , and clapping his precious pail and cover like castanets ."
"`` Yes , and Daisy and Nan must take good care of you ."
"Be at the bars at five o'clock , and Silas will come for you all . ''"
"Robby cast himself upon his mother in a burst of gratitude , promising to bring her every berry he picked , and not eat one ."
"Then they were all packed into the hay-cart , and went rattling away , the brightest face among the dozen being that of Rob , as he sat between his two temporary little mothers , beaming upon the whole world , and waving his best hat ; for his indulgent mamma had not the heart to bereave him of it , since this was a gala-day to him ."
"Such a happy afternoon as they had , in spite of the mishaps which usually occur on such expeditions !"
"Of course Tommy came to grief , tumbled upon a hornet 's nest and got stung ; but being used to woe , he bore the smart manfully , till Dan suggested the application of damp earth , which much assuaged the pain ."
"Daisy saw a snake , and flying from it lost half her berries ; but Demi helped her to fill up again , and discussed reptiles most learnedly the while ."
"That was all ; but brief as it was , and to me incomprehensible , it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight ."
"`` Livesey , '' said the squire , `` you will give up this wretched practice at once ."
Tomorrow I start for Bristol .
In three weeks ' time -- three weeks !
"-- two weeks -- ten days -- we 'll have the best ship , sir , and the choicest crew in England ."
Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy .
"You 'll make a famous cabin-boy , Hawkins ."
"You , Livesey , are ship 's doctor ; I am admiral ."
"We 'll take Redruth , Joyce , and Hunter ."
"We 'll have favourable winds , a quick passage , and not the least difficulty in finding the spot , and money to eat , to roll in , to play duck and drake with ever after . ''"
"`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` I 'll go with you ; and I 'll go bail for it , so will Jim , and be a credit to the undertaking ."
There 's only one man I 'm afraid of . ''
`` And who 's that ? ''
cried the squire .
"`` Name the dog , sir ! ''"
"`` You , '' replied the doctor ; `` for you can not hold your tongue ."
We are not the only men who know of this paper .
"These fellows who attacked the inn tonight -- bold , desperate blades , for sure -- and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger , and more , I dare say , not far off , are , one and all , through thick and thin , bound that they 'll get that money ."
We must none of us go alone till we get to sea .
"Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile ; you 'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol , and from first to last , not one of us must breathe a word of what we 've found . ''"
"`` Livesey , '' returned the squire , `` you are always in the right of it ."
I 'll be as silent as the grave . ''
"PART TWO -- The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea , and none of our first plans -- not even Dr. Livesey 's , of keeping me beside him -- could be carried out as we intended ."
"The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice ; the squire was hard at work at Bristol ; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth , the gamekeeper , almost a prisoner , but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures ."
"I brooded by the hour together over the map , all the details of which I well remembered ."
"Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper 's room , I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction ; I explored every acre of its surface ; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass , and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects ."
"Sometimes the isle was thick with savages , with whom we fought , sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us , but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures ."
"So the weeks passed on , till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey , with this addition , `` To be opened , in the case of his absence , by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins . ''"
"Obeying this order , we found , or rather I found -- for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print -- the following important news : Old Anchor Inn , Bristol , March 1 , 17 -- Dear Livesey -- As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London , I send this in double to both places ."
The ship is bought and fitted .
"She lies at anchor , ready for sea ."
"You never imagined a sweeter schooner -- a child might sail her -- two hundred tons ; name , HISPANIOLA ."
"DAMON AND PYTHIAS Mrs. Bhaer was right ; peace was only a temporary lull , a storm was brewing , and two days after Bess left , a moral earthquake shook Plumfield to its centre ."
"Tommy 's hens were at the bottom of the trouble , for if they had not persisted in laying so many eggs , he could not have sold them and made such sums ."
"Money is the root of all evil , and yet it is such a useful root that we can not get on without it any more than we can without potatoes ."
"Tommy certainly could not , for he spent his income so recklessly , that Mr. Bhaer was obliged to insist on a savings-bank , and presented him with a private one an imposing tin edifice , with the name over the door , and a tall chimney , down which the pennies were to go , there to rattle temptingly till leave was given to open a sort of trap-door in the floor ."
"The house increased in weight so rapidly , that Tommy soon became satisfied with his investment , and planned to buy unheard-of treasures with his capital ."
"He kept account of the sums deposited , and was promised that he might break the bank as soon as he had five dollars , on condition that he spent the money wisely ."
"Only one dollar was needed , and the day Mrs. Jo paid him for four dozen eggs , he was so delighted , that he raced off to the barn to display the bright quarters to Nat , who was also laying by money for the long-desired violin ."
"`` I wish I had 'em to put with my three dollars , then I 'd soon get enough to buy my fiddle , '' he said , looking wistfully at the money ."
`` P'raps I 'll lend you some .
"I have n't decided yet what I 'll do with mine , '' said Tommy , tossing up his quarters and catching them as they fell ."
`` Hi !
boys !
come down to the brook and see what a jolly great snake Dan 's got ! ''
called a voice from behind the barn .
"`` Come on , '' said Tommy ; and , laying his money inside the old winnowing machine , away he ran , followed by Nat ."
"The snake was very interesting , and then a long chase after a lame crow , and its capture , so absorbed Tommy 's mind and time , that he never thought of his money till he was safely in bed that night ."
"`` Never mind , no one but Nat knows where it is , '' said the easy-going lad , and fell asleep untroubled by any anxiety about his property ."
"Next morning , just as the boys assembled for school , Tommy rushed into the room breathlessly , demanding , `` I say , who has got my dollar ? ''"
`` What are you talking about ? ''
asked Franz .
"Tommy explained , and Nat corroborated his statement ."
"Every one else declared they knew nothing about it , and began to look suspiciously at Nat , who got more and more alarmed and confused with each denial ."
"`` Somebody must have taken it , '' said Franz , as Tommy shook his fist at the whole party , and wrathfully declared that , `` By thunder turtles !"
"if I get hold of the thief , I 'll give him what he wo n't forget in a hurry . ''"
"`` Keep cool , Tom ; we shall find him out ; thieves always come to grief , '' said Dan , as one who knew something of the matter ."
"`` May be some tramp slept in the barn and took it , '' suggested Ned ."
"`` No , Silas do n't allow that ; besides , a tramp would n't go looking in that old machine for money , '' said Emil , with scorn ."
`` Was n't it Silas himself ? ''
said Jack .
"`` Well , I like that !"
Old Si is as honest as daylight .
"You would n't catch him touching a penny of ours , '' said Tommy , handsomely defending his chief admirer from suspicion ."
"`` We 'll never get ashore at this rate , '' said I. `` If it 's the only course that we can lie , sir , we must even lie it , '' returned the captain ."
`` We must keep upstream .
"You see , sir , '' he went on , `` if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place , it 's hard to say where we should get ashore , besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs ; whereas , the way we go the current must slacken , and then we can dodge back along the shore . ''"
"`` The current 's less a ` ready , sir , '' said the man Gray , who was sitting in the fore-sheets ; `` you can ease her off a bit . ''"
"`` Thank you , my man , '' said I , quite as if nothing had happened , for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves ."
"Suddenly the captain spoke up again , and I thought his voice was a little changed ."
`` The gun ! ''
said he .
"`` I have thought of that , '' said I , for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort ."
"`` They could never get the gun ashore , and if they did , they could never haul it through the woods . ''"
"`` Look astern , doctor , '' replied the captain ."
"We had entirely forgotten the long nine ; and there , to our horror , were the five rogues busy about her , getting off her jacket , as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed ."
"Not only that , but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind , and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad ."
"`` Israel was Flint 's gunner , '' said Gray hoarsely ."
"At any risk , we put the boat 's head direct for the landing-place ."
"By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing , and I could keep her steady for the goal ."
But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door .
I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck .
`` Who 's the best shot ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` Mr. Trelawney , out and away , '' said I. `` Mr. Trelawney , will you please pick me off one of these men , sir ?"
"Hands , if possible , '' said the captain ."
Trelawney was as cool as steel .
He looked to the priming of his gun .
"`` Now , '' cried the captain , `` easy with that gun , sir , or you 'll swamp the boat ."
All hands stand by to trim her when he aims . ''
"The squire raised his gun , the rowing ceased , and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance , and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop ."
"They had the gun , by this time , slewed round upon the swivel , and Hands , who was at the muzzle with the rammer , was in consequence the most exposed ."
"However , we had no luck , for just as Trelawney fired , down he stooped , the ball whistled over him , and it was one of the other four who fell ."
"The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore , and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats ."
"`` Here come the gigs , sir , '' said I. `` Give way , then , '' cried the captain ."
`` We must n't mind if we swamp her now .
Isaac was a well-to-do old bachelor who had never had any notion of getting married until his sister died in the winter .
"And then , as soon as the spring planting was over , he began to look round for a wife ."
He came to me first and I said `` No '' good and hard .
"I liked Isaac well enough ; but I was snug and comfortable , and did n't feel like pulling up my roots and moving into another lot ; besides , Isaac 's courting seemed to me a shade too business-like ."
I ca n't get along without a little romance ; it 's my nature .
"Isaac was disappointed and said so , but intimated that it was n't crushing and that the next best would do very well ."
"The next best was Melissa , and he proposed to her after the decent interval of a fortnight ."
Melissa also refused him .
"I admit I was surprised at this , for I knew Melissa was rather anxious to marry ; but she has always been down on Isaac Appleby , from principle , because of a family feud on her mother 's side ; besides , an old beau of hers , a widower at Kingsbridge , was just beginning to take notice again , and I suspected Melissa had hopes concerning him ."
"Finally , I imagine Melissa did not fancy being second choice ."
"Whatever her reasons were , she refused poor Isaac , and that finished his matrimonial prospects as far as Jersey Cove was concerned , for there was n't another eligible woman in it -- that is , for a man of Isaac 's age ."
"I was the only widow , and the other old maids besides Melissa were all hopelessly old-maiden ."
"This was all three months ago , and Isaac had been keeping house for himself ever since ."
"Nobody knew much about how he got along , for the Appleby house is half a mile from anywhere , down near the shore at the end of a long lane -- the lonesomest place , as I did not fail to remember when I was considering Isaac 's offer ."
"`` I heard Jarvis Aldrich say Isaac had got a dog lately , '' said Melissa , when we finally came in sight of the house -- a handsome new one , by the way , put up only ten years ago ."
`` Jarvis said it was an imported breed .
I do hope it is n't cross . ''
"I have a mortal horror of dogs , and I followed Melissa into the big farmyard with fear and trembling ."
"We were halfway across the yard when Melissa shrieked : `` Anne , there 's the dog ! ''"
"There was the dog ; and the trouble was that he did n't stay there , but came right down the slope at a steady , business-like trot ."
"He was a bull-dog and big enough to bite a body clean in two , and he was the ugliest thing in dogs I had ever seen ."
Melissa and I both lost our heads .
"We screamed , dropped our parasols , and ran instinctively to the only refuge that was in sight -- a ladder leaning against the old Appleby house ."
"I am forty-five and something more than plump , so that climbing ladders is not my favorite form of exercise ."
But I went up that one with the agility and grace of sixteen .
"Melissa followed me , and we found ourselves on the roof -- fortunately it was a flat one -- panting and gasping , but safe , unless that diabolical dog could climb a ladder ."
I crept cautiously to the edge and peered over .
"The beast was sitting on his haunches at the foot of the ladder , and it was quite evident he was not short on time ."
The gleam in his eye seemed to say : `` I 've got you two unprincipled subscription hunters beautifully treed and it 's treed you 're going to stay .
That is what I call satisfying . ''
I reported the state of the case to Melissa .
`` What shall we do ? ''
"It was because his boat had got wedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice , through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle ."
"The fairies had as yet scarcely missed him , for they could not dance , so heavy were their hearts ."
"They forget all the steps when they are sad , and remember them again when they are merry ."
"David tells me that fairies never say , ` We feel happy ' : what they say is , ` We feel dancey . '"
"Well , they were looking very undancey indeed , when sudden laughter broke out among the onlookers , caused by Brownie , who had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented to the Duke ."
"Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared , though she had really no hope ; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie herself , who , however , was absolutely confident ."
"She was led before his grace , and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart , which for convenience ' sake was reached by a little trap-door in his diamond shirt , had begun to say mechanically , ` Cold , qui -- , ' when he stopped abruptly ."
` What 's this ? '
"he cried , and first he shook the heart like a watch , and then he put his ear to it ."
` Bless my soul ! '
"cried the doctor , and by this time of course the excitement among the spectators was tremendous , fairies fainting right and left ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They warned her -RSB- Everybody stared breathlessly at the Duke , who was very much startled , and looked as if he would like to run away ."
` Good gracious me ! '
"the doctor was heard muttering , and now the heart was evidently on fire , for he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth ."
The suspense was awful .
"Then in a loud voice , and bowing low , ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love . '"
You ca n't conceive the effect of it .
"Brownie held out her arms to the Duke and he flung himself into them , the Queen leapt into the arms of the Lord Chamberlain , and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen , for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything ."
"Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place , for if you leap into each other 's arms it is a fairy wedding ."
Of course a clergyman has to be present .
How the crowd cheered and leapt !
"Trumpets brayed , the moon came out , and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring ."
"Most gladsome sight of all , the Cupids plucked the hated fools ' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air ."
And then Maimie went and spoiled everything .
She could n't help it .
"She was crazy with delight over her little friend 's good fortune , so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy , ' O Brownie , how splendid ! '"
"Everybody stood still , the music ceased , the lights went out , and all in the time you may take to say , ` Oh dear ! '"
"An awful sense of her peril came upon Maimie ; too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates ; she heard the murmur of an angry multitude ; she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood , and she uttered a cry of terror and fled ."
How she ran !
and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head .
"Many times she lay down , and then quickly jumped up and ran on again ."
Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the Gardens .
He was all her own and she knew that he found strength and comfort in her sympathy and understanding .
"It was very wonderful to know she meant so much to him -- the knowledge helped her through moments that would otherwise have been unendurable , and gave her power to smile -- and even to laugh a little ."
"When Walter had gone she might indulge in the comfort of tears , but not while he was here ."
"She would not even let herself cry at night , lest her eyes should betray her to him in the morning ."
"On his last evening at home they went together to Rainbow Valley and sat down on the bank of the brook , under the White Lady , where the gay revels of olden days had been held in the cloudless years ."
"Rainbow Valley was roofed over with a sunset of unusual splendour that night ; a wonderful grey dusk just touched with starlight followed it ; and then came moonshine , hinting , hiding , revealing , lighting up little dells and hollows here , leaving others in dark , velvet shadow ."
"`` When I am ` somewhere in France , ' '' said Walter , looking around him with eager eyes on all the beauty his soul loved , `` I shall remember these still , dewy , moon-drenched places ."
The balsam of the fir-trees ; the peace of those white pools of moonshine ; the ` strength of the hills ' -- what a beautiful old Biblical phrase that is .
Rilla !
"Look at those old hills around us -- the hills we looked up at as children , wondering what lay for us in the great world beyond them ."
How calm and strong they are -- how patient and changeless -- like the heart of a good woman .
"Rilla-my-Rilla , do you know what you have been to me the past year ?"
I want to tell you before I go .
"I could not have lived through it if it had not been for you , little loving , believing heart . ''"
Rilla dared not try to speak .
She slipped her hand into Walter 's and pressed it hard .
"`` And when I 'm over there , Rilla , in that hell upon earth which men who have forgotten God have made , it will be the thought of you that will help me most ."
I know you 'll be as plucky and patient as you have shown yourself to be this past year -- I 'm not afraid for you .
"I know that no matter what happens , you 'll be Rilla-my-Rilla -- no matter what happens . ''"
"Rilla repressed tear and sigh , but she could not repress a little shiver , and Walter knew that he had said enough ."
"After a moment of silence , in which each made an unworded promise to each other , he said , `` Now we wo n't be sober any more ."
We 'll look beyond the years -- to the time when the war will be over and Jem and Jerry and I will come marching home and we 'll all be happy again . ''
"`` We wo n't be -- happy -- in the same way , '' said Rilla ."
"`` No , not in the same way ."
Nobody whom this war has touched will ever be happy again in quite the same way .
"But it will be a better happiness , I think , little sister -- a happiness we 've earned ."
"We were very happy before the war , were n't we ?"
"With a home like Ingleside , and a father and mother like ours we could n't help being happy ."
But that happiness was a gift from life and love ; it was n't really ours -- life could take it back at any time .
It can never take away the happiness we win for ourselves in the way of duty .
I 've realised that since I went into khaki .
"In spite of my occasional funks , when I fall to living over things beforehand , I 've been happy since that night in May ."
`` B ... b ... but m ... m ... miss ... th ... th ... they 're ... '' gasped Joe in desperation .
"`` Joseph , are you going to obey me or are you NOT ? ''"
said Anne .
A bolder and more self-possessed lad than Joe Sloane would have been overawed by her tone and the dangerous flash of her eyes .
This was a new Anne whom none of her pupils had ever seen before .
"Joe , with an agonized glance at St. Clair , went to the stove , opened the big , square front door , and threw the blue and white parcel in , before St. Clair , who had sprung to his feet , could utter a word ."
Then he dodged back just in time .
For a few moments the terrified occupants of Avonlea school did not know whether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred .
"The innocent looking parcel which Anne had rashly supposed to contain Mrs. Hiram 's nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinwheels for which Warren Sloane had sent to town by St. Clair Donnell 's father the day before , intending to have a birthday celebration that evening ."
"The crackers went off in a thunderclap of noise and the pinwheels bursting out of the door spun madly around the room , hissing and spluttering ."
Anne dropped into her chair white with dismay and all the girls climbed shrieking upon their desks .
"Joe Sloane stood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and St. Clair , helpless with laughter , rocked to and fro in the aisle ."
Prillie Rogerson fainted and Annetta Bell went into hysterics .
"It seemed a long time , although it was really only a few minutes , before the last pinwheel subsided ."
"Anne , recovering herself , sprang to open doors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room ."
"Then she helped the girls carry the unconscious Prillie into the porch , where Barbara Shaw , in an agony of desire to be useful , poured a pailful of half frozen water over Prillie 's face and shoulders before anyone could stop her ."
It was a full hour before quiet was restored ... but it was a quiet that might be felt .
Everybody realized that even the explosion had not cleared the teacher 's mental atmosphere .
"Nobody , except Anthony Pye , dared whisper a word ."
"Ned Clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while working a sum , caught Anne 's eye and wished the floor would open and swallow him up ."
The geography class were whisked through a continent with a speed that made them dizzy .
The grammar class were parsed and analyzed within an inch of their lives .
"Chester Sloane , spelling `` odoriferous '' with two f 's , was made to feel that he could never live down the disgrace of it , either in this world or that which is to come ."
"Anne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident would be laughed over that night at a score of tea-tables , but the knowledge only angered her further ."
In a calmer mood she could have carried off the situation with a laugh but now that was impossible ; so she ignored it in icy disdain .
When Anne returned to the school after dinner all the children were as usual in their seats and every face was bent studiously over a desk except Anthony Pye 's .
"He peered across his book at Anne , his black eyes sparkling with curiosity and mockery ."
"Anne twitched open the drawer of her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse sprang out of the drawer , scampered over the desk , and leaped to the floor ."
"Anne screamed and sprang back , as if it had been a snake , and Anthony Pye laughed aloud ."
"Then a silence fell ... a very creepy , uncomfortable silence ."
"Annetta Bell was of two minds whether to go into hysterics again or not , especially as she did n't know just where the mouse had gone ."
But she decided not to .
`` Now you 've done it !
I 'll give you a good thrashing when I get back ! ''
"roared Gus , shaking his fist at Joe , who stood staring , half-pleased , half-scared , at what he had done ."
`` Are you really going to try it ? ''
"asked Gus , as they glided on with increasing speed , and he , too , felt the charm of such a novel adventure , though the consequences bid fair to be serious ."
"`` Yes , I am , '' answered Frank , with the grim look he always wore when his strong will got the upper hand ."
"`` Bill will give it to us , any way , so we may as well have our fun out ."
"If you are afraid , I 'll slow down and you can jump off , '' and his brown eyes sparkled with the double delight of getting his heart 's desire and astonishing his friend at the same time by his skill and coolness ."
`` Go ahead .
"I 'll jump when you do ; '' and Gus calmly sat down again , bound in honor to stand by his mate till the smash came , though rather dismayed at the audacity of the prank ."
`` Do n't you call this just splendid ? ''
"exclaimed Frank , as they rolled along over the crossing , past the bridge , toward the curve , a mile from the station ."
`` Not bad .
They are yelling like mad after us .
"Better go back , if you can , '' said Gus , who was anxiously peering out , and , in spite of his efforts to seem at ease , not enjoying the trip a particle ."
`` Let them yell .
"I started to go to the curve , and I 'll do it if it costs me a hundred dollars ."
"No danger ; there 's no train under twenty minutes , I tell you , '' and Frank pulled out his watch ."
"But the sun was in his eyes , and he did not see clearly , or he would have discovered that it was later than he thought ."
"On they went , and were just rounding the bend when a shrill whistle in front startled both boys , and drove the color out of their cheeks ."
`` It 's the factory train ! ''
"cried Gus , in a husky tone , as he sprang to his feet ."
"`` No ; it 's the five-forty on the other road , '' answered Frank , with a queer thrill all through him at the thought of what might happen if it was not ."
"Both looked straight ahead as the last tree glided by , and the long track lay before them , with the freight train slowly coming down ."
"For an instant , the boys stood as if paralyzed ."
`` Jump ! ''
"said Gus , looking at the steep bank on one side and the river on the other , undecided which to try ."
`` Sit still ! ''
"commanded Frank , collecting his wits , as he gave a warning whistle to retard the on-coming train , while he reversed the engine and went back faster than he came ."
"A crowd of angry men was waiting for them , and Bill stood at the open switch in a towering passion as No. 11 returned to her place unharmed , but bearing two pale and frightened boys , who stepped slowly and silently down , without a word to say for themselves , while the freight train rumbled by on the main track ."
"Frank and Gus never had a very clear idea as to what occurred during the next few minutes , but vaguely remembered being well shaken , sworn at , questioned , threatened with direful penalties , and finally ordered off the premises forever by the wrathful depot-master ."
"Joe was nowhere to be seen , and as the two culprits walked away , trying to go steadily , while their heads spun round , and all the strength seemed to have departed from their legs , Frank said , in an exhausted tone , -- `` Come down to the boat-house and rest a minute . ''"
When Sara was fifteen she had gone away to school .
Jeff had missed her sorely .
"For four years he saw her only in the summers , and each year she had seemed taller , statelier , further from him ."
"When she graduated her father took her abroad for two years ; then she came home , a lovely , high-bred girl , dimpling on the threshold of womanhood ; and Jeffrey Miller was face to face with two bitter facts ."
"One was that he loved her -- not with the boy-and-girl love of long ago , but with the love of a man for the one woman in the world ; and the other was that she was as far beyond his reach as one of those sunset stars of which she had always reminded him in her pure , clear-shining loveliness ."
"He looked these facts unflinchingly in the face until he had grown used to them , and then he laid down his course for himself ."
"He loved Sara -- and he did not wish to conquer his love , even if it had been possible ."
"It were better to love her , whom he could never win , than to love and be loved by any other woman ."
"His great office in life was to be her friend , humble and unexpectant ; to be at hand if she should need him for ever so trifling a service ; never to presume , always to be faithful ."
Sara had not forgotten her old friend .
"But their former comradeship was now impossible ; they could be friends , but never again companions ."
"Sara 's life was full and gay ; she had interests in which he had no share ; her social world was utterly apart from his ; she was of the hill and its traditions , he was of the valley and its people ."
"The democracy of childhood past , there was no common ground on which they might meet ."
Only one thing Jeffrey had found it impossible to contemplate calmly .
"Some day Sara would marry -- a man who was her equal , who sat at her father 's table as a guest ."
"In spite of himself , Jeffrey 's heart filled with hot rebellion at the thought ; it was like a desecration and a robbery ."
"But , as the years went by , this thing he dreaded did not happen ."
"Sara did not marry , although gossip assigned her many suitors not unworthy of her ."
"She and Jeffrey were always friends , although they met but seldom ."
Sometimes she sent him a book ; it was his custom to search for the earliest mayflowers and take them to her ; once in a long while they met and talked of many things .
"Jeffrey 's calendar from year to year was red-lettered by these small happenings , of which nobody knew , or , knowing , would have cared ."
"So he and Sara drifted out of youth , together yet apart ."
"Her mother had died , and Sara was the gracious , stately mistress of Pinehurst , which grew quieter as the time went on ; the lovers ceased to come , and holiday friends grew few ; with the old colonel 's failing health the gaieties and lavish entertaining ceased ."
"Jeffrey thought that Sara must often be lonely , but she never said so ; she remained sweet , serene , calm-eyed , like the child he had met on the hill ."
"Only , now and then , Jeffrey fancied he saw a shadow on her face -- a shadow so faint and fleeting that only the eye of an unselfish , abiding love , made clear-sighted by patient years , could have seen it ."
"It hurt him , that shadow ; he would have given anything in his power to have banished it ."
And now this long friendship was to be broken .
Sara was going away .
"At first he had thought only of her pain , but now his own filled his heart ."
How could he live without her ?
How could he dwell in the valley knowing that she had gone from the hill ?
Never to see her light shine down on him through the northern gap in the pines at night !
"Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet , to vex her still more ; for she had always tucked them inside it , because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night ."
Then he nearly cried ; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead ; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it .
"Sometimes , though not often , he had dreams , and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys ."
"For hours he could not be separated from these dreams , though he wailed piteously in them ."
"They had to do , I think , with the riddle of his existence ."
"At such times it had been Wendy 's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap , soothing him in dear ways of her own invention , and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up , so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him ."
But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep .
"One arm dropped over the edge of the bed , one leg was arched , and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth , which was open , showing the little pearls ."
Thus defenceless Hook found him .
He stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy .
Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast ?
"The man was not wholly evil ; he loved flowers -LRB- I have been told -RRB- and sweet music -LRB- he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord -RRB- ; and , let it be frankly admitted , the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly ."
"Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree , but for one thing ."
What stayed him was Peter 's impertinent appearance as he slept .
"The open mouth , the drooping arm , the arched knee : they were such a personification of cockiness as , taken together , will never again , one may hope , be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness ."
They steeled Hook 's heart .
"If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident , and leapt at the sleeper ."
"Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed , Hook stood in darkness himself , and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle , the door of Slightly 's tree ."
"It did not entirely fill the aperture , and he had been looking over it ."
"Feeling for the catch , he found to his fury that it was low down , beyond his reach ."
"To his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter 's face and figure visibly increased , and he rattled the door and flung himself against it ."
Was his enemy to escape him after all ?
But what was that ?
The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter 's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach .
"He fathomed what it was straightaway , and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power ."
"Lest he should be taken alive , Hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug , blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his possession ."
"These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science , which was probably the most virulent poison in existence ."
Five drops of this he now added to Peter 's cup .
"His hand shook , but it was in exultation rather than in shame ."
"As he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper , but not lest pity should unnerve him ; merely to avoid spilling ."
"Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim , and turning , wormed his way with difficulty up the tree ."
As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole .
On every side the company of the Black Arrow was making for the hill .
"Some , being better runners , or having open ground to run upon , had far outstripped the others , and were already close upon the goal ; some , following valleys , had spread out to right and left , and outflanked the lads on either side ."
Dick plunged into the nearest cover .
"It was a tall grove of oaks , firm under foot and clear of underbrush , and as it lay down hill , they made good speed ."
"There followed next a piece of open , which Dick avoided , holding to his left ."
"Two minutes after , and the same obstacle arising , the lads followed the same course ."
"Thus it followed that , while the lads , bending continually to the left , drew nearer and nearer to the high road and the river which they had crossed an hour or two before , the great bulk of their pursuers were leaning to the other hand , and running towards Tunstall ."
The lads paused to breathe .
There was no sound of pursuit .
"Dick put his ear to the ground , and still there was nothing ; but the wind , to be sure , still made a turmoil in the trees , and it was hard to make certain ."
"`` On again , '' said Dick ; and , tired as they were , and Matcham limping with his injured foot , they pulled themselves together , and once more pelted down the hill ."
"Three minutes later , they were breasting through a low thicket of evergreen ."
"High overhead , the tall trees made a continuous roof of foliage ."
"It was a pillared grove , as high as a cathedral , and except for the hollies among which the lads were struggling , open and smoothly swarded ."
"On the other side , pushing through the last fringe of evergreen , they blundered forth again into the open twilight of the grove ."
`` Stand ! ''
cried a voice .
"And there , between the huge stems , not fifty feet before them , they beheld a stout fellow in green , sore blown with running , who instantly drew an arrow to the head and covered them ."
"Matcham stopped with a cry ; but Dick , without a pause , ran straight upon the forester , drawing his dagger as he went ."
"The other , whether he was startled by the daring of the onslaught , or whether he was hampered by his orders , did not shoot ; he stood wavering ; and before he had time to come to himself , Dick bounded at his throat , and sent him sprawling backward on the turf ."
The arrow went one way and the bow another with a sounding twang .
The disarmed forester grappled his assailant ; but the dagger shone and descended twice .
"Then came a couple of groans , and then Dick rose to his feet again , and the man lay motionless , stabbed to the heart ."
`` On ! ''
"said Dick ; and he once more pelted forward , Matcham trailing in the rear ."
"To say truth , they made but poor speed of it by now , labouring dismally as they ran , and catching for their breath like fish ."
"Matcham had a cruel stitch , and his head swam ; and as for Dick , his knees were like lead ."
But they kept up the form of running with undiminished courage .
Presently they came to the end of the grove .
"It stopped abruptly ; and there , a few yards before them , was the high road from Risingham to Shoreby , lying , at this point , between two even walls of forest ."
"At the sight Dick paused ; and as soon as he stopped running , he became aware of a confused noise , which rapidly grew louder ."
"It was at first like the rush of a very high gust of wind , but soon it became more definite , and resolved itself into the galloping of horses ; and then , in a flash , a whole company of men-at-arms came driving round the corner , swept before the lads , and were gone again upon the instant ."
"When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja's son, ""Now you must really go."""
"""Aunty,"" he answered, ""I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days longer. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see me."" So the old woman let him stay."
"When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room."
"There he said to his bag, ""Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring."""
"The bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam's hand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much frightened."
"""Who are you?"" she said to the prince. ""Where do you come from? Why do you come to my room?"""
"""Do not be afraid, princess,"" he said; ""I am no thief. I am a great Raja's son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to hunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and came to see you."""
"""Well,"" said the princess, ""as you are the son of such a great Raja, I will not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that I wish to marry you."""
"The prince then returned to the old woman's house; and when morning came the princess said to her mother, ""The son of a great Raja has come to this country, and I wish to marry him."" Her mother told this to the king."
"""Good,"" said the king; ""but if this Raja's son wishes to marry my daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of this he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall die."""
"In the morning the Raja's son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess. ""Oh,"" said the old woman, ""go away from this country, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and Rajas' sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them all killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas' sons who have tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do go away."" But the prince would not listen to anything she said."
"The king sent for the prince to the old woman's house, and his servants brought the Raja's son to the king's court-house to the king."
"There the king gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to crush all the oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him to the court-house. ""Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,"" he said to the prince, ""must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard seed, you will die."""
"The prince was very sorry when he heard this. ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day?"" he said to himself; ""and if I do not, the king will kill me."" He took the mustard seed to the old woman's house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the Ant-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to him. ""Why do you look so sad?"" said the Ant-Raja."
"The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not take the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me."""
"""Be happy,"" said the Ant-Raja; ""lie down and sleep; we will crush all the oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall take it to the king."" The Raja's son lay down and slept, and the ants crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the oil."
"The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the king said, ""You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so, you must first fight with my two demons and kill them."" The king a long time ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what to do with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country; and he did not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings' sons who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these demons; ""for,"" said the king to himself, ""perhaps the demons may be killed, and then I shall be rid of them."""
"When he heard of the demons the Raja's son was very sad. ""What can I do?"" he said to himself. ""How can I fight with these two demons?"" Then he thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and said, ""Why are you so sad?"" The Raja's son answered, ""The king has ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do this?"" ""Do not be frightened,"" said the tiger. ""Be happy. I and my wife will fight with them for you."""
"Then the Raja's son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were all gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he put on the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and said to him, ""May these tigers fight your demons for me?"""
"""Yes,"" said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his demons, provided they were killed. ""Then call your demons,"" said the Raja's son, ""and these tigers will fight them."" The king did so, and the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons."
"""That is good,"" said the king. ""But you must do something else before I give you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must go and beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you."""
"The Raja's son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old woman's house and sat on his bed. ""Little bed,"" he said, ""up in the sky is the king's kettle-drum. I want to go to it."" The bed flew up with him, and the Raja's son beat the drum, and the king heard him."
"Still, when he came down, the king would not give him his daughter."
"""You have,"" he said to the prince, ""done the three things I told you to do; but you must do one thing more."" ""If I can, I will,"" said the Raja's son."
"Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax hatchet, and said, ""To-morrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet."""
"The Raja's son went back to the old woman's house. He was very sad, and thought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. ""I had his oil crushed out by the ants,"" he said to himself. ""I had his demons killed by the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what can I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet?"""
"At night he went on his bed to see the princess. ""To-morrow,"" he said to her, ""your father will kill me."" ""Why?"" asked the princess."
"""He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet."
"How can I ever do that?"" said the Raja's son. ""Do not be afraid,"" said the princess; ""do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite easily."""
"Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince."
"""To-morrow,"" she said, ""when no one is near you, you must say to the tree-trunk, 'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair.' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet's blade."""
"So one day, 'twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall of the year, the weather was so wild and rough outside, and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew, till the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all sat round the fire, busy with this thing and that. But just then, all at once something gave three taps on the window-pane. Then the father went out to see what was the matter; and, when he got out of doors, what should he see but a great big White Bear."
"""Good-evening to you!"" said the White Bear."
"""The same to you!"" said the man."
"""Will you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I'll make you as rich as you are now poor,"" said the Bear."
"Well, the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich; but still he thought he must have a bit of a talk with his daughter first; so he went in and told them how there was a great White Bear waiting outside, who had given his word to make them so rich if he could only have the youngest daughter."
"The lassie said ""No!"" outright. Nothing could get her to say anything else; so the man went out and settled it with the White Bear that he should come again the next Thursday evening and get an answer."
"Meantime he talked his daughter over, and kept on telling her of all the riches they would get, and how well off she would be herself; and so at last she thought better of it, and washed and mended her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and was ready to start. I can't say her packing gave her much trouble."
"Next Thursday evening came the White Bear to fetch her, and she got upon his back with her bundle, and off they went. So, when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear said:"
"""Are you afraid?"""
"""No,"" she wasn't."
"""Well! mind and hold tight by my shaggy coat, and then there's nothing to fear,"" said the Bear."
"So she rode a long, long way, till they came to a great steep hill."
"There, on the face of it, the White Bear gave a knock, and a door opened, and they came into a castle where there were many rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver and gold; and there, too, was a table ready laid, and it was all as grand as grand could be. Then the White Bear gave her a silver bell; and when she wanted anything, she was only to ring it, and she would get it at once."
"Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore on, she got sleepy after her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so she rang the bell; and she had scarce taken hold of it before she came into a chamber where there was a bed made, as fair and white as any one would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains and gold fringe. All that was in the room was gold or silver; but when she had gone to bed and put out the light, a man came and laid himself alongside her. That was the White Bear, who threw off his beast shape at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she had put out the light, and before the day dawned he was up and off again. So things went on happily for a while, but at last she began to get silent and sorrowful; for there she went about all day alone, and she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters. So one day, when the White Bear asked what it was that she lacked, she said it was so dull and lonely there, and how she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters, and that was why she was so sad and sorrowful, because she couldn't get to them."
"""Well, well!"" said the Bear, ""perhaps there's a cure for all this; but you must promise me one thing, not to talk alone with your mother, but only when the rest are by to hear; for she'll take you by the hand and try to lead you into a room alone to talk; but you must mind and not do that, else you'll bring bad luck on both of us."""
"So one Sunday the White Bear came and said, now they could set off to see her father and mother. Well, off they started, she sitting on his back; and they went far and long. At last they came to a grand house, and there her brothers and sisters were running about out of doors at play, and everything was so pretty, 'twas a joy to see."
"""This is where your father and mother live now,"" said the White Bear; ""but don't forget what I told you, else you'll make us both unlucky."""
"""No! bless her, she'd not forget;"" and when she had reached the house, the White Bear turned right about and left her."
"Then, when she went in to see her father and mother, there was such joy, there was no end to it. None of them thought they could thank her enough for all she had done for them. Now, they had everything they wished, as good as good could be, and they all wanted to know how she got on where she lived."
"Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all she wished. What she said beside I don't know, but I don't think any of them had the right end of the stick, or that they got much out of her. But so, in the afternoon, after they had done dinner, all happened as the White Bear had said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her bedroom; but she minded what the White Bear had said, and wouldn't go upstairs."
"""Oh! what we have to talk about will keep!"" she said, and put her mother off. But, somehow or other, her mother got round her at last, and she had to tell her the whole story. So she said, how every night when she had gone to bed a man came and lay down beside her as soon as she had put out the light; and how she never saw him, because he was always up and away before the morning dawned; and how she went about woeful and sorrowing, for she thought she should so like to see him; and how all day long she walked about there alone; and how dull and dreary and lonesome it was."
"""My!"" said her mother; ""it may well be a Troll you slept with! But now I'll teach you a lesson how to set eyes on him. I'll give you a bit of candle, which you can carry home in your bosom; just light that while he is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on him."""
"Yes! she took the candle and hid it in her bosom, and as night drew on, the White Bear came and fetched her away."
"But when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear asked if all hadn't happened as he had said."
"""Well, she couldn't say it hadn't."""
"""Now, mind,"" said he, ""if you have listened to your mother's advice, you have brought bad luck on us both, and then, all that has passed between us will be as nothing."""
"""No,"" she said, ""she hadn't listened to her mother's advice."""
"So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the old story over again. There came a man and lay down beside her; but at dead of night, when she heard he slept, she got up and struck a light, lit the candle, and let the light shine on him, and so she saw that he was the loveliest Prince one ever set eyes on, and she fell so deep in love with him on the spot, that she thought she couldn't live if she didn't give him a kiss there and then. And so she did; but as she kissed him, she dropped three hot drops of tallow on his shirt, and he woke up."
"""What have you done?"" he cried; ""now you have made us both unlucky, for had you held out only this one year, I had been freed. For I have a step-mother who has bewitched me, so that I am a White Bear by day, and a Man by night. But now all ties are snapt between us; now I must set off from you to her. She lives in a Castle which stands East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and there, too, is a Princess, with a nose three ells long, and she's the wife I must have now."""
"She wept and took it ill, but there was no help for it; go he must."
Then she asked if she mightn't go with him.
"But there after a while, Halvor went about, and was so strange and dull and silent. Then the Princesses asked him what he lacked, and if he didn't like to live with them any longer? Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare, and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or other he did so long to go home, for his father and mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to see."
"Well, they thought that might be done easily enough."
"""You shall go thither and come back hither, safe and unscathed, if you will only follow our advice,"" said the Princesses."
"Yes, he'd be sure to mind all they said. So they dressed him up till he was as grand as a king's son, and then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but they told him to be sure and not take it off, and not to name their names, for there would be an end of all his bravery, and then he'd never see them more."
"""If I only stood at home I'd be glad,"" said Halvor; and it was done as he had wished. Then stood Halvor at his father's cottage door before he knew a word about it. Now it was about dusk at even, and so, when they saw such a grand stately lord walk in, the old couple got so afraid they began to bow and scrape. Then Halvor asked if he couldn't stay there, and have a lodging there that night. No; that he couldn't."
"""We can't do it at all,"" they said, ""for we haven't this thing or that thing which such a lord is used to have; 'twere best your lordship went up to the farm, no long way off, for you can see the chimneys, and there they have lots of everything."""
"Halvor wouldn't hear of it he wanted to stop; but the old couple stuck to their own, that he had better go to the farmer's; there he would get both meat and drink; as for them, they hadn't even a chair to offer him to sit down on."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go up there till to-morrow early, but let me just stay here to-night; worst come to the worst, I can sit in the chimney corner."""
"Well, they couldn't say anything against that; so Halvor sat down by the ingle, and began to poke about in the ashes, just as he used to do when he lay at home in old days, and stretched his lazy bones."
"Well, they chattered and talked about many things; and they told Halvor about this thing and that; and so he asked them if they had never had any children."
"Yes, yes, they had once a lad whose name was Halvor, but they didn't know whither he had wandered; they couldn't even tell whether he were dead or alive."
"""Couldn't it be me, now?"" said Halvor."
"""Let me see; I could tell him well enough,"" said the old wife, and rose up. ""Our Halvor was so lazy and dull, he never did a thing; and besides, he was so ragged, that one tatter took hold of the next tatter on him. No; there never was the making of such a fine fellow in him as you are, master."""
"A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell on Halvor's face, just as when he was at home of old poking about in the ashes, she knew him at once."
"""Ah! but it is you after all, Halvor?"" she cried; and then there was such joy for the old couple, there was no end to it; and he was forced to tell how he had fared, and the old dame was so fond and proud of him, nothing would do but he must go up at once to the farmer's, and show himself to the lassies, who had always looked down on him. And off she went first, and Halvor followed after. So, when she got up there, she told them all how Halvor had come home again, and now they should only just see how grand he was, for, said she, ""he looks like nothing but a King's son."""
"""All very fine,"" said the lassies, and tossed up their heads. ""We'll be bound he's just the same beggarly ragged boy he always was."""
"Just then in walked Halvor, and then the lassies were all so taken aback, they forgot their sarks in the ingle, where they were sitting darning their clothes, and ran out in their smocks. Well, when they were got back again, they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look at Halvor, towards whom they had always been proud and haughty."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""you always thought yourselves so pretty and neat, no one could come near you; but now you should just see the eldest Princess I have set free; against her you look just like milkmaids, and the midmost is prettier still; but the youngest, who is my sweetheart, she's fairer than both sun and moon. Would to Heaven they were only here,"" said Halvor, ""then you'd see what you would see."""
"He had scarce uttered these words before there they stood, but then he felt so sorry, for now what they had said came into his mind. Up at the farm there was a great feast got ready for the Princesses, and much was made of them, but they wouldn't stop there."
"""No, we want to go down to your father and mother,"" they said to Halvor; ""and so we'll go out now and look about us."""
"So he went down with them, and they came to a great lake just outside the farm. Close by the water was such a lovely green bank; here the Princesses said they would sit and rest a while; they thought it so sweet to sit down and look over the water."
"So they sat down there, and when they had sat a while the youngest Princess said:"
"""I may as well comb your hair a little, Halvor."""
"Well, Halvor laid his head on her lap, and she combed his bonny locks, and it wasn't long before Halvor fell fast asleep. Then she took the ring from his finger, and put another in its stead; and she said:"
"""Now hold me all together! and now would we were all in Soria Moria Castle."""
"So when Halvor woke up, he could very well tell that he had lost the Princesses, and began to weep and wail; and he was so downcast, they couldn't comfort him at all. In spite of all his father and mother said, he wouldn't stop there, but took farewell of them, and said he was safe not to see them again; for if he couldn't find the Princesses again, he thought it not worth while to live."
"Well, he had still about sixty pounds left, so he put them into his pocket, and set out on his way. So, when he had walked a while, he met a man with a tidy horse, and he wanted to buy it, and began to chaffer with the man."
"""Aye,"" said the man, ""to tell the truth, I never thought of selling him; but if we could strike a bargain perhaps """
"""What do you want for him?"" asked Halvor."
"""I didn't give much for him, nor is he worth much; he's a brave horse to ride, but he can't draw at all; still he's strong enough to carry your knapsack and you too, turn and turn about,"" said the man."
"At last they agreed on the price, and Halvor laid the knapsack on him, and so he walked a bit, and rode a bit, turn and turn about. At night he came to a green plain where stood a great tree, at the roots of which he sat down. There he let the horse loose, but he didn't lie down to sleep, but opened his knapsack and took a meal. At peep of day off he set again, for he could take no rest. So he rode and walked and walked and rode the whole day through the wide wood, where there were so many green spots and glades that shone so bright and lovely between the trees. He didn't know at all where he was or whither he was going, but he gave himself no more time to rest than when his horse cropped a bit of grass, and he took a snack out of his knapsack when they came to one of those green glades. So he went on walking and riding by turns, and as for the wood there seemed to be no end to it."
But at dusk the next day he saw a light gleaming away through the trees.
"His rallying cry was, ""I am a Democrat."""
"The Mexican War now came on. General Taylor's army met the enemy first at Palo Alto, where he ran across the Mexicans six thousand strong, and, though he had but two thousand men, drove them back, only losing nine men. This was the most economical battle of the war."
"The next afternoon he met the enemy at Resaca de la Palma, and whipped him in the time usually required to ejaculate the word ""scat!"""
"Next General Taylor proceeded against Monterey, September 24, and with six thousand men attacked the strongly-fortified city, which held ten thousand troops. The Americans avoided the heavy fire as well as possible by entering the city and securing rooms at the best hotel, leaving word at the office that they did not wish to be disturbed by the enemy. In fact, the soldiers did dig their way through from house to house to avoid the volleys from the windows, and thus fought to within a square of the Grand Plaza, when the city surrendered. The Grand Plaza is generally a sandy vacant lot, where Mexicans sell tamales made of the highly-peppered but tempting cutlets of the Mexican hairless dog."
"The battle of Buena Vista took place February 23, 1847, General Santa Anna commanding the Mexicans. He had twenty thousand men, and General Taylor's troops were reduced in numbers. The fight was a hot one, lasting all day, and the Americans were saved by Bragg's artillery."
Bragg used the old Colonial method of rolling his guns up to the nose of the enemy and then discharging an iron-foundry into his midst. This disgusted the enemy so that General Santa Anna that evening took the shreds of his army and went away.
"General Kearney was sent to take New Mexico and California. His work consisted mainly in marching for General Frémont, who had been surveying a new route to Oregon, and had with sixty men been so successful that on the arrival of Kearney, with the aid of Commodores Sloat and Stockton, California was captured, and has given general satisfaction to every one."
"In March, 1847, General Scott, with twelve thousand men, bombarded Vera Cruz four days, and at the end of that time the city was surrendered."
"At Cerro Gordo, a week later, Scott overtook the enemy under General Santa Anna, and made such a fierce attack that the Mexicans were completely routed. Santa Anna left his leg on the field of battle and rode away on a pet mule named Charlotte Corday. The leg was preserved and taken to the Smithsonian Institute. It is made of second-growth hickory, and has a brass ferrule and a rubber eraser on the end. General Taylor afterwards taunted him with this incident, and, though greatly irritated, Santa Anna said there was no use trying to kick."
"Puebla resisted not, and the army marched into the city of Mexico August 7. The road was rendered disagreeable by strong fortifications and thirty thousand men who were not on good terms with Scott. The environments and suburbs one after another were taken, and a parley for peace ensued, during which the Mexicans were busy fortifying some more on the quiet."
"September 8 the Americans made their assault, and carried the outworks one by one. Then the castle of Chapultepec was stormed. First the outer works were scaled, which made them much more desirable, and the moat was removed by means of a stomach-pump and blotting-pad, and then the escarpment was up-ended, the Don John tower was knocked silly by a solid shot, and the castle capitulated."
"Thus on the 14th of September the old flag floated over the court-house of Mexico, and General Scott ate his tea in the palace of the Montezumas. Peace was declared February 2, 1848, and the United States owned the vast country southward to the Gila (pronounced Heeler) and west to the Pacific Ocean."
"The Wilmot Proviso was invented by David Wilmot, a poor, struggling member of Congress, who moved that in any territory acquired by the United States slavery should be prohibited except upon the advice of a physician. The motion was lost."
"Gold was discovered in the Sacramento Valley in August, 1848, by a workman who was building a mill-race. A struggle ensued over this ground as to who should own the race. It threatened to terminate in a race war, but was settled amicably."
In eighteen months one hundred thousand people went to the scene.
"Thousands left their skeletons with the red brother, and other thousands left theirs on the Isthmus of Panama or on the cruel desert. Many married men went who had been looking a long time for some good place to go to. Leaving their wives with ill-concealed relief, they started away through a country filled with death, to reach a country they knew not of. Some died en route, others were hanged, and still others became the heads of new families. Some came back and carried water for their wives to wash clothing for their neighbors."
"It was a long hard trip then across the plains. One of the author's friends at the age of thirteen years drove a little band of cows from the State of Indiana to Sacramento. He says he would not do it again for anything. He is now a man, and owns a large prune-orchard in California, and people tell him he is getting too stout, and that he ought to exercise more, and that he ought to walk every day several miles; but he shakes his head, and says, ""No, I will not walk any to-day, and possibly not to-morrow or the day following. Do not come to me and refer to taking a walk: I have tried that. Possibly you take me for a dromedary; but you are wrong. I am a fat man, and may die suddenly some day while lacing up my shoes, but when I go anywhere I ride."""
"When he got to Sacramento, where gold was said to be so plentiful, he was glad to wash dishes for his board, and he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into the fields for to feed swine, and he would fain have filled his system with the California peaches which the swine did eat, and he began to be in want, and no man gave unto him, and if he had spent his substance in riotous living, he said, it would have been different."
"About thirty years after that he arose and went unto his father, and carried his dinner with him, also a government bond and a new suit of raiment for the old gentleman."
I do not know what we should learn from this.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE WEBSTERS.
"Daniel Webster, together with Mr. Clay, had much to do with the Compromise measures of 1850. These consisted in the admission of California as a free State, the organizing of the Territories of Utah and New Mexico without any provision regarding slavery pro or con, the payment to Texas of one hundred million dollars for New Mexico, which was a good trade for Texas, the prohibition of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia, and the enactment of a Fugitive Slave Law permitting owners of slaves to follow them into the free States and take them back in irons, if necessary. The officials and farmers of the free States were also expected to turn out, call the dog, leave their work, and help catch these chattels and carry them to the south-bound train."
"Daniel Webster was born in 1782, and Noah in 1758. Daniel was educated at Dartmouth College, where he was admitted in 1797. He taught school winters and studied summers, as many other great men have done since, until he knew about everything that anybody could. What Dan did not know, Noah did."
"Strange to say, Daniel was frightened to death when first called upon to speak a piece. He says he committed dozens of pieces to memory and recited them to the woods and crags and cows and stone abutments of the New England farms, but could not stand up before a school and utter a word."
"In 1801 he studied law with Thomas W. Thompson, afterwards United States Senator. He read then for the first time that ""Law is a rule of action prescribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong."""
"In 1812 he was elected to Congress, and in 1813 made his maiden speech."
"One of his most masterly speeches was made on economical and financial subjects; and yet in order to get his blue broadcloth coat with brass buttons from the tailor-shop to wear while making the speech, he had to borrow twenty-five dollars."
"When the country has wanted a man to talk well on these subjects it has generally been compelled to advance money to him before he could make a speech. Sometimes he has to be taken from the pawn-shop. Webster, it is said, was the most successful lawyer, after he returned to Boston, that the State of Massachusetts has ever known; and yet his mail was full of notices from banks down East, announcing that he had overdrawn his account."
"""Behold him then, O excellent by strength!"
"And speak wise words, not out of season."
"You see how, by his talking overmuch,     The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!"""
"The king saw that he was himself referred to, and said, ""O Teacher!"
"are you speaking of us?"""
"And the Bodisat spake openly, and said, ""O great king! be it thou, or be it any other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap like this."""
"And the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few words."
A Lac of Rupees for a Bit of Advice
"A poor blind Brahman and his wife were dependent on their son for their subsistence. Every day the young fellow used to go out and get what he could by begging. This continued for some time, till at last he became quite tired of such a wretched life, and determined to go and try his luck in another country. He informed his wife of his intention, and ordered her to manage somehow or other for the old people during the few months that he would be absent. He begged her to be industrious, lest his parents should be angry and curse him."
"One morning he started with some food in a bundle, and walked on day after day, till he reached the chief city of the neighbouring country."
"Here he went and sat down by a merchant's shop and asked alms. The merchant inquired whence he had come, why he had come, and what was his caste; to which he replied that he was a Brahman, and was wandering hither and thither begging a livelihood for himself and wife and parents. Moved with pity for the man, the merchant advised him to visit the kind and generous king of that country, and offered to accompany him to the court. Now at that time it happened that the king was seeking for a Brahman to look after a golden temple which he had just had built. His Majesty was very glad, therefore, when he saw the Brahman and heard that he was good and honest. He at once deputed him to the charge of this temple, and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and one hundred rupees to be paid to him every year as wages."
"Two months after this, the Brahman's wife, not having heard any news of her husband, left the house and went in quest of him. By a happy fate she arrived at the very place that he had reached, where she heard that every morning at the golden temple a golden rupee was given in the king's name to any beggar who chose to go for it. Accordingly, on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband."
"""Why have you come here?"" he asked. ""Why have you left my parents?"
"Care you not whether they curse me and I die? Go back immediately, and await my return."""
"""No, no,"" said the woman. ""I cannot go back to starve and see your old father and mother die. There is not a grain of rice left in the house."""
"""O Bhagawant!"" exclaimed the Brahman. ""Here, take this,"" he continued, scribbling a few lines on some paper, and then handing it to her, ""and give it to the king. You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees for it."" Thus saying he dismissed her, and the woman left."
"On this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice First, If a person is travelling and reaches any strange place at night, let him be careful where he puts up, and not close his eyes in sleep, lest he close them in death. Secondly, If a man has a married sister, and visits her in great pomp, she will receive him for the sake of what she can obtain from him; but if he comes to her in poverty, she will frown on him and disown him. Thirdly, If a man has to do any work, he must do it himself, and do it with might and without fear."
"On reaching her home the Brahmani told her parents of her meeting with her husband, and what a valuable piece of paper he had given her; but not liking to go before the king herself, she sent one of her relations. The king read the paper, and ordering the man to be flogged, dismissed him. The next morning the Brahmani took the paper, and while she was going along the road to the darbar reading it, the king's son met her, and asked what she was reading, whereupon she replied that she held in her hands a paper containing certain bits of advice, for which she wanted a lac of rupees. The prince asked her to show it to him, and when he had read it gave her a parwana for the amount, and rode on. The poor Brahmani was very thankful. That day she laid in a great store of provisions, sufficient to last them all for a long time."
"In the evening the prince related to his father the meeting with the woman, and the purchase of the piece of paper. He thought his father would applaud the act. But it was not so. The king was more angry than before, and banished his son from the country."
"So the prince bade adieu to his mother and relations and friends, and rode off on his horse, whither he did not know. At nightfall he arrived at some place, where a man met him, and invited him to lodge at his house. The prince accepted the invitation, and was treated like a prince. Matting was spread for him to squat on, and the best provisions set before him."
"""Ah!"" thought he, as he lay down to rest, ""here is a case for the first piece of advice that the Brahmani gave me. I will not sleep to-night."""
"It was well that he thus resolved, for in the middle of the night the man rose up, and taking a sword in his hand, rushed to the prince with the intention of killing him. But he rose up and spoke."
"""Do not slay me,"" he said. ""What profit would you get from my death?"
"If you killed me you would be sorry afterwards, like that man who killed his dog."""
"""What man? What dog?"" he asked."
"""I will tell you,"" said the prince, ""if you will give me that sword."""
"So he gave him the sword, and the prince began his story:"
"""Once upon a time there lived a wealthy merchant who had a pet dog. He was suddenly reduced to poverty, and had to part with his dog. He got a loan of five thousand rupees from a brother merchant, leaving the dog as a pledge, and with the money began business again. Not long after this the other merchant's shop was broken into by thieves and completely sacked. There was hardly ten rupees' worth left in the place. The faithful dog, however, knew what was going on, and went and followed the thieves, and saw where they deposited the things, and then returned."
"""In the morning there was great weeping and lamentation in the merchant's house when it was known what had happened. The merchant himself nearly went mad. Meanwhile the dog kept on running to the door, and pulling at his master's shirt and paijamas, as though wishing him to go outside. At last a friend suggested that, perhaps, the dog knew something of the whereabouts of the things, and advised the merchant to follow its leadings. The merchant consented, and went after the dog right up to the very place where the thieves had hidden the goods. Here the animal scraped and barked, and showed in various ways that the things were underneath. So the merchant and his friends dug about the place, and soon came upon all the stolen property."
Nothing was missing. There was everything just as the thieves had taken them.
"""The merchant was very glad. On returning to his house, he at once sent the dog back to its old master with a letter rolled under the collar, wherein he had written about the sagacity of the beast, and begged his friend to forget the loan and to accept another five thousand rupees as a present. When this merchant saw his dog coming back again, he thought, 'Alas! my friend is wanting the money. How can I pay him? I have not had sufficient time to recover myself from my recent losses. I will slay the dog ere he reaches the threshold, and say that another must have slain it. Thus there will be an end of my debt. No dog, no loan.' Accordingly he ran out and killed the poor dog, when the letter fell out of its collar. The merchant picked it up and read it. How great was his grief and disappointment when he knew the facts of the case!"
"An effort was made to get up a fight between the French fleet and the English at Newport for the championship, but a severe storm came up and prevented it."
"In July the Wyoming Massacre, under the management of the Tories and Indians, commanded by Butler, took place in that beautiful valley near Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania."
"This massacre did more to make the Indians and Tories unpopular in this country than any other act of the war. The men were away in the army, and the women, children, and old men alone were left to the vengeance of the two varieties of savage. The Indians had never had gospel privileges, but the Tories had. Otherwise they resembled each other."
"In 1779 the English seemed to have Georgia and the South pretty well to themselves. Prevost, the English general, made an attack on Charleston, but, learning that Lincoln was after him, decided that, as he had a telegram to meet a personal friend at Savannah, he would go there. In September, Lincoln, assisted by the French under D'Estaing, attacked Savannah. One thousand lives were lost, and D'Estaing showed the white feather to advantage. Count Pulaski lost his life in this fight. He was a brave Polish patriot, and his body was buried in the Savannah River."
"The capture of Stony Point about this time by ""Mad Anthony Wayne"" was one of the most brilliant battles of the war."
"Learning the countersign from a negro who sold strawberries to the British, the troops passed the guard over the bridge that covered the marsh, and, gagging the worthy inside guard, they marched up the hill with fixed bayonets and fixed the enemy to the number of six hundred."
"The countersign was, ""The fort is won,"" and so it was, in less time than it takes to ejaculate the word ""scat!"" Wayne was wounded at the outset, but was carried up the hill in command, with a bandage tied about his head. He was a brave man, and never knew in battle what fear was. Yet, strange to say, a bat in his bed would make him start up and turn pale."
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE CLOSE OF THE REVOLUTION.
"The atrocities introduced into this country by the Tories and Indians caused General Sullivan to go out against the measly enemy, whip him near Elmira, and destroy the fields of corn and villages in the Genesee country, where the Indian women were engaged in farming while their men-folks attended to the massacre industry."
The weak point with the Americans seemed to be lack of a suitable navy.
"A navy costs money, and the Colonists were poor. In 1775 they fitted out several swift sailing-vessels, which did good service. Inside of five years they captured over five hundred ships, cruised among the British isles, and it is reported that they captured war-vessels that were tied to the English wharves."
"Paul Jones had a method of running his vessel alongside the enemy's, lashing the two together, and then having it out with the crew, generally winning in a canter. His idea in lashing the two ships together was to have one good ship to ride home on. Generally it was the one he captured, while his own, which was rotten, was allowed to go down. This was especially the case in the fight between the Richard and the Serapis, September 23, 1779."
"In 1780 the war was renewed in South Carolina. Charleston, after a forty days' siege, was forced to surrender. Gates now took charge of the South, and also gave a sprinting exhibition at Camden, where he was almost wiped off the face of the earth. He had only two troops left at the close of the battle, and they could not keep up with Gates in the retreat. This battle and the retreat overheated Gates and sowed the seeds of heart-disease, from which he never recovered. He should have chosen a more peaceful life, such as the hen-traffic, or the growth of asparagus for the market."
"Benedict Arnold has been severely reproached in history, but he was a brave soldier, and possibly serving under Gates, who jealously kept him in the background, had a good deal to do with the little European dicker which so darkened his brilliant career as a soldier."
"Unhappy man! He was not well received in England, and, though a brilliant man, was forced to sit in a corner evening after evening and hear the English tell his humorous stories as their own."
"The Carolinas were full of Tories, and opposition to English rule was practically abandoned in the South for the time, with the exception of that made in a desultory swamp-warfare by the partisan bands with such leaders as Marion, Sumter, and Pickens."
Two hundred thousand dollars of Continental money was the sum now out.
"Forty dollars of it would buy one dollar's worth of groceries; but the grocer had to know the customer pretty well, and even then it was more to accommodate than anything else that he sold at that price."
"The British flooded the country with a counterfeit that was rather better-looking than the genuine: so that by the time a man had paid six hundred dollars for a pair of boots, and the crooked bills had been picked out and others substituted, it made him feel that starting a republic was a mighty unpopular job."
"General Arnold had married a Tory lady, and lived in Philadelphia while recovering from his wounds received at Quebec and Saratoga. He was rather a high roller, and ran behind, so that it is estimated that his bills there per month required a peach-basket-full of currency with which to pay them, as the currency was then quoted. Besides, Gates had worried him, and made him think that patriotism was mostly politics. He was also overbearing, and the people of Philadelphia mobbed him once. He was reprimanded gently by Washington, but Arnold was haughty and yet humiliated. He got command of West Point, a very important place indeed, and then arranged with Clinton to swap it for six thousand three hundred and fifteen pounds and a colonelcy in the English army."
"Major André was appointed to confer with Arnold, and got off the ship Vulture to make his way to the appointed place, but it was daylight by that time, and the Vulture, having been fired on, dropped down the river. André now saw no way for him but to get back to New York; but at Tarrytown he was met by three patriots, who caught his horse by the reins, and, though André tried to tip them, he did not succeed. They found papers on his person, among them a copy of Punch, which made them suspicious that he was not an American, and so he was tried and hanged as a spy. This was one of the saddest features of the American Revolution, and should teach us to be careful how we go about in an enemy's country, also to use great care in selecting and subscribing for papers."
"In 1781, Greene, who succeeded Gates, took charge of the two thousand ragged and bony troops. January 17 he was attacked at Cowpens by Tarleton. The militia fell back, and the English made a grand charge, supposing victory to be within reach. But the wily and foxy troops turned at thirty yards and gave the undertaking business a boom that will never be forgotten."
"Morgan was in command of the Colonial forces. He went on looking for more regulars to kill, but soon ran up against Cornwallis the surrenderer."
"General Greene now joined Morgan, and took charge of the retreat. At the Yadkin River they crossed over ahead of Cornwallis, when it began for to rain. When Cornwallis came to the river he found it so swollen and restless that he decided not to cross. Later he crossed higher up, and made for the fords of the Dan at thirty miles a day, to head off the Americans. Greene beat him, however, by a length, and saved his troops."
"The writer has seen the place on the Yadkin where Cornwallis decided not to cross. It was one of the pivotal points of the war, and is of about medium height."
"A fight followed at Guilford Court-House, where the Americans were driven back, but the enemy got thinned out so noticeably that Cornwallis decided to retreat. He went back to Washington on a Bull Run schedule, without pausing even for feed or water. Cornwallis was greatly agitated, and the coat he wore at the time, and now shown in the Smithsonian Institution, shows distinctly the marks made where the Colonists played checkers on the tail."
"The battle of Eutaw Springs, September 8, also greatly reduced the British forces at that point."
"Arnold conducted a campaign into Virginia, and was very brutal about it, killing a great many people who were strangers to him, and who had never harmed him, not knowing him, as the historian says, from ""Adam's off ox."""
"His heart was good, but his blood was bad,       Sing Glory hallelujah.""[3]"

CHAPTER VIII.
THE DUTCH AT NEW AMSTERDAM.
"Soon after the discovery of the Hudson, Dutch ships began to visit that region, to traffic in furs with the Indians. Some huts were erected by these traders on Manhattan Island in 1613, and a trading-post was established in 1615. Relics of these times are frequently turned up yet on Broadway while putting in new pipes, or taking out old pipes, or repairing other pipes, or laying plans for yet other pipes, or looking in the earth to see that the original pipes have not been taken away."
"Afterwards the West India Company obtained a grant of New Netherland, and New Amsterdam was fairly started. In 1626, Minuit, the first governor, arrived, and, as we have stated, purchased the entire city of New York of the Indians for twenty-four dollars."
"Then trouble sprang up between the Dutch and the Swedes on the Delaware over the possession of Manhattan, and when the two tribes got to conversing with each other over their rights, using the mother-tongue on both sides, it reminded one of the Chicago wheat market when business is good. The English on the Connecticut also saw that Manhattan was going to boom as soon as the Indians could be got farther west, and that property would be high there."
"Peter Stuyvesant was the last Dutch governor of New York. He was a relative of mine. He disliked the English very much. They annoyed him with their democratic ideas and made his life a perfect hell to him. He would be sorry to see the way our folks have since begun to imitate the English. I can almost see him rising in his grave to note how the Stuyvesants in full cry pursue the affrighted anise-seed bag, or with their coaching outfits go tooling along 'cross country, stopping at the inns on the way and unlimbering their portable bath-tubs to check them with the ""clark."""
"Pete, you did well to die early. You would not have been happy here now."
"While Governor Stuyvesant was in hot water with the English, the Swedes, and the Indians, a fleet anchored in the harbor and demanded the surrender of the place in the name of the Duke of York, who wished to use it for a game preserve. After a hot fight with his council, some of whom were willing even then to submit to English rule and hoped that the fleet might have two or three suits of tweed which by mistake were a fit and therefore useless to the owners, and that they might succeed in swapping furs for these, the governor yielded, and in 1664 New York became a British possession, named as above."
"The English governors, however, were not popular. They were mostly political hacks who were pests at home and banished to New York, where the noise of the streets soon drove them to drink. For nine years this sort of thing went on, until one day a Dutch fleet anchored near the Staten Island brewery and in the evening took the town."
"However, in the year following, peace was restored between England and Holland, and New Amsterdam became New York again, also subject to the Tammany rule."
"Andros was governor for a time, but was a sort of pompous tomtit, with a short breath and a large aquiline opinion of himself. He was one of the arrogant old pie-plants whose growth was fostered by the beetle-bellied administration at home. He went back on board the City of Rome one day, and did not return."
"New York had a gleam of hope for civil freedom under the rule of the Duke of York and the county Democracy, but when the duke became James II. he was just like other people who get a raise of salary, and refused to be privately entertained by the self-made ancestry of the American."
"He was proud and arrogant to a degree. He forbade legislation, and stopped his paper. New York was at this time annexed to the New England Colony, and began keeping the Sabbath so vigorously that the angels had great difficulty in getting at it."
"Nicholson, who was the lieutenant tool of iniquity for Andros, fled with him when democracy got too hot for them. Captain Leisler, supported by Steve Brodie and everything south of the Harlem, but bitterly opposed by the aristocracy, who were distinguished by their ability to use new goods in making their children's clothes, whereas the democracy had to make vests for the boys from the cast-off trousers of their fathers, governed the province until Governor Sloughter arrived."
"Sloughter was another imported Smearkase in official life, and arrested Leisler at the request of an aristocrat who drove a pair of bang-tail horses up and down Nassau Street on pleasant afternoons and was afterwards collector of the port. Having arrested Leisler for treason, the governor was a little timid about executing him, for he had never really killed a man in his life, and he hated the sight of blood; so Leisler's enemies got the governor to take dinner with them, and mixed his rum, so that when he got ready to speak, his remarks were somewhat heterogeneous, and before he went home he had signed a warrant for Leisler's immediate execution."
"When he awoke in the morning at his beautiful home on Whitehall Street, the sun was gayly glinting the choppy waves of Buttermilk Channel, and by his watch, which had run down, he saw that it was one o'clock, but whether it was one o'clock A.M. or P.M. he did not know, nor whether it was next Saturday or Tuesday before last. Oh, how he must have felt!"
"His room was dark, the gas having gone out to get better air. He attempted to rise, but a chill, a throb, a groan, and back he lay hastily on the bed just as it was on the point of escaping him. Suddenly a thought came to him. It was not a great thought, but it was such a thought as comes to those who have been thoughtless. He called for a blackamoor slave from abroad who did chores for him, and ordered a bottle of cooking brandy, then some club soda he had brought from London with him. Next he drank a celery-glass of it, and after that he felt better. He then drank another."
"""Keep out of the way of this bed, Julius,"" he said. ""It is coming around that way again. Step to one side, Julius, please, and let the bed walk around and stretch its legs. I never saw a bed spread itself so,"" he continued, seeming to enjoy his own Lancashire humor. ""All night I seemed to feel a great pain creeping over me, Julius,"" he said, hesitatingly, again filling his celery-glass, ""but I see now that it was a counterpane."""
"Eighty years after that, Sloughter was a corpse."
"We should learn from this not to be too hasty in selecting our birthplaces. Had he been born in America, he might have been alive yet."
"From this on the struggles of the people up to the time of the Revolution were enough to mortify the reader almost to death. I will not go over them again. It was the history of all the other Colonies; poor, proud, with large masses of children clustering about, and Indians lurking in the out-buildings. The mother-country was negligent, and even cruel. Her political offscourings were sent to rule the people. The cranberry-crops soured on the vines, and times were very scarce."
"It was during this period that Captain William Kidd, a New York ship-master and anti-snapper from Mulberry Street, was sent out to overtake and punish a few of the innumerable pirates who then infested the high seas."
"Studying first the character, life, and public services of the immoral pirate, and being perfectly foot-loose, his wife having eloped with her family physician, he determined to take a little whirl at the business himself, hoping thereby to escape the noise and heat of New York and obtain a livelihood while life lasted which would maintain him the remainder of his days unless death overtook him."
"Dropping off at Boston one day to secure a supply of tobacco, he was captured while watching the vast number of street-cars on Washington Street. He was taken to England, where he was tried and ultimately hanged. His sudden and sickening death did much to discourage an American youth of great brilliancy who had up to 1868 intended to be a pirate, but who, stumbling across the ""Life and Times of Captain Kidd, and his Awful Death,"" changed his whole course and became one of the ablest historians of the age in which he lived."
This should teach us to read the papers instead of loaning them to people who do not subscribe.
"At last the old man said, ""Come down, honey. I am afraid the limb will break if you don't."" Then, as the boy still remained, he told him that those were not eating-apples, that they were just common cooking-apples, and that there were worms in them. But the boy said he didn't mind a little thing like that. So then the old gentleman got irritated, and called the dog, and threw turf at the boy, and at last saluted him with pieces of turf and decayed cabbages; and after the lad had gone away the old man pried the bull-dog's jaws open and found a mouthful of pantaloons and a freckle."
"I do not tell this, of course, in Mr. Webster's language, but I give the main points as they recur now to my mind."
"Though I have been a close student of Mr. Webster for years and have carefully examined his style, I am free to say that his ideas about writing a book are not the same as mine. Of course it is a great temptation for a young author to write a book that will have a large sale; but that should not be all. We should have a higher object than that, and strive to interest those who read the book. It should not be jerky and scattering in its statements."
"I do not wish to do an injustice to a great man who is now no more, a man who did so much for the world and who could spell the longest word without hesitation, but I speak of these things just as I would expect others to criticise my work. If one aspire to be a member of the literati of his day, he must expect to be criticised. I have been criticised myself. When I was in public life, as a justice of the peace in the Rocky Mountains, a man came in one day and criticised me so that I did not get over it for two weeks."
"I might add, though I dislike to speak of it now, that Mr. Webster was at one time a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts. I believe that was the only time he ever stepped aside from the strait and narrow way."
"A good many people do not know this, but it is true."
"Mr. Webster was also a married man, yet he never murmured or repined."
CHAPTER XXIV.
BEFO' THE WAH CAUSES WHICH LED TO IT MASTERLY GRASP OF THE SUBJECT SHOWN BY THE AUTHOR.
"A Man named Lopez in 1851 attempted to annex Cuba, thus furnishing for our Republican wrapper a genuine Havana filler; but he failed, and was executed, while his plans were not."
"Franklin Pierce was elected President on the Democratic ticket, running against General Scott, the Whig candidate. Slavery began to be discussed again, when Stephen A. Douglas, in Congress, advocated squatter sovereignty, or the right for each Territory to decide whether it would be a free or a slave State. The measure became a law in 1854."
"That was what made trouble in Kansas. The two elements, free and slave, were arrayed against each other, and for several years friends from other States had to come over and help Kansas bury its dead. The condition of things for some time was exceedingly mortifying to the citizen who went out to milk after dark without his gun."
"Trouble with Mexico arose, owing to the fact that the government had used a poor and unreliable map in establishing the line: so General Gadsden made a settlement for the disputed ground, and we paid Mexico ten millions of dollars. It is needless to say that we have since seen the day when we wished that we had it back."
"Two ports of entry were now opened to us in Japan by Commodore Perry's Expedition, and cups and saucers began to be more plentiful in this country, many of the wealthier deciding at that time not to cool tea in the saucer or drink it vociferously from that vessel. This custom and the Whig party passed away at the same time."
The Republican or Anti-Slavery party nominated for President John C.
"Frémont, who received the vote of eleven States, but James Buchanan was elected, and proved to the satisfaction of the world that there is nothing to prevent any unemployed man's applying for the Presidency of the United States; also that if his life has been free from ideas and opinions he may be elected sometimes where one who has been caught in the very act of thinking, and had it proved on him, might be defeated."
Chief Justice Taney now stated that slaves could be taken into any State of the Union by their owners without forfeiting the rights of ownership.
"This was called the Dred Scott decision, and did much to irritate Abolitionists like John Brown, whose soul as this book goes to press is said to be marching on. Brown was a Kansas man with a mission and massive whiskers. He would be called now a crank; but his action in seizing a United States arsenal at Harper's Ferry and declaring the slaves free was regarded by the South as thoroughly representative of the Northern feeling."
"The country now began to be in a state of restlessness. Brown had been captured and hanged as a traitor. Northern men were obliged to leave their work every little while to catch a negro, crate him, and return him to his master or give him a lift towards Canada; and, as the negro was replenishing the earth at an astonishing rate, general alarm broke out."
"Douglas was the champion of squatter sovereignty, John C. Breckinridge of the doctrine that slaves could be checked through as personal baggage into any State of the Union, and Lincoln of the anti-slavery principle which afterwards constituted the spinal column of the Federal Government as opposed to the Confederacy of the seceded States."
"Lincoln was elected, which reminded him of an anecdote. Douglas and several other candidates were defeated, which did not remind them of anything."
"South Carolina seceded in December, 1860, and soon after Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit."
"The following February the Confederacy was organized at Montgomery, Alabama, and Jefferson Davis was elected President. Long and patient effort on the part of the historian to ascertain how he liked it has been entirely barren of results. Alexander H. Stephens was made Vice-President."
"Everything belonging to the United States and not thoroughly fastened down was carried away by the Confederacy, while President Buchanan looked the other way or wrote airy persiflage to tottering dynasties which slyly among themselves characterized him as a neat and cleanly old lady."
"Had Buchanan been a married man it is generally believed now that his wife would have prevented the war. Then she would have called James out from under the bed and allowed him to come to the table for his meals with the family. But he was not married, and the war came on."
"Major Anderson was afraid to remain at Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, so crossed over to Fort Sumter. The South regarded this as hostility, and the fort was watched to see if any one should attempt to divide his lunch with the garrison, which it was declared would be regarded as an act of defiance. The reader will see by this that a deaf and dumb asylum in Northern Michigan was about the only safe place for a peaceable man at that time."
"President Lincoln found himself placed at the head of a looted government on the sharp edge of a crisis that had not been properly upholstered. The Buchanan cabinet had left little except a burglar's tool or two here and there to mark its operations, and, with the aged and infirm General Scott at the head of a little army, and no encouragement except from the Abolitionists, many of whom had never seen a colored man outside of a minstrel performance, the President stole incog. into Washington, like a man who had agreed to lecture there."
"Southern officers resigned daily from the army and navy to go home and join the fortunes of their several States. Meantime, the Federal government moved about like a baby elephant loaded with shot, while the new Confederacy got men, money, arms, and munitions of war from every conceivable point."
"Finding that supplies were to be sent to Major Anderson, General Peter G. T. Beauregard summoned Major Anderson to surrender. General Beauregard, after the war, became one of the good, kind gentlemen who annually stated over their signatures that they had examined the Louisiana State Lottery and that there was no deception about it. The Lottery felt grateful for this, and said that the general should never want while it had a roof of its own."
"Major Anderson had seventy men, while General Beauregard had seven thousand. After a bombardment and a general fight of thirty-four hours, the starved and suffocated garrison yielded to overwhelming numbers."
"Sherman's army of sixty thousand, after a month's rest at Savannah, started north to unite with Grant in the final blow. ""Before it was terror, behind it ashes."""
"Columbia was captured February 17, and burned, without Sherman's authority, the night following. Charleston was evacuated the next day."
"Johnston was recalled to take command, and opposed the march of Sherman, but was driven back after fierce engagements at Bentonville and Averysboro. On March 25 Lee decided to attack Grant, and, while the latter was busy, get out of Richmond and join Johnston, but when this battle, known as the attack on Fort Steadman, was over, Grant's hold was tighter than ever."
"Sheridan attacked Lee's rear with a heavy force, and at Five Forks, April 1, the surprised garrison was defeated with five thousand captured. The next day the entire Union army advanced, and the line of Confederate intrenchments was broken. On the following day Petersburg and Richmond were evacuated, but Mr. Davis was not there. He had gone away. Rather than meet General Grant and entertain him when there was no pie in the house, he and the Treasury had escaped from the haunts of man, wishing to commune with nature for a while. He was captured at Irwinsville, Georgia, under peculiar and rather amusing circumstances."
"He was never punished, with the exception perhaps that he published a book and did not realize anything from it."
"Lee fled to the westward, but was pursued by the triumphant Federals, especially by Sheridan, whose cavalry hung on his flanks day and night."
"Food failed the fleeing foe, and the young shoots of trees for food and the larger shoots of the artillery between meals were too much for that proud army, once so strong and confident."
Let us not dwell on the particulars.
"As Sheridan planted his cavalry squarely across Lee's path of retreat, the worn but heroic tatters of a proud army prepared to sell themselves for a bloody ransom and go down fighting, but Grant had demanded their surrender, and, seeing back of the galling, skirmishing cavalry solid walls of confident infantry, the terms of surrender were accepted by General Lee, and April 9 the Confederate army stacked its arms near Appomattox Court-House."
"The Confederate war debt was never paid, for some reason or other, but the Federal debt when it was feeling the best amounted to two billion eight hundred and forty-four million dollars. One million men lost their lives."
Was it worth while?
"In the midst of the general rejoicing, President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre, April 14. The assassin was captured in a dying condition in a burning barn, through a crack in the boarding of which he had been shot by a soldier named Boston Corbett. He died with no sympathetic applause to soothe the dull, cold ear of death."
"West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863, and Nevada in 1864."
"The following chapters will be devoted to more peaceful details, while we cheerfully close the sorrowful pages in which we have confessed that, with all our greatness as a nation, we could not stay the tide of war."
CHAPTER XXIX.
"TOO MUCH LIBERTY IN PLACES AND NOT ENOUGH ELSEWHERE. THOUGHTS ON THE LATE WAR WHO IS THE BIGGER ASS, THE MAN WHO WILL NOT FORGIVE AND FORGET, OR THE MAWKISH AND MOIST-EYED SNIVELLER WHO WANTS TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME?"
"When Patrick Henry put his old cast-iron spectacles on the top of his head and whooped for liberty, he did not know that some day we should have more of it than we knew what to do with. He little dreamed that the time would come when we should have more liberty than we could pay for."
"When Mr. Henry sawed the air and shouted for liberty or death, I do not believe that he knew the time would come when Liberty would stand on Bedloe's Island and yearn for rest and change of scene."
"It seems to me that we have too much liberty in this country in some ways. We have more liberty than we have money. We guarantee that every man in America shall fill himself up full of liberty at our expense, and the less of an American he is the more liberty he can have. Should he desire to enjoy himself, all he needs is a slight foreign accent and a willingness to mix up with politics as soon as he can get his baggage off the steamer. The more I study American institutions the more I regret that I was not born a foreigner, so that I could have something to say about the management of our great land. If I could not be a foreigner, I believe I should prefer to be a policeman or an Indian not taxed."
"I am often led to ask, in the language of the poet, ""Is civilization a failure, and is the Caucasian played out?"""
"Almost every one can have a good deal of fun in America except the American. He seems to be so busy paying his taxes that he has very little time to vote, or to mingle in society's giddy whirl, or to mix up with the nobility. That is the reason why the alien who rides across the United States in the ""Limited Mail"" and writes a book about us before breakfast wonders why we are always in a hurry. That also is the reason why we have to throw our meals into ourselves with such despatch, and hardly have time to maintain a warm personal friendship with our families."
"We do not care much for wealth, but we must have freedom, and freedom costs money. We have advertised to furnish a bunch of freedom to every man, woman, and child who comes to our shores, and we are going to deliver the goods whether we have any left for ourselves or not."
"What would the great world beyond the seas say to us if some day the blue-eyed Oriental, with his heart full of love for our female seminaries and our old women's homes, should land upon our coasts and crave freedom in car-load lots but find that we were using all the liberty ourselves? But what do we want of liberty, anyhow? What could we do with it if we had it? It takes a man of leisure to enjoy liberty, and we have no leisure whatever. It is a good thing to keep in the house for the use of guests, but we don't need it for ourselves."
"Therefore we have a statue of Liberty Enlightening the World, because it shows that we keep Liberty on tap winter and summer. We want the whole broad world to remember that when it gets tired of oppression it can come here to America and oppress us. We are used to it, and we rather like it. If we don't like it, we can get on the steamer and go abroad, where we may visit the effete monarchies and have a high old time."
"The sight of the Goddess of Liberty standing there in New York harbor night and day, bathing her feet in the rippling sea, is a good thing. It is first-rate. It may also be productive of good in a direction that many have not thought of. As she stands there day after day, bathing her feet in the broad Atlantic, perhaps some moss-grown alien landing on our shore and moving toward the Far West may fix the bright picture in his so-called mind, and, remembering how, on his arrival in New York, he saw Liberty bathing her feet with impunity, he may be led in after-years to try it on himself."
More citizens and less voters will some day be adopted as the motto of the Republic.
"One reference to the late war, and I will close. I want to refer especially to the chronic reconciler who when war was declared was not involved in it, but who now improves every opportunity, especially near election-time, to get out a tired olive-branch and make a tableau of himself. He is worse than the man who cannot forgive or forget."
"The growth of reconciliation between the North and the South is the slow growth of years, and the work of generations. When any man, North or South, in a public place takes occasion to talk in a mellow and mawkish way of the great love he now has for his old enemy, watch him. He is getting ready to ask a favor. There is a beautiful, poetic idea in the reunion of two contending and shattered elements of a great nation."
"There is something beautifully pathetic in the picture of the North and the South clasped in each other's arms and shedding a torrent of hot tears down each other's backs as it is done in a play, but do you believe that the aged mothers on either side have learned to love the foe with much violence yet? Do you believe that the crippled veteran, North or South, now passionately loves the adversary who robbed him of his glorious youth, made him a feeble ruin, and mowed down his comrades with swift death? Do you believe that either warrior is so fickle that he has entirely deserted the cause for which he fought? Even the victor cannot ask that."
"""I don't know, dearie. He used to take to spells like that when he was"
little. But lately he's got over them. I followed him once and I found
him out in the sand dunes lying flat on his face cryin' awful--out loud
and beatin' his arms. I let him be. I stole home and I never let on I
knew. When he came back all white lookin' I had a nice cake ready--roll
"jell, his favorite."""
"""Do--do you think he was out in the sand dunes--last night?"""
"""I don't know. He come in about nine o'clock, awful quiet and I didn't"
"ask him anything, but I just set his breakfast before him as though the"
morning wa'n't half over. And then he went off again and I ain't seen
"him sense. I thought mebbe it was these folks of Mr. Dugald's--"""
"""What do you mean, Aunt Achsa?"" But Sidney knew what she meant."
"""Like as not Lav's plain jealous. Mr. Dugald hasn't had any time for"
anything but toting this Pola round everywhere and Lav notices it. He
hasn't any right to be jealous as I can see for Miss Pola is Mr.
"Dugald's own cousin, but Lav thinks the sun rises and sets in Mr."
"Dugald. And like as not he misses you--"""
"""I've missed Lav dreadfully. I didn't know how much I missed him and"
Mart until today when it came over me suddenly that the things I was
doing with Pola weren't really much fun--just at first they were
"because they were different. I'm afraid, Aunt Achsa, that I love"
different things! But tomorrow I am going to play all day long with Lav
"and Mart, see if I don't. I can't wait for tomorrow to come!"""
"mother used to, and lifted her eyes... Oh, _madam_!"
"When Harry came I had his letters all ready, and the ring and a ducky"
"little brooch he’d given me—a silver bird it was, with a chain in its"
"beak, and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger. Quite the"
thing! I opened the door to him. I never gave him time for a word.
"“There you are,” I said. “Take them all back,” I said, “it’s all over."
"I’m not going to marry you,” I said, “I can’t leave my lady.” White! he"
"turned as white as a woman. I had to slam the door, and there I stood,"
"all of a tremble, till I knew he had gone. When I opened the"
"door—believe me or not, madam—that man _was_ gone! I ran out into the"
"road just as I was, in my apron and my house-shoes, and there I stayed"
in the middle of the road... staring. People must have laughed if they
saw me....
... Goodness gracious!—What’s that? It’s the clock striking! And here
"I’ve been keeping you awake. Oh, madam, you ought to have stopped"
"me.... Can I tuck in your feet? I always tuck in my lady’s feet, every"
"night, just the same. And she says, “Good night, Ellen. Sleep sound and"
"wake early!” I don’t know what I should do if she didn’t say that, now."
"... Oh dear, I sometimes think... whatever should I do if anything were"
"to.... But, there, thinking’s no good to anyone—is it, madam? Thinking"
won’t help. Not that I do it often. And if ever I do I pull myself up
"sharp, “Now, then, Ellen. At it again—you silly girl! If you can’t find"
anything better to do than to start thinking!...”
"The doctor when he came pronounced her dead, thought it was probably"
an effusion of blood on the brain but couldn't be certain till he
had made an autopsy.
"""What _am_ I to do?"" said Vivie thinking aloud...."
"""Why, stay here till all the formalities are over and you can find"
"rooms elsewhere,"" said Mme. Trouessart, the owner-servant of the"
"tea-shop. ""I have another spare room. For the moment my locataires"
"are gone. I know you both very well by sight, you were clients of"
"ours in the happy days before the War. Madame votre mère was, I"
"think, the gérante of the Hotel Édouard-Sept when I first came to"
"manage here. Since then, you have often drunk my tea. Je me nomme"
'Trouessart' c'est le nom de mon mari qui est ... qui est--Vous
"pouvez diviner où il est, où est à present tout Belge loyal qui peut"
"servir. Le nom Walcker? C'était le nom de nom père, et de plus est,"
c'était un nom Anglais transformé un peu en Flamand. Mon
arrière-grand-père etait soldat Anglais. Il se battait à Waterloo.
"For me, I spik no English--or ver' leetle."""
"She went on to explain, whilst the doctors occupied themselves with"
"their gruesome task, and Vivie was being persuaded to take some"
"nourishment, that her great grandfather had been a soldier servant"
who had married a Belgian woman and settled down on the site of this
very shop a hundred years ago. He and his wife had even then
"made a specialty of tea for English tourists. She, his great"
"grand-daughter, had after her marriage to Monsieur Trouessart"
"carried on the business under the old name--Walker, made to look"
Flemish as Walcker.
Vivie when left alone suddenly thought of the money question. She
Mrs. White took the sketch forcibly from Trude. She frowned over it.
One of the girls certainly did look like Sidney as she remembered the
child from their one meeting.
"""How do you explain it, Trude?"""
"Trude sighed heavily. ""I can't explain it. There's something wrong"
"somewhere. And it's my fault, Aunt Edith. I--I consented--we all"
consented to let Sidney go off down there just so that we could go
ahead with our own plans. But we thought--we felt _certain_ that these
cousins were very nice--I--I mean had a lovely home and were rich so
that Sidney might get something out of her visit that she couldn't get
"at home. It sounds shameful to _say_ it."""
"""I understand, my dear. But what made you think so?"""
"""The--the letter this Cousin Achsa wrote. It _was_ a very nice letter!"""
"""Well, _I_ have always thought you could judge anyone's character and"
"background by a letter. There must be something wrong. This girl--"""
"pointing to the sketch, ""is positively shocking! At least she would be"
"around here."""
"""I remember now something Sidney said--when she was begging us to let"
her go away. 'I want to be different! I want to go somewhere where I
won't be Joseph Romley's daughter. I want adventure and to do exciting
"things--' Those were her very words! I didn't take them seriously then,"
"but, oh, Aunt Edith, perhaps she meant them more than we guessed!"" Poor"
"Trude rose quickly to her feet. ""Aunt Edith, I simply _must_ go to"
Provincetown at once. May I ask Pepper to find out about trains?
"You'll--you'll understand, won't you? I can't be happy one minute until"
"I see the child. I feel that it's all my fault."""

"""That's so,"" said the crowd, and the House was rough."
"Meanwhile, the skipper, or ""old man"" (who henceforward, by the way,"
"was called the ""Guffin""), and his two mates were discussing the"
"latest aspect of world politics, as they drank whiskey and water."
"""What's wrong with Salisbury,"" said the Guffin, who was as stout as a"
"barrel and as sturdy, ""is, that he ain't got a backbone.  He just"
lets 'em blow him about like so much paper.  What he wants is
"stiffenin': he's like a sprung spar.  That's what he's like."""
"The mate, a tough-looking dog with hair like anæmic tussac grass in"
"patches on his face, shook his head."
"""I've a greater opinion of him, captain, than you have.  All his"
double shuffle is cunning.  It's getting back so's to lead them
"French on.  Mark me, he'll play them yet a fair knock-out."""
The Guffin sneered.
"""He may have cunnin', Lampert, but he ain't no real tact.  Now,"
"diplomatic tact, I take it, is not givin' way into the gutter, but"

"nicely."""
"I hitched myself up to him and we sat on the bunk, glooming away at"
each other. Then we heard the tramp of feet in the crossway.
Butt swung down and headed for the control compartment in the
nose of the lifeboat. He had his blaster out and was cursing very
"interestingly. I started after him, but he picked me up by the seat"
of my jumper and tossed me toward the door. The Captain came in and
tripped over me.
I got all tangled up in his gold braid and million-mile space buttons.
"When we finally got to our feet and sorted out right, he was breathing"
"very hard. The Captain was a round little man with a plump, golden face"
"and a very scared look on it. He _humphed_ at me, just the way Sis"
"does, and lifted me by the scruff of my neck. The Chief Mate picked me"
up and passed me to the Second Assistant Engineer.
"Sis was there, being held by the purser on one side and the Chief"
"Computer's Mate on the other. Behind them, I could see a flock of"
wide-eyed female passengers.
"""You cowards!"" Sis was raging. ""Letting your Captain face a dangerous"
"outlaw all by himself!"""
"""I dunno, Miss Sparling,"" the Computer's Mate said, scratching the"
"miniature slide-rule insignia on his visor with his free hand. ""The Old"
"Man would've been willing to let it go with a log entry, figuring the"
spaceport paddlefeet could pry out the stowaway when we landed. But you
"had to quote the Mother Anita Law at him, and he's in there doing his"
"duty. He figures the rest of us are family men, too, and there's no"
"Petunikoff and his kind tremble and perspire before me!"""
"""Ah!  You have a courageous tongue!"" jeered Abyedok."
"""Yes ...  You miser!""  And Kuvalda looked at him contemptuously.  ""What"
do you understand?  What do you know?  Are you able to think?  But I
have thought and I have read ... books of which you could not have
"understood one word."""
"""Of course!  One cannot eat soup out of one's hand ... But though you"
"have read and thought, and I have not done that or anything else, we"
"both seem to have got into pretty much the same condition, don't we?"""
"""Go to the Devil!"" shouted Kuvalda.  His conversations with Abyedok"
"always ended thus.  When the teacher was absent his speeches, as a"
"rule, fell on the empty air, and received no attention, and he knew"
"this, but still he could not help speaking.  And now, having quarrelled"
"with his companion, he felt rather deserted; but, still longing for"
"conversation, he turned to Simtsoff with the following question: ""And"
"you, Aleksei Maksimovitch, where will you lay your grey head?"""
"The old man smiled good-humouredly, rubbed his hands, and replied, ""I"
"do not know ...  I will see.  One does not require much, just a little"
"drink."""
"""Plain but honourable fare!"" the Captain said.  Simtsoff was silent,"
"only adding that he would find a place sooner than any of them, because"
"women loved him.  This was true.  The old man had, as a rule, two or"
"three prostitutes, who kept him on their very scant earnings.  They"
"very often beat him, but he took this stoically.  They somehow never"
"beat him too much, probably because they pitied him.  He was a great"
"lover of women, and said they were the cause of all his misfortunes."
"""That's so,"" said the second mate, who had been listening.  ""Now last"
"v'y'ge in the _Battleaxe_, there was a Dago in my watch as come from"
the betwixt and between land where Spain jines France.  And he was
"the Dagoest Dago I ever sailed with.  But I knew the breed, and the"
first time he opens his garlicky mouth I hauled off and hit him.  And
then I took his knife away and snapped the point off.  And I says to
"him, 'Now, you black beggar, every time at muster you'll show me that"
"knife, and there'll be peace in the land.'  And he done so, and there"
"was peace."""
"The captain (or ""Guffin"") smote his thigh."
"""You're right, Simcox, you're right, and if Salisbury was to take a"
"leaf out of your log-book in respects of handlin' Dagoes, 'twould be"
"better for all concerned.  But no, not him.  He goes on seein' them"
French make a fleet and he lets 'em!  He actually sees 'em with their
"fleet sharpenin' on the grindstone and never says from the poop,"
"'Chuck that overboard, you swine, or I'll come and 'andle you so's"
"you'll be glad to die.'"""
"The second mate was much gratified, as was obvious by his standing"
first on one foot and then on another.  But Lampert was not so
pleased.
"""Why, you talk--you, captain and you, Simcox--as if they had a fleet."
"Why, it's my opinion--and experts say 'ditto' to me there--that a"
"string o' band-boxes with crackers in 'em, and all on a mud-flat,"
would do as much harm as the French fleet--unless they blows up when
"we takes 'em."""
The Guffin shook his head.
gallants. But it may not be.  I may not give you such a right. A maiden
is not free to choose her friends; and the knights of chivalry are long
"since vanished from the earth.  I would that I might call you friend,"
that sometimes we might meet and hold converse together. I trust that I
"may learn a good report of you, that one day I may speak with pride of"
having known you in your youth.  But that must suffice us.  Let it be
"enough for both.  I may not—"""
"She hesitated, and her voice died into silence. She spoke with a"
repressed emotion which he scarcely understood.  The tumult of his own
heart was such that he could not seek to gauge the depths of her
feelings.
"""If I may not be your knight, let me at least be your friend—your"
"servant!"" he pleaded.  ""And if there is anything wherein I can serve"
"you—"""
She seemed struck by the phrase.  She lifted her bent head and gazed
earnestly at him; but the words she spoke seemed strange.
"""You are the friend of Lord Sandford; is it not so?"""
"""I have been his comrade these many weeks.  He has shown me much"
"kindness and good-fellowship. I owe him gratitude."""
"""And you must know him well, I doubt not.  Tell me, Sir Grey—and I pray"
you deceive me not—what kind of a man is this same Lord Sandford?  Is he
"leal and true, faithful, loving, and loyal?  Is he better than the crowd"
"who follow at his heels and ape his manners, use his name as a"
"watchword, and fawn upon his favour?  Tell me, what think you of him?  A"
"friend must needs speak sooth."""
"""The Rajah has a charmed life,"" he said somberly. ""He is always in the"
front of his men--we can recognize him by his dress and figure--he is
"always within range, but we can't hit him. Not that I ought to wish"
"his death, though it's our only chance."" He put his hands distractedly"
"to his head. ""Heaven knows, it's too hard for a Christian man! Every"
"time I see an enemy fall, I rejoice--and then I remember that it is my"
"brother--"" He stopped, the expression on his face of profound trouble"
"giving way to active alarm. ""Hush! Some one is coming!"""
"A second time the door opened, and Travers rushed in. Lois saw his"
"face, and something in her recoiled in sick disgust. Fear, an almost"
"imbecilic fear, was written on the wide-open, staring eyes, and the"
hand that held the revolver trembled like that of an old man.
"""Quick--out by the back way!"" he stammered incoherently. ""I will lock"
the door--so. That will keep them off a minute. They are bound to look
for us here first. Nicholson is retiring with his men--they are going
to have a try to bring down the Rajah. It's our one chance. It may
"frighten the devils--they think he's a god. I believe he is, curse"
"him!"" All the time, he had been piling furniture against the door with"
"a mad and feverish energy. ""Help me! Help me!"" he screamed. ""Why don't"
"you help? Do you want to be killed like sheep?"""
Lois drew him back by the arm.
"""You are wasting time,"" she said firmly. ""Come with us! Why, you are"
"hurt!"""
He looked at the thin stream which trickled down the soiled white of
his coat. A silly smile flickered over his big face.
"“One or two other little things,” replied Herold, judiciously. “I 'll"
copy them out and bring them to you. But go on.”
"“Well,” she said, “yesterday afternoon a little bird--I don't know what"
"kind of bird it was--came and sat on the window-sill, and turned his"
"head this way and looked at me, and turned his head that way and looked"
"at me, and I did n't move hand or foot, and I said, 'Cheep, cheep!' And"
he hopped on the bed and stayed there such a long time. And I talked
"to him, and he hopped about and looked at me and seemed to tell me all"
"sorts of wonderful things. But he did n't somehow, although he came from"
"the sky, and was a perfect dear. He must have known all about it, but he"
"did n't know how to tell me. Now, you and John come from the beautiful"
world and tell me wonderful things about it; and I shall never go there
"really, but I can live in it through you.”"
"Constable, the Great Dane, known by this abbreviated title in familiar"
"life, rose, stretched himself, and went and snuggled his head beneath"
"John's arm. John turned, his arm round the hound's neck."
"“But you can live in it through anybody, dear,” said he--“your Uncle"
"Oliver, your Aunt Julia, or anybody who comes to see you.”"
Stellamaris looked at Herold for a characteristically sympathetic
"moment, and then at John. She sighed."
"“I told you it was hard to explain. But don't you see, Belovedest? You"
and Walter are like my gull. Everybody else is like the little bird. You
"know how to tell me and make me live. The others are darlings, but they"
don't seem to know how to do it.”
John scratched his head.
In the white track was a brilliant silver object travelling along at a
"great speed. A number of anti-aircraft guns opened fire simultaneously,"
"and all around the shining fugitive innumerable stars of pale, liquid"
gold flashed out and melted away again.
"""I bet they're puttin' 'is bloody wind up! Rotten bastard, bombin' a lot"
"o' wounded! If I get 'old of a Fritz up the line, I'll murder 'im. Yer"
"won't catch me takin' no more pris'ners, I tell yer."""
A flashing star suddenly seemed to envelop the aeroplane.
"""Got 'im that time--bloody good shot--'e's comin' down, look, look, 'e's"
"comin' down! Look, 'e's all in flames!"""
"But the aeroplane sped on, growing smaller and smaller. Then the white"
"beam swung back and was extinguished, while the guns ceased firing."
"""Fine lot o' gunners we got--couldn't 'it a Zep 'alf a yard orf! They"
"ain't worth the grub they get!"""
We returned to our marquee and sat down on our kits. My friend Private
"Black came in after us, smiling ruefully. I asked him what was the"
matter.
"""I was playing the piano in the Sergeants' Mess when the first one"
dropped. We all jumped up together and rushed out. Then the second one

"and fro, tripping over tent-ropes and dashing up against revetments. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life. I couldn't get my breath,"
there was a kind of weight on my stomach and a tightness round my chest
"and throat, and my knees kept on giving way all the time. The third one"
burst and I fell down and crawled under some ropes and lay flat against
"""It's too bad I've got somebody in the best room,"" said Eilert. ""They're"
"gentlefolk from the city. They came down here through Stordalen, and they"
had to walk because the cars have stopped for the season. They've been in
"my house for quite some days, and I think they'll be staying on a while"
"yet. I think they're out now, but of course it means I can't let you have"
"my best room."""
"I looked up, and saw a face in the window. A shiver ran through me--no, of"
"course not a shiver, far from it, but certainly this was a fresh surprise."
"What a coincidence! As we were about to enter the door, there was the"
"actor, too--standing there looking at me: the actor from the Tore Peak"
"resort. It was his knees, his coat, and his stick. So I was right--I"
"_had_ recognized her face at an upper window. Yes, indeed, the world"
is small.
The actor and I greeted each other and began to talk. How nice to see me
"again! And how was Paul, the good fellow--still soaking himself in liquor,"
he supposed? Funny effect it has sometimes; Paul seemed to think the whole

"wish we were, I must say!--Well, Eilert, are we getting some fresh haddock"
"for supper? Good!--Really, we like it here very much; we've already been"
"here several days; we want to stay and get a good rest."""
"As we stood there, a rather stout girl came down from the loft and"
addressed the actor:
"""The missis wants you to come right upstairs."""
"""Oh? Very well, at once.... Well, see you later. You'll be stopping here,"
"too, I expect?"""
He hurried up the stairs.
"She looked at me keenly, and I fancied her colour rose. But she only"
"answered, 'Yes, Martin. But you see I have not one. I am alone.'"
"'And lonely, my lady?'"
"'Sometimes,' she answered, smiling sadly."
"'But this evening?' I replied, feeling that there was still something"
I did not understand. 'I should not have thought you would be feeling
"that way. I have not been here, but when I came in, my lady----'"
"'Pshaw!' she answered with a laugh of disdain. 'Those boys, Martin?"
"They can laugh, fight, and ride; but for the rest, pouf! They are not"
"company. However, it is bedtime, and you must go. I think you have"
"done me good. Good night. I wish--I wish I could do you good,' she"
"added kindly, almost timidly."
To some extent she had. I went away feeling that mine was not the only
"trouble in the world, nor my loneliness the only loneliness. She was a"
"stranger in a besieged city, a woman among men, exposed, despite her"
"rank, to many of a woman's perils; and doubtless she had felt Fraulein"
Max's defection and the Waldgrave's strange conduct more deeply than
any one watching her daily bearing would have supposed. So much the
"greater reason was there that I should do my duty loyally, and putting"
"her first to whom I owed so much, let no sorrow of my own taint my"
service.
But God knows there is one passion that defies argument. The house
next Herr Krapp's had a fascination for me which I could not resist;
"and though I did not again leave my lady unguarded, but arranged that"
"Steve should stop at home and watch the door, four o'clock the next"

He went back into the drawing-room.  There they were--just passing the
"side of the house. Five minutes, and they would be down at the turning."
"He stood at the window, waiting.  If only that fellow did not come in!"
Through the partition wall he could hear him still tramping up and down
the dining-room.  What a long time a minute was!  Three had gone when he
"heard the dining-room door opened, and Fiorsen crossing the hall to the"
"front door.  What was he after, standing there as if listening?  And"
"suddenly he heard him sigh.  It was just such a sound as many times, in"
"the long-past days, had escaped himself, waiting, listening for"
"footsteps, in parched and sickening anxiety. Did this fellow then really"
"love--almost as he had loved?  And in revolt at spying on him like this,"
he advanced and said:
"""Well, I won't wait any longer."""
Fiorsen started; he had evidently supposed himself alone.  And Winton
thought: 'By Jove! he does look bad!'
"""Good-bye!"" he said; but the words: ""Give my love to Gyp,"" perished on"
their way up to his lips.
"""Good-bye!"" Fiorsen echoed.  And Winton went out under the trellis,"
conscious of that forlorn figure still standing at the half-opened door.
Betty was nowhere in sight; she must have reached the turning.  His
"mission had succeeded, but he felt no elation.  Round the corner, he"
"picked up his convoy, and, with the perambulator hoisted on to the taxi,"
"journeyed on at speed.  He had said he would explain in the cab, but the"
only remark he made was:
"""You'll all go down to Mildenham to-morrow."""
"And Betty, who had feared him ever since their encounter so many years"
"pitiful to hear. And the castle was hung with black, and in the whole"
kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help
"the king's daughter should get her, and half the kingdom besides. Then"
"Tom, Dick and Harry, and the best physicians in the country came along."
But none of them could help the princess.
But one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court. He was not from
"their country, he said, and had made the journey purposely just to try"
"his luck here. But he must see the king's daughter alone, said he, and"
permission was granted him.
"The king's daughter recognized him, and grew red and pale in turn. ""If"
"I help you now, will you marry me?"" asked the youth. Yes, indeed she"
"would. Then he gave her one of the magic apples, and her horns were only"
"half as large as before. ""But I cannot do more until I have my cap,"
"and my table-cloth, and my purse back again,"" said he. So she went and"
"brought him the things. Then he gave her still another magic apple, and"
"now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets. ""But now I cannot go on"
"until you have sworn that you will be true to me,"" said he. And she"
"swore that she would. And after she had eaten the third apple, her"
"forehead was quite smooth again, and she was even more beautiful than"
in days gone by.
Then there was great joy in the castle. They prepared for the wedding
"with baking and brewing, and invited people from East and West to come"
"to it. And they ate and drank, and were merry and of good cheer, and if"
"they have not stopped, they are merry and of good cheer to this very"
day!

"says yer better git busy, and make a sneak for de train.”"
The young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden
"thought. His hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a"
"handful of letters. Selecting one, he handed it to the boy, following"
it with a silver dollar from his vest-pocket.
"“Give that letter to the lady,” he said, “and ask her to read it. Tell"
"her that it should explain the situation. Tell her that, if she had"
"mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal, much heartache"

Dear Dr. Arnold:   I want to thank you for your most kind and opportune
"aid to my daughter last Friday evening, when she was overcome by an"
attack of her old heart-trouble in the conservatory at Mrs. Waldron’s
reception. Had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render
"proper attention, we might have lost her. I would be glad if you would"
call and undertake the treatment of her case.
"world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers,"
together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was
to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn’t have dragged
"Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well,"
we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years
"from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from"
what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years
"each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made,"
whatever they were going to be.”
"“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the policeman. “Rather a long time"
"between meets, though, it seems to me. Haven’t you heard from your"
friend since you left?”
"“Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,” said the other. “But after a"
"year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty"
"big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But"
"I know Jimmy will meet me here if he’s alive, for he always was the"
"truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He’ll never forget. I came a"
"thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it’s worth it if my"
old partner turns up.”
"The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with"
small diamonds.
"“Three minutes to ten,” he announced. “It was exactly ten o’clock when"
we parted here at the restaurant door.”
"“Did pretty well out West, didn’t you?” asked the policeman."
"“You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder,"
"though, good fellow as he was. I’ve had to compete with some of the"

know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing

"know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and"
your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific
"stock, too."""
"I was so excited I just had to yell: ""Gee, Sis, say _yes_!"""

"My sister's voice was steaming with scorn. ""And what makes you think"
"that I'd consider you a desirable husband?"""
"He spread his hands genially. ""Figure if you wanted a poodle, you're"
pretty enough to pick one up on Earth. Figure if you charge off to

land when they're cleared. Not to mention the rich berzeliot beds
offshore. I got no bad habits outside of having my own way. I'm also
"passable good-looking for a slaptoe planter. Besides, if you marry"
me you'll be the first mated on this ship--and that's a splash most
"nesting females like to make."""
There was a longish stretch of quiet. Sis stepped back and measured him
slowly with her eyes; there was a lot to look at. He waited patiently
while she covered the distance from his peculiar green boots to that
head of hair. I was so excited I was gulping instead of breathing.
Imagine having Butt for a brother-in-law and living on a wet-plantation
in Flatfolk country!
But then I remembered Sis's level head and I didn't have much hope any
"wood-louse!  You nose out every evil thing.  Yes, the face of that"
young swindler shows that he has got what he wanted...  I wonder how
much Egorka has got out of them.  He has evidently taken something...
He is just the same sort of rogue that they are ... they are all tarred
"with the same brush.  He has got some money, and I'm damned if I did"
not arrange the whole thing for him!  It is best to own my folly...
"Yes, life is against us all, brothers ... and even when you spit upon"
"those nearest to you, the spittle rebounds and hits your own face."""
"Having satisfied himself with this reflection, the worthy Captain"
"looked round upon his staff.  Every one of them was disappointed,"
because they all knew that something they did not expect had taken
"place between Petunikoff and Vaviloff, and they all felt that they had"
been insulted.  The feeling that one is unable to injure anyone is
"worse than the feeling that one is unable to do good, because to do"
harm is far easier and simpler.
"""Well, why are we loitering here?  We have nothing more to wait for ..."
"except the reward that I shall get out--out of Egorka,..."" said the"
"Captain, looking angrily at the eating-house. ""So our peaceful life"
under the roof of Judas has come to an end. Judas will now turn us
"out....  So do not say that I have not warned you."""
Kanets smiled sadly.
"""What are you laughing at, jailer?"" Kuvalda asked."
"""Where shall I go then?"""
"""That, my soul, is a question that fate will settle for you, so do not"
"worry,"" said the Captain, thoughtfully, entering the dosshouse.  ""The"
"creatures that once were men"" followed him."
"rowing. A little later I got up and looked again--oh, yes, they were"
getting on. I took up my post by the window. It was really quite
interesting to watch the boat getting smaller and smaller; finally I
"opened the window, even looked through my field-glasses. As it was not yet"
"quite light, I could not see them very clearly, but the red hat was still"
discernible. Then the boat disappeared behind an island. I dressed and
"went down. The children were all still in bed, but the wife, Regine, was"
up. How calmly and naturally she took everything!
"""Do you know where your husband is?"" I asked her."
"""Yes--funny, aren't they?"" she replied. ""I never saw them till after"
they'd left--gone down to the fjord. Where do you suppose they're going?
"Haddock fishing?"""
"""Maybe,"" was all I said. But I thought to myself: ""They're leaving, all"
"right. They had their knapsacks on their backs."""
"""Funny couple,"" Regine resumed. ""Nothing to eat, no coffee, not a thing!"
"And the missis not wanting anything to eat last night, neither!"""
I merely shook my head and went out. Regine called to me that coffee was
"nearly ready, so if I'd like a cup--"
Of course the only thing I could do in the face of such foolishness was to
shake my head and go away. One must take the sensible view. How was it
"possible to understand such behavior? Nevertheless I, the undersigned,"
"should have gone on to Olaus yesterday, instead of going fishing. That"
would have been still more sensible. What business had I at this house?
"Very likely she found it embarrassing to be called the ""missis,"" and this"
was why she could neither eat last night nor stay here today. So she had
"beaten a retreat, with her friend and her knapsack."
"""You cannot?  Why?""  I demanded, taken somewhat aback by her sudden"
attitude of determination.
"""I will not allow you to ruin yourself, Gerald, on my account,"" she"
declared in a very low but calm voice.
"""But why should my love for you prove my ruin?""  I cried madly.  ""The"
"truth is that you do not love me.  Why not admit it at once?"""
"""You are in error,"" she hastened to protest.  ""I do love you.  I love"
you to-day with the same fond affection as I entertained for you until
that day--fatal to me--when you turned your back upon me and left me.
"But, alas! we can never now be the same to one another as we were then."""
"She paused for a moment to regain breath; then, pale-faced, with eyes"
"filled with tears, she gripped my arm frantically, crying: ""Gerald, my"
"love, hear me!  These are my last words, but I pronounce them--I make"
confession--so that you may understand the barrier that now lies between
"us."""
"""Well,"" I said, ""speak--tell me!"""
"""Ah!"" she cried hoarsely, covering her face with her hands, ""you wring"
this confession from me.  I am the most unhappy girl in all the world.
"Would that I were dead that it was all ended!  If I did not love you,"
"Gerald, I should deceive you, and leave you to discover the truth after"
our marriage.  But I cannot--I cannot!  Even though we shall part to-day
"for ever, I have resolved to be frank with you because I still have one"
"single spark of honesty left within my heart!"""
"""I don't understand,"" I exclaimed.  ""Tell me."""
"""Then listen,"" she said in a hard, unnatural voice, after a few moments"
"accents, eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen. They writhed in their"
"chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of Tildy, that"
Aileen’s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and
eggs.
And Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could receive
the flattery and the homage. The blunt nose was loyal to the short
Grecian. She was Aileen’s friend; and she was glad to see her rule
hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot-pie and lemon
meringue. But deep below our freckles and hay-coloured hair the
"unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess, not vicarious, but"
coming to us alone.
There was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly
bruised eye; and Tildy’s solicitude was almost enough to heal any
optic.
"“Fresh guy,” explained Aileen, “last night as I was going home at"
"Twenty-third and Sixth. Sashayed up, so he did, and made a break. I"
"turned him down, cold, and he made a sneak; but followed me down to"
"Eighteenth, and tried his hot air again. Gee! but I slapped him a good"
"one, side of the face. Then he give me that eye. Does it look real"
"awful, Til? I should hate that Mr. Nicholson should see it when he"
comes in for his tea and toast at ten.”
Tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration. No man had
ever tried to follow her. She was safe abroad at any hour of the
twenty-four. What bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one
and black one’s eye for love!
"Among the customers at Bogle’s was a young man named Seeders, who"
"worked in a laundry office. Mr. Seeders was thin and had light hair,"
"""The depth ... seventy-three feet."""
"""What?  Have you guessed, you shaved ugly face?"""
"""Of course, Aristid Fomich!  If you have eyes you can see a thing or"
"two,"" shouted Vaviloff, joyfully."
"A few minutes afterwards they sat side by side in Vaviloff's parlour,"
and the Captain was engaged in drinking large quantities of beer.
"""And so all the walls of the factory stand on your ground,"" said he to"
"the eating-house keeper.  ""Now, mind you show no mercy! The teacher"
"will be here presently, and we will get him to draw up a petition to"
the court.  As to the amount of the damages you will name a very
"moderate sum in order not to waste money in deed stamps, but we will"
"ask to have the factory knocked down.  This, you see, donkey, is the"
result of trespassing on other people's property.  It is a splendid
"piece of luck for you. We will force him to have the place smashed, and"
I can tell you it will be an expensive job for him.  Off with you to
the court.  Bring pressure to bear on Judas.  We will calculate how
much it will take to break the factory down to its very foundations.
"We will make an estimate of it all, counting the time it will take too,"
"and we will make honest Judas pay two thousand roubles besides."""
"""He will never give it!"" cried Vaviloff, but his eyes shone with a"
greedy light.
"""You lie!  He will give it ...  Use your brains... What else can he do?"
"But look here, Egorka, mind you don't go in for doing it on the cheap."
They are sure to try to buy you off.  Don't sell yourself cheap.  They
"will probably use threats, but rely upon us..."""
"Yashka was ""touched with paint"" after two glasses of vodki, and was in"
a slightly uplifted condition.
"The people looked at him, expecting him to make a row, and all were"
silent.
"""Did you see me?  And how did it please you?"" asks Yashka."
The people control their laughter.
"""No; it did not please me,"" replies the teacher.  His tone is so"
serious that the people are silent.
"""You see I was just trying it,"" said Yashka, with bravado, fearing that"
"the teacher would rebuke him. ""The wife is satisfied....  She has not"
"got up yet to-day...."""
"The teacher, who was drawing absently with his fingers on the table,"
"said, ""Do you see, Yakov, why this did not please me? ... Let us go"
"into the matter thoroughly, and understand what you are really doing,"
and what the result may be.  Your wife is pregnant.  You struck her
last night on her sides and breast. That means that you beat not only
"her but the child too.  You may have killed him, and your wife might"
have died or else have become seriously ill.  To have the trouble of
"looking after a sick woman is not pleasant.  It is wearing, and would"
"cost you dear, because illness requires medicine, and medicine money."
"If you have not killed the child, you may have crippled him, and he"
"will be born deformed, lop-sided, or hunch-backed.  That means that he"
"will not be able to work, and it is only too important to you that he"
"should be a good workman.  Even if he be born ill, it will be bad"
"enough, because he will keep his mother from work, and will require"
medicine.  Do you see what you are doing to yourself?  Men who live by

"""It's no use, Dawson,"" protested I emphatically. ""You are a wonder at"
"disguise, and will look, I do not doubt, the very spit of a Marine."
But you can't pass among the men for half an hour without discovery.
"They are a class apart, they talk their own language, cherish their"
"own secret traditions, live in a world to which no stranger ever"
penetrates. You could pass as a naval officer more easily than you
"could as a Pongo. It is sheer madness, Dawson."""
"He gave a short laugh. ""Much you know about it. I have served in the"
"Red Corps myself. I was a recruit at Deal, passed two years at"
"Plymouth, and served afloat for three years. I was then drafted into"
the Naval Police. Afterwards I was recommended for detective work in
"the dockyards, and at the end of my Marine service joined the Yard. My"
"good man, I was a sergeant before I left the Corps."""
"""I give up, Dawson,"" said I. ""Nothing about you will ever surprise me"
"again. Not even if you claim to have been a Cabinet Minister."""
"A queer smile stole over his face. ""No, I have not been a minister,"
"but I have attended a meeting of the Cabinet."""
"Cary interposed at this point. ""Yours is a fine idea, Mr. Dawson. As a"
Marine sentry you can get yourself posted by the Major wherever you
"please, and the Guard will not talk even though they may wonder that"
any man should want to do twenty-four hours of duty per day. The
"Marines are the closest, faith-fullest, and best disciplined force in"
the wide world. Bluejackets will gossip; Marines never. You will be
"able to watch more closely than even Trehayne, who, I suppose, will"
"also be on board."""

"fiercely at me. ""I looked it up. Of the Anita Mason Law, Emergency"

"informer, but I made it before I knew it was Butt Lee Brown you were"
talking about. I didn't want to arrest Butt Lee Brown. You forced
"me. So I'm breaking my promise to you, just as, I understand, you"
broke your promise to your brother. They'll both be picked up at New

"""And now you'll have to return with the boy. I'm sorry, Miss Sparling."
"But as you explained to me, a man who has been honored with an"
important official position should stay close to the letter of the law
for the sake of other men who are trying to break down terrestrial
"anti-male prejudice. Of course, there's a way out."""
"""There is? Tell me, please!"""
"""Can I lower my hands a minute?"" I asked."
"""No, you can't, son--not according to the armed surveillance provisions"
"of the Mother Anita Law. Miss Sparling, if you'd marry Brown--now,"
"now, don't look at me like that!--we could let the whole matter drop."
A shipboard wedding and he goes on your passport as a 'dependent male
"member of family,' which means, so far as the law is concerned, that he"
had a regulation passport from the beginning of this voyage. And once
we touch Venusian soil he can contact his bank and pay for passage. On
"the record, no crime was ever committed. He's free, the boy's free, and"

The Captain shrugged and spread his arms wide.
"""Perhaps I should be, but that's what comes of putting men into"
"responsible positions, as you would say. See here, Miss Sparling, _I_"
"didn't want to arrest Brown, and, if it's at all possible, I'd still"
"prefer not to. The crew, officers and men, all go along with me. We"
"may be legal residents of Earth, but our work requires us to be on"
Venus several times a year. We don't want to be disliked by any members
of the highly irritable Brown clan or its collateral branches. Butt

"eyes, is a man of much influence on the Polar Continent. In his own"

"considers Butt a helpless, put-upon youngster--"""
"""Much influence, you say? Mr. Brown has?"" Sis was suddenly thoughtful."
"""_Power_, actually. The kind a strong man usually wields in a newly"
"settled community. Besides, Miss Sparling, you're going to Venus for a"

"too particular in any case. While you're fairly pretty, you won't bring"
any wealth into a marriage and your high degree of opinionation is not
"likely to be well-received on a backward, masculinist world. Then, too,"

He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother
when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a
"growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very"
"off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh"
fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat
and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.
"Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have"
been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way
"to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things"
like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.
"Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering"
and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things
about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....
I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the
native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference
between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the
"slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,"
"Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it"
so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from
the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no

"within easy reach in front of the indexer, but leaving room for the"

larger than the slips themselves.[48] On the inside bottom of each

"Y Z. As soon as a slip is written, throw it into its proper box, and"
continue throughout the work. It is a false economy to search out the
"slips for subsequent entries, unless they can be easily found, as it is"
a simple matter at the end to combine the several slips which belong to
the same heading.
"Here are sample slips, showing a heading which requires full entries"

"Silence, intense, sardonic silence had intervened. The three looked at"
one another and made a sour joke about Mandas. Then the black-cap turned
to me.
"""Can you understand Sardinian?"" he said."
"""Somewhat. More than Sicilian, anyhow."""
"""But Sardinian is more difficult than Sicilian. It is full of words"
"utterly unknown to Italian--"""
"""Yes, but,"" say I, ""it is spoken openly, in plain words, and Sicilian is"
"spoken all stuck together, none of the words there at all."""
He looks at me as if I were an imposter. Yet it is true. I find it quite
"easy to understand Sardinian. As a matter of fact, it is more a question"
of human approach than of sound. Sardinian seems open and manly and
"downright. Sicilian is gluey and evasive, as if the Sicilian didn't want"
"to speak straight to you. As a matter of fact, he doesn't. He is an"
"over-cultured, sensitive, ancient soul, and he has so many sides to his"
mind that he hasn't got any definite one mind at all. He's got a dozen
"minds, and uneasily he's aware of it, and to commit himself to anyone of"
them is merely playing a trick on himself and his interlocutor. The
"Sardinian, on the other hand, still seems to have one downright mind. I"
"bump up against a downright, smack-out belief in Socialism, for"
example. The Sicilian is much too old in our culture to swallow
Socialism whole: much too ancient and rusé not to be sophisticated about
any and every belief. He'll go off like a squib: and then he'll smoulder
acridly and sceptically even against his own fire. One sympathizes with
him in retrospect. But in daily life it is unbearable.

THE HAT OF THE _HULDRES_
"Once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead, and a"
certain cottager was on his way to the wedding-feast. As he chanced to
"cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are usually made of"
"cows' tails, and looking just like an old brown rag. He picked it up,"
"for he thought it could be washed, and then he would give it to his"
wife for a dish-rag. But when he came to the house where they were
"celebrating the wedding, it seemed as though no one saw him. The bride"
"and groom nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them and"
poured for them; but he got neither greeting nor drink. Then the chief
cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table; but he was
"not asked, nor did he get anything to eat. For he did not care to sit"
down of his own accord when no one had asked him. At last he grew angry
"and thought: ""I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit of"
"attention to me here."" When he reached home, he said: ""Good evening,"
"here I am back again."""
"""For heaven's sake, are you back again?"" asked his wife."
"""Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention to me, or even so"
"much as looked at me,"" said the man, ""and when people show me so little"
"consideration, it seems as though I have nothing to look for there."""
"""But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot see you!"" cried his"
wife.
"The man was invisible, for what he had found was a _huldre_ hat."
"""What are you talking about? Can't you see me? Have you lost your wits?"""

"evidently very proud of his young pupil and assistant, paraded his"
"accomplishments before us rather to Trehayne's embarrassment. ""Try him"
"with French and German,"" urged Dawson. ""He can chatter them as well as"
English. But he is as close as wax in all three languages. Some men
"can't keep their tongues still in one."""
"I turned to Trehayne and spoke in French: ""German I can't abide, but"
"French I love. My vocabulary is extensive, but my accent"
abominable--incurably British. You can hear it for yourself how it
"gives me away."""
"""It is not quite of Paris,"" replied Trehayne. ""Mais vous parlez"
"francais tres bien, tres correctement. Beaucoup mieux que moi."""
"""Non, non, monsieur,"" I protested, and then reverted to English."
"""Now,"" said Dawson, when Trehayne had left us, ""I must get along, see"
"the Commander of the _Malplaquet_, and draw a uniform and rifle out of"
the marine stores. It will be quite like old times. You won't see me
"until Saturday, when I shall be either a triumphant or a broken man."
"What is the betting, Mr. Copplestone?"""
"I could not understand the quizzical little smile that Dawson gave me,"
nor the humorous twitch of his lips. He had contemptuously disclaimed
"all use of theories, yet there was more moving behind that big"
forehead of his than he chose to give away. Did his ideas run on
parallel lines with mine; did he even suspect that I had formed any
"idea at all? I could not inquire, for I dislike being laughed at,"
"especially by this man Dawson. I had nothing to go upon, at least so"
little that was palpable that anything which I might say would be
"dismissed as the merest guesswork, for which, as Dawson proclaimed, he"
thirty-one thousand five hundred dollars. But it cost the Romish Church
far more than money--it cost her the loss of all the leading nations
"of the world, which had been under her dominion till that time. For"
"the expense of the vast structure, with its ""insolent opulence of"
"marbles,"" was so great that Julius II. and Leo X. were obliged to meet"
"the enormous outlay by the sale of indulgences, and that, as is well"
"known, precipitated the Reformation. So that Protestants may well feel"
a peculiar interest in this mighty cathedral.
[Sidenote: The Column against which Christ Leaned in the Temple.]
It goes without saying that the popes would not allow the chief church
"of Roman Catholicism to go begging in the matter of relics. And, sure"
"enough, we have no sooner pushed aside the heavy padded screen and"
"stepped within than we find on our right the Chapel of the Holy Column,"
so called because it contains a pillar which is declared to have been
that against which our Lord leaned when he prayed and taught in the
"temple at Jerusalem. The pillar contains this inscription: ""Haec est"
illa columna in qua DNS N{r} Jesus XPS appodiatus dum populo prædicabat
"et Deo pno preces in templo effundebat adhaerendo, stabatque una"

"encrusted with ivory, which we are told was the Cathedra Petri,"
the episcopal throne of St. Peter and his immediate successors.
A magnificent festival in honor of this chair has been annually
"the lawyer had drawn up from his dictation, and the more lengthy"
agreement between Sallie and Jasper Slyne.
"Slyne and Jobling added their names to that, and Slyne attached his"
careful signature to a promise to pay the solicitor the percentage
agreed upon. Captain Dove witnessed it and then called Sallie from her
"seat in the window-alcove, and she came forward with anxious eyes, to"
fulfil the undertaking she had finally had to give Jasper Slyne as the
price of his help in her most unhappy predicament.
She did not know--nor did she greatly care then--what was contained in
the contract he laid before her without a word. She took from him
without demur the pen he held out to her. She had promised to do all he
"told her and give him whatever he asked--except, for the present,"
herself.
"""Sign 'Josceline Justice' at the foot of each page,"" he said gently, and"
she did so without a word. For she would not for all the world contained
have broken any promise she had given. Then Mr. Jobling desired her to
witness the two other men's signatures.
As she handed him back the pen she had a final question to ask him.
"""You said my father and mother are both dead, and my step-brother too."
"Is there no one else--"""
"""No one you need worry about in the least,"" he assured her,"
"misunderstanding. ""There was a beggarly American who lodged a claim to"
"the title and--to the title; his name was Carthew, I think--yes, Justin"
Carthew. But even if I--if he hadn't gone and got lost while looking for
"you, his claim would be quite ineffectual now. You're your father's"
"daughter, Lady Josceline. Justin Carthew was a dozen or more degrees"
"The time was barely 10 o’clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with"
a taste of rain in them had well nigh de-peopled the streets.
"Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and"
"artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown"
"the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and"
"slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The"
vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the
lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the
majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since
been closed.
When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his
"walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an"
unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man
spoke up quickly.
"“It’s all right, officer,” he said, reassuringly. “I’m just waiting for"
a friend. It’s an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little
"funny to you, doesn’t it? Well, I’ll explain if you’d like to make"
certain it’s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a
restaurant where this store stands—‘Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant.”
"“Until five years ago,” said the policeman. “It was torn down then.”"
The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light
"showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white"
"scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly"
set.
"“Twenty years ago to-night,” said the man, “I dined here at ‘Big Joe’"
"Brady’s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the"
"as all besieged cities are, of rumours of spies and treachery, and of"
"reported overtures made now to the city behind the back of the army,"
"and now to the army to betray the city. A single word of denunciation,"
and Tzerclas' life would not be worth three minutes' purchase--a rope
and the nearest butcher's hook would end it. My mind was made up to
say the word.
I suppose I had been going about in this state of vigilance three days
"or more, when something, but not the thing I sought, rewarded it. At"
the time I was on my way back from morning drill. It was a little
"after eight, and the streets and the people wore an air bright, yet"
"haggard. Night, with its perils, was over; day, with its privations,"
"lay before us. My mind was on the common fortunes, but I suppose my"
"eyes were mechanically doing their work, for on a sudden I saw"
"something at a window, took perhaps half a step, and stopped as if I"
had been shot.
"I had seen Marie's face! Nay, I still saw it, while a man might count"
two. Then it was gone. And I stood gasping.
"I suppose I stood so for half a minute, waiting, with the blood racing"
"from my heart to my head, and every pulse in my body beating. But she"
did not reappear. The door of the house did not open. Nothing
happened.
Yet I had certainly seen her; for I remembered particulars--the
"expression of her face, the surprise that had leapt into her eyes as"
"they met mine, the opening of the lips in an exclamation."
And still I stood gazing at the window and nothing happened.
"At last I came to myself, and I scanned the house. It was a large"
knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open
it with. Not even a button you could press.
That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps
back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock
"combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice"
"key--might as well see if that's it, I figured."
"""Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame."""
"For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million"
"possible combinations--The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and"
a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed
around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.
I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and
"sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found"
myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the
cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.
He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that
looked hard and soft at the same time.
"His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his"
back.
"And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the"
"deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards"
in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation--the kind of tan
that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His
"hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long"
combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down
"""Nay,"" he said deliberately, ""I have been both judged and misjudged"
"myself, and it would ill become me in like manner to judge others. But"
"if that man is not of your country and my trade, Ramon Garcia has lived"
"in vain. That is all."""
Concha nodded a little uncertainly.
"""Yes,"" she said slowly, ""yes--of my country. I believe you. He has the"
Andalucian manner of wearing his clothes. If he were a girl he would
know how to tie a ribbon irregularly and how to place a bow-knot a
little to the side in the right place--things which only Andalucians
"know. But what in the world do you mean by 'of your profession'?"""
"El Sarria smoked a while in silence, inhaling the blue cigarette smoke"
"luxuriously, and causing it to issue from his nostrils white and"
moisture-laden with his breath. Then he spoke.
"""I mean of my late profession,"" he explained, smiling on Concha; ""it"
will not do for a man on the high-road to a commission to commit himself
"to the statement that he has practised as a bandit, or stopped a coach"
on the highway in the name of King Carlos Quinto that he might examine
"more at his ease the governmental mail bags. But our Sergeant--well, I"
am man-sworn and without honour if he hath not many a time taken
"blackmail without any such excuse!"""
Concha seemed to be considering deeply. Her pretty mouth was pursed up
"like a ripe strawberry, and her brows were knitted so fiercely that a"
deep line divided the delicately arched eyebrows.
"""And to this I can add somewhat,"" she began presently; ""they say (I know"
not with what truth) that I have some left-handed gipsy blood in me--and
"if that man be not a Gitano--why, then I have never seen one. Besides,"
A. A. Milne
PREFACE
"This book was written in 1915, for the amusement of my wife and myself"
at a time when life was not very amusing; it was published at the end
"of 1917; was reviewed, if at all, as one of a parcel, by some brisk"
"uncle from the Tiny Tots Department; and died quietly, without"
seriously detracting from the interest which was being taken in the
"World War, then in progress."
It may be that the circumstances in which the book was written have
"made me unduly fond of it.  When, as sometimes happens, I am"
introduced to a stranger who starts the conversation on the right
"lines by praising, however insincerely, my books, I always say, ""But"
"you have not read the best one."" Nine times out of ten it is so.  The"
"tenth takes a place in the family calendar; St. Michael or St. Agatha,"
"as the case may be, a red-letter or black-letter saint, according to"
whether the book was bought or borrowed.  But there are few such
"saints, and both my publisher and I have the feeling (so common to"
publishers and authors) that there ought to be more.  So here comes
"the book again, in a new dress, with new decorations, yet much, as far"
"as I am concerned, the same book, making the same appeal to me; but,"
"let us hope, a new appeal, this time, to others."
"For whom, then, is the book intended?  That is the trouble.  Unless I"
"can say, ""For those, young or old, who like the things which I like,"""
"I find it difficult to answer.  Is it a children's book?  Well, what"
do we mean by that?  Is _The Wind in the Willows_ a children's book?
special interest in his spotless Lady Geraldine.
[Illustration: He stood quite still to watch Lord Sandford lead away the
fair Geraldine (page 155).]
"""I trow so,"" was the carelessly-spoken reply of Lord Sandford, as he"
adjusted his wig and suffered his valet to spray some delicate perfume
"over his person, as a finishing touch to his toilet.  ""The Lady"
Geraldine is no longer to lead the life of a nun.  It has been decreed
"that she is to show her lovely face abroad, and add thereby a lustre to"
"her mother’s charms."""
"""A lustre her ladyship would well dispense with,"" laughed another.  ""She"
would sooner pose as the stepmother than the mother of a grown-up
"daughter—ha, ha!  How comes it that this young beauty hath never been"
shown before to the world?  Other damsels make their _début_ at sixteen;
"but the Lady Geraldine can scarce be less than twenty, and has the"
"dignity of matronhood."""
"""A vast deal more dignity than the most part of our matrons do show"
"forth,"" spoke Lord Sandford incisively.  ""Doubtless she learned it from"
"her grandam, her mother’s mother and her father’s aunt; for my Lord and"
"my Lady Romaine are cousins, and Mrs. Adair was trusted and revered by"
"both.  Young children are in the way of such gay ladies of fashion,"
"wherefore the babe was sent to its grandam, and remained with her till"
"the virtuous and discreet old lady died, having bequeathed her store of"
"wisdom and discretion to the beautiful maid she had reared."""
"""And her fortune too,"" sniggered one gay dandy. ""Do not forget that"
"item, my lord.  It is whispered that it will make the biggest of her"
"charms.  What is the figure?  Doth anybody know?"""
gone long barefoot. The marks of a child either stolen for ransom or run
away from home owing to some wild strain in the blood were too obvious
to be mistaken. Her liberty of movement among the gipsies made the
latter supposition the more probable.
"""I am _not_ pretty Chica, and I am not little,"" she cried angrily. ""I"
"would have you remember, Pépe, that _I_ made this plan, which the folk"
of Egypt are to execute to-night. But since this is the great brigand
"Don José of Ronda, who was executed at Salamanca, I will tell him all"
"about it."""
She looked round at the dark faces with which they were surrounded.
"""There are new folk among these,"" she said, ""men I do not know. Bid them"
"go away. Else I will not speak of myself, and I have much to say to Don"
"José!"""
"Pépe of the Eleven Wounds looked about him, and shook his head. Gipsydom"
"is a commonwealth when it comes to a venture like this, and save in the"
"presence of some undoubted leader, all Egypt has an equal right to hear"
and to speak. Pépe's authority was not sufficient for this thing. But
that of the Sergeant was.
"He lifted his Montera cap and said, ""I would converse a while with this"
maid on the affairs of Egypt. 'Tis doubtless no more than you know
"already, and then, having heard her story my advice is at your service."
"But she will not speak with so many ears about. It is a woman's whim,"
"and such the wisest of us must sometimes humour."""
The gipsies smiled at the gay wave of his hand with which Cardono
uttered this truism and quickly betook themselves out of earshot in
"groups of ten and a dozen. Cards were produced, and in a few minutes"
"already hear the clattering of the horses of the general's cavalcade,"
"and he knew that if upon his arrival he had not carried out his orders,"
he might expect a severe reprimand.
But it was not the general's suite that rode so furiously. The sound
"came from a contrary direction. Two horses were being ridden at speed,"
and at sight of the four men set in order against the wall the foremost
rider sank both spurs into her white mare and dashed forward with a wild
cry.
"The officer already had his sword raised in the air, the falling of"
which was to be the signal for the volley of death. But it did not fall.
Something in the aspect of the girl-rider as she swept up parallel with
"the low garden wall, her hair floating disordered about her"
shoulders--her eyes black and shining like stars--the sheaf of papers
"she waved in her hand, all compelled the Carlist to suspend that last"
irrevocable order.
"It was Concha Cabezos who arrived when the eleventh hour was long past,"
and leaped from her reeking horse opposite the place of execution. With
"her, wild-haired as a Mænad, rode La Giralda, cross-saddled like a man."
"""General Cabrera! Where is General Cabrera?"" cried Concha. ""I must see"
"him instantly. These are no traitors. They are true men, and in the"
"service of Don Carlos. Here are their papers!"""
"""Where is Ramon Cabrera? Tell me quickly!"" cried La Giralda. ""I have"
news for him. I was with his mother when she died. They whipped me at
the cross of Tortosa to tell what I knew--stripping me to the waist they
"whipped me, being old and the mother of many. Cabrera will avenge me."
"Let me but see Ramon Cabrera whom of old I suckled at my breasts!"""
"the hospitality of the Nat by hunting near his home, came to severe"
grief.
"But the Nat has gone now, alas! The tree is still there, but the Nat has"
fled away these many years.
"'I suppose he didn't care to stay,' said the headman. 'You see that the"
"English Government officials came and camped here, and didn't fear the"
"Nats. They had fowls killed here for their dinner, and they sang and"
"shouted; and they shot the green pigeons who ate his figs, and the"
little doves that nested in his branches.'
"All these things were an abomination to the Nat, who hated loud, rough"
"talk and abuse, and to whom all life was sacred."
"So the Nat went away. The headman did not know where he was gone, but"
there are plenty of trees.
"'He has gone somewhere to get peace,' the headman said. 'Somewhere in"
"the jungle, where no one ever comes save the herd-boy and the deer, he"
"will be living in a tree, though I do not think he will easily find a"
tree so beautiful as this.'
"The headman seemed very sorry about it, and so did several villagers who"
"were with him; and I suggested that if the Nat-houses were rebuilt, and"
"flowers and water offered, the Nat might know and return. I even offered"
"to contribute myself, that it might be taken as an _amende honorable_ on"
behalf of the English Government. But they did not think this would be
"any use. No Nat would come where there was so much going and coming, so"
"little care for life, such a disregard for pity and for peace. If we"
"were to take away our rest-house, well then, perhaps, after a time,"
"something could be done, but not under present circumstances."
presently be an armistice and Germany would have to make peace with
"perhaps the cession to France of Metz as a _solatium_, while Germany"
"was given a little bit more of Africa, and Austria got nothing...."
Meantime the Villa Beau-séjour seemed after Holloway Prison a
paradise upon earth. Why quarrel with her fate? Why not drop
politics and take up philosophy? She felt herself capable of writing
a Universal History which would be far truer if more cynical than
any previous attempt to show civilized man the route he had followed
and the martyrdom he had undergone.
On the 17th of August she took the tram into Brussels. It seemed
"however as if it would never get there, and when she reached the"
Porte de Namur she was too impatient to wait for the connection. She
"could not find any gendarme, but at a superior-looking flower-shop"
she obtained the address of the British Legation.
She asked at the lodge for Mr. Hawk; but there was only a Belgian
"coachman in charge, and he told her the Minister and his staff had"
followed the Court to Antwerp. Mr. Hawk had only left that morning.
"""What a nuisance,"" said Vivie to herself. ""I might have found out"
from him whether there is any truth in the rumours that are flying
"about Tervueren."""
These rumours were to the effect that the Germans had captured all
"the forts of Liège and their brave defender, General Léman; that"
"they were in Namur and were advancing on Louvain. ""I wonder what we"
"had better do?"" pondered Vivie."
In her bewilderment she took the bold step of calling at the Hotel
"de Ville, gave her name and nationality, and asked the advice of"
the municipal employé who saw her as to what course she and her
"“Ah, yes. That 's why I wrote to you yesterday, dear.”"
"She had written to him, in fact, every month for many years, long,"
foolish letters in which everything was futile save the genuine
"affection underlying them, and more often than not John had taken"
them as read and pitched them into the waste-paper basket. His few
"perfunctory replies, however, had been treasured and neatly docketed and"
"pigeon-holed in the bureau in her bedroom, together with the rest of her"
family archives and other precious documents. Among them was a famous
recipe for taking mulberry stains out of satin. That she prized
inordinately.
"“I should n't like to drift apart from dear Ellen's boy,” she said with"
a smile.
"“And I should n't like to lose touch with you, my dear aunt,” said John,"
with more graciousness. “And that is why I've come to see you to-day.
I've had rather a bad time lately.”
“I know--that awful case in the papers.” She shivered. “Don't let us
talk of it. You must try to forget it. I wrote to you how shocked I was.
"I asked you to come and stay with me, and said I would do what I could"
"to comfort you. I believe in the ties of kinship, my dear, and I did n't"
like to think of you bearing your trouble alone.”
"“That was very kind indeed of you,” said John, who had missed the"
invitation hidden away in the wilderness of the hastily scanned
"sixteen-page letter. He flushed beneath his dark skin, aware of"
"rudeness. After all, when a lady invites you to her house, it is boorish"
to ignore the offered hospitality. It is a slight for which one can
scarcely apologize. But she evidently bore him no malice.
"office itself, with its glass doors, its counter, and its long desk, at"
the farther end of which a bill-clerk was poring over his task.
Iron-barred windows at the front of the room looked out upon the
street; other windows and a door at the right opened upon the driveway
"and railroad track, while at the rear the glass-panelled door through"
"which they had just been peering gave egress only to the dock itself,"
up which the two officers were likely to come at any instant. Even as
"Emerson, with a last desperate glance, summed up the possible places of"
"concealment, Fraser exclaimed, softly:"
"""There they are now!"" and they saw at the foot of the gang-plank two"
men talking with Big George. They saw Balt point the strangers
"carelessly to the office, whence he had seen Boyd disappearing a few"
"moments before, and turn back to his stevedores; then they saw the"
plain-clothes men approaching.
"""Here! Gimme your coat and hat, quick!"" cried Fraser in a low voice,"
"his eyes blazing at a sudden, thought. He stripped his own garments"
"from his back with feverish haste. ""Put mine on. There! I'll stall for"
"you. When they grab me, take it on the run. Understand!"""
"""That won't do. Everybody knows me."" Boyd cast an apprehensive glance"
"at the arched back of the bill-clerk, but Fraser, quick of resource in"
"such a situation, forced him swiftly to make the change, saying:"
"""Nix. It's your only 'out.' Stand here, see!"" He indicated a position"
"beside the rear door. ""I'll step out the other way where they can see"
"me,"" he continued, pointing to the wagon-way at the right. ""Savvy? When"
"they grab me, you beat it, and don't wait for nothing."""
"""But you--"""
"who considers himself duped, in his countenance. It had gone ill with La"
Giralda if she had not been able to prove her case. But she held
"something in her hand, the sight of which brought the butcher of Tortosa"
down from his saddle as quickly as if a Cristino bullet had pierced him
to the heart.
"La Giralda was holding out to him an old string of beads, simply carved"
"out of some brown oriental nut, but so worn away by use that the"
stringing had almost cut through the hard and polished shell.
"""My mother's rosary!"" he cried, and sinking on his knees, he devoutly"
received and kissed it. He abode thus a moment looking up to the
"sky--he, the man who had waded in blood during six years of bitter"
warfare. He kissed the worn beads one by one and wept. They were his
mother's way to heaven. And he did not know a better. In which perchance
he was right.
"""Whence gat you this?"" cried Cabrera, rising sharply as a thought struck"
"him; ""my mother never would have parted with these in her life--you"
"plundered it from her body after her death! Quick, out with your story,"
"or you die!"""
"""Nay, little foster-son,"" said La Giralda, ""I was indeed with your"
"mother at the last--when she was shot by Nogueras, and five minutes"
before she died she gave her rosary into my hands to convey to you.
"'Take this to my son,' she said, 'and bid him never forget his mother,"
nor to say his prayers night and morn. Bid him swear it on these sacred
beads!' So I have brought them to you. She kissed them before she died.
"At the risk of my life have I brought it."""
"""And these,"" said Cabrera--""do you know these dogs, La Giralda?"""
"""Tiger-Lily"" was not altogether gone. She looked back, her face"
wrinkling into one of those strangely unbecoming expressions of grim
playfulness.
"""I've half a mind to make an 'At Home' out of YOU!"" she said, nodding"
"at him energetically. ""Only you're not important enough!"""
Villiers burst out laughing. He was not proof against this touch of
"humor, and on a sudden good-natured impulse, sprang to the door and"
shook hands with her.
"""No, indeed, I am not!"" he said, with a charming smile--""Think of"
"it!--I haven't even invented a new biscuit! Come, let me see you into"
"the hall,--I'm really sorry if I've spoken roughly, but I assure you"
"Alwyn's not at all the sort of man you want for interviewing,--he's far"
too modest and noble-hearted. Believe me!--I'm not romancing a
"bit--I'm in earnest. There ARE some few fine, manly, gifted fellows"
"left in the world, who do their work for the love of the work alone,"
"and not for the sake of notoriety, and he is one of them. Now I'm not"
"certain, if you were quite candid with me, you'd admit that you"
yourself don't think much of the people who actually LIKE to be
"interviewed?"""
"His amiable glance, his kindly manner, took the gaunt female by"
"surprise, and threw her quite off her guard. She laughed,--a natural,"
unforced laugh in which there was not a trace of bitterness. He was
"really a delightful young man, she thought, in spite of his"
"old-fashioned, out-of-the-way notions!"
"""Well, perhaps I don't!"" she replied frankly--""But you see it is not my"
"business to think about them at all. I simply 'interview' them,--and I"
"generally find they are very willing, and often eager, to tell me all"
"months of German occupation, though Vivie, in her solitude at"
"Tervueren, seldom heard them."
After her business at the bank she walked about the town. No one
took any notice of her or annoyed her in any way. The restaurants
"seemed crowded with Belgians as well as Germans, and the Belgians"
did not seem to have lost their appetites. The Palace Hotel had
become a German officers' club. On all the public buildings the
German Imperial flag hung alongside the Belgian. Only a few of the
"trams were running. Yet you could still buy, without much difficulty"
"at the kiosques, Belgian and even French and British newspapers."
From these she gathered that the German forces were in imminent
peril between the Belgian Antwerp army on the north and the British
army advancing from the south; and that in the plains of Alsace the
"French had given the first public exhibition of the new ""Turpin"""
explosive. The results had been _foudroyant_ ... and simple.
Complete regiments of German soldiers had been destroyed in _one
"minute_. It seemed curious, she thought, that with such an arm as"
this the French command did not at once come irresistibly to the
rescue of Brussels....
"However, it was four o'clock, and there was her friend the enemy's"
"automobile drawn up outside the bank, awaiting her. She got in, and"
"the soldier chauffeur whirled her away to the Villa Beau-séjour,"
beyond Tervueren.
On her return she found her mother prostrate with bad news. Their
"nearest neighbour, Farmer Oudekens who had driven them into Brussels"
the preceding day had been executed in his own orchard only an hour
ago. It seemed that the lieutenant in charge of the soldiers
"billeted there had disappeared in the night, leaving his uniform and"
watch and chain behind him. The farmer's story was that in the night
spirit?”
"“If it's as you say, it's uncanny,” said Risca, unconvinced."
Yet when Sir Oliver and Julia both assured him that Stella never doubted
"his luxurious happiness, and that the ordering of the picture was due to"
"no subtle suggestion, he had to believe them."
"“You always make the mistake, John, of thinking Stellamaris mortal,”"
"said Herold, at the supper-table, for, on receipt of the young men's"
"telegram, the Blounts had deferred their dinner to the later hour of"
"supper. “You are utterly wrong,” said he. “How can she be mortal when"
she talks all day to winds and clouds and the sea-children in their cups
"of foam? She's as elemental as Ariel. When she sleeps, she's really away"
on a sea-gull's back to the Isles of Magic. That's why she laughs at the
"dull, clumsy old world from which she is cut off in her mortal guise."
What are railway-trains and omnibuses to her? What would they be to
"you, John, if you could have a sea-gull's back whenever you wanted to go"
"anywhere? And she goes to places worth going to, by George! What could"
she want with Charing Cross or the Boulevard des Italians? Fancy the
nymph Syrinx at a woman writers' dinner!”
"“I don't know what you 're talking about, Walter,” said Lady Blount,"
whose mind was practical.
"“Syrinx,” said Sir Oliver, oracularly (he was a little, shrivelled man,"
to whose weak face a white moustache and an imperial gave a false air
"of distinction)--“Syrinx,” said he, “was a nymph beloved of Pan,--it's a"
"common legend in Greek mythology,--and Pan turned her into a reed.”"
"“And then cut the reed up into Pan-pipes,” cried Herold, eagerly, “and"
made immortal music out of them--just as he makes immortal music out of
"reward in the proverbial ""nice young man."""
"Mr. White agreed with her on every point but this. ""If she deserted"
that household it would fall! She's the only one that isn't like her
"father."""
"""Then she must find someone who'll take the family with her,"" Mrs."
White asserted determinedly. But having no godmother's fairy wand she
"had not been able, during the summer weeks, to bring the prince to"
Edgeacres; her husband's acquaintances were too bald and round to play
the part of princes.
Trude had not minded the dearth of young men. Since her unhappy
experience on a former visit she was glad of that dearth. The serenity
"of the summer, the relaxation and rest from responsibilities had"
"brought a lovely freshness to her face, a brightness to her eyes that"
was not all a reflection of the brightness about her. The sheer luxury
"of loafing, of not having to think out petty problems or worry one"
"single minute was all her old-young heart now asked. Once in awhile, of"
"course, she fretted because Isolde was not enjoying Edgeacres with her,"
or getting to know how really nice Aunt Edith White was. Where Vick and
"Sidney were concerned she had no remorse for Vick was seeing new lands,"
"doubtless conquering them, and Sidney was happy at Cape Cod; but she"
could not help thinking that Issy must be working too hard at the
Deerings--getting up early in the morning and typing all through the
hot day and doubtless fussing over the housework and the small babies
as well.
Trude thought of the mail. Again there had been no letter from either
Issy or Sidney! Sidney really _ought_ to write. Perhaps it _had_ not
been wise to let her go off alone with relatives of whom they knew
nothing!
He saw not the rival queens of beauty in their gorgeous apparel.  He saw
"not the surging crowd that eddied around them, appraising, flattering,"
"admiring, laughing.  He only saw one white figure, standing aloof and"
"for the moment alone, the moonbeams glimmering upon the shining"
"whiteness of her dress, the fair face bent, as though in some sort of"
"sorrow or shame.  He saw it, and he was instantly at her side."
"Whether or not he spoke, he knew not.  He offered his arm, and the next"
"moment he was leading her away from that giddy, mocking crowd; and he"
felt the clinging clasp of her fingers thrilling him to his heart’s
core.  He heard the breath of relief as the chorus of flippant merriment
"died away in the distance. He paused, and a quick exclamation escaped"
his lips.
"""This is no place for you, Lady Geraldine.  Why do they bring you"
"hither?"""
"She answered not, but turned her gaze for a moment towards him, and then"
"dropped her eyes. With an impulse for which he could not account, he"
"covered the fingers which lay upon his arm with his own disengaged hand,"
and passionate words sprang to his lips.
"""Give me only the right, fair lady, and I will save you from them all."
I ask only to live and die as your knight—your champion—without
"wages—without reward!"""
Then he was silent.  His breath came thick and fast.  He felt the quiver
"of the hand he held.  He knew not how long the silence lasted, it was so"
"strangely sweet, so full of mysterious meaning."
"""I thank you, sir.  I trow that you speak truth, and that your words are"
not idle froth—gone in a moment—as the words of so many of yonder
"'This is the place,' Steve muttered. 'It will be dawn in another hour."
"What do you think, Master Martin?'"
"'That we had better get off the road,' I answered. 'Take it they found"
him at midnight; the orderly's patience would scarcely last longer.
"Then, if they started after us a quarter of an hour later, they should"
be here in another twenty minutes.'
"'It is an aguey place,' he said doubtfully."
"'It will suit us better than the camp,' I answered."
"No one else expressed an opinion, and Steve, taking my lady's rein,"
led her horse on until he came to the hollow part of the road. Here
"the moonlight disclosed a kind of water-lane, running away between the"
"osiers, at right angles from the road. Steve turned into it, leading"
"my lady's horse, and in a moment was wading a foot deep in water. The"
"Waldgrave followed, then the women. I came last, with Marie's rein in"
"my hand. We kept down the lane about one hundred and fifty paces, the"
"horses snorting and moving unwillingly, and the water growing ever"
"deeper. Then Steve turned out of it, and began to advance, but more"
"cautiously, parallel with the road."
"We had waded about as far in this direction, sidling between the"
"stumps and stools as well as we could, when he came again to a stand"
"and passed back the word for me. I waded on, and joined him. The"
"osiers, which were interspersed here and there with great willows,"
rose above our heads and shut out the moonlight. The water gurgled
"black about our knees. Each step might lead us into a hole, or we"
might trip over the roots of the osiers. It was impossible to see a
"foot before us, or anything above us save the still, black rods and"
"again, would explain nothing, and name no quarter from which help"
"might come. All the afternoon the camp lay grilling in the sunshine,"
and in the shuttered room in the middle of it my lady suffered. Had
the house lain by the river she might have tried to escape; but the
"camp girdled it on three sides, and on the fourth, where a swampy"
"inlet guarded one flank of the village, a deep ditch as well as the"
morass forbade all passage.
She remained in her room until she heard the unwelcome sounds which
"told of the general's return. Then she came into the outer room, her"
"eyes glittering, a red spot on either cheek, all pretence at an end."
"Her glance withered Fraulein Max, who sat blinking in a corner with a"
"very evil conscience. And to Marie Wort, when the girl came near her"
"on the pretence of adjusting her lace sleeves, she had only one word"
to say.
"'You slut!' she hissed, her breath hot on the girl's cheek. 'If you"
fail me I will kill you. Begone out of my sight!'
"The child, excited before, broke down at that, and, bursting into a"
"fit of weeping, ran out. Her sobs were still in the air when General"
Tzerclas entered.
"The Countess's face was flushed, and her bearing, full of passion and"
"defiance, must have warned him what to expect, if he felt any doubt"
"before. The sun was just setting, the room growing dusk. He stood"
"awhile, after saluting her, in doubt how he should come to the point,"
or in admiration; for her scorn and anger only increased her beauty
"and his feeling for her. At length he pointed lightly to the women,"
who kept their places by the door.
"'Is it your wish, fair cousin,' he said slowly, 'that I should speak"
"Slyne was not beyond feeling somewhat ashamed of himself, but found easy"
solace in the reflection that all he had said was for her good as well
as his own. He could see that his last brutal argument had struck home.
"For Sallie could no longer doubt, now, in the lurid light of her recent"
"experiences, that Captain Dove looked upon her as a mere chattel, to be"
turned into cash as soon as occasion should offer.
"In a little she looked up at him again out of pleading, desperate eyes."
Some most unusual impulse of pity stirred him. She was only a young girl
"yet, and her helplessness spoke its own appeal, even to him. He made up"
"his mind again, quite apart from any question of policy, to deal with"
her as generously as might be practicable.
"""Will Captain Dove let me go now if I promise to marry you, Jasper?"" she"
asked. And he nodded solemnly.
"""And not unless I do?"" she insisted. ""You _know_ I didn't--before,"
"although you say I did."""
"""I swear to God, Sallie,"" he declared, ""that I can't raise the money the"
Old Man wants any other way. And--I won't say another word about what's
past and done with.
"""If you'll really promise to marry me,"" he said eagerly, ""I'll prove to"
you that all I have told you is true before you need even leave Captain
Dove; I won't ask you to go a step farther with me until you're
perfectly satisfied; I'll take you safely to your own home as soon as
you _are_ satisfied that you can trust me. And I won't ask you to keep
"your promise till--"""
An irrepressible light of longing had leaped up behind the despair in
her eyes.
with just the right inflection of sarcasm to sting. It had suddenly
occurred to him that the fellow’s object was to make him lose his
"temper, and thus precipitate a clash, during which almost anything might"
"be accomplished. Not only did he refuse to let go his grip, but he did"
"his very best to goad Joyce himself into flaming out, and possibly"
betraying a few secrets.
"“That’s hardly the question, though,” he went on swiftly. “Strikes me"
you’ve been rather premature in running out the boom. Your mill isn’t
"operating, and I have yet to see a single log coming downstream except"
our own.”
"“Never you mind that,” retorted Joyce hotly. “Do you think a man’s going"
to wait till his timber comes in sight afore makin’ arrangements to take
care of it? You can’t come over me with no soft talk like that. The
"boom’s there, an’ there it stays. Half the river’s clear for you to use,"
an’ that’s all you gets.”
"“Hum! That’s your last word, is it?” inquired Bainbridge quietly. “You"
even refuse to let us swing the boom around so we can break our jam?”
“I do!” replied the red-haired individual emphatically. “The first man
"that tries to monkey with my property will wish he hadn’t, that’s all I"
got to say.”
"He raised his automatic significantly, but Bob was not even looking at"
"him. The young man’s gaze had swept out to the face of the jam, and in"
an incredibly short space an accurate picture of its appearance had been
photographed on his brain. Still without giving Joyce the satisfaction
"of a glance, he turned away, motioning Peters to accompany him."
"“A put-up job, of course,” he said tersely, when they were through the"
"""I do not think that he regards them at all! He has scarcely looked at"
"one of them ever since I first knew him."""
"Sergeant Cardono groaned, seemingly greatly perturbed in spirit."
"""I feared as much,"" he said, shaking his head; ""he hath not the right"
"wandering eye. Now, that young Frenchman is a devil untamed! And the"
"Englishman--well, though he is deeper, he also hath it in him. But the"
colonel is all for fighting and his duty. It is easy to see that he will
rise but little higher. When was there ever a great soldier without a
"weakness for a pretty woman and a good dinner? Why, the thing is"
"against nature. Now, my father fought in the War of the Independence,"
and the tales that he told of El Gran' Lor'--he was a soldier if you
"like, worthy of the white plumes! A cook all to himself closer at his"
"elbow than an aide-de-camp--and as to the women--ah----!"""
Sergeant Cardono nodded as one who could tell tales and he would. Yet
the Sergeant Cardono found some reason to change his mind as to Rollo's
qualifications for field-officership before the end of their first day
apart from Cabrera.
It was indeed with a feeling of intense relief that the little company
of five men separated from the white and red _boinas_ of the
butcher-general's cavalcade. Well-affected to them as Cabrera might be
"for the time being, his favour was so brief and uncertain, his affection"
"so tiger-like, that even Sergeant Cardono sighed a sigh of satisfaction"
when they turned their horses' heads towards the far-away Guadarrama
beyond which lay the goal of their adventuring.
Presently the tongues of the little cavalcade were unloosed. El Sarria
"and Sergeant Cardono having found subjects of common interest, communed"
"ravine. It was decided, too, that there was not a moment to be lost in"
"putting their plan into execution. In consequence, Castro immediately"
took his departure.
The hour that passed before the time set for Johnson to leave the cabin
"was a most trying one for both of them. It was not so hard on the man,"
"of course, for he was excited over the prospect of escaping; but the"
"Girl, whose mind was filled with the dread of what might happen to him,"
"had nothing to sustain her. Despite his objection, she had stipulated"
"that, with Jackrabbit as a companion, she should accompany him to the"
"outskirts of the camp. And so, at the moment of departure, throwing"
"about her a cloak of some rough material, she went up to her lover and"
said with a quiver in her voice:
"""I'm ready, Dick, but I'm a-figurin' that I can't let you go alone--you"
"jest got to take me below with you, an' that's all there is to it."""
The man shook his head.
"""There's very little risk, believe me. I'll join Castro and ride all"
through the night. I'll be down below in no time at all. But we must be
"going, dear."""
The man passed through the door first. But when it came the Girl's turn
"she hesitated, for she had seen a dark shadow flit by the window. It was"
"as if someone had been stealthily watching there. In another moment,"
"however, it turned out to be Jackrabbit and, greatly relieved, the Girl"
whispered to Johnson that he was to descend the trail between the Indian
"and herself, and that on no account was he to utter a word until she"
gave him permission.
"For another moment or so they stood in silence; Johnson, appreciating"
"walls, considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and"
"knees, rummaging mantel and tables, the curtains and hangings, the"
"drunken cabinet in the corner, for a visible sign, unable to perceive"
"that she was there beside, around, against, within, above him, clinging"
"to him, wooing him, calling him so poignantly through the finer senses"
that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call. Once again he
"answered loudly: “Yes, dear!” and turned, wild-eyed, to gaze on"
"vacancy, for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and"
"outstretched arms in the odour of mignonette. Oh, God! whence that"
"odour, and since when have odours had a voice to call? Thus he groped."
"He burrowed in crevices and corners, and found corks and cigarettes."
These he passed in passive contempt. But once he found in a fold of the
"matting a half-smoked cigar, and this he ground beneath his heel with a"
green and trenchant oath. He sifted the room from end to end. He found
dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant; but of
"her whom he sought, and who may have lodged there, and whose spirit"
"seemed to hover there, he found no trace."
And then he thought of the housekeeper.
He ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a
crack of light. She came out to his knock. He smothered his excitement
as best he could.
"“Will you tell me, madam,” he besought her, “who occupied the room I"
have before I came?”
"“Yes, sir. I can tell you again. ’Twas Sprowls and Mooney, as I said."
"Miss B’retta Sprowls it was in the theatres, but Missis Mooney she was."
My house is well known for respectability. The marriage certificate
"hung, framed, on a nail over—”"
"“Well,” Ned suggested, “we’d better wait here a little while, until"
"things get quieted down, and then make a break for the passage.”"
"“All right,” Jimmie said with an air of resignation, “I’ll crawl back"
here in the corner and try to imagine that I’m in charge of a pie wagon
on Third avenue. Perhaps I can dream a pie or two!”
The boy leaned back in an angle of the chamber and prepared to continue
the discussion regarding the different kinds of pies sold at the old
"Williams street corner. As he did so, the support of his back gave way,"
"his heels flew up in the air, and he tumbled all of a heap into a"
passage which seemed to begin at that corner of the room.
Hearing the fall and the exclamation of impatience which came from the
"boy’s lips, Ned turned on the electric and saw Jimmie lying on his back"
in a tunnel probably a yard in size each way. There were plenty of
indications that the tunnel had been cut through solid rock.
"As far as Ned could see; that is, as far as the eye of the electric"
carried; there were no breaks in it. Directly a chill breeze blew in
"from the opening, and the boy knew that the passage touched the surface"
of the mountain not far away.
"“Je-rusalem!” shouted Jimmie, “hold up the light and let me see if I’m"
all here. That’s the second tumble I’ve got in this consarned old hole
today.”
"“If every tumble you get in life brings such results as this,” Ned"
"declared, “you ought to go around the world looking for tumbles!”"
"“They hurt, just the same!” Jimmie declared, rubbing the back of his"
head. “I got an awful bump on my coco!”
"""And lots and lots of love, father,"" interrupted Betty."

"Well, our journey was soon arranged on a grand scale. Pickering lent us"
"his new coach, just home from the makers in Cow Street. It was cushioned"
and curtained and had springs in place of thorough-braces. It also had
glass in the windows and doors; a luxury then little known in England
even among the nobles. There was a prejudice against its use in coach
windows because of the fact that two or three old ladies had cut their
faces in trying to thrust their heads through it.
"The new coach was a wonderful vehicle, and Frances and I, as well as"
"Betty, were very proud of our grandeur. Pickering sent along with the"
"coach and horses two lusty fellows as drivers, and gave us a hamper"
almost large enough to feed a company of soldiers. I was to pay all
expenses on the road.
"Almost at the last hour Sir Richard concluded not to go, but insisted"
"that Frances, Bettina, and I take the journey by ourselves. As Pickering"
"offered no objection, Frances shrugged her shoulders in assent, I"
"shrugged mine, and Betty laughed, whereby we all, in our own way, agreed"
"to the new arrangement, and preparations went forward rapidly."
"By the time we were ready to start, the king, the duke, the duchess, and"
"many ladies and gentlemen of the court circle had gone to Bath, thus"
giving us an opportunity to make our journey without the knowledge of any
one in Whitehall; a consideration of vast importance to us under the
circumstances. Some of our grand friends at court might have laughed at

"coach, but Frances and I laughed because we were happy."
description. The name awoke in me a recollection of a painful incident
"within my experience. I saw before me the puffed, degraded face of one"
to whom I had given chance after chance of redeeming himself from
"thraldom to the whisky bottle, one who had promised again and again to"
"amend his ways. At last, wearied, I had cast him out. He had been"
"looking after an important shipbuilding district, had conspicuous"
"ability and knowledge, the support of a faithful wife. But nothing"
"availed to save him from himself. ""Give me five minutes alone with"
"your prisoner,"" I said to Dawson, ""and I will give you the spy you"
"seek."""
"I had asked for five minutes, but two were sufficient for my purpose."
"The draughtsman had been obstinate with Dawson, seeking loyally to"
"shield his wretched brother-in-law, but when he found that I had the"
"missing thread in my hands, he gave in at once. ""What relation is ----"
"to your wife?"" I asked. He had risen at my entrance, but the question"
"went through him like a bullet; his pale face flushed, he staggered"
"pitifully, and, sitting down, buried his face in his hands. ""You may"
"tell the truth now,"" I said gently. ""We can easily find out what we"
"must know, but the information will come better from you."""
"""He is my wife's brother,"" murmured the man."
"""You knew that he was no longer in my service?"""
"""Yes, I knew."""
"I might fairly have asked why he had used my name, but refrained. One"
"can readily pardon the lapses of an honest man, terrified at finding"
"himself in the coils of the police, clinging to the good name of his"
"wife and her family, clutching at any device to throw the"
sleuth-hounds of the law off the real scent. He had given his
the right to make his own terms at private houses upon the two remaining
nights of the working week. The costumes were to be provided by the
"managers, but were to be the property of the actors, who would undertake"
to replace them should any harm befall them at private representations.
"When these matters had been satisfactorily settled, and certain other"
"details arranged, the great men took their leave in high good humour;"
"and the Old Lion, shaking back his mane of shaggy hair, grasped Grey by"
"the hands, his eyes sparkling in his head."
"""Your fortune is made, young man! your fortune is made!  You will never"
need to fear poverty again. What life so grand as that of the man who
"can sway the multitude, make men laugh or weep at his bidding, hold them"
"suspended breathless upon his lips, move them to mirth, or rouse them to"
"the highest realm of passion?  Ah, that is life! that is life! Have I"
"not tasted it?  Do I not know?  And that life lies before you, my son."

[Sidenote: Pisa's Four Monuments.]
The four chief objects of interest at Pisa are all in a group at the
"northern end of the town, and a wonderfully effective group it is: the"
"cloistered cemetery, or Camp Santo, with its fifty-five shiploads of"
"earth from the Holy Land; the Baptistery, with its remarkable echo;"
"the Cathedral, with the pendent lamp in the nave which suggested to"
"Galileo the idea of the pendulum; and that wonder of the world, the"

came to be known as the “Old Version.”
"d. _The Bay Psalm Book_, Boston, 1640. This was the first book printed"
in English-speaking America. It was made to obtain greater literalness
to the Hebrew original than was found in the versions then in use. The
book reigned supreme among the English churches in New England for over
"a century. Seventy editions of it were printed in America, the last in"
"1773. Eighteen editions appeared in England, and twenty-two in Scotland."
"There were no tunes given it until 1698, then only 13, with the air in"
the bass.
"e. _The Scottish Psalter_, completed 1650. Special mention is made of"
this version of the Psalms because it is the source of nearly all the
selections of metrical psalms which constitute Book Five of the
_Hymnary_. The number of versions and editions of psalms which appeared
"on the Continent and in England were numerous and confusing, each"
"claiming its own special merits. Finally, in the interests of better"
literary diction and greater unity in singing in the Scottish
"Presbyterian churches, the General Assembly authorized a new version."
"The result, after many years’ work, was the famous _Scottish Psalter_ of"
1650 which remains the standard work in Scotland today.
There is a certain “dignified crudeness” in some of the literary
expressions but the psalms have long been learned in this version and
have become an important part of the religious training and experience
"of millions of English speaking people, especially in Scotland."
The Scottish Psalter first appeared with words only. There were no notes
and no suggestions for melodies. The succeeding one hundred years were a
"time of confusion. The tunes used were few in number, such as the"
"leaders had learned from various sources, and passed on to succeeding"
generations by rote. The time came when better singing and better tunes

Mrs. Warren at least died with the reputation of one who promptly
"paid her bills; and the whole _assistance_, as it walked slowly back"
"to Brussels, recalled many a deed of kindness and jovial charity on"
the part of the dead Englishwoman.

"Vivie, on sizing up her affairs, got Monsieur Walcker, the Baptist"
"pasteur, to convey a letter to the American Consulate General."
"Walcker was used to such missions as these, of which the German"
"Government was more or less cognizant. The Germans, among their many"
"contradictory features, had a great respect for religion, a great"
tolerance as to its forms. They not only appreciated the difference
"between Jews and Christians, Catholics and Lutherans, but between"
the Church of England and the various Free Churches of Britain and
America. The many people whom they sentenced to death must all have
their appropriate religious consolation before facing the firing
"party. Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists were all provided for;"
there was a Church of England chaplain for the avowed Anglicans; but
what was to be done for the Free Churches and Nonconformist sects of
the Anglo-Saxons? They were not represented by any captive pastor;
"so in default this much respected Monsieur Walcker, the Belgian"
"Baptist, was called in to minister to the Nonconformist mind in its"
last agony. He therefore held a quasi-official position and was
often entrusted with missions which would have been dealt with
punitorily on the part of any one else. Consequently he was able to
deliver Vivie's communication to the American Consul-General with
some probability of its being sent on. It contained no further
appeal to American intervention than this: that the Consul-General
would try to convey to England the news of her mother's death to
"Dharma turned, in the thoughts of the Burmese Buddhists, for no one can"
"believe the incomprehensible. A man has a soul, and it passes from life"
"to life, as a traveller from inn to inn, till at length it is ended in"

heaven in reality.
"Many children, the Burmese will tell you, remember their former lives."
"As they grow older the memories die away and they forget, but to the"
young children they are very clear. I have seen many such.
About fifty years ago in a village named Okshitgon were born two
"children, a boy and a girl. They were born on the same day in"
"neighbouring houses, and they grew up together, and played together, and"
"loved each other. And in due course they married and started a family,"
"and maintained themselves by cultivating their dry, barren fields about"
"the village. They were always known as devoted to each other, and they"
died as they had lived--together. The same death took them on the same
day; so they were buried without the village and were forgotten; for the
times were serious.
"It was the year after the English army had taken Mandalay, and all Burma"
"was in a fury of insurrection. The country was full of armed men, the"
"roads were unsafe, and the nights were lighted with the flames of"
"burning villages. It was a bad time for peace-loving men, and many such,"
"fleeing from their villages, took refuge in larger places nearer the"
centres of administration.
Okshitgon was in the midst of one of the worst of all the distressed
"districts, and many of its people fled, and one of them, a man named"
"Maung Kan, with his young wife went to the village of Kabyu and lived"
there.
A suite of rooms received them in the quiet West End hotel where the
"Canon always stayed. They dined alone, the discreet butler waiting on"
"them, for the Canon was an honoured guest. When the cloth was removed,"
the Canon said in his even voice:--
"“Are you sufficiently recovered, Yvonne, to discuss this painful"
subject?”
"“I am quite ready, Everard.”"
“We will make it as short as possible. What I said last night must
"remain, whatever be the suffering. I have loved you deeply--like a young"
"man--in a way perhaps ill befitting my years. The memories, for they are"
"innocent, will always be there, Yvonne. If I did not seek strength from"
"Elsewhere, it might wreck my life to part from you.”"
A young teacher was telling her pupils the story of the emotional lady
"who, to put her lover to the test, bade him pick up the glove which"
she had thrown down into the arena between the tiger and the lion. The
"lover does her bidding, in order to vindicate his character as a brave"
"knight. One boy, after hearing the story, at once states his contempt"
"for the knight's acquiescence, which he declares to be unworthy."
"“But,” says the teacher, “you see he really did it to show the lady how"
foolish she was.” The answer of the boy sums up what I have been trying
"to show: “There was no sense in _his_ being sillier than _she_ was, to"
show her _she_ was silly.”
"If the boy had stopped there, we might have concluded that he was"
"lacking in imagination or romance, but his next remark proves what a"

It was not much after seven when we came to Mandas. Mandas is a junction
where these little trains sit and have a long happy chat after their
arduous scramble over the downs. It had taken us somewhere about five
hours to do our fifty miles. No wonder then that when the junction at
last heaves in sight everybody bursts out of the train like seeds from
"an exploding pod, and rushes somewhere for something. To the station"
"restaurant, of course. Hence there is a little station restaurant that"
"does a brisk trade, and where one can have a bed."
A quite pleasant woman behind the little bar: a brown woman with brown
"parted hair and brownish eyes and brownish, tanned complexion and tight"
"brown velveteen bodice. She led us up a narrow winding stone stair, as"
"up a fortress, leading on with her candle, and ushered us into the"
"bedroom. It smelled horrid and sourish, as shutup bedrooms do. We threw"
open the window. There were big frosty stars snapping ferociously in
heaven.
"The room contained a huge bed, big enough for eight people, and quite"
clean. And the table on which stood the candle actually had a cloth. But
"imagine that cloth! I think it had been originally white: now, however,"
it was such a web of time-eaten holes and mournful black inkstains and
poor dead wine stains that it was like some 2000 B.C. mummy-cloth. I
wonder if it could have been lifted from that table: or if it was
mummified on to it! I for one made no attempt to try. But that
"table-cover impressed me, as showing degrees I had not imagined.--A"
table-cloth.

"The Girl clenched her hands, heedless of the nails cutting into her"
"palms: ""Won't you wait a moment,--please, wait, Jack!"""
"""Wait? What for?"" the Sheriff flung at her brutally, his finger"
twitching on the trigger.
"The Girl's lips parted to answer, then closed again dumbly,--for it was"
"then that she saw the boots, then the legs of the road agent slide"
"uncertainly through the open trap, fumble clumsily for the rungs of the"
"ladder, then slip and stumble as the weight of the following body came"
upon them while the weak fingers strained desperately for a hold. The
whole heart and soul and mind of the Girl seemed to be reaching out
"impotently to give her lover strength, to hurry him down fast enough to"
forestall a shot from the Sheriff. It seemed hours until the road agent
"reached the bottom of the ladder, then lurched with unseeing eyes to a"
"chair and, finally, fell forward limply, with his arms and head resting"
"on the table. Still dumb with dread, the Girl watched Rance slowly"
circle round the wounded man; it was not until the Sheriff returned his
pistol to its holster that she breathed freely again.
"""So, you dropped into The Polka to-night to play a little game of poker?"
"Funny how things change about in an hour or two!"" Rance chuckled"
mirthlessly; it seemed to suit his sardonic humour to taunt his helpless
"rival. ""You think you can play poker,--that's your conviction, is it?"
"Well, you can play freeze-out as to your chances, Mr. Johnson of"
"Sacramento. Come, speak up,--it's shooting or the tree,--which shall it"
"be?"""
"Goaded beyond endurance by Rance's taunting of the unconscious man, the"
"Girl, fumbling in her bosom for her pistol, turned upon him in a sudden,"
"He gave way to much emotion. Vivie, though still dazed with the"
"reverberating horror of Edith Cavell's execution, tried to regain"
her mind balance and thank him for the kindness he had shown them.
But it was now necessary to see her mother who might also be
undergoing a shock. As she walked up to their bedroom she reflected
that the departure of von Giesselin would have to be followed by
their own exile to some other lodging. They would share in his
disgrace.
The next morning in fact the Belgian manager of the hotel with many
regrets gave them a month's warning. The hotel would be required for
some undefined need of the German Government and he had been told no
one could be lodged there who was not furnished with a permit from
the Kommandantur.
For three weeks Vivie sought in vain for rooms. Every suitable place
was either full or else for reasons not given they were refused. She
"was reduced to eating humble pie, to writing once more to Gräfin von"
Stachelberg and imparting the dilemma in which they were placed. Did
this kind lady know where a lodging could be obtained? She herself
"could put up with any discomfort, but her mother was ill. If she"
"could help them, Vivie would humbly beg her pardon for her angry"
letter of three weeks ago and resume her hospital work. Minna von
Stachelberg made haste to reply that there were some things better
not discussed in writing: if Vivie could come and see her at six one
"evening, when she had a slight remission from work--"
"Vivie went. Out of hearing, Gräfin von Stachelberg--who, however, to"
"facilitate intercourse, begged Vivie to call her ""Minna,""--""We may"
"all be dead, my dear, before long of blood-poisoning, bombs from"
has left me or been dismissed--probably dismissed. When a British
"subject, of decent education and once respectable surroundings, gets"
"into the hands of German agents, you may be certain of one thing,"
"Dawson, that he has become a rotter through drink."""
"""That's it,"" cried Dawson. ""You have hit it. Crime and drink are twin"
brothers as no one knows better than the police. Look out for the name
and address of a man dismissed for drunkenness and we shall have our
"bird."""
"""The name I can no doubt give you, but not the address."""
"""Give us any address where he lived, even if it were ten years ago,"
and we will track him down in three days. That is just routine police
"work."""
"""I never presume to teach an expert his business--and you, Dawson, are"
"a super-expert, a director-general of those of common qualities--but"
"would it not be well to warn all the Post Offices, so that when"
another parcel is brought in addressed to the lieutenant the bearer
"may be arrested?"""
"Dawson sniffed. ""Police work; common police work. It was done at once"
for this city and fifty miles round. No parcel was put in last week.
The warning has since been extended to the whole of the United
"Kingdom. We may get our man this week, or at least a messenger of his,"
"but no news has yet come to me. I will lunch with you, as you so"
"kindly suggest, and afterwards I want you to come with me to see the"
draughtsman in the lockup. You may be able to shake his confounded
obstinacy. Run the pathetic stunt. Say if he keeps silent that you
"will be arrested, your home broken up, your family driven into the"
"workhouse, and you yourself probably shot. Pitch it strong and rich."

"The Abbé spoke poor English, therefore the conversation was carried on in"
"French, much to the annoyance of some of our guests, who pretended to a"
greater knowledge of that language than they possessed.
"Soon after my presentation to the Abbé, the king arrived, and we all went"
"out to the supper table, where the Abbé's chair was on the king's right,"
with De Grammont on his Majesty's left. After the king had been seated a
"moment, he rose and asked us to be seated; so we took our places, all"
save the king dropping our hats beside us on the floor because of his
Majesty's presence.
"I sat next to De Grammont, almost opposite the Abbé, and had a good"
opportunity to observe the French emissary. The king's French was
"excellent, and the dinner conversation was carried on largely between him"
"and the Abbé. All subjects were discussed, but the Abbé adroitly avoided"
Dunkirk and seemed to prefer talking on religious and philosophical
"topics, in which he took the liberty to disagree with the king in many"
"respects, politely though positively."
"I listened attentively, hoping that some tone of the Abbé's voice, a pose"
"or a gesture, might reveal George Hamilton, if it were he, in the most"
"excellent disguise I had ever seen. But nothing of the sort occurred, and"
"before the dinner was over, I was still more convinced that whoever the"
"Abbé du Boise might be, he was not Hamilton."
"After dinner came the heavy wines, of which the Abbé did not partake, and"
"of which De Grammont and I drank sparingly. All the others, including the"
"king, were gloriously drunk long before the night was over."

David is really the center of this territory. It is a typical Central
"American town of about 15,000 people, with a plaza, a cathedral, a hotel"
and all the appurtenances of metropolitan life in Panama. The place is
"attractive in its way, with its streets of white-walled, red-tiled"
"dwellings, with blue or green doors and shutters. It seems to have grown"
"with some steadiness, for though the Panama census for 1912 gave it"
"15,000 inhabitants, travelers like Mr. Forbes Lindsay and Albert"
"Edwards, who visited it only a year or two earlier, gave it only from"
"5000 to 8000 people. Its growth, however, is natural and healthy, for"
the country round it is developing rapidly. You reach David now by boats
of the Pacific Mail and the National Navigation Company from Panama. The
"quickest trip takes thirty hours. When the government railroad is built,"
"about which there is some slight doubt, the whole country will be opened"
and should be quickly settled. The road in all probability will be
continued to Bocas del Toro on the Atlantic coast.

"While the cattle business of the Chiriqui region is its chief mainstay,"
it is far from being developed to its natural extent. The Commissary
officials of the Canal organization tried to interest cattle growers to
"the extent of raising enough beef for the need of the Canal workers, but"
failed. Practically all of the meat thus used is furnished by the
so-called “Beef Trust” of the United States. It is believed that there
"are not more than 50,000 head of cattle all told in Panama. I was told"
on the Isthmus that agents of a large Chicago firm had traveled through
"Edward Island, and losing his commission, he went to live near Halifax,"
"and became a lieutenant in the Nova Scotia Fencibles, while his wife"
"remained on the island to look after his estates, which brought him in"
"£300 a year. Meeting with a Scotchman called Morrison, together they"
"bought a ""pretty little New York battleship,"" mounting ten guns. Manning"
"this dangerous toy with a crew of ninety desperate characters, the"
"partners went ""on the account,"" and began well by taking a brig belonging"
"to Mr. Hill, of Rotherhithe, which they took to New York, and there sold"
both ship and cargo.
"They next cruised in the West Indies, taking several English and Dutch"
"ships, the crews of which they treated with the greatest brutality."
"Landing on St. Kitts Island, they burnt and plundered two Dutch"
"plantations, murdering the owners and slaves. Sailing north to"
"Newfoundland they took ten more vessels, which they sold in New York."
After further successful voyages in the West Indies and off the coast of
"Brazil, Nelson felt the call of home ties becoming so strong that he"
"ventured to return to Prince Edward Island to visit his wife and family,"
where no one dared to molest him.
"By this time Nelson had been a pirate for three years and had, by his"
"industry, won for himself a fortune worth £150,000, but his Scotch"
"partner, Morrison, being a frugal soul, had in the meantime saved an even"
larger sum. Eventually their ship was wrecked in a fog on a small barren
"island near Prince Edward Island, and Morrison and most of the crew were"
"drowned, but Nelson and a few others were saved. At last he reached New"
"York, where he lived the rest of his life in peaceful happiness with his"
wife and family.
"NICHOLLS, THOMAS, _alias_ NICHOLAS."
"inadvertently upon the last occasion it was used, exploded. The man’s"
"arm had been wrenched off, and he was burned terribly. It was a stroke"
of luck that the liner hove in sight at the moment she did. There was
"no chance of extending succour to the injured man on the spot, and he"
would have died before a doctor could have been summoned by boat from
"Ballycastle, nine miles away. The surgeon bound up the man’s injuries,"
"lowered him into his boat, and, on regaining the liner, placed him"
"in the hospital, where he was tended until the vessel’s arrival in"
"Liverpool, where he was landed and placed in hospital."

More remarkable was the accident which happened at the Flannen Islands
light-station in 1900; it remains an unsolved mystery to this day. This
"is one of Scotland’s lonely lights, mounting guard over a group of"
islets fifteen miles off the Hebrides. On December 26 the relief-tender
"approached the station on her usual fortnightly visit, but, to the"
"amazement of those on board, no signs of the keepers or the usual"
"signals were to be seen, while the lantern was not dressed in its"
"daylight garb. The crew landed hurriedly, wondering what was amiss."
They found the lighthouse absolutely deserted; not a sign of any of the
"three keepers was to be seen or heard. They examined the log, and found"
"that the light had not been burning for some days, the last entry being"
"made about 4 a.m. nearly a week previously. The rock was searched, but"
yielded no clue to the mystery of the complete disappearance of the
"83,664. (Mr. Chaubal). He did not know whether the salaries he had"
"mentioned as having been paid in Japan, New Zealand and Yale were on an"
incremental scale or not.
"83,665. There was a difference of kind between the way in which"
students were taught in schools and the way in which they were taught in
colleges. He did not agree with the witnesses who had said that during
the first year or two years at college the instruction given was similar
to that given in a school. It was very difficult to disprove or to prove
such statements. There would be no advantage in keeping boys to a school
course up the intermediate standard and making the colleges deal with
only those students who had passed the intermediate examination.
"83,666. (Sir Theodore Morison). There should be one scale of pay for all"
"persons in the higher educational department. The rate of salary, Rs."
"200 rising to Rs. 1,500 per month, was suitable, subject to the proviso"
"that the man of great distinction, instead of beginning at the lowest"
"rate of pay, should start some where in the middle of the list, say, at"
Rs. 400 or Rs. 500. He would make no reference in regard to Europeans or
Indians in that respect. In effect this no doubt amounted to making
Indians eligible for higher educational posts both by direct recruitment
and by promotion.
"83,667. He would not favour the handing over of all the Government"
institutions in Bengal to private agencies; there must be one or two
Government colleges in order to keep up the standard. He should be
sorry to see the Government dissociating itself from one of its primary
"duties, which was education."
"83,668. Privately managed Colleges paid less in salary than the"
Government Colleges. They paid about the same as was given in the
"the unstable progressive stage of popular well-being, though probably"
suffering less from it than either Germany or England.
"Here, then, is a group of kindred peoples apparently at least as capable"
"of reaching a solution of the social problem as any other, and visibly"
prospering materially and morally in proportion as they bring reason to
"bear on the vital lines of conduct, though still in the stage of curing"
over-population by emigration. Given continued peaceful political
"evolution in the direction first of democratic federation, and further"
"of socialisation of wealth, they may reach and keep the front rank in"
"civilisation, while the more unmanageably large communities face risks"
of dire vicissitude.

"There were a lot of untouched spaces--a horde, a myriad. On the side"
"wall was a chart, showing that nine squadrons of twenty-five spacecraft"
"each were patrolling back and forth through the uncharted wastes,"
seeking the space-wrecked lifeships.
The maddening part was the hourly report from both lifeships. It was
"like someone hiding in the dark and calling for aid, invisible and"
"alone. And not really calling for aid, but only making whimpering"
noises. For the signaling equipment on the lifeships was not equipped
"with the complicated infrawave phone, but only with the simple"
"signal-emitter, coded to transmit the identification call of the unit."
"On the hour they came in, calling three times, ""Lifeship Seventy-nine,"
"Seventy-nine, Number Three."" Number Two had not been heard from."
"Presumably it was not in use, or hadn't made the grade."
Wilson chewed his fingernails and fretted. Was Alice on Number One or
"Number Three, or was she on Number Two and it had foundered?"
"If she were still alive, what kind of fellow survivors were with her?"
He hoped she was with a group. If she had blown out in a lifeship with
"only one other--well, Ted Wilson did not like the idea. Of course, it"
was more customary than not for a young woman to love lightly before
she mated permanently. There was a lot less chance of wading into
matrimony wide-eyed and ignorant of what it was all about.
"But Wilson, if willing to face such transient loving at all, would"
"have preferred that Alice have her chance to pick and choose, rather"
than have the matter thrust upon her in the middle of a threatening
situation. The passion that comes with the shadow of death is only the
"instinct of racial preservation, and it mates men and women unsuited to"
"Francesco climbed from the valley as the day came with splendor, a"
glow of molten gold streaming from the east. Wood and hillside
"glimmered in a smoking mist, dew-bespangled, wonderful. As the sun"
"rose, the sea stretched sudden into the arch of the west, a great"
"expanse of liquid gold. A mysterious lustre hovered over the cliffs,"
waves of light bent like saffron mist upon San Nicandro.
The dawn-light found an echo in Francesco's face. He came that
"morning the ransomer, the champion, defeated in life and hope and"
"happiness, yet with head erect, as if defying Fate. His manhood smote"
"him like the deep-throated cry of a great bell, majestic and solemn."
"The towers on the cliff were haloed with magic hues. Life, glory, joy,"
lay locked in the gray stone walls. His heart sang in him; his eyes
were afire.
As he walked his horse with a hollow thunder of hoof over the narrow
"bridge, he took his horn and blew a blast thereon. There was a sense"
"of desolation, a lifelessness about the place that smote his senses"
with a strange fear. The walls stared void against the sky. There was
"no stir, no sound within, no watchful faces at portal or wicket. Only"
the gulls circled from the cliffs and the sea made its moan along the
strand.
"Francesco sat in the saddle and looked from wall to belfry, from tower"
"to gate. There was something tragic about the place, the silence of a"
"sacked town, the ghostliness of a ship sailing the seas with a dead"
"crew upon her decks. Francesco's glance rested on the open postern, an"
empty gash in the great gate. His face darkened and his eyes lost
their sanguine glow. There was something betwixt death and worse than
death in all this calm.
"though I am not abroad. But perhaps I am abroad after all, far away from"
the soil where I have my roots.
"Why, indeed, do I stay here any longer, at a resort full of"
"schoolmistresses, with a host who has once more said farewell to sobriety?"
Nothing is happening to me; I do not grow here. The others go out and lie
"on their backs; I steal off and find relish in myself, and feel poetry"
"within me for the night. The world wants no, poetry; it wants only verses"
that have not been sung before.
"And Norway wants no red-hot irons; only village smiths forge irons now,"
for the needs of the mob and the honor of the country.
No one came; the stream of tourists went up and down Stordalen and left
our little Reisa valley deserted. If only the Northern Railway could have
come to Reisa with Cook's and Bennett's tours--then Stordalen in its turn
"would have lain deserted. Meanwhile, the cotters who are cultivating the"
soil will probably go on harvesting half the crop of the outlying fields
for the rest of time. There is every reason to think so--unless our
"descendants are more intelligent than we, and refuse to be smitten with"
the demoralizing effects of the tourist traffic.
"Now, my friend, you mustn't believe me; this is the point where you must"
"shake your head. There is a professor scuttling about the country, a born"
mediocrity with a little school knowledge about history; you had better
"ask him. He'll give you just as much mediocre information, my friend, as"
your vision can grasp and your brain endure.

Hardly had Manufacturer Brede left when Paul began to live a most
irregular life again. More and more all roads were closed to him; he saw
"sailed away with his prize from the harbour. This prize, amongst the"
"merchandise, contained 40,000 moidors and a cross of diamonds designed for"
the King of Portugal.
"He then took a Dutch ship, and two days later an English one, and sailed"
"back to Brazil, refitting and cleaning at the Island of Ferdinando."
"In a work such as this is, it is impossible to recount all, or even a few,"
"of the daring adventures, or the piratical ups and downs of one pirate."
Roberts sailed to the West Indies devastating the commerce of Jamaica and
"Barbadoes. When things grew too hot there, he went north to Newfoundland,"
and played the very devil with the English and French fishing fleets and
settlements.
"His first ship he called the _Fortune_, his next, a bigger ship, the"
"_Royal Fortune_, another the _Good Fortune_."
"On two occasions Roberts had been very roughly handled, once by a ship"
"from Barbadoes and once by the inhabitants of Martinica, so when he"
"designed his new flag, he portrayed on it a huge figure of himself"
"standing sword in hand upon two skulls, and under these were the letters"
"A.B.H. and A.M.H., signifying a Barbadian's and a Martinican's head."
"In April, 1721, Roberts was back again on the Guinea Coast, burning and"
plundering. Amongst the prisoners he took out of one of his prizes was a
clergyman. The captain dearly wished to have a chaplain on board his ship
"to administer to the spiritual welfare of his crew, and tried all he could"
"to persuade the parson to sign on, promising him that his only duties"
should be to say prayers and make punch. But the prelate begged to be
"excused, and was at length allowed to go with all his belongings, except"
three prayer-books and a corkscrew--articles which were sorely needed
aboard the _Royal Fortune_.

"SPRIGGS, CAPTAIN FRANCIS FARRINGTON."
An uninteresting and bloody pirate without one single redeeming character.
"He learnt his art with the pirate Captain Lowther, afterwards serving as"
quartermaster with Captain Low and taking an active part in all the
barbarities committed by the latter.
"About 1720 Low took a prize, a man-of-war called the _Squirrel_. This he"
"handed over to some of the crew, who elected Spriggs their captain. The"
"ship they renamed the _Delight_, and in the night altered their course and"
"left Low. They made a flag, bearing upon it a white skeleton, holding in"
"one hand a dart striking a bleeding heart, and in the other an hourglass."
"Sailing to the West Indies, Spriggs took several prizes, treating the"
crews with abominable cruelty. On one occasion the pirates chased what
"they believed to be a Spanish ship, and after a long while they came"
alongside and fired a broadside into her. The ship immediately
"surrendered, and turned out to be a vessel the pirate had plundered only a"
"few days previously. This infuriated Spriggs and his crew, who showed"
their disappointment by half murdering the captain. After a narrow escape
"from being captured by a French man-of-war near the Island of St. Kitts,"
"Spriggs sailed north to the Summer Isles, or Bermudas. Taking a ship"
"coming from Rhode Island, they found her cargo to consist of horses."
Several of the pirates mounted these and galloped up and down the deck
until they were thrown. While plundering several small vessels of their
"cargo of logwood in the Bay of Honduras, Spriggs was surprised and"
"attacked by an English man-of-war, and the pirates only escaped by using"
their sweeps. Spriggs now went for a cruise off the coast of South
"Carolina, returning again to Honduras. This was a rash proceeding on"
"Another naked tree I would paint is the gleaming mauve-silver fig, which"
"burns its cold incandescence, tangled, like some sensitive creature"
emerged from the rock. A fig tree come forth in its nudity gleaming over
"the dark winter-earth is a sight to behold. Like some white, tangled sea"
"anemone. Ah, if it could but answer! or if we had tree-speech!"

"Yes, the steep valley sides become almost gorges, and there are trees."
"Not forests such as I had imagined, but scattered, grey, smallish oaks,"
"and some lithe chestnuts. Chestnuts with their long whips, and oaks with"
"their stubby boughs, scattered on steep hillsides where rocks crop out."
"The train perilously winding round, half way up. Then suddenly bolting"
"over a bridge and into a completely unexpected station. What is more,"
men crowd in--the station is connected with the main railway by a post
motor-omnibus.
An unexpected irruption of men--they may be miners or navvies or
land-workers. They all have huge sacks: some lovely saddle-bags with
rose-coloured flowers across the darkness. One old man is in full
"black-and-white costume, but very dirty and coming to pieces. The others"
wear the tight madder-brown breeches and sleeved waistcoats. Some have
"the sheepskin tunic, and all wear the long stocking cap. And how they"
smell! of sheep-wool and of men and goat. A rank scent fills the
carriage.
"They talk and are very lively. And they have mediaeval faces, _rusé_,"
"never really abandoning their defences for a moment, as a badger or a"
pole-cat never abandons its defences. There is none of the brotherliness
and civilised simplicity. Each man knows he must guard himself and his
own: each man knows the devil is behind the next bush. They have never
(153) The patient was wounded at Paardeberg at a range of from
"500 to 700 yards. _Entry_, just to the left of the episternal"
"notch; _exit_, in the fifth left interspace posteriorly, midway"
between the spine and vertebral margin of the scapula. A
"quantity of bright blood was brought up at once, and later"
blood was coughed up in clots.
There was no great pain at the moment of the injury; the man
"again got up to the firing line, and later walked two miles to"
"the Field hospital without aid. He remained here a week, when"
"he was sent down to the Base, and during the first three days'"
journey in the wagon he began to get worse. On the fourth day
cough began to be very troublesome.
"When he arrived at the Base, fifteen days after the original"
"injury, there was much dyspnoea; the temperature was 102°,"
and the pulse 110. The left side of the chest was dull
"throughout; an aspirating needle was introduced, and a pint of"
very dark liquid blood drawn off. The whole of the blood was
not removed on account of the very severe cough and pain which
the evacuation occasioned. The man appeared to steadily improve
"until three weeks later, when the temperature, which throughout"
"had been uneven, became consistently high, and signs of fluid"
"at the base increased. An aspirating needle was introduced, and"
16 ounces of pus were drawn off. Two days later a piece of rib
was resected (Mr. Pegg) and another pint of pus evacuated.
"After this, rapid improvement took place, and in ten days the"
"man was able to be up and dressed, although a small amount of"
discharge still persisted. He eventually made an excellent
recovery.
"Secondary empyemata not uncommonly followed incision of the chest, or"
"Morgan was essentially a man of action, and a regular life on shore proved"
"irksome to him, for we learn from a report sent home by Lord Vaughan in"
"1674 that Morgan ""frequented the taverns of Port Royal, drinking and"
"gambling in unseemly fashion,"" but nevertheless the Jamaican Assembly had"
voted the Lieutenant-Governor a sum of £600 special salary. In 1676
Vaughan brought definite charges against Morgan and another member of the
"Council, Robert Byndloss, of giving aid to certain Jamaica pirates."
"Morgan made a spirited defence and, no doubt largely owing to his"
"popularity, got off, and in 1678 was granted a commission to be a captain"
of a company of 100 men.
"The Governor to succeed Vaughan was Lord Carlisle, who seems to have liked"
"Morgan, in spite of his jovial ""goings on"" with his old buccaneer friends"
"in the taverns of Port Royal, and in some of his letters speaks of"
"Morgan's ""generous manner,"" and hints that whatever allowances are made to"
"him ""he will be a beggar."""
"In 1681 Sir Thomas Lynch was appointed to be Governor, and trouble at once"
began between him and his deputy. Amongst the charges the former brought
"against Morgan was one of his having been overheard to say, ""God damn the"
"Assembly!"" for which he was suspended from that body."
"In April, 1688, the King, at the urgent request of the Duke of Albemarle,"
"ordered Morgan to be reinstated in the Assembly, but Morgan did not live"
"long to enjoy his restored honours, for he died on August 25th, 1688."
"An extract from the journal of Captain Lawrence Wright, commander of"
"H.M.S. _Assistance_, dated August, 1688, describes the ceremonies held at"
"Port Royal at the burial of Morgan, and shows how important and popular a"
man he was thought to be. It runs:
"""It were better,"" she cried--""better that I had died yesterday than"
"suffer like this.  You rescued me from death only to torture me."""
Her words aroused within me a distinct suspicion that her strange
"illness had been brought to pass because, using some mysterious means,"
she had made an attempt against her own life.  I believed that she had
"suffered, and was still suffering, from the effects of some poison, the"
exact nature of which neither Deane nor Trepard could as yet determine.
"""I do not seek to torture you, dearest,"" I protested.  ""Far from it.  I"
"merely want to know the truth, in order that I may share your"
"unhappiness, as your betrothed ought to do."""
"""But you are not my betrothed."""
"""I was once."""
"""But not now.  You taunt me with breaking that promise which I made"
"three years ago, yet you yourself it was who played me false--who left"
"me for your prim, strait-laced English miss!"""
In an instant the truth was plain.  She was aware that I had transferred
my affections to Edith!  Someone had told her--no doubt with a good many
"embellishments, or perhaps some scandalous story.  In the salons through"
"which we of the diplomatic circle are compelled to move, women's tongues"
are ever at work match-making and mischief-making.  On the Continent
love and politics run always hand-in-hand.  That is the reason why the
"most notorious of the demi-monde in Paris, in Vienna, and in Berlin are"
the secret agents of their respective Governments; and many are the
honest men innocently denounced through jealousy and kindred causes.  A
false declaration of one or other of these unscrupulous spies has before
now caused the downfall of a Ministry or the disgrace of a noble and
his shoulder.
"Boswell and Trent, each with a little missive burning his pocket, turned"
"red, fidgeted, glared at the ocean, and made no remark. Severance darted"
"a glance at each of the three in succession, and then looked at the"
ground with a contemplative stare. At this moment Mrs. Pendleton
appeared.
Three of the men advanced to meet her with an awkward attempt at
"surprise, but she waved them back."
"“I have something to say to you,” she said."
The cold languor of her face had given place to an expression of haughty
triumph. A gleam of conscious power lay deep in her scornful eyes. The
"final act in the drama had come, and the dénouement should be worthy of"
her talents. She looked like a judge who had smiled encouragement to a
guilty defendant only to confer the sentence of capital punishment at
last.
"“Gentlemen,” she said, and even her voice was judicatorial, “I have"
"asked you all to meet me here this morning”—(three angry starts, but"
she went on unmoved)—“because I came to the conclusion last night that
"it is quite time this farce should end. I am somewhat bored myself, and"
"I have no doubt you are so, as well. Your joke was a clever one, worthy"
of the idle days of autumn. When I received your four proposals by the
"same mail, I appreciated your wit—I will say more, your genius—and"
"felt glad to do anything I could to contribute to your amusement,"
especially as all the world is away and I knew how dull you must be. So
"I accepted each of you, as you know, had four charming interviews and"
one memorable one of a more composite nature; and now that we have all
agreed that the spicy and original little drama has run its length I
be a crucial node where he could attach the device he'd brought.
"It had taken some doing, but he'd managed to assemble an item that"
should take care of his problem beautifully when the moment came. It
"was a radio-controlled, electrically operated blade that, when clamped"
"onto a strand of wires, could sever them in an instant. The radio range"
"was fifty meters, which would be adequate; the transmitter, no larger"
"than a small tape recorder, was going to be with him in his flight"
suit. The instant he switched the turboramjets over to the scramjet
"mode, he was going to activate it and blow their fucking AI module out"
of the system. Permanently.
He figured he had ten minutes before one of the security team came
looking to see what he was doing; he'd timed this moment to coincide
with their regular tea break. Even the Japanese didn't work around the
clock.
"Now, holding the penlight and shivering from the cold, he began"
"carefully checking the wires. Carefully, so very carefully. He didn't"
"have a diagram of their computer linkages, and he had to make sure he"
"didn't accidentally interrupt the main power source, since the one"
thing he didn't want to do was disconnect any of the other flight
control systems. He wanted to cut in somewhere between the AI module's
power supply and its central processor. The power source led in here .
". . and then up the side over to there, a high-voltage transformer . ."
. and then out from . . .
There. Just after the step-up transformer and before the motherboard
with the dedicated CPU and I/O. That should avoid any shorting in the
main power system and keep the interruption nice and localized.
"The line was almost half an inch thick, double-stranded, copper"
Across the void from her world to my own she was signaling--trying to
tell me what?--and frantically my fancy sprang to translate the message.
"But as the man, with growing agitation, had been watching narrowly"
throughout this--a condition of which I felt sure she must be acutely
aware--I dared not make the slightest sign. Yet she seemed to understand
"and, joining him, they passed out."
I pounced upon that crumpled ball of paper and was back in my chair
unfolding it with nervous fingers. Feverishly pressing out the creases I
"saw that it was, indeed, a corner torn from the winecard, and written"
upon it--nothing. Absolutely nothing!
"Perhaps I should have laughed, but as a matter of fact I cursed. Deep in"
"my soul I cursed. Her little joke, her pretty bit of acting, had left a"
stinging sense of loss. As suddenly as this ruthless comet swept into my
orbit it had swung out and on; for one delicious moment we had touched
"across the infinite, but now my harmony was shattered, the strings of my"
"harp were snapped, curled up, and could not be made to play again."
"But the Spanish girl was playing her guitar, once more singing her"
"impassioned song of the enchanted island in its sea of love, which made"
me pity myself so much that I permitted the waiter again to fill my
glass. What a wondrous adventure this night might have brought!
Such thoughts wore not to be profaned by the companionship of Tommy and
"Monsieur, so I slipped away, hailed a cab and alighted at the Machina"
"wharf. The boatman there, whom I aroused to take me out, was one of the"
"most stupid fellows I've ever encountered. At any rate, someone was"
stupid.
Going aboard the yacht I stood for a moment listening to the lonely

"surgeon that had ever done so, and he hoped, he said, to prove as great a"
rogue as any of them.
"When the African Company's Guinea ship, the _King Solomon_, was taken,"
Scudamore came aboard and helped himself to their surgeon's instruments
"and medicines. He also took a fancy for a backgammon board, but only kept"
it after a violent quarrel with another pirate. It came out at his trial
"that on a voyage from the Island of St. Thomas, in a prize, the _Fortune_,"
"in which was a cargo of slaves, Scudamore had tried to bring about a"
"mutiny of the blacks to kill the prize crew which was on board, and he was"
"detected in the night going about amongst the negroes, talking to them in"
the Angolan language. He said that he knew enough about navigation to sail
"the ship himself, and he was heard to say that ""this were better than to"
"be taken to Cape Corso to be hanged and sun dried."""
The same witness told how he had approached the prisoner when he was
"trying to persuade a wounded pirate, one James Harris, to join him in his"
"scheme, but fearing to be overheard, Scudamore turned the conversation to"
horse-racing.
"Scudamore was condemned to death, but allowed three days' grace before"
"being hanged, which he spent in incessant prayers and reading of the"
"Scriptures. On the gallows he sang, solo, the Thirty-first Psalm. Died at"
the age of 35.
"SEARLES, CAPTAIN ROBERT."
"In 1664 he brought in two Spanish prizes to Port Royal, but as orders had"
only lately come from England to the Governor to do all in his power to
"promote friendly relations with the Spanish islands, these prizes were"
"folly. I don't doubt that he honestly thought he was dealing with me."""
"""He will have to be punished. The Admiral will insist upon that."""
"""We must make the punishment as light as we can. You shall help me"
with all the discretionary authority with which you are equipped. I
"can see, Dawson, from the tactful skill with which you have dealt with"
me that discretion is among your most distinguished characteristics.
"If you had been a stupid, bull-headed policeman, you would have been"
"up against pretty serious trouble."""
"""That was quite my own view,"" replied Dawson drily."
"""Who is the man described by our erring draughtsman?"""
"""He won't say. We have put on every allowable method of pressure, and"
some that are not in ordinary times permitted. We have had over this
spy hunt business to shed most of our tender English regard for
"suspected persons, and to adopt the French system of fishing"
inquiries. In France the police try to make a man incriminate himself;
in England we try our hardest to prevent him. That may be very right
"and just in peace time against ordinary law breakers; but war is war,"
and spies are too dangerous to be treated tenderly. We have
"cross-examined the man, and bully-ragged him, but he won't give up the"
name of his accomplice. It may be a relation. One thing seems sure.
"The man is, or was, a member of your staff, engaged in shipyard"
inquiries. Can you give me a list of the men who are or have been on
"this sort of work during the past few years?"""
"""I will get it for you. But please use it carefully. My present men"
"are precious jewels, the few left to me by zealous military"
authorities. What I must look for is some one over military age who
"loves. Death, he says, and life are one; not antagonistic, but the same;"
and the only way to escape from one is to escape from the other too.
"Only in the Great Peace, when we have found refuge from the passion and"
"tumult of life, shall we find the place where death cannot come. Life"
and death are one.
"This is the teaching of the Buddha, repeated over and over again to his"
"disciples when they sorrowed for the death of Thariputra, when they"
were in despair at the swift-approaching end of the great teacher
"himself. Hear what he says to Ananda, the beloved disciple, who is"
mourning over Thariputra.
"'Ananda,' he said, 'often and often have I sought to bring shelter to"
your soul from the misery caused by such grief as this. There are two
"things alone that can separate us from father and mother, from brother"
"and sister, from all those who are most cherished by us, and those two"
"things are distance and death. Think not that I, though the Buddha, have"
not felt all this even as any other of you; was I not alone when I was
seeking for wisdom in the wilderness?
'And yet what would I have gained by wailing and lamenting either for
myself or for others? Would it have brought to me any solace from my
loneliness? Would it have been any help to those whom I had left? There
"is nothing that can happen to us, however terrible, however miserable,"
that can justify tears and lamentations and make them aught but a
weakness.'
"And so, we are told, in this way the Buddha soothed the affliction of"
"Ananda, and filled his soul with consolation--the consolation of"
resignation.
"For there is no other consolation possible but this, resignation to the"
"of horns, the shouting of commands."
The duke and Francesco had dismounted and were gazing up towards the
storm-swept ramparts. Shrieks and curses rolled down upon them like
the tumbling of a cascade.
"Then they began to scale the ledge, the path dwindling to a goat's"
highway.
Above them rose a sheer wall on which there appeared not clinging
space for a lizard. The abyss below was ready to welcome them to
perdition if their feet slipped.
"After a brief respite they continued, the duke's men scrambling up"
"behind them, looking like so many ants on the white chalk-cliffs. The"
"air was hot to suffocation; the storm roared, the thunder bellowed in"
"deafening echoes through the skies, and the heavens seemed one blazing"
"cataract of fire, reflected in the throbbing mirror of the sea."
"They had reached a seam in the rock, where they paused for a moment to"
let their brains rest. There was hardly room for the duke and
"Francesco on the ledge, so narrow was the rocky shelf, and the latter"
was pushing close against the wall when he was suddenly forced to look
"up. He heard the din of the encounter above. The Pisans, having"
"attacked the Frangipani from the south, were driving them out at the"
"north. Suddenly two bodies whizzed by him, thrust over the ramparts in"
the fierceness of the assault. Another came; he seemed to have jumped
"for life, for he kept feet foremost for a distance through the air,"
"before he began to whirl. These fell clear of the scaling party, and"
"were impaled on the broken tops of the stunted trees, that bossed the"
side of the precipice. One came so near the duke that his flight
downward almost blew him off his narrow perch. His head struck the
and found. I am now within five thousand yards of what appears to be
"Lifeship One."""

the habits of a lifetime which keeps the mind clear and the nerve
"firm. Lois went on quietly preparing some sandwiches, which in all"
"probability would never be eaten, and Mrs. Carmichael resigned martial"
occupation for the cutting-out of a baby's pinafore for an East-end
child whom she had under her special patronage. But her mind was
"active and, stern, self-opinionated martinet that she was, she could"
not altogether crush the regrets that swarmed up in this last
reckoning up of her life's activity. Better had her charity and
interest been centered on the dirty little children whom she had
indignantly tolerated on her compound! Better for them all would it
have been had each one of them sought to win the love and respect of
"the subject race! Then, perhaps, they would not have been deserted in"
this last hour of peril.
Mrs. Carmichael glanced at Beatrice Cary with a fresh pricking of
"conscience. What, after all, had she done to deserve the chief"
condemnation? She had played with fire. Had they not all played with
"fire? She had looked upon a native as a toy fit to play with, to break"
"and throw away. Did they not all, behind their seeming tolerance and"
"Christian principles, hide an equal depreciation? Was she even as bad"
"as some? How many men revealed to their syces their darkest moods,"
their lowest passions? How many women were to their ayahs subjects for
"contemptuous Bazaar gossip. They were all to blame, and this was the"
"harvest, the punishment for the neglect of a heavy responsibility. The"
"""I want to see Mr. Jobling, at once,"" Slyne announced to him. And Mr."
"Jobling's ""managing clerk"" looked slowly round, with a snake-like and"
disconcerting effect due to a very long neck and a very low collar.
"""Show Mr. Slyne in immediately, Mullins,"" ordered a pompous voice from"
"within; and Mr. Jobling himself, a blackcoated, portly, important"
"personage there, came bustling out from his private office to welcome"
his visitors.
"""How d'ye do, how d'ye do, Lady Josceline!"" he exclaimed, and cocked an"
arch eyebrow at Sallie's most becoming costume; although the effect he
intended was somewhat impaired by the fact that he was still suffering
"from a black eye, painted over in haste--and by an incompetent artist."
"""I can see now what's been keeping _you_ in Paris!"" he added"
"facetiously, and, having shaken hands with Slyne, who seemed to think"
"that superfluous, turned to receive Captain Dove with the same"
politeness.
"""Phew!"" whistled Mr. Jobling and drew back and stared at the old man."
"""I'd _never_ have recognised you in that rig-out."""
"Captain Dove pulled off a pair of smoked glasses he had been wearing,"
"the better to look him, with offensive intent, in his injured eye. For"
Captain Dove was still enduring much mental as well as physical
discomfort in a disguise which he had only been induced to adopt a
"couple of days before, and after an embittered quarrel with Slyne. The"
stiff white collar round his corded neck was still threatening to choke
him and then cut his throat. He had been infinitely more at his ease in
"his scanty, short-tailed frock-coat and furry top-hat than he was in the"
"somewhat baggy if more becoming black garb he had donned in its place,"
with a soft wide-awake always flapping about his ears.
"throat. After all, he was going to win! Out of the shimmering distance"
"of his desire, the lady of his dreams drew closer to him; and ere long"
"he could lay at her feet the burden of his travail, and then--."
"Oblivious to the turmoil all about, he wrote rapidly, almost"
"incoherently, to Mildred, transcribing the mood of mingled tenderness"
and exultation which possessed him.
"""Outside the building,"" he concluded, ""there is a raging mob. They"
"would ruin me if they could, but they can't do it, they can't do it. We"
"have beaten them all, my lady. We have won!"""
"He was sealing his letter, when, without warning, ""Fingerless"" Fraser"
"appeared at his side, his fishlike eyes agleam, his colorless face"
drawn with anxiety.
"""They've come to grab you for killing that striker,"" he began,"
"breathlessly; ""there's a couple of 'square-toes' on the dock now."
"Better take it on the 'lam'--quick!"""
"""God!"" So Marsh had withheld this stroke until the last moment, when"
the least delay would be fatal. Boyd knew that if he were brought into
court he would have hard shift to clear himself against the mass of
perjured testimony that his rival had doubtless gathered; but even this
seemed as nothing in comparison with the main issue. For one wild
instant he considered sending George Balt on with the ship. That would
"be folly, no doubt; yet plainly he could not hold _The Bedford Castle_"
and keep together that raging army of fishermen while he fought his way
through the tedious vexations of a trial. He saw that he had
"under-estimated his enemy's cunning, and he realized that, if Marsh had"
"planned this move, he would press his advantage to the full."
"""There's two plain-clothes men,"" he heard Fraser running on. ""I 'made'"
"But a moment later his superiority turned to consternation, and he"
was burying his head in the bowels of the car.
After a moment's inspection he showed a face of such utter dismay
that it would have been comical had not the situation been so serious.
"""Great Scott, sir! I must have left the petrol tap turned on, and the"
"tank is nearly empty."""
"Here, I'm afraid, my language was violent, and it was some minutes"
before Allan was able to ascertain exactly how much petrol we had
left. His calculations established the fact that we had lost some
fourteen gallons. This meant that we should have to walk the greater
part of the last two hundred miles of our journey. A pleasant
"prospect in that forbidding country. But orders were to go on, and go"
on we did.
"That day we made good time, and before evening had done the ninety"
"miles set as a day's march. But, as we had lost so much ground the"
"previous day, I determined to go on as long as Allan could stick at"
"the driving wheel, and we went on--to a post called Yadgar."
"I should explain that in this barren, townless, roadless district"
"there are occasional small rest-houses, very modest types of Dâk"
"bungalows, established by the Indian Government for the benefit of"
"travellers, or soldiers on their way to frontier duty. They are quite"
"bare except for a camp bed or two, a tub, a table, a few chairs and a"
"wash-hand basin, with a _chokidar_, or keeper, in charge."
"Such a rest-house we found at Yadgar, and being not only very tired"
"and dusty, but filthily dirty, as the result of our struggles with"
"the car, we pulled up to try and get a superficial wash."
rotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a
"muted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until"
he could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.

"Remembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he"
instantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate
level from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as
"quaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have"
had enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered
if he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth
"their relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would"
"send her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,"
that special power of his over her was reserved for far more important
purposes.
Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence
"into his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed."
No covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them
"unnecessary. He stepped into his clothing--the severe tunic, tights and"
sockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message
"tape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme"
"tablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly"
"planted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face"
broke into a smile.
"It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making"
"up his life--and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of"
"his best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving"
"technique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as"
somno-learning.
"Summer tourists were still there; the Casino was full of people, the"
shops were doing an active trade; the restaurants were crowded with
"English, Americans, Belgians taking tea, chocolate, or liqueurs at"
little tables and creating a babel of talk. Newspapers were being
sold everywhere by ragamuffin boys who shouted their head-lines in
"French, Flemish, and quite understandable English. A fort or two at"
"Liége had fallen, but it was of no consequence. General Léman could"
"hold out indefinitely, and the mere fact that German soldiers had"
entered the town of Liége counted for nothing. Belgium had virtually
won the war by holding up the immense German army. France was
"overrunning Alsace, Russia was invading East Prussia and also"
"sending uncountable thousands of soldiers, via Archangel, to"
"England, whence they were being despatched to Calais for the relief"
of Belgium.
"""It looks,"" thought Vivie, after glancing at the _Indépendance"
"Belge_, ""As though Belgium were going to be extremely interesting"
during the next few weeks; I may be privileged to witness--from a
"safe distance--another Waterloo."""
Then she returned to the train which in her absence had been so
crowded with soldiers and civilian passengers that she had great
difficulty in finding her place and seating herself. The young man
whom she had seen pacing the deck of the steamer approached her and
"said: ""There is more room in my compartment; in fact I have"
"selfishly got one all to myself. Won't you share it?"""
She thanked him and moved in there with her suit case and rugs.
When the train had started and she had parried one or two polite
"enquiries as to place and ventilation, she said: ""I think I ought to"
"tell you who I am, in case you would not like to be seen speaking to"
"Usually, however, the peasants of the South have left off the costume."
"Usually it is the invisible soldiers' grey-green cloth, the Italian"
"khaki. Wherever you go, wherever you be, you see this khaki, this"
"grey-green war-clothing. How many millions of yards of the thick,"
"excellent, but hateful material the Italian government must have"
"provided I don't know: but enough to cover Italy with a felt carpet, I"
should think. It is everywhere. It cases the tiny children in stiff and
"neutral frocks and coats, it covers their extinguished fathers, and"
sometimes it even encloses the women in its warmth. It is symbolic of
"the universal grey mist that has come over men, the extinguishing of all"
"bright individuality, the blotting out of all wild singleness. Oh"
democracy! Oh khaki democracy!
*       *       *       *       *
This is very different from Italian landscape. Italy is almost always
"dramatic, and perhaps invariably romantic. There is drama in the plains"
"of Lombardy, and romance in the Venetian lagoons, and sheer scenic"
excitement in nearly all the hilly parts of the peninsula. Perhaps it is
the natural floridity of lime-stone formations. But Italian landscape is
"really eighteenth-century landscape, to be represented in that"
romantic-classic manner which makes everything rather marvelous and very
"topical: aqueducts, and ruins upon sugar-loaf mountains, and craggy"
ravines and Wilhelm Meister water-falls: all up and down.
"Sardinia is another thing. Much wider, much more ordinary, not"
"up-and-down at all, but running away into the distance. Unremarkable"
"ridges of moor-like hills running away, perhaps to a bunch of dramatic"
"peaks on the southwest. This gives a sense of space, which is so lacking"
"in Italy. Lovely space about one, and traveling distances--nothing"
"finished, nothing final. It is like liberty itself, after the peaky"
"drift into Self and Wrong, than to strike out brave arms, and swim,"
"despite all difficulty, toward God and Right, yet if we once take the"
"latter course, we shall find it the most natural and the least"
fatiguing. And with every separate stroke of high endeavor we carry
"others with us,--we raise our race,--we bear it onward,--upward! And"
"the true reward, or best result of fame, is, that having succeeded in"
"winning brief attention from the multitude, a man may be able to"
pronounce one of God's lightning messages of inspired Truth plainly to
"them, while they are yet willing to stand and listen. This momentary"
"hearing from the people is, as I take it, the sole reward any writer"
"can dare to hope for,--and when he obtains it, he should remember that"
"his audience remains with him but a very short while,--so that it is"
"his duty to see that he employ his chance WELL, not to win applause for"
"himself, but to cheer and lift others to noble thought, and still more"
"noble fulfilment."""
Villiers regarded him wistfully.
"""Alwyn, my dear fellow, do you want to be the Sisyphus of this"
"era?--You will find the stone of Evil heavy to roll upward,--moreover,"
it will exhibit the usually painful tendency to slip back and crush
"you!"""
"""How can it crush me?"" asked his friend with a serene smile. ""My heart"
"cannot be broken, or my spirit dismayed, and as for my body, it can but"
"die,--and death comes to every man! I would rather try to roll up the"
"stone, however fruitless the task, than sit idly looking at it, and"
"doing nothing!"""
"""Your heart cannot be broken? Ah! how do you know"" ... and Villiers"
"shook his head dubiously--""What man can be certain of his own destiny?"""
that this was the man he hated. He simply felt an overwhelming
"thankfulness that some one had come at last, and obeyed orders"
mechanically and without question.
"But as his peavey gripped the end of that troublesome log, there"
suddenly flamed into Curly’s mind--temptation. Bainbridge stood below
"him, perched perilously on the very face of the jam. A little"
thrust--the tiniest movement of the riverman’s arm--would send him
"plunging into the stream, while another movement would suffice to drop"
one of the looser logs upon him. There were no witnesses; the whole
"affair would pass as an unfortunate accident. A chance like this, so"
"easy, so absolutely safe, would never come again."
"“Now!” broke in the crisp voice of the lumberman. “Hard over, boy."
Toward me--all you know how!”
Curly’s muscles strained as he threw every ounce of strength into the
pull. The key log creaked and groaned as if agony but was thrust
"gradually forward. Curly felt it moving faster and faster, and"
instinctively he prepared for that backward leap which would carry him
out of reach of the treacherous avalanche of falling logs.
A second later his peavey was torn from his hands by the sudden collapse
of half the face of the jam. The logs at his side vanished in the
"unexpected rush, but that on which he stood remained firm for a precious"
moment. Below him he saw Bainbridge whirl like a cat and grasp for
"something solid. Instantly he bent over, reaching out both callous,"
"muscular hands, and as swiftly Bob gripped them. There was a heave, an"
"upward scramble, another crash as the remainder of the jam disappeared"
"into the foaming water. But the two men had leaped in time, and a moment"
later they were standing together on the bank.
"Louvain objected, 'if you do not really approve of any of them?' And"
"Erasmus answers with Horace's word: 'In the first place, because I"
cannot sleep'.
"A sleepless energy, it was that indeed. He cannot rest. Still half"
"seasick and occupied with his trunks, he is already thinking about an"
"answer to Dorp's letter, just received, censuring the _Moria_. We should"
"fully realize what it means that time after time Erasmus, who, by"
"nature, loved quiet and was fearful, and fond of comfort, cleanliness"
"and good fare, undertakes troublesome and dangerous journeys, even"
"voyages, which he detests, for the sake of his work and of that alone."
"He is not only restless, but also precipitate. Helped by an incomparably"
retentive and capacious memory he writes at haphazard. He never becomes
anacoluthic; his talent is too refined and sure for that; but he does
repeat himself and is unnecessarily circumstantial. 'I rather pour out
"than write everything,' he says. He compares his publications to"
"parturitions, nay, to abortions. He does not select his subjects, he"
"tumbles into them, and having once taken up a subject he finishes"
"without intermission. For years he has read only _tumultuarie_, up and"
down all literature; he no longer finds time really to refresh his mind
"by reading, and to work so as to please himself. On that account he"
envied Budaeus.
"'Do not publish too hastily,' More warns him: 'you are watched to be"
"caught in inexactitudes.' Erasmus knows it: he will correct all later,"
he will ever have to revise and to polish everything. He hates the
"labour of revising and correcting, but he submits to it, and works"
"passionately, 'in the treadmill of Basle', and, he says, finishes the"
work of six years in eight months.
In that recklessness and precipitation with which Erasmus labours there

strenuous latter days.

But we were soon to learn that the Roman Catholics did not think of the
infant Christ as lacking in power of a certain sort; on the contrary
they ascribe miraculous agency even to an image of the divine babe. On
"the afternoon of December 29th, as two of our party were returning to"
"our hotel, they passed at the foot of the Capitoline Hill a carriage,"
"out of the window of which hung a ribbon or sash of cloth of gold, and"
"they were not a little astonished to observe that, as this carriage"
"rolled along, people knelt reverently before it on the street. Inside"
they saw two bareheaded men holding a child on a pillow with a wealth
of lace about it. They thought perhaps it was the royal carriage with
"the baby princess, but they could not imagine why _men_ should be"
"nursing the baby, as that is usually the employment of women, nor why"
"the people should kneel so reverently before the young princess, a"
"thing which they never did even for the king himself. The fact is that,"
as they learned on the following afternoon when visiting the Church of
"Ara Coeli, on the Capitoline Hill, the carriage in question belonged to"
"a far more important personage in Rome than any princess, though that"
"personage was not even a living baby, but only a doll. It was the coach"
of the famous Bambino--_Il Santissimo Bambino_--which with its dress
"of gold and silver tissue and its magnificent diamonds, emeralds and"
"rubies, is the chief attraction of this church."

"Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his book on _The Roman Catholic Church in"
"Brand had been to Jupiter on four different trips; and, as he walked"
"toward his quarters from Stone's office, he reviewed what he had"
learned on those trips.
"Jupiter, as he knew it, was a vast globe of vague horror and sharp"
contrasts.
"Distant from the sun as it was, it received little solar heat. But,"
"with so great a mass, it had cooled off much more slowly than any of"
"the other planets known, and had immense internal heat. This meant"
that the air--which closely approximated Earth's air in density--was
"cool a few hundred yards up from the surface of the planet, and dankly"
"hot close to the ground. The result, as the cold air constantly sank"
"into the warm, was a thick steamy blanket of fog that covered"
everything perpetually.
"Because of the recent cooling, life was not far advanced on Jupiter."
Too short a time ago the sphere had been but a blazing mass. Tropical
"marshes prevailed, crisscrossed by mighty rivers at warmer than blood"
"heat. Giant, hideous fernlike growths crowded one another in an"
"everlasting jungle. And among the distorted trees, from the blanket of"
"soft white fog that hid all from sight, could be heard constantly an"
ear-splitting chorus of screams and bellows and whistling snarls. It
made the blood run cold just to listen--and to speculate on what
gigantic but tiny-brained monsters made them.
"Now and then, when Brand had been flying dangerously low over the"
"surface, a wind had risen strong enough to dispel the fog banks for an"
"instant; and he had caught a flash of Jovian life. Just a flash, for"
"example, of a monstrous lizard-like thing too great to support its own"
"bulk: or a creature all neck and tail, with ridges of scale on its"
"outline of the history of the Lake Superior region, the"
"deformations which it suffered, their relative severity, the times"
"when they occurred, and the erosion cycles marked by the"
successive unconformities.
OTHER PRE-CAMBRIAN AREAS IN NORTH AMERICA. Pre-Cambrian rocks are
"exposed in various parts of the continent, usually by the erosion"
of mountain ranges in which their strata were infolded. Large
areas occur in the maritime provinces of Canada. The core of the
"Green Mountains of Vermont is pre-Cambrian, and rocks of these"
systems occur in scattered patches in western Massachusetts. Here
belong also the oldest rocks of the Highlands of the Hudson and of
"New Jersey. The Adirondack region, an outlier of the Laurentian"
"region, exposes pre-Cambrian rocks, which have been metamorphosed"
and tilted by the intrusion of a great boss of igneous rock out of
which the central peaks are carved. The core of the Blue Ridge and
probably much of the Piedmont Belt are of this age. In the Black
Hills the irruption of an immense mass of granite has caused or
accompanied the upheaval of pre-Cambrian strata and metamorphosed
"them by heat and pressure into gneisses, schists, quartzites, and"
slates. In most of these mountainous regions the lowest strata are
"profoundly changed by metamorphism, and they can be assigned to"
the pre-Cambrian only where they are clearly overlain
unconformably by formations proved to be Cambrian by their
"fossils. In the Belt Mountains of Montana, however, the Cambrian"
"is underlain by Algonkian sediments twelve thousand feet thick,"
and but little altered.
MINERAL WEALTH OF THE PRE-CAMBRIAN ROCKS. The pre-Cambrian rocks
"are of very great economic importance, because of their extensive"
metamorphism and the enormous masses of igneous rock which they
involve. In many parts of the country they are the source of
"purchasers, the former being mounted as a curiosity, while the backbone"
forms a novel and serviceable walking-stick.
One method of trapping these monsters which affords keen delight was
"related to me. The requirements are an electric battery, some rope, a"
"few feet of electric wire, a cartridge, and an empty box, with a chunk"
"or two of bad meat. The cartridge is fitted with an electric primer,"
the wire of which stretches to the battery. This cartridge is buried
"in a hunk of meat, the whole being dangled from a box--an empty cask is"
"better--which serves as a float, while a rope is stretched from the box"
"to the shore, with the electric wire spirally wound round it. A short"
"length of chain is preferable, if available, to attach the bait to the"
"float, but a short piece of rope will do. This novel line is thrown"
"into the water, and the man keeps his eye on the float, with one finger"
"on the battery. The hungry shark, espying the tempting morsel, makes a"
"grab and swallows it, but the chain prevents him tearing away with it."
"The pull causes the float to disappear, the man’s finger presses the"
"button, and the trick is done. There is an explosion, and pieces of"
shark and showers of water fly into the air. The incident is all over
too quickly for the fish to marvel about the strange indigestibility
of the tainted meat he grabbed so greedily. The men enjoy this sport
"hugely when it can be followed, as they regard the shark with intense"
detestation.

It was this syncretic religion that came to Rome after having enjoyed
popularity in the eastern Mediterranean. Sicily and the south of Italy were
"more than half Hellenized, and the Ptolemies had diplomatic relations with"
"these countries, just as the merchants of Alexandria had commercial"
relations with them. For this reason the worship of Isis spread as rapidly
in those regions as on the coasts of Ionia or in the Cyclades.[22] It was
introduced into Syracuse and Catana during the earliest years of the third
"century by {81} Agathocles. The Serapeum of Pozzuoli, at that time the"
"busiest seaport of Campania, was mentioned in a city ordinance of the year"
"105 B. C.[23] About the same time an Iseum was founded at Pompeii, where"
the decorative frescos attest to this day the power of expansion possessed
by the Alexandrian culture.
"After its adoption by the southern part of the Italian peninsula, this"
religion was bound to penetrate rapidly to Rome. Ever since the second
"century before our era, it could not help but find adepts in the chequered"
multitude of slaves and freedmen. Under the Antonines the college of the
_pastophori_ recalled that it had been founded in the time of Sulla.[24] In
vain did the authorities try to check the invasion of the Alexandrian gods.
"Five different times, in 59, 58, 53, and 48 B. C., the senate ordered their"
"altars and statues torn down,[25] but these violent measures did not stop"
the diffusion of the new beliefs. The Egyptian mysteries were the first
example at Rome of an essentially popular religious movement that was
triumphant over the continued resistance of the public authorities and the
official clergy.
Why was this Egyptian worship the only one of all Oriental religions to
"suffer repeated persecutions? There were two motives, one religious and one"
political.

whimperings and by laying their rough heads caressingly against La
Giralda's short and primitive skirt and leather-cased legs.
In a few moments after they had reached the pavilion the Princess came
"shouting back. She was certainly a most jovial little person, Spanish at"
"all points, with great dark eyes and cheeks apple-red with good health"
and the sharp airs of the Guadarrama. Doña Susana had walked a little in
"front of La Giralda and her flock, to show the superiority of her"
"position, and also, it may be, to display the amplitude of her several"
"chins, by holding them in the air in a manner as becoming as it was"
dignified.
"""Milk them! Milk them quickly! Let me see!"" the Princess shouted,"
clanging the pails joyously together. The walls of the pavilion in which
La Giralda found herself were decorated with every kind of household
"utensil, but not such as had ever been used practically. Everything was"
of silver or silver-gilt. There was indeed a complete _batterie de
"cuisine_--saucepans, patty-pans, graters, a mincing machine with the"
"proper screws and handles, shining rows of lids, and a complete"
graduated series of cooking spoons stuck in a bandolier. Salad dishes of
"sparkling crystal bound with silver ornamented the sideboard, while"
various earthen pots and pans of humbler make stood on a curiously
designed stove under whose polished top no fire had ever burned. At
"least so it appeared to La Giralda, who, much impressed by the"
"magnificence of the installation, would promptly have driven her goats"
out again.
But this the little Isabel would by no means permit.
"""Here--here!"" she commanded, ""this is mine--my very own. My mother has a"
accompanied by the duchess and a gentleman in waiting. The visit was made
incognito.
"As a result of this royal visit, which was made for the purpose of seeing"
"Frances, a part of Sir Richard's estates near St. Albans were restored to"
"him, and from poverty he rose at once to a comfortable income of, say, a"
thousand or twelve hundred pounds a year.
"Immediately all of Sir Richard's hatred of Charles II fell away, and once"
more the king shone in the resplendent light of his divine appointment.
"While Frances estimated the king's generosity at its true value, she was"
"glad her father had received even a small part of what was his just due,"
"and although she knew the restoration had been made to please, and, if"
"possible, to win her, she was glad to have spoiled the royal Philistine,"
"and despised him more than ever before, if that were possible."
"Sir Richard's good fortune brought a gleam of joy to Frances, but it also"
"brought a pang of regret, because it had come too late. Her only purpose"
in going to Whitehall had been to marry a rich nobleman and thereby raise
"the fallen fortunes of her house. Now that reason existed no longer, and"
"if George were here, she could throw herself away upon him with injury to"
"no one but herself. But George was not here, and liberty to throw herself"
away had come too late to be of any value.
"Every day during the fortnight that Frances remained at home, she asked"
"if I had any news from court, meaning the French court, but using the"
form of inquiry to avoid acquainting her father and Sarah with the real
cause of her solicitude.
"But my answers were always, ""Oh, nothing but Castlemain's new tantrum,"""
"or ""The duke's defeat at pall-mall."""
It may be added that neither in the one Lagoon nor in the other are
"there any private, proprietary rights to coral outcrops. The whole"
"community of Sinaketa have their fishing grounds in the Lagoon,"
"within which every man may hunt for his spondylus shell, and catch"
"his fish at times. If the other spondylus fishing community, the"
"Vakutans, encroached upon their grounds, there would be trouble,"
"and in olden days, fighting. Private ownership in coral outcrops"
"exists in the Northern villages of the Lagoon, that is in Kavataria,"
and the villages on the island of Kayleula.
III
We must now follow the later stages of the kaloma industry. The
technology of the proceedings is so mixed up with remarkable
sociological and economic arrangements that it will be better to
indicate it first in its main outlines. The spondylus consists of a
"shell, the size and shape of a hollowed out half of a pear, and of a"
"flat, small lid. It is only the first part which is worked. First"
it has to be broken into pieces with a binabina or an utukema
(green stone imported from Woodlark Island) as shown on Plate L
"(A). On each piece, then, can be seen the stratification of the"
"shell: the outside layer of soft, chalky substance; under this, the"
"layer of red, hard, calcareous material, and then the inmost, white,"
crystalline stratum. Both the outside and inside have to be rubbed
"off, but first each piece has to be roughly rounded up, so as to form"
"a thick circular lump. Such a lump (see foregrounds of Plates L (A),"
L (B)) is then put in the hole of a cylindrical piece of wood. This
latter serves as a handle with which the lumps are rubbed on a piece
of flat sandstone (see Plate L (B)). The rubbing is carried on so far
He was near singing more than once. The place was astir with the sound
"of Betty’s skirts, the echo of her gaiety, the sound of her light"
footstep. The air was sweet with the breath of her uncomplaining
good-nature.
"He shut up the bag, tied a label upon it, put on his cloak and hat,"
"blew out the candle, and softly let himself out of the room."
In the darkness Noll stood upon the bridge at the end of the Boule
"Miche, the pleasant highway of youth. But he now knew no indecisions."
He realized that his mere intellect had led him into the veriest
pedantries--had nearly led him into irretrievable blunders. He saw that
"man’s highest was rooted in the body, that heaven was no fantastic"
"dream, but here and now for the winning on this healthy brown earth."
"He had been letting it slip by him, whilst he dreamed of pasteboard"
nothingnesses.
He realized that the emotion felt was nearer to the centre of life than
"all thought. He cast from him the devil of mere intellect, and it went"
"out of him demurely into the darkness, like some poor thin-souled nun,"
who crushes down into barrenness the splendid emotions of the life
"within her which are her very godhood, in fantastic hope to win an"
"eternity of vague bliss, she who by the very act shows her inability"
"to enjoy bliss--for, heaven and hell and all the eternities shall"
yield her no such bliss as the dear human loves may do--the æons of
immortality shall never bring her the delight that she might know in an
hour of a lover’s embrace or the dear touch of a nestling child at her
lean breasts.
"As the awakened youth stood there, the black night passed over the edge"
"he was, notwithstanding, a rather notable figure as he stood looking"
gravely and thoughtfully downwards; there was something very graceful in
"his attitude, and in the carriage of his head, and his features were so"
remarkably handsome that Lady Romaine turned her eyes upon him many
"times, and exerted all her artifices to draw him back to her immediate"
"neighbourhood.  But he was perfectly unconscious of this, not hearing"
"the chatter which went on about him, lost in some reverie of his own,"
which brought a peculiar dreamy softness into his eyes.
"Lord Sandford, following the direction of Geraldine’s glance, looked at"
"this motionless figure, then back at the girl, and laughed."
"""Lady Geraldine, pray permit me to present to you my newly-made friend"
"and comrade, Sir Grey Dumaresq, who, I doubt not, is dying to make his"
"bow to so fair a lady."""
"She flashed him a glance half merry, half reproachful, and he suddenly"
"laid his hand upon his lips, a laugh rolling from them hearty and full."
"""I’ faith I had forgot!  How shall I teach my rebel tongue a new"
"language?  But Sir Grey will atone for all my defects.—Here is a lady,"
"if you will believe it, O friend, who loves not the sugared and honeyed"
"phrase of adulation, but seeks in all things truth, virtue, and I know"
not what else beside.  It is whispered to me that she is a mistress of
"all the _belles lettres_, and perchance a poetess herself."""
"""Nay, my lord,"" answered Geraldine, with a blush and a smile—""only one"
"who loves the poesy of those who have lived before, and left their"
"treasures for us who come after, and would fain drink in all the beauty"
"of their thoughts and of their lives."""
"Lord Sandford good-naturedly yielded his seat to Grey, whose sensitive"
"“Then I’ll go,” Frank decided. “I don’t like the idea of sitting around"
"the camp and letting you boys have all the fun. Besides,” he continued,"
"“if it is the messenger who is making the signals, you’ll need all the"
help you can get.”
"“Come running, then!” advised Jack, starting down the slope."
"As the reader will remember, the signal observed by the boys had been"
"built by Jimmie in the hope of attracting the attention of Ned, or of"
"Norman, the boy who had made himself so conspicuous that morning. In"
building the fires and creating the columns of dense white smoke by
"heaping on green boughs, the boy had not given serious thought to the"
effect his action might have on his chums.
"In fact, at the time of his leaving camp, he had not fully decided what"
"course to pursue, and for this reason he had not informed the boys of"
his intention to set a signal for the benefit of the mysterious Boy
"Scout. Even at the time of making the signal, he had no idea that it"
would actually draw his three chums away from the camp.
"He might have known what the effect would be, but, though he did stop to"
"consider for a moment, he did not take in the whole situation. Jimmie"
"usually acted on impulse, and so the signal lifted to the sky without"
any explanation having been made to the Boy Scouts who were certain to
see it.
It will be remembered that when Jimmie descended from the elevation
where the fires had been built he did so in order to hasten in the
direction of a smoke signal which he saw to the north. The result of
this was that he was out of the vicinity of the fires long before the
boys reached that point.
"The ledge was narrow, and as the bunch clung together where the leader"
"and his opponent still struggled, one of them slipped over the edge of"
the declivity and started downward. Naturally he caught hold of the
"first object within his reach, and this happened to be the shoe of the"
"outlaw nearest to him. This man, in turn, caught another, and two more"
"tried to pull up the falling ones, with the result that in about half a"
minute five of the half-breeds were rolling and tumbling heels over head
down the rocky slope.
"The boys were not far out of their path, but they managed to elude the"
downrushing bodies as they swung by. Notwithstanding the gravity of the
"situation, the boys shrieked with laughter as the clumsy fellows went"
"tumbling down, uttering vicious curses at the boys, at the mountain and"
at each other.
“I wish I had a gun now!” shouted Frank.
As he spoke a formidable weapon which seemed to be half revolver and
"half sawed-off shotgun, flew out of the hands of one of the involuntary"
acrobats and landed against Frank’s side with a great thud.
Frank seized the weapon and backed away. By this time the leader was on
his feet shouting wrathful commands for the boys to return.
"“Easy, now,” Frank shouted, moving away to the south. “If any of you"
"ginks lift a finger until we get into the timber line, I’ll empty this"
load of slugs into the thick of you.”
"The leader, more daring than the others, sprang down the slope, his"
great boots scattering fragments of rock and sending them hurtling down
upon the heads of the half-breeds below. Frank was about to fire when
the man lost his balance and joined the procession of those making for
the creative energy.... The great artist works _in_ and _through_ and
_from_ moral ideas; his works are indirectly a criticism of life. He
"is moral without having a moral. The moment a moral obtrudes itself,"
that moment he begins to fall from grace as an artist.... The great
distinction of Art is that it aims to see life steadily and to see it
whole.... It affords the one point of view whence the world appears
harmonious and complete.”
"It would seem, then, from this passage, that it is of _moral_"
importance to put things dramatically.
In Froebel's “Mother Play” he demonstrates the educational value of
"stories, emphasising that their highest use consists in their ability"
"to enable the child, through _suggestion_, to form a pure and noble"
idea of what a man may be or do. The sensitiveness of a child's mind
"is offended if the moral is forced upon him, but if he absorbs it"
"unconsciously, he has received its influence for all time."
To me the idea of pointing out the moral of the story has always seemed
as futile as tying a flower on to a stalk instead of letting the flower
"_grow out_ of the stalk, as Nature intended. In the first case, the"
"flower, showy and bright for the moment, soon fades away. In the second"
"instance, it develops slowly, coming to perfection in fulness of time"
because of the life within.
"X.--Lastly, the element to avoid is _that which rouses emotions which"
cannot be translated into action_.
"Mr. Earl Barnes, to whom all teachers owe a debt of gratitude for the"
"inspiration of his education views, insists strongly on this point."
"The sole effect of such stories is to produce a form of hysteria,"
"fortunately short-lived, but a waste of force which might be directed"
stood beside Socrates. And Beatus Rhenanus devotes to him a life of
earnest admiration and helpfulness that was to prove of much more value
than these exuberant panegyrics. There is an element of national
exaltation in this German enthusiasm for Erasmus: it is the violently
stimulated mood into which Luther's word will fall anon.
"The other nations also chimed in with praise, though a little later and"
"a little more soberly. Colet and Tunstall promise him immortality,"
"Étienne Poncher exalts him above the celebrated Italian humanists,"
Germain de Brie declares that French scholars have ceased reading any
"authors but Erasmus, and Budaeus announces that all Western Christendom"
resounds with his name.
This increase of glory manifested itself in different ways. Almost every
"year the rumour of his death was spread abroad, malignantly, as he"
"himself thinks. Again, all sorts of writings were ascribed to him in"
"which he had no share whatever, amongst others the _Epistolae obscurorum"
virorum_.
"But, above all, his correspondence increased immensely. The time was"
long since past when he asked More to procure him more correspondents.
"Letters now kept pouring in to him, from all sides, beseeching him to"
reply. A former pupil laments with tears that he cannot show a single
note written by Erasmus. Scholars respectfully sought an introduction
"from one of his friends, before venturing to address him. In this"
"respect Erasmus was a man of heroic benevolence, and tried to answer"
"what he could, although so overwhelmed by letters every day that he"
"hardly found time to read them. 'If I do not answer, I seem unkind,'"
"says Erasmus, and that thought was intolerable."
"We should bear in mind that letter-writing, at that time, occupied more"
"or less the place of the newspaper at present, or rather of the literary"
"wildly, a bell in terror. Yellow gleams streaked the fretted waters,"
"and again the trumpet challenged the dark walls, like the cry of a"
sea-bird driven by the storm.
The duke and Francesco looked meaningly at each other. The sound
needed no words to christen it; they knew that the Pisans had
"attacked. They heard the roar and the cries from the rampart, the"
cataractine thunder of a distant battle.
"Pushing on more swiftly as the woods thinned, the din grew more"
"definite, more human, more sinister in detail. It stirred the blood,"
"challenged the courage, racked conjecture with the infinite chaos it"
portended. Victory and despair were trammelled up together in its
sullen roar; life and death seemed to swell it with the wind sound of
"their wings. It was stupendous, chaotic, a tempest cry of steel and"
passions inflamed.
The duke's face kindled to the sound as he shouted to his men to
"gallop on. Yet another furlong, and the spectral trunks dwindled, the"
"sombre boughs seemed to mingle with the clouds, while gray, indefinite"
"before them, engulfing the lightnings of heaven, loomed the great"
"swell of the Tyrrhene, dark and restless under the thunderclouds, that"
came nearer and nearer. Ghostly the plains of Torre del Greco
"stretched towards the Promontory of Circé, and, solitary and"
"impregnable, the Castello of Astura rose upon its chalk-cliffs, white"
in the lightnings which hissed around its summit.
"The duke's men had come up, forming a wide semicircle around the"
"leaders. At their feet opened a deep ravine, leading into the plain;"
"half a furlong beyond, although it seemed less than a lance's throw"
"across, rose the castle of the Frangipani, washed by the waves of the"
"Tyrrhene. The Pisans had attacked the southern acclivity, and the"
The inhabitants of the street were divided into two parties according
"to their sympathies.  One was in favour of Kuvalda, who was thought ""a"
"good soldier, clever, and courageous,"" the other was convinced of the"
"fact that the teacher was ""superior"" to Kuvalda.  The latter's admirers"
"were those who were known to be drunkards, thieves, and murderers, for"
whom the road from beggary to prison was inevitable.  But those who
"respected the teacher were men who still had expectations, still hoped"
"for better things, who were eternally occupied with nothing, and who"
were nearly always hungry.
The nature of the teacher's and Kuvalda's relations towards the street
may be gathered from the following:
Once in the eating-house they were discussing the resolution passed by
"the Corporation regarding the main street, viz., that the inhabitants"
"were to fill up the pits and ditches in the street, and that neither"
manure nor the dead bodies of domestic animals should be used for the
"purpose, but only broken tiles, etc., from the ruins of other houses."
"""Where am I going to get these same broken tiles and bricks?  I could"
"not get sufficient bricks together to build a hen-house,"" plaintively"
"said Mokei Anisimoff, a man who hawked kalaches (a sort of white bread)"
which were baked by his wife.
"""Where can you get broken bricks and lime rubbish?  Take bags with you,"
and go and remove them from the Corporation buildings. They are so old
"that they are of no use to anyone, and you will thus be doing two good"
"deeds; firstly, by repairing the main street; and secondly, by adorning"
"the city with a new Corporation building."""
"""If you want horses get them from the Lord Mayor, and take his three"
"daughters, who seem quite fit for harness. Then destroy the house of"
other.
"A city watchman, with a pipe in his mouth, looked drowsily and frowsily"
out of the town-hall or _ayuntamiento_. He was retreating again to his
settle when it suddenly struck him that this intruder had paid no duty
"upon her milk and firewood. True, he was not the functionary appointed"
"by law to receive the tax; but since he was on the spot, and for lack of"
"other constituted the representative of civic state, he felt he must"
undertake the duty.
"So, laying aside his pipe and seizing his halberd and cocked hat, he"
sallied grumblingly forth to intercept the bold contravener of municipal
"laws. But the active limbs of the old gipsy, the lightened udders of the"
"she-goats, and the ass with his meek nose pointed homeward, took the"
party out of the village gate before the man in authority could
over-take La Giralda.
"Soon, therefore, the roofs of San Ildefonso and the white palace again"
lay beneath her as the gipsy reascended by her track of the morning. So
long had she occupied in her various adventures that the evening shadows
were already lengthening when she returned to the corrie where the party
had spent in restful indolence the burden and heat of the day. The
"Sergeant had not yet arrived, and La Giralda delayed her story till he"
should give her leave to speak. For not even to the gipsies of the
Guadarrama was José Maria a greater personage than Sergeant Cardono to
La Giralda of Sevilla.
"In the mean time she busied herself, with Concha's help, in preparing"
"the evening meal, as quick upon her legs as if she had done nothing but"
lounge in the shade all day. It was almost sundown when the Sergeant
"came in, dropping unannounced over the precipice as if from the clouds."
"stood ready to cast off--was that he once followed the sea, but in more"
recent years lived by fishing up sponges and at times supplying shark
meat to the poorer quarter of Key West. The carcass of a water fowl tied
"to his boat, while he occupied himself with sponges, would sometimes"
"attract a shark; then he would strip, take a knife in his teeth, and"
dive.
"I glanced at Gates, but saw no incredulity in his face."
"In another hour, at nearly dusk, Key West had grown small and finally"
"sank below the horizon, leaving only its three skeleton-like towers"
"standing against the sky--standing erect with all nerves strained,"
"watch-dogs of the darkening sea; ears cocked, to catch a distressed cry"
from some waif out in the mysterious night.
Looking back along our wake I imagined the big black man standing as we
"had left him on the dock, gazing after us with patient regret; and I was"
"glad to have given him the handful of coins at parting, little dreaming"
how many times that loaf upon the water would come floating in to me.
Monsieur Dragot revealed himself more and more to our astonished eyes as
we sat that night on deck. He had been a professor in the University of
"Bucharest, and hinted at an intimate entente with the reigning house of"
"Azuria. Besides being versed in many sciences, including medicine, he"
spoke seven languages and read several others. But these things were
"drawn from him by Tommy's artful questions, rather than being said in"
"boastfulness. Indeed, Monsieur was charmingly, almost touchily, modest."
"Of his business in Havana he gave no hint, yet this happened to be the"
one piece of information that Tommy seemed most possessed to find out.
"""You'll be in Cuba long, Monsieur?"" he asked."
"prince of cooks. Yet who, by the wildest stretch of fancy, could have"
contemplated tight places or dangers as the trim yacht rode peacefully
at anchor an eighth of a mile off our dock at smiling Miami? To every
man aboard such things as death and the shedding of blood had ceased
"with the armistice, and Gates would have taken his oath, were it asked"
"of him, that our course pointed only toward laughing waters, blue skies,"
and emerald shore-lines.
Early next morning we were under way when Tommy pounded on my stateroom
"door, challenging me to a dip overboard. There was a glorious joy in his"
"voice, as far reaching as reveille, that found response in the cockles"
"of my heart. Gates, never happier than when standing beneath stretched"
"canvas, hove-to as he saw us dash stark naked up the companionway stairs"
"and clear the rail head-first, but he laid by only while we had our"
splash and continued the course southward the moment our hands grasped
the gangway.
"""We're cruising, not swimming,"" he said bluntly, as we reached the deck."
"""But I'll say this,"" he called after us, ""you're both in about as fine"
"condition as men get to be. I'll give _that_ to the Army!"" Which was"
"true, except for the fact that I might have been pronounced overtrained."
"Tommy and I were as hard as nails, our skin glowed like satin--but,"
"better than this, his spirit was quick with the love of living, charged"
with a contagion that had already begun to touch my own.
Half an hour later he mumbled through a crumbling biscuit:
"""If Pete ever cooked better grub than this it was in a previous"
"incarnation!"""
"""Man achieves his greatest triumph but once in life,"" I admitted. ""It's"
"self-evident."""
appears to have had a common origin with it. We may conceive that
the primordial fishes not only had gills used in breathing air
"dissolved in water, but also developed a saclike pouch off the"
gullet. This sac evolved along two distinct lines. On the line of
the ancestry of most modern fishes its duct was closed and it
became the swim bladder used in flotation and balancing. On
"another line of descent it was left open, air was swallowed into"
"it, and it developed into the rudimentary lung of the dipnoans and"
into the more perfect lungs of the amphibians and other air-
breathing vertebrates.
One of the ancient dipnoans is illustrated in Figure 300. Some of
"the members of this order were, like the ostracoderms, cased in"
"armor, but their higher rank is shown by their powerful jaws and"
by other structures. Some of these armored fishes reached twenty-
five feet in length and six feet across the head. They were the
tyrants of the Devonian seas.
GANOIDS. These take their name from their enameled plates or
scales of bone. The few genera now surviving are the descendants
of the tribes which swarmed in the Devonian seas. A restoration of
"one of a leading order, the FRINGE-FINNED ganoids, is given in"
"Figure 301. The side fins, which correspond to the limbs of the"
"higher vertebrates, are quite unlike those of most modern fishes."
"Their rays, instead of radiating from a common base, fringe a"
central lobe which contains a cartilaginous axis. The teeth of the
Devonian ganoids show a complicated folded structure.
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DEVONIAN FISHES. THE NOTOCHORD IS
"PERSISTENT. The notochord is a continuous rod of cartilage, or"
"gristle, which in the embryological growth of vertebrate animals"
supports the spinal nerve cord before the formation of the
not to be shaken. It may be well imagined that the feeding of my
chauffeur during the months to come loomed up as one of my minor
anxieties.
"From Pindi I went to Quetta by train, my car, with the native"
"chauffeur having gone direct to the then rail-head at Nushki, in the"
North of Indo-Baluchistan.
"At Quetta I laid in a store of petrol, spare tyres, a few personal"
"necessities, reported to General Grover for orders and information,"
"and then proceeded to Nushki; which place was reached, and the car"
"picked up, on, if I remember rightly, the 25th of February."
This day in Nushki was to prove the last in a civilised town for
many months to come. The look of the country lying before us so
"intimidated my native chauffeur that he came to me, a short time"
"before we were due to start, with a countenance torn with grief and,"
"with lamentations and protestations of sorrow, told me that both his"
"father and mother were ill, and that it was vital for him to return"
and succour them. As I had been in two minds as to the advisability
"of taking the rascal with me, this sign of the white feather at the"
"very outset at once decided the point, and I gave him to understand"
that he could go and bury as many of his relations as he pleased.
With a countenance swiftly transformed to cheerfulness he left me.
Just before starting a wire was handed in from a high political
official at Quetta informing me that the Baluch Raiders had already
"cut our lines of communication, were right across my path, and he"
"advised, if not ordered, me not to proceed."
"However, as explicit military instructions were to endeavour to reach"
"Robat (near the Koh-i-Maliksia), a hill at which the Baluch, Afghan"
"the fibula. While being carried off the field, a second bullet"
(Lee-Metford) entered immediately outside the left posterior
"superior iliac spine, perforated the pelvis, and emerged 1-1/2"
inch within the left anterior superior spine. The patient was
then put down and left on the field ten hours; later he was
"carried to shelter for the night, and arrived at Orange River"
"on the second day. He suffered with some pain in the abdomen,"
"especially during the journey in the train, but was not sick;"
the bowels were confined.
"When seen on the third day at 6 P.M., some pain was complained"
"of in the abdomen, which moved freely in the upper part, but"
was motionless below the umbilicus. No distension. Tenderness
around wound of exit and some rigidity. The bowels had acted
"four times during the day; motions loose, dark brown, and"
"containing no blood. Face not anxious, eyes bright, temperature"
"102°. Pulse 96, regular, and of good strength. Tongue moist and"
little furred.
"The abdomen was opened at 5 A.M. on the fourth day, as the"
"local signs had become more pronounced, and the patient had"
passed a restless night in great abdominal pain. A local
"incision was chosen, as the wound was presumably in the sigmoid"
flexure. The sigmoid flexure was adherent to the abdominal wall
"opposite the wound of exit, and a dark ecchymosed patch was"
"found, but no perforation could be detected. Foul pus and gas"
"escaped freely from the pelvis, but no wound of the large bowel"
could be discovered here. On enlarging the incision upwards
"three openings were found in a coil of jejunum, probably that"
about five feet from the duodenal junction usually provided
with the longest mesentery. No fourth opening could be found.
"The openings were circular, about 1/3 inch in diameter, clean"
certainly having no prevision she would not recross the Channel for
"four years and four months, and not see Dover again for five or six"
years.
British war vessels were off the port and inside it. But there was
not much excitement or crowding on the Ostende steamer or any of
"those sensational precautions against being torpedoed or mined,"
which soon afterwards oppressed the spirits of cross-Channel
passengers. Vessels arriving from Belgium were full of passengers of
"the superior refugee class, American and British tourists, or"
wealthy people who though they preferred living abroad had begun to
think that the Continent just now was not very healthy and England
the securest refuge for those who wished to be comfortable.
"Vivie being a good sailor and economical by nature, never thought of"
securing a cabin for the four or five hours' sea-journey. She sat on
the upper deck with her scanty luggage round her. A nice-looking
"young man who had a cabin the door of which he locked, was walking"
up and down on the level deck and scrutinizing her discreetly. And
when at last they worked their way backwards into Ostende--the
"harbour was full of vessels, chiefly mine-dredgers and torpedo"
boats--she noticed the obsequiousness of the steamer people and how
he left the ship before any one else.
"She followed soon afterwards, having little encumbrances in the way"
of luggage; but she observed that he just showed a glimpse of some
paper and was allowed to walk straight through the Douane with
"unexamined luggage, and so, on to the Brussels train."
But she herself had little difficulty. She put her hand luggage--she
"had no other--into a first-class compartment, and having an hour and"
a half to wait walked out to look at Ostende.
In any case if India need to make any contribution to the world it
should be as great as the hope they cherished for her. Let them not
"talk of the glories of the past till they have secured for her, her true"
place among the intellectual nations of the world. Let them find out how
she had fallen from her high estate and ruthlessly put an end to all
that self satisfied and little-minded vanity which had been the cause of
their fatal weakness. What was it that stood in her way? Was her mind
paralysed by weak superstitious fears? That was not so; for her great
"thinkers, the Rishis, always stood for freedom of intellect and while"
"Galileo was imprisoned and Bruno burnt for their opinions, they boldly"
declared that even the Vedas were to be rejected if they did not conform
to truth. They urged in favour of persistent efforts for the discovery
"of physical causes yet unknown, since to them nothing was extra-physical"
but merely mysterious because of a hitherto unascertained cause. Were
they afraid that the march of knowledge was dangerous to true faith? Not
so. For their knowledge and religion were one.
These are the hopes that animate us. For there is something in the Hindu
culture which is possessed of extraordinary latent strength by which it
has resisted the ravages of time and the destructive changes which have
swept over the earth. And indeed a capacity to endure through infinite
transformations must be innate in that mighty civilisation which has
"seen the intellectual culture of the Nile Valley, of Assyria and of"
Babylon war and wane and disappear and which to-day gazes on the future
with the same invincible faith with which it met the past.

[Illustration: A PERFECT BUNCH OF BANANAS]
The towns of Bocas del Toro and Almirante are maintained almost entirely
by the banana trade. Other companies than the United Fruit raise and buy
"bananas here, but it was the initiative of the leading company which by"
systematic work put the prosperity of this section on a firm basis.
Lands that a few years ago were miasmatic swamps are now improved and
"planted with bananas. Over 4,000,000 bunches were exported from this"
"plantation in 1911, and 35,000 acres are under cultivation there. A"
narrow gauge railway carries bananas exclusively. The great white
steamships sail almost daily carrying away little except bananas. The
money spent over the counters of the stores in Bocas del Toro comes from
natives who have no way of getting money except by raising bananas and
"selling them, mostly to the United Fruit Company. It has its"
"competitors, but it invented the business and has brought it to its"
"highest development. At this Panama town, and for that matter in the"
"other territories it controls, the company has established and enforces"
the sanitary reforms which Col. Gorgas applied so effectively in Colon
and Panama. Its officials proudly claim that they were the pioneers in
inventing and applying the methods which have conquered tropical
diseases. At Bocas del Toro the company maintains a hospital which lacks
"nothing of the equipment of the Ancon Hospital, though of course not so"
large. It has successfully adopted the commissary system established on
the Canal Zone. Labor has always been the troublesome factor in
industrial enterprises in Central America. The Fruit Company has joined
with the Isthmian Commission in the systematic endeavor to keep labor
contented and therefore efficient.

"George crossed London Bridge, attired in his Quaker disguise, and made"
"his way to Deptford, where he preached in the streets. From Deptford"
"he followed the river by easy stages to Sheerness, where he lodged nearly"
"a week, awaiting a boat that would answer his purpose. Had he attempted"
"to board a vessel, he would have been seized and examined; therefore his"
"plan was to grow violent in his preaching, and, if possible, provoke the"
authorities to place him on board one of the outgoing crafts; that being
a favorite method of the king's men in getting rid of the too blatant
fanatics in Sheerness.
"The Dutch sea captains were fanatics almost to a man, and the exiled"
exhorters found them always willing to help their persecuted brethren of
the faith.
And so it happened with George in Sheerness. He was on the dock exhorting
"vehemently against the evils of the time, laying great stress on the"
wickedness of the king and denouncing the vileness of the court. Two of
"the king's officers tried to silence him, but failing, ordered him to"
leave England by a certain Dutch boat then waiting in the harbor with its
"pennant up. He protested and struggled, but at last was forced aboard,"
"raving against those godless Balaamites, the clergy of the Established"
"Church, who, with the devil, he declared, were behind his persecution."
So well did George play his part that a collection was taken up among the
passengers of the Dutch boat to help the good man so vilely put upon.
"There was a sweet bit of irony in the fact, learned afterwards, that the"
officers who forced George aboard the Dutch ship were at Sheerness for
the purpose of winning the two hundred pounds reward offered for his
capture.
The goodness of God occasionally takes a whimsical form.
A horde of civilians was thronging the main street of the village. Old
men and women were carrying all that was left to them of their property
on their backs. Others were pushing wheelbarrows heaped up with clothes
and household utensils. Girls were carrying heavy bundles under their
"arms and dragging tired, tearful children along. White-faced, sorrowful"
"mothers were carrying peevish babies. Great wagons, loaded with"
"furniture and bedding, and whole families sitting on top, were drawn by"
"lank and bony horses. A little cart, with a pallid, aged woman cowering"
"inside, was drawn painfully along by a white-haired man. They passed by"
"us in the gathering gloom, and there seemed to be no end to these"
"straggling multitudes of ruined, homeless people who were wandering"
westwards to escape the disaster that threatened to engulf us all.
The eastern sky flickered with vivid gun-flashes and scintillated with
brilliant shell-bursts. The night was full of rustling noises and sullen
"thunder-claps, while a more distant roaring and rumbling seemed to break"
against some invisible shore like the breakers of a stormy sea.
We retired to our huts and tents. Soon after lights-out the Police
Corporal came round and shouted:
"""Parade at 4.45 to-morrow morning in marching order."""
The tumult increased as though the surge were coming nearer and nearer.
Shells of small calibre passed overhead with a prolonged whistle and
burst with a hardly audible report. The thunder of bigger explosions
shook the huts and caused the ground to tremble.
As I woke the next morning the din of the cannonade broke in upon my
"senses with a sudden impact. Rumbling, thundering, bellowing, rushing,"
"whistling, and whining, the tumult seemed all around and above us."
Sudden flashes lit up the whole camp so that for fractions of seconds
CHAPTER XX
"WHEREIN ""FINGERLESS"" FRASER RETURNS"
"Big George had lost no time, and already the tow-boats were overboard,"
while a raft of timber was taking form alongside the ship. As soon as
"it was completed, it was loaded with crates and boxes and paraphernalia"
"of all sorts, then towed ashore as the tide served. Another took its"
"place, and another and another. All that night the torches flared and"
the decks drummed to a ceaseless activity. In the morning Boyd sent a
"squad of fishermen ashore to clear the ground for his buildings, and"
all day new rafts of lumber and material helped to increase the pile at
the water's edge.
"His early training as an engineer now stood him in good stead, for a"
thousand details demanded expert supervision; but he was as completely
at home at this work as was Big George in his own part of the
"undertaking, and it was not long before order began to emerge from what"
seemed a hopeless chaos. Never did men have more willing hands to do
their bidding than did he and George; and when a week later _The
"Juliet_, with Willis Marsh on board, came to anchor, the bunk-houses"
"were up and peopled, while the new site had become a beehive of"
activity.
"The mouth of the Kalvik River is several miles wide, yet it contains"
"but a small anchorage suitable for deep-draught ships, the rest of the"
harbor being underlaid with mud-bars and tide-flats over which none but
small boats may pass; and as the canneries are distributed up and down
"the stream for a considerable distance, it is necessary to transport"
all supplies to and from the ships by means of tugs and lighters. Owing
"to the narrowness of the channel, _The Juliet_ came to her moorings not"
“From the above one might conclude that cleanliness and modesty are not
"the rule among the Chocos. As a matter of fact, the first thing they do"
"in the morning is to jump into the near-by river, and these ablutions"
are repeated several times in the course of the day.
"“The kitchen utensils are always thoroughly washed before using, and,"
"contrary to our former experience, their simple dishes, prepared mostly"
"in our presence, looked almost always inviting. During our stay among"
these good people nothing was noticed that would hurt the most delicate
sense of decency.
"“The Chocoes seem to be exclusively monogamist, and both parents"
"surround their babies with tender care, being mindful, however, to"
prepare them early for the hard and struggling life ahead of them.
"Small bows and arrows, dexterously handled by tiny hands, are the"
"favorite toys of the boys, while the girls spend more time in the water"
"playing with miniature dugouts, washing, and swimming. The only dolls"
"seen among them were imported ones, and they seemed to be as much in"
favor among grown women as among children. These latter go naked until
"they are about five years old, when the girls receive a large"
"handkerchief to be used as a ‘paruma’, or skirt, and the boys a strip of"
some old maternal dress for an ‘antia’ or clout.
"“The Chocoes are very industrious. During the dry spells their life, of"
"course, is an out-of-door one, planting and watching their crops,"
"hunting, fishing and canoeing. But when the heavy rains come they stay"
"at home, weaving baskets of all kinds--a work in which the women are"
"proficient--making ropes and hammocks, carving dishes, mortars, stools,"
and other objects out of tree trunks”.
In the country which will be traversed by the Panama-David Railroad are
"Marsh's full, red lips went pallid with rage as he said ""Then it is to"
"be war, eh?"""
"""Suit yourself."" Boyd pointed to the shore. ""Your boatman is waiting"
"for you."""
As Marsh made his way to the water's edge he stumbled like a blind man;
"his lips were bleeding where his small, sharp teeth had bitten them,"
and he panted like an hysterical woman.
"During the next fortnight the sailing-ships began to assemble, standing"
in under a great spread of canvas to berth close alongside the two
"steamships; for, once the ice had moved north, there was no further"
"obstacle to their coming, and the harbor was soon livened with puffing"
"tugs, unwieldy lighters, and fleets of smaller vessels. Where, but a"
"short time before, the brooding silence had been undisturbed save for"
"the plaint of wolf-dogs and the lazy voices of natives, a noisy army"
was now at work. The bustle of a great preparation arose; languid
smoke-wreaths began to unfurl above the stacks of the canneries; the
stamp and clank of tin-machines re-echoed; hammer and saw maintained a
never-ceasing hubbub. Down at the new plant scows were being launched
while yet the pitch was warm on their seams; buildings were rising
"rapidly, and a crew had gone up the river to get out a raft of piles."
"On the morning after the arrival of the last ship, Emerson and his"
companions were treated to a genuine surprise. Cherry had come down to
the site as usual--she could not let a day go by without visiting the
"place--and Clyde, after a tardy breakfast, had just come ashore. They"
"were watching Big George direct the launching of a scow, when all of a"
"sudden they heard a familiar voice behind them cry, cheerfully:"
"But the finest growth of the new literature, it turns out, is due to"
"culture-contacts--an unexpected confirmation, in a most unlikely"
"quarter, of a general principle arrived at on other data. The vigilant"
"study of our own day has detected, standing out from the early"
"Icelandic literature, ""a group of poems which possess the very qualities"
"of high imagination, deep pathos, fresh love of nature, passionate"
"dramatic power, and noble simplicity of language, which [other] Icelandic"
poetry lacks. The solution is that these poems do not belong to Iceland at
"all. They are the poetry of the 'Western Islands'""[688]--that is, the"
"poetry of the meeting and mixing of the ""Celtic"" and Scandinavian stocks"
"in Ireland and the Hebrides--the former already much mixed, and"
proportionally rich in intellectual variations. It was in this area that
"""a magnificent school of poetry arose, to which we owe works that for"
power and beauty can be paralleled in no Teutonic language till centuries
"after their date.... This school, which is totally distinct from the"
"Icelandic, ran its own course apart and perished before the thirteenth"
"century.""[689]"
"Compare Messrs. Vigfusson and Powell's _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_,"
"1883, vol. i, Introd. pp. lxii, lxiii; and, as regards the old"
"Irish civilisation, the author's _Saxon and Celt_, pp. 127, 128,"
131-33.
"The theory of Celtic influence, though established in its"
"essentials, is not perfectly consistent as set forth in the"
"_Britannica_ article. Thus, while the Celticised literature is"
"remarked for ""noble simplicity of language,"" the true Icelandic,"
"primarily like the Old English, is said to develop a ""complexity of"
"structure and ornament, an elaborate mythological and enigmatical"
"phraseology, and a regularity of rhyme, assonance, luxuriance,"
"quantity, and syllabification which it caught up from the Latin and"
"_Celtic_ poets."" Further, while the Celticised school is described"
"the appreciation of the best qualities of the hero: his modesty, his"
"dignity, his reticence, his courage and his constancy: he seems to"
combine all the qualities of the best soldier with those of the best
"civilian, without the more obvious qualities which generally attract"
"first. As for the love-story, we must not _expect_ any child to see"
"its tenderness and beauty, though the individual child may intuitively"
"appreciate these qualities, but it is not what we wish for or work for"
at this period of child-life.
This method could be applied to various stories. I have chosen the _Tin
Soldier_ because of its dramatic qualities and because it is marked off
(probably quite unconsciously on the part of Andersen) into periods
which correspond to the child's development.
In Eugene Field's exquisite little poem of “The Dinkey Bird” we find
"the objects familiar to the child in _unusual_ places, so that some"
imagination is needed to realise that “big red sugar-plums are clinging
to the cliffs beside that sea”; but the introduction of the fantastic
bird and the soothing sound of the Amfalula Tree are new and delightful
"sensations, quite out of the child's personal experience."
Another such instance is to be found in Mrs. W. K. Clifford's story of
"Master Willie. The abnormal behaviour of familiar objects, such as a"
"doll, leads from the ordinary routine to the paths of adventure. This"
"story is to be found in a little book called “Very Short Stories,” a"
most interesting collection for teachers and children.
"We now come to the second element we should seek in material--namely,"
"the element of the unusual, which we have already anticipated in the"
story of the Tin Soldier.
This element is necessary in response to the demand of the child who
"Everywhere the smooth dark trunks converged upon one another, sending"
up a tangle of boughs that glittered in the soft sheen of the
"sunlight. Withered bracken stood in thin silence, and here and there a"
dead bough lay like a snake with its head raised to strike.
"The silence was immense, and yet it was a stillness that suggested"
"sounds. It resembled the silence of a huge cavern, out of which came"
strange whisperings; innumerable crepitations seemed to come from the
"dead leaves. Francesco fancied he could hear the trees breathing, and"
from afar he caught the wild note of a bird.
The sun was low when they came at last to the edge of the forest and
saw a hill rise steeply against the sky. It was covered with silver
"birches, whose stems looked like white threads in the level light of"
the setting sun. And rising against the sky-line from amidst the
fretwork of birch-boughs Francesco saw the well-remembered outlines of
the ruined tower wherein he had spent a memorable night.
"The valley before them was flooded with golden light, and, as they"
"crossed it, Francesco felt a curious desire for physical pain,"
"something fierce and tangible to struggle with, to drown the"
ever-pulsing memory of the woman who had gone from him.
As the dusk deepened they went scrambling up the hillside amid the
"birches, whose white stems glimmered upwards into the blue gloom of"
"the twilight. Francesco's thoughts climbed ahead of him, hurrying to"
deal with the unknown dangers that might be awaiting him. He had to
"dismount, pull his steed after him; but the scramble upwards gave him"
the sense of effort and struggle that he needed. It was like scaling a
"wall to come to grips with an enemy, whose wild eyes and sword-points"
showed between the crenelations.
more frequent lightnings he saw that it was drawn and gray.
"""There lies his lair,"" the duke pointed to the white masonry of"
"Astura, as it loomed out of the night, menacing and spectral, as a"
"thunderbolt hissed into the sea, and again lapsed into gloom."
"""Betrayer of God and man,--his hour is at hand!""--"
"The duke's beard fairly bristled as he uttered these words, and he"
gripped the hilt of his sword as if he anticipated a conflict with
"some wild beast of the forest, some mythical monster born of night and"
crime.
Francesco made no reply. He was bowed down beneath the gloom of the
"hour, oppressed with unutterable forebodings. He too had an account to"
"settle: yet, whichever way the tongue inclined in the scales, life"
stretched out from him as a sea at night. He dared not think of
"Ilaria, far away in the convent of San Nicandro by the sea; yet her"
"memory had haunted him all day, knocked at the gates of his"
"consciousness, dominated the hours. Compared with the ever present"
"sense of her loss, all in life seemed utterly trifling, and he longed"
for annihilation only.
Yet a kindred note which he sounded in the duke's soul found him in a
more receptive mood for the latter's confidences; once life had
"seemed good to him; he had thought men heroes, the world a faerie"
"place. Thoughts had changed with time, and that for which he once"
"hungered he now despised. Cursed with perversities, baffled and"
"mocked, the eternal trivialities of life made the soul sink within"
"him. Not all are mild earth, to be smitten and make no moan. There are"
"sea spirits that lash and foam, fire spirits that leap and burn,--was"
he to be cursed because he was born with a soul of fire?
"""Come,--let us go!"" she said gently. ""We twain, made one in love and"
"faith, must hasten to begin our work!--darkness gathers and deepens"
"over the Sorrowful Star,--but we, perchance, with Christ's most holy"
"Blessing, may help to lift the Shadows into Light!"""
*     *     *     *     *     *     *
"Away in a sheltered mountainous retreat, apart from the louder clamor"
"of the world, the Poet and his heavenly companion dwell in peace"
"together. Their love, their wondrous happiness, no mortal language can"
"define,--for spiritual love perfected as far exceeds material passion"
as the steadfast glory of the sun outshines the nickering of an earthly
"taper. Few, very few, there are who recognize, or who attain, such"
"joy,--for men chiefly occupy themselves with the SEMBLANCES of things,"
and therefore fail to grasp all high realities. Perishable
"beauty,--perishable fame,--these are mere appearances; imperishable"
"Worth is the only positive and lasting good, and in the search for"
"imperishable Worth alone, the seeker must needs encounter Angels"
unawares!
But for those whose pleasure it is to doubt and deny all spiritual life
"and being, the history of Theos Alwyn can be disposed of with much"
"languid ease and cold logic, as a foolish chimera scarce worth"
"narrating. Practically viewed, there is nothing wonderful in it, since"
it can all be traced to a powerful exertion of magnetic skill. Tranced
"into a dream bewilderment by the arts of the mystic Chaldean,"
"Heliobas,--tricked into visiting the Field of Ardath, what more likely"
"than that a real earth-born maiden, trained to her part, should have"
"met the dreamer there, and, with the secret aid of the hermit Elezar,"
continued his strange delusion? What more fitting as a sequel to the
"whole, than that the same maiden should have been sent to him again in"
"the great Rhine Cathedral, to complete the deception and satisfy his"
seemed a laudable purpose--that is if hanging is ever laudable--but the
Panama officials are quite as determined to keep the wheels of their
criminal law moving. The proprietors of machines like to see them
run--which is one of the reasons why too many battleships are not good
for a nation.

"To return, however, to the statistics of the Zone. Its population is"
"shifting, of course, and varies somewhat in its size according to the"
extent to which labor is in demand. The completion of a part of the work
"occasionally reduces the force. In January, 1912, the total population"
"of the Zone, according to the official census, was 62,810; at the same"
"time, by the same authority, there were employed by the Canal Commission"
"and the Panama Railroad 36,600 men. These figures emphasize the fact"
"that the working force on the Zone is made up mainly of unmarried men,"
"for a working population of 36,600 would, under the conditions existing"
"in the ordinary American community, give a population of well over"
"100,000. Though statistics are not on hand, and would probably be"
"impossible to compile among the foreign laborers, it is probable that"
not more than one man in four on the Zone is married. From this
situation it results that the average maiden who visits the Zone for a
brief holiday goes rushing home to get her trousseau ready before some
young engineer’s next annual vacation shall give him time to go like a
"young Lochinvar in search of his bride. Indeed, the life of the Zone for"
"many reasons has been singularly conducive to matrimony, and as a game"
"preserve for the exciting sport of husband-hunting, it has been"
unexcelled.

probability of bloodshed is reported to the king. To restore the courage
"of the despairing Gorboduc is now the labour of his counsellors, but the"
later announcement of the death of Ferrex casts him lower than before.
"At this point the Chorus, recalling the murder of a cousin in an earlier"
"generation of the royal race, points, in true Aeschylean fashion, to the"
hatred of an unsated revenge behind this latest blow:
"Thus fatal plagues pursue the guilty race,"
"Whose murderous hand, imbru'd with guiltless blood,"
"Asks vengeance still before the heaven's face,"
With endless mischiefs on the cursed brood.
"_Act IV, Scene 1._--Videna alone, in words of passionate vehemence,"
"laments that she has lived so long to see the death of Ferrex, renounces"
"his brother as no child of hers, and concludes with a threat of"
"vengeance. _Scene 2._--Bowed down with remorse, Porrex makes his defence"
"before the king, pleading the latter's own act, in dividing the kingdom,"
as the initial cause of the ensuing disaster. Before he has been long
"gone from his father's presence, Marcella, a lady-in-waiting, rushes"
"into the room, in wild disorder and grief, to report his murder at his"

"his sleep, he started up and, spying the queen by his side, called to"
"her for help, not crediting that she, his mother, could be his"
"murderess. Again, in tones of solemn warning, the Chorus reminds the"
audience that
"Blood asketh blood, and death must death requite:"
"Jove, by his just and everlasting doom,"
Justly hath ever so requited it.

of the king and queen at the hands of their subjects in revolt against
It was interesting to follow up the way it had come. The earlier news
"about the Dobuans had been brought by the canoes, which had fetched"
"the sago to Gumasila from the main island. A few days later, a canoe"
"from one of the main island villages had arrived here, and on its"
way had passed the Dobuans in Tewara. The news from the Trobriands
in the North had been brought by the Kuyawa canoe which had arrived a
couple of days before in Nabwageta (and whose visit to Nu'agasi I have
"described in Chapter XI). All these movements were not accidental,"
"but connected with the uvalaku expedition. To show the complexity,"
"as well as the precise timing of the various movements and events,"
"so perfectly synchronised over a vast area, in connection with the"
"uvalaku, I have tabulated them in the Chart, facing this page, in"
"which almost all the dates are quite exact, being based on my own"
"observations. This Chart also gives a clear, synoptic picture of an"
"uvalaku, and it will be useful to refer to it, in reading this Chapter."
"In olden days, not less than now, there must have been an ebullition"
"in the inter-tribal relations, and a great stirring from one place"
"to another, whenever an uvalaku Kula was afoot. Thus, news would"
"be carried rapidly over great distances, the movements of the vast"
"numbers of natives would be co-ordinated, and dates fixed. As has been"
"said already, a culminating event of an expedition, in this case the"
"arrival of the Dobuan fleet in Sinaketa, would be always so timed"
"as to happen on, or just before, a full moon, and this would serve"
"as a general orientation for the preliminary movements, such as in"
"this case, the visits of the single canoes."

carefully and tenderly about her.
Concha raised her eyes once to his as he fastened its chain-catch
"beneath her chin, and Rollo, though the starlight dimmed the brilliance"
"of the glance, felt more than repaid. In the background Etienne smiled"
bitterly. The damsel of the green lattice being now left far behind at
"Sarria, he would have had no scruples about returning to his allegiance"
to Concha. But the chill indifference with which his advances were
"received, joined to something softer and more appealing in her eyes when"
"she looked at Rollo, warned the much-experienced youth that he had"
better for the future confine his gallantries to the most common and
ordinary offices of courtesy.
"Yet it was certainly a restraint upon the young Frenchman, who, almost"
"from the day he had been rid of his Jesuit tutor, had made it a maxim to"
make love to the prettiest girl of any company in which he happened to
find himself.
"When, therefore, he found himself reduced to a choice between an"
"inaccessible Concha and La Giralda, riding astride in her leathern"
"leg-gear and sack-like smock, the youth bethought himself of his"
"religious duties which he had latterly somewhat neglected; and, being"
debarred from earthly love by Concha's insensibility and La Giralda's
"ineligibility, it did not cost him a great effort to become for the"
nonce the same Brother Hilario who had left the monastery of Montblanch.
"So, much to the astonishment of John Mortimer, who moved a little"
"farther from him, as being a kind of second cousin of the scarlet woman"
"of the Seven Hills, Etienne pulled out his rosary and, falling on his"
"knees, betook him to his prayers with vigour and a single mind."

In the typical Indian hut there is no furniture on the ground floor
"other than a rough hewn bench, a few pieces of pottery and gourds, iron"
"cooking vessels and what they call a kitchen, which is in fact a large"
"flat box with raised edges, about eight square feet in surface and about"
as high from the floor as a table. This is filled with sand and slabs of
"stone. In it a little fire is built of wood or charcoal, the stones laid"
about the fire support the pots and pans and cooking goes on as gaily as
"in any modern electric kitchen. The contrivance sounds primitive, but I"
have eaten a number of excellent meals cooked on just such an apparatus.

I knew I had come into contact with the truly representative man. His
"opinion and the opinions of those like him, they all made up popular"
opinion. All other opinion was abnormal and negligible. It was with
despair that I realized the hopelessness of my own position and that of
my friends.
The public did not understand the war and did not want to understand it.
It was far away from them and they did not realize the amount of
suffering caused by it. It also brought wealth to many who would
therefore have regretted its sudden termination. This seems a hard thing
"to say, but nevertheless it is true. The so-called ""working-classes"" had"
developed an appetite for wealth and power that nothing could satisfy.
"This appetite was being fed continually, but the more it devoured the"
more voracious it became. Nor did the shameless profiteering of the
wealthy tend to allay it in any way. Protests against the war never went
beyond the passing of mere resolutions. Those who had sufficient
humanity and imagination to hate the war in its entirety and to suffer
"from it, although not necessarily taking any part in it, were too few"
and too scattered and isolated to take any effective action.
The extent to which a man can suffer is the precise measure of his
"merit, and thus it was that our patriots and war-enthusiasts being"
"incapable, by reason of their grossness and vulgarity, of suffering in a"
"spiritual sense, were immune from the misery caused by the war and yet"
it was they above all others upon whose support the continuance of the
war depended.
This was the terrible fatality. The more a man suffered from the war the
smaller was his control over it.
"Everywhere, those who deserved to suffer did not suffer and those who"

"So far we have dealt only with the negative results of stories, but"
"there are more important effects, and I am persuaded that if we are"
"careful in our choice of stories, and artistic in our presentation"
"(so that the truth is framed, so to speak, in the memory), we can"
unconsciously correct evil tendencies in children which they only
recognise in themselves when they have already criticised them in
the characters of the story. I have sometimes been misunderstood on
"this point, therefore I should like to make it quite clear. I do"
_not_ mean that stories should take the place entirely of moral or
"direct teaching, but that on many occasions they could supplement"
"and strengthen moral teaching, because the dramatic appeal to the"
imagination is quicker than the moral appeal to the conscience. A child
will often resist the latter lest it should make him uncomfortable
or appeal to his personal sense of responsibility: it is often not in
"his power to resist the former, because it has taken possession of him"
before he is aware of it.
"As a concrete example, I offer three verses from a poem entitled “A"
"Ballad for a Boy,” written some twelve years ago by W. Cory, an Eton"
master. The whole poem is to be found in a book of poems known as
“Ionica” (published by George Allen and Co.).
"The poem describes a fight between two ships, the French ship"
_Téméraire_ and the English ship _Quebec_. The English ship was
"destroyed by fire. Farmer, the captain, was killed, and the officers"
taken prisoners:
"“They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for Farmer dead;"
"And as the wounded captives passed, each Breton bowed the head."
"Then spoke the French lieutenant, 'Twas the fire that won, not we:"
and helpful experiment.
To take a concrete example: let us suppose the story of Andersen's Tin
"Soldier told to a child of five or six years. At the first recital, the"
point which will interest the child most will be the setting up of the
"tin soldiers on the table, because he can understand this by means of"
"his own experience, in his own nursery: it is an appeal to conditions"
to which he is accustomed and for which no exercise of the imagination
"is needed, unless we take the effect of memory to be, according to"
"Queyrat, retrospective imagination."
"The next incident that appeals is the unfamiliar behaviour of the toys,"
"but still in familiar surroundings; that is to say, the _unusual_"
activities are carried on in the safe precincts of the nursery--in the
_usual_ atmosphere of the child.
I quote from the text:
"“Late in the evening the other soldiers were put in their box, and the"
people of the house went to bed. Now was the time for the toys to play;
"they amused themselves with paying visits, fighting battles and giving"
"balls. The tin soldiers rustled about in their box, for they wanted to"
"join the games, but they could not get the lid off. The nut-crackers"
"turned somersaults, and the pencil scribbled nonsense on the slate.”"
"Now, from this point onwards in the story, the events will be quite"
"outside the personal experience of the child, and there will have"
to be a real stretch of imagination to appreciate the thrilling and
"blood-curdling adventures of the little tin soldier, namely, the"
"terrible sailing down the gutter under the bridge, the meeting with"
"the fierce rat who demands the soldier's passport, the horrible"
"sensation in the fish's body, etc. Last of all, perhaps, will come"
In physiognomy the San Blas Indians are heavy of feature and stocky of
"frame. Their color is dark olive, with no trace of the negro apparent,"
for it has been their unceasing study for centuries to retain their
"racial purity. Their features are regular and pleasing and, among the"
"children particularly, a high order of beauty is often found. To get a"
"glimpse of their women is almost impossible, and a photograph of one is"
"practically unknown. If overtaken on the water, to which they often"
"resort in their cayucas, the women will wrap their clothing about their"
"faces, rather heedless of what other portions of their bodies may be"
"exposed, and make all speed for the shore. These women paint their faces"
"in glaring colors, wear nose rings, and always blacken their teeth on"
being married. Among them more pains is taken with clothing than among
"most of the savage Indians, many of their garments being made of a sort"
"of appliqué work in gaudy colors, with figures, often in representation"
"of the human form, cut out and inset in the garment."
So determined are the men of this tribe to maintain its blood
"untarnished by any admixture whatsoever, that they long made it an"
invariable rule to expel every white man from their territory at
nightfall. Of late years there has been a very slight relaxation of this
severity. Dr. Henri Pittier of the United States Department of
"Agriculture, one of the best-equipped scientific explorers in the"
"tropics, several of whose photographs elucidate this volume, has lived"
much among the San Blas and the Cuna-Cuna Indians and won their
friendship.

[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 2.--Secondary Hæmorrhages in a case of
Hæmothorax. Case No. 151]
"(151) The wound was received at short range, probably at from"
"100 to 200 yards. _Entry_, 1 inch from the left axillary margin"
"in the first intercostal space; _exit_, at the back of the"
right arm 1-1/2 inch below the acromial angle; both pleuræ were
"therefore crossed. The patient expectorated at first fluid,"
"then clotted, blood in considerable quantity. When brought into"
"the advanced Base hospital on the third day, there were signs"
"of blood in the left pleura, cellular emphysema over the right"
"side of the chest, and signs of collapse of the right lung. The"
temperature chart gives shortly the course of the case: the
"right pneumo-thorax cleared up spontaneously, also the"
emphysema; but the left pleura needed tapping to relieve
"symptoms of pressure on four occasions, the 13th, 15th, 19th,"
and 25th days respectively. On the first two occasions blood
"was removed, on the third blood serum only, and on the last"
pus. The patient was relieved after each aspiration; after the
"third, the temperature fell to normal, the general condition"
"also improved, and he promised to do well. None the less,"
"reaccumulation took place, the evacuated fluid assumed an"
"inflammatory character, and an incision to evacuate pus was"
eventually followed by death on the twenty-seventh day. The
"amount of hæmoptysis throughout was considerable, and the case"
"was possibly one of pulmonary hæmothorax, as after death no"
source of hæmorrhage could be localised in the intercostal
"space. The track in the lung was almost healed, and although a"
part of it allowed the introduction of a probe for about an
"inch, it could be traced no further even on section of the"
"organ, and no special vessel could be located as the original"
"distance--hair up and teeth bared. The feeling is spontaneous,"
"unpredictable, and the usual result is fight."
"Up to this time she had not seen me, or even known of my insignificant"
"existence; but suddenly, as though it were a sally of banter whose blade"
"he parried in the nick of time, her laughter-bathed eyes darted past him"
and squarely met my own; her lips sobered into a half parted expression
"of interest and, some strange thought--perhaps unbidden--coming into her"
"mind, sent the blood surging to her cheeks. As quickly as this happened"
"it had gone, and again she seemed to be absorbing the attention of her"
_vis-à-vis_.
"Once, years ago in the Dolomites, I thoughtlessly struck my staff upon a"
"piece of rock when, lo, a wonderful tone arose therefrom. And the memory"
"of that rich, unbidden sound was re-awakened now as the contact of our"
glances stirred something which thrilled me with a maddening sense of
harmony. As an E string vibrates when another E is struck somewhere near
"to it, so my being vibrated with each tilt of her head, each movement of"
her lips. Yet however much I conjured the magnet of my will to make her
"look again, she successfully, if coquettishly, resisted."
The Spanish waiter came up softly to refill my glass; an attention I
"permitted, murmuring happily:"
"""Right, kiddo! Stay me with flagons, comfort me with champagne, for my"
"heart is faint with love!""--only Solomon didn't sing it quite like"
"that, the fickle old dog, nor did my waiter understand me, which was"
just as well.
Engrossed with watching her I saw a new look come into her face as she
quickly whispered something across the table. Her _vis-à-vis_ turned
"impatiently as a man approached them, who to my surprise was the yacht"
explicit.
At the present recruitment in the Indian Educational Service is made in
England and is practically confined to Englishmen. Such racial
"preference is in my opinion, prejudicial to the interest of education."
"The best man available, English or Indian should be selected"
"impartially, and high scholarship should be the only test."
It has been said that the present standard of Indian Universities is
"not as high as that of British Universities, and that the work done by"
the former is more like that of a sixth form of public schools in
England. It is therefore urged that what is required for an Educational
officer is the capacity to manage classes rather than high scholarship.
I do not agree with these views: (1) there are Universities in Great
Britain whose standards are not higher than ours; I do not think that
the Pass Degree even of Oxford or Cambridge is higher than the
corresponding degree here; (2) the standard of the Indian Universities
is being steadily raised; (3) the standard will depend upon what the men
entrusted with Educational work will make it. For these reasons it is
necessary that the level of scholarship represented by the Indian
Educational Service should be maintained very high.
"In paragraph 83,631 I have stated that even these Indians who have"
distinguished themselves in European Universities have little chance of
entering the higher Educational Service. I should like to add that these
highly qualified Indians need only opportunities to render service which
would greatly advance the cause of higher education. As regards
"graduates of Indian Universities, I have known men among them whose"
works have been highly appreciated. If promising Indian graduates are
"given the opportunity of visiting foreign Universities, I have no doubt"
that they would stand comparison with the best recruits that can be
obtained from the West.
"with fifteen thousand of his soldiers around him, lifted this same"

"That men who, like Charlemagne and Napoleon, had reached the highest"
"pinnacle of human power, should seek to enhance their influence by"
"crowning their heads with one of the nails which, as their followers"
"believed, had pierced the Galilean's foot, is a richly suggestive fact."
But we must keep our tempted thoughts to another and less edifying line
at present.
When we had examined all the parts of the famous crown to our
"satisfaction, we stepped to the desk in the ante-room and paid our five"
"francs (one dollar), the regular price for the exhibition of the Iron"
"Crown, then left the cathedral, bought one or two post-card pictures of"
"the crown, and took the tram through the dreary weather back to Milan,"
well pleased with the results of our first pilgrimage to the shrine of
a real Roman Catholic relic in Italy.
[Sidenote: Rome Caps the Climax.]
"But on our arrival at Rome, a month later, we found that, interesting"
"as were the relics which we had seen or read of elsewhere, they were"
"nothing to those in the Eternal City itself. In this, as in everything"
else except such little matters as cleanliness and morality and
"truthfulness and honesty, Rome outvies all her rivals. It is only fair"
"to add, however, that, since the overthrow of the papal sovereignty and"
"the establishment of a capable government, Rome has improved immensely"
"in the matter of cleanliness, and even her immorality is not so"
"flaunting as it was. This is attested by the Hon. Guiseppe Zanardelli,"
"Third International, is at the same time reacting most violently away"
"from all other contact, back, recoiling on herself, into a fierce,"
unapproachable Russianism. Which motion will conquer? The workman's
"International, or the centripetal movement into national isolation? Are"
we going to merge into one grey proletarian homogeneity?--or are we
"going to swing back into more-or-less isolated, separate, defiant"
communities?
Probably both. The workman's International movement will finally break
"the flow towards cosmopolitanism and world-assimilation, and suddenly in"
a crash the world will fly back into intense separations. The moment has
"come when America, that extremist in world-assimilation and"
"world-oneness, is reacting into violent egocentricity, a truly"
Amerindian egocentricity. As sure as fate we are on the brink of
American empire.
"For myself, I am glad. I am glad that the era of love and oneness is"
over: hateful homogeneous world-oneness. I am glad that Russia flies
"back into savage Russianism, Scythism, savagely self-pivoting. I am glad"
that America is doing the same. I shall be glad when men hate their
"common, world-alike clothes, when they tear them up and clothe"
"themselves fiercely for distinction, savage distinction, savage"
distinction against the rest of the creeping world: when America kicks
"the billy-cock and the collar-and-tie into limbo, and takes to her own"
national costume: when men fiercely react against looking all alike and
"being all alike, and betake themselves into vivid clan or"
nation-distinctions.
The era of love and oneness is over. The era of world-alike should be at
an end. The other tide has set in. Men will set their bonnets at one
"another now, and fight themselves into separation and sharp distinction."
"The day of peace and oneness is over, the day of the great fight into"
CHAPTER XXX.
ROMAN CATHOLIC RELICS AT ROME.
"We reached Rome at a good time for seeing relics, as the special"
services of the Christmas season were just beginning. One of the most
splendid of these ceremonies is the procession in honor of the _Santa
"Culla_; that is, the cradle in which the priestly tradition says the"
infant Jesus was carried into Egypt. This is the great relic and chief
"distinction of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, though it contains"
"a number of others, such as the bodies of St. Matthew and St. Jerome,"
"and two little bags of the brains of Thomas á Becket, and ""one of the"
pictures attributed to St. Luke (and announced to be such in a papal
"bull attached to the walls!), much revered for the belief that it"
stayed the plague which decimated the city during the reign of Pelagius
"II., and that (after its intercession had been sought by a procession"
by order of Innocent VIII.) it brought about the overthrow of the
"Moorish dominion in Spain."""
[Sidenote: The Miraculous Snow in Summertime.]
"Moreover, this church of Santa Maria Maggiore is by no means lacking"
"in legendary and architectural interest. It was founded A. D. 352, by"
"Pope Liberius and John, a Roman patrician, to commemorate an alleged"
"miraculous fall of snow, which covered this spot of ground and no"
"other, on the 5th of August, and an alleged appearance of the Virgin"
"Mary, in a vision, at the same time, showing them that she had thus"
"appropriated the site of a new temple, all of which is duly represented"
"in a fine painting on the wall of the church, and in two of Murillo's"
"most beautiful pictures in the Academy at Madrid, and commemorated"
"every year on the 5th of August by a solemn high mass, and by showers"
forms.
THE GREAT LENGTH OF GEOLOGIC TIME INFERRED FROM THE SLOW CHANGE OF
"SPECIES. Life forms, like land forms, are thus subject to change"
under the influence of their changing environment and of forces
acting from within. How slowly they change may be seen in the
apparent stability of existing species. In the lifetime of the
"observer and even in the recorded history of man, species seem as"
stable as the mountain and the river. But life forms and land
"forms are alike variable, both in nature and still more under the"
shaping hand of man. As man has modified the face of the earth
"with his great engineering works, so he has produced widely"
different varieties of many kinds of domesticated plants and
"animals, such as the varieties of the dog and the horse, the apple"
"and the rose, which may be regarded in some respects as new"
species in the making. We have assumed that land forms have
changed in the past under the influence of forces now in
operation. Assuming also that life forms have always changed as
"they are changing at present, we come to realize something of the"
immensity of geologic time required for the evolution of life from
its earliest lowly forms up to man.
It is because the onward march of life has taken the same general
course the world over that we are able to use it as a UNIVERSAL
TIME SCALE and divide geologic time into ages and minor
subdivisions according to the ruling or characteristic organisms
"then living on the earth. Thus, since vertebrates appeared, we"
"have in succession the Age of Fishes, the Age of Amphibians, the"
"Age of Reptiles, and the Age of Mammals."
The chart given on page 295 is thus based on the law of
superposition and the law of the evolution of organisms. The first
"the blood-stained House. Certain of the nobles, gathered together,"
resolve upon an alliance for the purpose of restoring a strong
"government. The Duke of Albany, however, thinks to snatch power to"
himself from this opportunity. _Scene 2._--Report is made of the
"suppression of the rebellion, but this news is immediately followed by a"
report of Albany's attempted usurpation of the throne. Coalition for his
"defeat is agreed upon, and the play ends with the mournful soliloquy of"
that aged counsellor who first opposed the division of the throne and
"now sees, as the consequence of that fatal act, his country, torn to"
"pieces by civil strife, left an easy prize for an ambitious conqueror."
Hereto it comes when kings will not consent
"To grave advice, but follow wilful will."
"This is the end, when in fond princes' hearts"
"Flattery prevails, and sage rede[51] hath no place:"
"These are the plagues, when murder is the mean"
To make new heirs unto the royal crown....
"And this doth grow, when lo, unto the prince,"
"Whom death or sudden hap of life bereaves,"
"No certain heir remains, such certain heir,"
"As not all only is the rightful heir,"
But to the realm is so made known to be;
"And troth thereby vested in subjects' hearts,"
To owe faith there where right is known to rest.
"This last quotation, interesting in itself as containing a"
"recommendation to Queen Elizabeth to marry, or at least name her"
"successor, will also serve as a specimen of the new verse, Blank Verse,"
"which here, for the first time, finds its way into English drama."
Meeting with small favour from writers skilful in the stringing together
"of rhymes, it suffered comparative neglect for some years until Marlowe"
taught its capacities to his own and future ages. With Sackville's stiff
previously opposed him at the Royal Society. The plagiarism was
subsequently discovered and led to much unpleasantness. It is not
necessary to refer any more to the subject except as explanation of the
fact that the determined hostility and misrepresentations of one man
succeeded for more than ten years to bar all avenues of publication for
his discoveries. But every cloud has its silver lining; this incident
"secured for him many true friends in England who stood for fair play,"
and whose friendship has proved to be a source of great encouragement to
him.
FURTHER DIFFICULTIES
Dr. Bose's next work in 1903 was the discovery of the identity of
response and of automatic activity in plant and animal and of the
nervous impulse in plant. These new contributions were regarded as of
such great importance that the Royal Society showed its special
appreciation by recommending it to be published in their Philosophical
transactions. But the same influence which had hitherto stood in his way
"triumphed once more, and it was at the very last moment that the"
"publication was withheld. The Royal Society, however, informed him that"
"his results were of fundamental importance, but as they were so wholly"
"unexpected and so opposed to the existing theories, that they would"
"reserve their judgment until, at some future time, plants themselves"
could be made to record their answers to questions put to them. This was
interpreted in certain quarters here as the final rejection of Dr.
"Bose's theories by the Royal Society, and the limited facilities which"
he had in the prosecution of his researches were in danger of being
withdrawn. And everything was dark for him for the next ten years. The
only thought that possessed him was how to make the plant give testimony
by means of its own autograph.
"admirer of Erasmus, had requested him to direct his attention to the"
"fact that in his interpretation of St. Paul, especially in that of the"
"epistle to the Romans, Erasmus had failed to conceive the idea of"
"_justitia_ correctly, had paid too little attention to original sin: he"
might profit by reading Augustine.
"The nameless Austin Friar was Luther, then still unknown outside the"
"circle of the Wittenberg University, in which he was a professor, and"
the criticism regarded the cardinal point of his hardly acquired
conviction: justification by faith.
Erasmus paid little attention to this letter. He received so many of
"that sort, containing still more praise and no criticism. If he answered"
"it, the reply did not reach Spalatinus, and later Erasmus completely"
forgot the whole letter.
"Nine months afterwards, in September 1517, when Erasmus had been at"
"Louvain for a short time, he received an honourable invitation, written"
"by the first prelate of the Empire, the young Archbishop of Mayence,"
Albert of Brandenburg. The archbishop would be pleased to see him on an
occasion: he greatly admired his work (he knew it so little as to speak
"of Erasmus's emendation of the Old Testament, instead of the New) and"
hoped that he would one day write some lives of saints in elegant style.
"The young Hohenzoller, advocate of the new light of classical studies,"
"whose attention had probably been drawn to Erasmus by Hutten and Capito,"
"who sojourned at his court, had recently become engaged in one of the"
boldest political and financial transactions of his time. His elevation
"to the see of Mayence, at the age of twenty-four, had necessitated a"
"papal dispensation, as he also wished to keep the archbishopric of"
Magdeburg and the see of Halberstadt. This accumulation of
ecclesiastical offices had to be made subservient to the Brandenburg
"put by a ruler. The same would apply to a combination of signs, one of the"
"fundamental principles of divination being--once favorable, always"
favorable.
Among the birth-omen reports we have one containing a historical reference
of unusual interest[30].
'If the foetus is male and female--omen of Azag-Bau who ruled the
land. The king's country will be seized.
"If a foetus is male and female, without testicles, a son of the"
palace[31] will rule the land or will assert himself against the
king.'
"We must assume in this case that a monstrosity has been born, having"
partly male and partly female organs. The priest by way of interpretation
"notes a series of signs registered in the collections, all prognosticating"
"an abnormal state of affairs--a woman on the throne, captivity, seizure"
of the throne by an usurper and revolt. We frequently find in the
"collections several interpretations registered in this way,--a valuable"
indication of the manner in which these collections were compiled by the
priests from a variety of documents before them. The name of this female
"ruler, hitherto known only from this report and from a list of proper"
"names in which Azag-Bau occurred, has now turned up in an important list"
"of early dynasties ruling in the Euphratean Valley, discovered and"
"published by Scheil[32]. We may conclude, therefore, that at the time that"
"Azag-Bau sat on the throne or shortly before, such a monstrosity actually"
"came to light. As an unusual occurrence it presaged something unusual, and"
was naturally associated with the extraordinary circumstance of a woman
mounting the throne. Azag-Bau according to the newly discovered list is
the founder of a dynasty ruling in Erech as a centre and whose date
appears to be somewhere between 2800 and 3000 B. C.--possibly even
The man in the street looks out for a newspaper which may strengthen
his own party proclivities. He expects to find political questions
"discussed, but so far as religion is concerned he accepts without"
"knowing it the current convention of the pressman, and imbibes a"
semi-sceptical atmosphere without misgiving or suspicion.
"And yet, as Sir Leslie Stephen saw, every theory of duty depends upon"
Belief or Disbelief in the Divinity of Christ. We may talk of duty to
"Society, duty to the Race, duty to Posterity, duty to Civilization;"
but the plain man will recall the question of Sir Boyle Roche: “I do
"not understand, Mr. Speaker, all this talk about our duty to"
Posterity! What has Posterity ever done for us?”
You cannot control conduct by asserting that a man owes a debt to an
"abstraction which you vivify by printing it with a capital letter,"
and there remains always the question of the dying Lucretius--
“Thy duty? What is duty? Fare thee well.”
"The problem, then, which we have to solve is--how to arrest the"
"attention of the average man to those Christian principles, of which"
the acceptance or definite refusal will determine the course of
civilization during the next twenty years.
"The mere assertion of authority will not suffice, and men are not"
impressed in favour of Catholic doctrine simply by dignified ceremony
and Ritual. We have only to look across the English Channel to be
assured of this. Frenchmen have not been encouraged to study the
evidences of Christianity. Bishops and priests have only advertised
sceptical books by forbidding their perusal to the faithful; and as
"the devout have been instructed to live by faith, but not how to give"
"a reason for the faith which is in them, in the result M. Viviani’s"
vertebrae. In most modern fishes and in all higher vertebrates the
notochord is gradually removed as the bodies of the vertebrae are
formed about it; but in the Devonian fishes it persists through
maturity and the vertebrae remain incomplete.
THE SKELETON IS CARTILAGINOUS. This also is an embryological
"characteristic. In the Devonian fishes the vertebrae, as well as"
"the other parts of the skeleton, have not ossified, or changed to"
"bone, but remain in their primitive cartilaginous condition."
THE TAIL FIN IS VERTEBRATED. The backbone runs through the fin and
is fringed above and below with its vertical rays. In some fishes
"with vertebrated tail fins the fin is symmetric, and this seems to"
be the primitive type. In others the tail fin is unsymmetric: the
"backbone runs into the upper lobe, leaving the two lobes of"
unequal size. In most modern fishes (the teleosts) the tail fin is
"not vertebrated: the spinal column ends in a broad plate, to which"
the diverging fin rays are attached.
"But along with these embryonic characters, which were common to"
"all Devonian fishes, there were other structures in certain groups"
which foreshadowed the higher structures of the land vertebrates
"which were yet to come: air sacs which were to develop into lungs,"
and cartilaginous axes in the side fins which were a prophecy of
limbs. The vertebrates had already advanced far enough to prove
the superiority of their type of structure to all others. Their
internal skeleton afforded the best attachment for muscles and
enabled them to become the largest and most powerful creatures of
"the time. The central nervous system, with the predominance given"
"to the ganglia at the fore end of the nerve cord,--the brain,--"
already endowed them with greater energy than the invertebrates;
"and, still more important, these structures contained the"
"Occasionally, their dancing is really remarkably interesting, when a"
large amount of pantomime enters into it and they develop the story of
"some primitive action, as, for instance, the drawing of the water,"
"cutting the wood, making the fire, cooking the food, etc., ending in a"
burst of song symbolizing the joys of the new prepared feast. In an
extremely crude form it reminds one of the old opera ballets and seems
"to be a composite of the original African and the ancient Spanish, which"
is very probably the case.
[Illustration: THE CHURCH AT ANCON]
“The Orientals of the Isthmus deserve a word in passing. They are
chiefly Chinese coolies and form a large part of the small merchant
"class. Others, in the hill districts, cultivate large truck gardens,"
bringing their produce swinging over the shoulders on poles to the city
"markets. Their houses and grounds are very attractive, built of reed or"
"bamboo in the eastern fashion and marked everywhere by extreme neatness,"
contrasting so strikingly with the homes and surroundings of their negro
"neighbors. Many cultivate fields of cane or rice as well, and amidst the"
"silvery greens, stretching for some distance, the quaint blue figures of"
the workmen in their huge hats make a charming picture. Through the
rubber sections Chinese ‘middlemen’ are of late frequently found buying
"that valuable commodity for their fellow countrymen in Panama City, who"
are now doing quite a large business in rubber. These people live much
"as in their native land, seldom learning more than a few words of"
"Spanish (except those living in the towns), and they form a very"
substantial and good element of the population”.

To enumerate even by names the aboriginal tribes would be tedious and
"unavailing. Among the more notable are the Doracho-Changuina, of"
"outside, where an elaborate etiquette had made the rules even for the"
trees to grow in seemliness with a most gentlemanly existence. For him
were no disturbing peerings into human destiny--he raised no rough
"alarms by strenuous aims and vigorous thinking. Pretty, dandified,"
"he--always. Sinning easily enough, but always like a gentleman. Never"
"a crudity. As a perfumed fan fluttered by jewelled slender fingers,"
blowing cool fragrant airs that kiss the painted cheek of some
"frail beauty, he uttered his lines--obscene often, but by the most"
gentlemanly of innuendoes. The unmannerly thing was the only sin. The
display of a profound emotion was the depth of ill-breeding. So sang
"he, tunefully always, guiltless of all rough accent of originality;"
"sang of peacocks and green carnations and blue roses, of butterflies"
"and pools and dragonflies and souls, of ivory and silver, and of"
"dawn and dusk and dew, and white shoulders sweet, beauties who moved"
languidly with rustle of silk--so wafted he to you nothing more vibrant
than whisper of women and scent of perfumed chambers and flowers and
"bowers and rose and amarynth and asphodel and daffodil, of moonlight"
and music and kiss and gavotte and little tiny things--and always in
the most gentlemanly manner. He milked the unicorn. Always a would-be
"suggestion of mysterious deep-hid symbolism that ended where it began,"
and at most only the dark hint of well-bred tragedy.
"He moved impatiently now, as impatiently as he might, complaining that"
the shop-window into which he deigned to cast his reflection was tinted
with amethyst.
"“Come, Greppel,” said he--“let us gaze at ourselves in another"
window--this is an ageing colour.”
Then came the terrible tragedy of a fire at a charity bazaar; a most
patrician function with much upper clergy in it was smitten with sudden
"Virginia, directing every effort to build up a stock farm which his"
family had more or less indifferently carried for generations. Next to
"winning Nell, his greatest ambition was to raise a Derby"
winner--according to him a more notable feat than being President.
"The sixth of April, 1917, had caught him with a promising string of"
"yearlings, each an aristocrat in the equine world of blue-bloods, each a"
hope for that most classic of American races. But he had thrown these
upon the hands of a trainer and submerged his personal interests six
"hours after Congress declared war. At the same moment, indeed, all of"
"Kentucky was turning to a greater tradition than that of ""horses and"
"whiskey""; and, by the time the draft became operative, the board of one"
county searched it from end to end without finding a man to
"register--because those in the fighting age, married or single, with"
"dependents or otherwise, had previously rushed to the Colors. This, and"
"the fact that his state, with three others, headed the nation with the"
"highest percentage in physical examinations, added luster to the shield"
of his old Commonwealth--though he roundly insisted that 'twas not
"Kentucky's manhood, but her womanhood, who deserved the credit. After"
"our cruise he was going back to the thoroughbreds, now within a few"
months of the required Derby age; and of course I had promised to be on
hand at Churchill Downs when his colors flashed past the grandstand.
"Late in the afternoon the _Whim_ docked at Key West and, while Gates was"
"ashore arranging for our clearance, Tommy and I ambled up town in search"
of daily papers. We were seated in the office of a rather seedy hotel
"when its proprietor approached, saying:"
"""'Scuse me, gents,--are you from that boat down there?"""
I answered in the affirmative.
"less our own, sometimes rest upon a merest chance--dropped in for supper"
at a fashionable place patronized by those who wish to see the brightest
"of Havana life. There were other places, of course, that might have"
"offered quite as much, but this one happened to be on the route we had"
taken.
"Midnight passed, but still we lingered, seated on the latticed balcony"
that encircles an inner court where cabaret features are
"held--suggestive of a bull ring. One rather piquant Spanish girl,"
"playing her accompaniment on a guitar, gazed softly up at Tommy while"
"singing about some wonderful Nirvana, an enchanted island that floated"
"in a sea of love. It was a pretty song, even if more intense than"
"temperate, and pleased with it he tossed her a coin; whereupon she"
"tilted her chin and raised a shoulder, asking in the universal language"
of cabarets if she should not come up and drink a health with the
"_imperioso Señor_. But he, whose heart was beating against a twenty-page"
"letter from a nymph in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, laughed a"
"negative, this time throwing her a flower that she kissed lightly and"
put in her hair.
"We had supped well, the mandolins were now tinkling, incessantly, and"
"this, mingled with the silvery tones of glasses touched in eager"
"pledges, created an ensemble of sounds dear to the heart of every true"
Bohemian. Effects were good here. The ceilings and walls of our balcony
were lighted by vari-colored electric bulbs artfully placed amidst
"growing vines that drooped in festoons above the tables, producing a"
"fairy-like enchantment. And, indeed, the café proved to be a mart not"
"only of enchantments but entertainments, including a popular gambling"
salon.
"At last, in desperation seeing that Monsieur refused to be cheered,"
"Tommy sprang up, saying:"
"probably falls into the fallacy, common even among those who follow"
"the sea, that a partial or entire clearance of her ""crowd"" will quite"
"alter her nature; whereas sailors being sailors--that is, people of"
certain fairly definite attributes--any given environment makes them
much the same as those who preceded them.
But entire changes in the _personnel_ of a vessel rarely take place.
"The officers change, but the crew remains: the crew goes, but"
officers stay.  Or more frequently some few men are favourites of one
"or two of the officers, and they mingle with the new crew like yeast,"
till the ancient fermentation is visible once more.
Ships (to speak thus of their companies) talk of the same subjects
over a million miles of changing seas: they have a permanent stock of
subjects.  These include all which are perennially of interest to
"seafaring men, such as homes _versus_ boarding-houses, but they"
"include also something more individual, something more intimately"
connected with the essence of that particular vessel.  And the one
unending topic of interest on board the _Potluck_ was foreign
politics.
"How this came about no one knew, though many theories were set afloat"
and sunk again every Sunday afternoon.  Some said that the first
"captain of the _Potluck_ was called Palmerstone, and that he"
introduced the subject of England _versus_ the world as soon as he
came on board.  Others swore that they had been told by a clerk in
the employ of the firm that there had been a discussion over her very
keel concerning the introduction into her frame of foreign oaks.
"""This was the way of it,"" said Jack Hart, who was the chief upholder"
"of this particular theory, and the son of a little shipbuilder--""the"
lot that built her at Liverpool was the mixedest crowd of forsaken
"easy life, but one of unending struggle. It is for him to cast his life"
"as an offering, regarding gain and loss, success and failure, as one."
Yet in my case this long persisting gloom was suddenly lifted. My
"scientific deputation in 1914, from the Government of India, gave the"
opportunity of giving demonstrations of my discoveries before the
leading scientific societies of the world. This led to the acceptance of
"my theories and results, and the recognition of the importance of the"
Indian contribution to the advancement of the world's science. My own
"experience told me how heavy, sometimes even crushing, are the"
difficulties which confront an inquirer here in India; yet it made me
"stronger in my determination, that I shall make the path of those who"
"are to follow me less arduous, and that India, is never to relinquish"
what has been won for her after years of struggle.
THE TWO IDEALS
What is it that India is to win and maintain? Can anything small or
circumscribed ever satisfy the mind of India? Has her own history and
the teaching of the past prepared her for some temporary and quite
subordinate gain? There are at this moment two complementary and not
antagonistic ideals before the country. India is drawn into the vortex
of international competition. She has to become efficient in every
"way,--through spread of education, through performance of civic duties"
"and responsibilities, through activities both industrial and commercial."
Neglect of these essentials of national duty will imperil her very
existence; and sufficient stimulus for these will be found in success
and satisfaction of personal ambition.
But these alone do not ensure the life of a nation. Such material
"activities have brought in the West their fruit, in accession of power"
"and wealth. There has been a feverish rush even in the realm of science,"
his must necessarily be in direct and absolute opposition! At the same
"time, he remembered that those who were sure of their faith never lost"
"their temper about it,--and as he glanced at his friend's perfectly"
"serene and coldly smiling countenance, he saw there was no danger of"
"his letting slip, even for a moment, his admirable power of"
"self-command. The Duc de la Santoisie, meanwhile, settling his"
"mustache, and gracefully waving one hand, on which sparkled a large"
"diamond ring, bent forward a little with a courteous, deprecatory"
gesture.
"""I think""--he said, in soft, purring accents,--""that my friend, Dr."
"Mudley""--here he bowed toward the saturnine looking individual who had"
"entered into conversation with Alwyn--""takes a very proper, and indeed"
"a very lofty, view of the whole question. The moral sense""--and he laid"
"a severely weighty emphasis on these words,--""the moral sense of each"
"man, if properly trained, is quite sufficient to guide him through"
"existence, without any such weakness as reliance on a merely"
"supposititious Deity."""
The Duke's French way of speaking English was charming; he gave an
"expressive roll to his r's, especially when he said ""the moral sense,"""
that of itself almost carried conviction. His wife smiled as she heard
"him, and her smile was not altogether pleasant. Perhaps she wondered by"
"what criterion of excellence he measured his own ""moral sense,"" or"
"whether, despite his education and culture, he had any ""moral sense"" at"
"all, higher than that of the pig, who eats to be eaten! But Alwyn"
"spoke, and she listened intently, finding a singular fascination in the"
"soft and quiet modulation of his voice, which gave a vaguely delicious"
suggestion of music underlying speech.
"""To guide people by their moral sense alone""--he said--""you must first"
"prove plainly to them that the moral sense exists, together with moral"
cephalopods take a new departure. So far in all their various
"forms, whether straight, as the Orthoceras, or curved, or close-"
"coiled as in the nautilus, the septum, or partition dividing the"
"chambers, met the inner shell along a simple line, like that of"
the rim of a saucer. There now begins a growth of the septum by
"which its edges become sharply corrugated, and the suture, or line"
"of juncture of the septum and the shell, is thus angled. The group"
in which this growth of the septum takes place is called the
"GONIATITE (Greek GONIA, angle)."
VERTEBRATES. It is with the greatest interest that we turn now to
study the backboned animals of the Devonian; for they are believed
to be the ancestors of the hosts of vertebrates which have since
dominated the earth. Their rudimentary structures foreshadowed
"what their descendants were to be, and give some clue to the"
earliest vertebrates from which they sprang. Like those whose
"remains are found in the lower Paleozoic systems, all of these"
Devonian vertebrates were aquatic and go under the general
designation of fishes.
"The lowest in grade and nearest, perhaps, to the ancestral type of"
"vertebrates, was the problematic creature, an inch or so long, of"
"Figure 297. Note the circular mouth not supplied with jaws, the"
"lack of paired fins, and the symmetric tail fin, with the column"
"of cartilaginous, ringlike vertebrae running through it to the"
end. The animal is probably to be placed with the jawless lampreys
"and hags,--a group too low to be included among true fishes."
"OSTRACODERMS. This archaic group, long since extinct, is also too"
"lowly to rank among the true fishes, for its members have neither"
"jaws nor paired fins. These small, fishlike forms were cased in"
front with bony plates developed in the skin and covered in the
3. THE LARGER ZOOLOGICAL AND BOTANICAL GROUPINGS SURVIVE LONGER
THAN THE SMALLER. Species are so short-lived that a single
geological epoch may be marked by several more or less complete
extinctions of the species of its fauna-flora and their
replacement by other species. A genus continues with new species
after all the species with which it began have become extinct.
"Families survive genera, and orders families. Classes are so long-"
lived that most of those which are known from the earliest
"formations are represented by living forms, and no sub-kingdom has"
ever become extinct.
"Thus, to take an example from the stony corals,--the ZOANTHARIA,--"
the particular characters--which constituted a certain SPECIES--
Facosites niagarensis--of the order are confined to the Niagara
series. Its GENERIC characters appeared in other species earlier
in the Silurian and continued through the Devonian. Its FAMILY
"characters, represented in different genera and species, range"
from the Ordovician to the close of the Paleozoic; while the
"characters which it shares with all its order, the Zoantharia,"
began in the Cambrian and are found in living species.
4. THE CHANGE IN ORGANISMS HAS BEEN GRADUAL. The fossils of each
life zone and of each formation of a conformable series closely
"resemble, with some explainable exceptions, those of the beds"
immediately above and below. The animals and plants which tenanted
the earth during any geological epoch are so closely related to
those of the preceding and the succeeding epochs that we may
consider them to be the descendants of the one and the ancestors
"of the other, thus accounting for the resemblance by heredity. It"
is therefore believed that the species of animals and plants now
living on the earth are the descendants of the species whose
"remains we find entombed in the rocks, and that the chain of life"
mad.
"Indeed, our friend, the man in the street, when he becomes a family"
"man, without any pretensions to be a man of family, very often finds"
himself face to face with other problems. Shall he simply sing with
"the Psalmist “Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant, even so are"
the young children. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of
"them,” or shall he be guided by the gloss of a modern interpreter who"
maintains that the oriental quiver was designed to hold but two or
three arrows at most?
Even when the plain man confines his interests to his business and
"seeks relaxations in “sport” alone, endeavouring to evade the puzzles"
"of politics and avoid all theologized inquiry, he cannot escape from"
ethical consideration. Professionalism in athletics and questions of
betting and bribery contend with his conviction that there is
"something which ennobles man in running and striving for mastery, and"
"it is futile to curse the bookmaker when his clients are so many, his"
occupation so lucrative.
The average man gets little guidance from pulpit or press. It is dull
"work reading sermons, even if sermons came in his way. From time to"
time some eloquent bishop or canon is reported in the Monday morning
"papers, but journalists know that the publication of a summary with,"
"in the case of a few of the preachers, some epigrams or denunciations,"
is all that can be permitted or expected. These may arouse the
"attention to the existence of evils, but give no guiding principle for"
their cure.
The habit of attendance at some place of worship is easily abandoned
"in the days of bachelor freedom, and rarely regained in maturer years."
Men for the most part find the preacher unconvincing. The usual
"the exasperated peasantry in Friesland and Guelderland,[757] but to put"
"down all the oligarchs who had rebelled against him, and finally to"
"behead them by the dozen,[758] leaving the land to his son as a"
virtually subject State.
"In the sixteenth century, under Charles V, the men of Ghent, grown once"
"again a great commercial community,[759] exhibited again the fatal"
instability of the undeveloped democracy of all ages. Called upon to pay
"their third of a huge subsidy of 1,200,000 _caroli_ voted by the Flemish"
"States to the Emperor, they rang their bell of revolt and defied him,"
"offering their allegiance to the King of France. That monarch, by way of"
"a bargain, promptly betrayed the intrigue to his ""brother,"" who"
"thereupon marched in force through France to the rebel city, now"
"paralysed by terror; and without meeting a shadow of resistance,"
"penalised it to the uttermost, beheading a score of leading citizens,"
"banishing many more, annulling its remaining municipal rights, and"
exacting an increased tribute.[760] It needed an extremity of grievance
to drive such communities to an enduring rebellion. When Charles V
"abdicated at Brussels in favour of his son Philip in 1555, he had"
already caused to be put to death Netherlanders to the number at least
of thousands for religious heresy;[761] and still the provinces were
"absolutely submissive, and the people capable of weeping collectively"
"out of sympathy with the despot's infirmities.[762] He, on his part,"
"born and educated among them, and knowing them well, was wont to say of"
them that there was not a nation under the sun which more detested the
"_name_ of slavery, or that bore the reality more patiently when managed"
with discretion.[763] He spoke whereof he knew.
§ 2. _The Revolt against Spain_
That the people who endured so much at the hands of a despot should have
"for prohibiting or allowing, wholly or in certain Cases, or subject to"
"any Conditions or Regulations or otherwise, as may from Time to Time"
"seem meet, the ransoming or the entering into any contract or Agreement"
for the ransoming of any Ship or Goods belonging to any of Her Majesty's
"Subjects, and taken as Prize by any of Her Majesty's Enemies."
"Any Contract or Agreement entered into, and any Bill, Bond, or other"
"Security given for Ransom of any Ship or Goods, shall be under the"
exclusive Jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty as a Prize Court
"(subject to Appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council), and"
if entered into or given in contravention of any such Order in Council
shall be deemed to have been entered into or given for an illegal
Consideration.
If any Person ransoms or enters into any Contract or Agreement for
"Ransoming any Ship or Goods, in contravention of any such Order in"
"Council, he shall for every such Offence be liable to be proceeded"
against in the High Court of Admiralty at the Suit of Her Majesty in Her
"Office of Admiralty, and on Conviction to be fined, in the Discretion of"
"the Court, any Sum not exceeding Five hundred Pounds."
_Convoy._
[Sidenote: Punishment of Masters of Merchant Vessels under Convoy
disobeying Orders or deserting Convoy.]
46. If the Master or other Person having the Command of any Ship of any
"of Her Majesty's Subjects, under the Convoy of any of Her Majesty's"
"Ships of War, wilfully disobeys any lawful Signal, Instruction, or"
"Command of the Commander of the Convoy, or without Leave deserts the"
"Convoy, he shall be liable to be proceeded against in the High Court of"
"Admiralty at the Suit of Her Majesty in Her Office of Admiralty, and"
twenty years ago. He apparently does not know that some foreign
houses have trusted clerks or travellers all over the country; that
some foreign business men run up to Osaka and Tokio daily; and that
"business journeys to Maidzuru--the great, fortified naval base on"
"the Sea of Japan--Nagoya Sasebo, Hiroshima, and other important"
"centres, are matters of everyday experience now."
In the same number of the same journal is also published an important
"article from the pen of Sir Tollemache Sinclair, Bart., concerning"
Bishop Awdry's letter published in the _Times_. Sir Tollemache strongly
repudiates the accuracy of the bishop's charge of dishonesty and
"immorality against the Japanese, which Sir Tollemache calls the bishop's"
"'utterly erroneous accusations,' basing his contention upon an elaborate"
comparison of the statistical facts of Japan and many other nations
relating to several important subjects having bearing on the question.
"Among other things, he writes:--"
"This clerical censor, who endeavours to find a mote in his Japanese"
"brother's eye, but does not see the beam in his English brother's"
"eye, cut the ground from under his own feet on the subject of the"
"imaginary dishonesty of Japanese traders, for he tells us that a"
house was built for him by Japanese tradesmen admirably without any
"contract, and at a moderate expense; and I should like to know, if"
"any Englishman did the same thing in England, whether he would not"
be unmercifully fleeced. Bishop Awdry says he is a friend of the
"Japanese, but they will probably say to him, after reading his"
"letter, 'Save us from our friends, as to our enemies we will take"
care of them ourselves.'
And he winds up the article with these words:--
What excuse has he to offer for the gross and discreditable and
it had to deal with the unravelling of the great mystery that underlies
memory and tracing it backwards to latent impressions even in the
"inorganic bodies which are capable of subsequent revival; and finally,"
the determination of the special characteristic of that vehicle through
which sensiferous impulses are transmitted and the possibility of
changing the intensity and the tone of sensation. All these
"investigations, Dr. Bose said, are to be carried out by new physical"
methods of the utmost delicacy. He had in these years been able to
remove the obstacles in the path and had lifted the veil so as to catch
a glimpse of the ineffable wonder that had hitherto been hidden from
"view. The real work, he said, had only just begun."
A SOCIAL GATHERING
"At the Social Gathering held on the 16th December 1915, in the compound"
"of the Calcutta Presidency College, to meet him after his highly"
"successful tour through Europe, America and Japan, Dr. Bose spoke as"
follows:--
He said that it was his rare good fortune to have been amply rewarded
for the hardships and struggles that he had gone through by the generous
and friendly feelings of his colleagues and the love and trust of his
pupils. He would say a few words regarding his experience in the
"Presidency College for more than three decades, which he hoped would"
serve to bring all who loved the Presidency College--present and past
pupils and their teachers--in closer bonds of union. He would speak to
"them what he had learnt after years of patient labour, that the"
impossible became possible by persistent and determined efforts and
adherence to duty and entire selflessness. The greatest obstacle often
"arises out of foolish misunderstanding of each other's ideals, such as"
"the differing points of view, first of the Indian teacher, then of his"
friendship--Aversion to disturbance of any kind--Too much
concerned about other men's opinions--Need of self-
justification--Himself never in the wrong--Correlation
between inclinations and convictions--Ideal image of
himself--Dissatisfaction with himself--Self-centredness--A
solitary at heart--Fastidiousness--Suspiciousness--Morbid
mistrust--Unhappiness--Restlessness--Unsolved contradictions of
his being--Horror of lies--Reserve and insinuation
Erasmus's powerful mind met with a great response in the heart of his
contemporaries and had a lasting influence on the march of civilization.
But one of the heroes of history he cannot be called. Was not his
failure to attain to still loftier heights partly due to the fact that
his character was not on a level with the elevation of his mind?
"And yet that character, a very complicated one, though he took himself"
"to be the simplest man in the world, was determined by the same factors"
which determined the structure of his mind. Again and again we find in
his inclinations the correlates of his convictions.
At the root of his moral being we find--a key to the understanding of
his character--that same profound need of purity which drove him to the
sources of sacred science. Purity in the material and the moral sense is
"what he desires for himself and others, always and in all things. Few"
things revolt him so much as the practices of vintners who doctor wine
and dealers who adulterate food. If he continually chastens his language
"and style, or exculpates himself from mistakes, it is the same impulse"
"which prompts his passionate desire for cleanliness and brightness, of"
the home and of the body. He has a violent dislike of stuffy air and
smelly substances. He regularly takes a roundabout way to avoid a
malodorous lane; he loathes shambles and fishmongers' shops. Fetors
THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS. It is possible that the earth began as a
"vaporous, shining sphere, formed by the gathering together of the"
material of a gaseous ring which had been detached from a cooling
and shrinking nebula. Such a vaporous sphere would condense to a
"liquid, fiery globe, whose surface would become cold and solid,"
while the interior would long remain intensely hot because of the
slow conductivity of the crust. Under these conditions the
primeval atmosphere of the earth must have contained in vapor the
water now belonging to the earth's crust and surface. It held also
"all the oxygen since locked up in rocks by their oxidation, and"
all the carbon dioxide which has since been laid away in
"limestones, besides that corresponding to the carbon of"
"carbonaceous deposits, such as peat, coal, and petroleum. On this"
"hypothesis the original atmosphere was dense, dark, and noxious,"
and enormously heavier than the atmosphere at present.
"THE ACCRETION HYPOTHESIS. On the other hand, it has been recently"
suggested that the earth may have grown to its present size by the
"gradual accretion of meteoritic masses. Such cold, stony bodies"
might have come together at so slow a rate that the heat caused by
their impact would not raise sensibly the temperature of the
growing planet. Thus the surface of the earth may never have been
hot and luminous; but as the loose aggregation of stony masses
grew larger and was more and more compressed by its own
"gravitation, the heat thus generated raised the interior to high"
"temperatures, while from time to time molten rock was intruded"
"among the loose, cold meteoritic masses of the crust and outpoured"
upon the surface.
It is supposed that the meteorites of which the earth was built
"brought to it, as meteorites do now, various gases shut up within"
"celestial visitant who, on noiseless pinions, comes flying divinely"
"into the poorest homes, transfiguring common life with ethereal"
"radiance, making toil easy, giving beauty to the plainest faces and"
"poetry to the dullest brains. Love! its tremulous hand-clasp,--its"
"rapturous kiss,--the speechless eloquence it gives to gentle eyes!--the"
"grace it bestows on even the smallest gift from lover to beloved, were"
such gift but a handful of meadow blossoms tied with some silken
threads of hair!
"Not for the poet creator of ""Nourhulma"" such love any more,--had he not"
"drained the cup of Passion to the dregs in the far Past, and tasted its"
mixed sweetness and bitterness to no purpose save self-indulgence? All
"that was over;--and yet, as he walked away from the bridge, back to his"
"hotel in the quiet moonlight, he thought what a transcendent thing Love"
"might be, even on earth, between two whose spirits were SPIRITUALLY"
"AKIN,--whose lives were like two notes played in tuneful"
"concord,--whose hearts beat echoing faith and tenderness to one"
"another,--and who held their love as a sacred bond of union--a gift"
"from God, not to be despoiled by that rough familiarity which surely"
brings contempt. And then before his fancy appeared to float the
"radiant visage of Edris, half-child, half-angel,--he seemed to see her"
"beautiful eyes, so pure, so clear, so unshadowed by any knowledge of"
"sin,--and the exquisite lines of a poet-contemporary, whose work he"
"specially admired, occurred to him with singular suggestiveness:"
"""Oh, thou'lt confess that love from man to maid"
"Is more than kingdoms,--more than light and shade"
"In sky-built gardens where the minstrels dwell,"
And more than ransom from the bonds of Hell.
"Thou wilt, I say, admit the truth of this,"
"And half relent that, shrinking from a kiss,"
"Thou didst consign me to mine own disdain,"
to be considered. In fact considerable evidence is now available to show
that Babylonian-Assyrian astrological notions and in part also
astronomical data spread to China[9].
II
The observation of signs observed in young animals and in infants at the
time of birth constitutes a third division of Babylonian-Assyrian
"divination, quite equal in prominence to Hepatoscopy and Astrology. Here"
too we are justified in seeking for some rational or quasi-rational basis
"for the importance attached by Babylonians and Assyrians, and as we shall"
"see by other nations as well, to anything of a noteworthy or unusual"
character observed at the moment that a new life was ushered into the
world. The mystery of life made as deep an impression upon primitive man
"and upon ancient peoples as it does on the modern scientist, who endeavors"
with his better equipment and enriched by the large experience of past
"ages, to penetrate to the very source of life. A new life issuing from"
"another life--what could be stranger, what more puzzling, what more"
awe-inspiring? If we bear in mind that there is sufficient evidence to
"warrant us in saying that among peoples in a primitive state of culture,"
"the new life was not associated with the sexual act[10], the mystery must"
have appeared still more profound. The child or the young animal was
supposed to be due to the action of some spirit or demon that had found
"its way into the mother, just as death was supposed to be due to some"
malicious demon that had driven the spirit of life out of the body. The
"many birth customs found in all parts of the world[11], are associated"
with this impression of mystery made by the new life; they centre largely
round the idea of protection to the mother and her offspring at a critical
beginning of each chapter: the Contents gives a general idea of the
divisions into which the author has separated his subject; the Topical
Analyses still further divide each chapter; and the Index is ordinarily
"still more minute, with the further advantage of having its references"
arranged in alphabetical order.
"The proper person to make an index is, first of all, the author of the"
"book, provided that he possesses the natural characteristics. It does"
"not at all naturally follow, however, that all authors are competent to"
"do this, for the art of indexing is not as simple as many superficially"
"suppose. The author should be the one best fitted, because he knows"
better than any reader the exact meaning each of his sentences is
"intended to convey,--and this meaning should be expressed in the"
"index. The ideal index is that which gives every topic, thought, or"
"reference contained in the book itself, without a single superfluous"
"word, and with no description or comment."
To make an index requires a quick grasp of the idea contained in each
"sentence or paragraph, an immediate discernment of the main thought,"
"an instinctive classification, absolute accuracy in translating this"
"thought into its briefest expression, ability to condense, and a"
sensing of the reader's needs in adequate cross-references. All this
demands a mind more logical and more sensitive to codified detail
"than is possessed by many able writers. Under these circumstances,"
it is desirable to place the making of the index in the hands of one
"possessing these qualifications, either instinctively or as a result of"
experience.
Every publishing-house and most printing establishments of any
"consequence are in a position to have indexes prepared when required,"
"but the danger is always present that the indexer, approaching his"
"subject from the outside, will fail to place himself sufficiently in"
III. CRITICISM AND HISTORY
Beyond the system--The universality of art--The discipline of
"art--Poetry, prose and oratory--Classicism and impressionism--"
Practical personality and poetical personality--The monographic
method in criticism--The reform of Ã¦sthetic history--Criticism as
philosophy--Sensibility and intelligence.
"The identification of history and philosophy, in the form in which"
"we have expounded it in the preceding chapter, is the turning point"
of Croce's thought; the system which in the first three volumes of
the _Filosofia dello Spirito_ had still a somewhat static and rigid
"appearance, is really set to movement, animated as if by a new and"
"intenser life, since its implicit dynamism is made explicit in the"
"fourth and concluding volume. To Croce himself, the whole of his work"
"appears no longer as a system, but as ""a series of systematizations,"""
"and his _Filosofia dello Spirito_, as a series of ""volumes on the"
"problems slowly gathering in his mind since the years of his youth."""
"No wonder, therefore, that his later work should contain ""thoughts"
"that break the bars of the so-called system, and give, to a close"
"scrutiny, new systems or new 'systematizations,' since always the whole"
"moves with every one of our steps."" No wonder that he should feel that"
he will continue to philosophize even if one day he shall abandon
"""philosophy,"" ""as this is what the unity of philosophy and history"
"implies: that we philosophize whenever we think, and of whatever object"
"and in whatever form we may think.""[1] And in fact, in these last few"
"years, Croce has given many a severe shock to the faithful worshippers"
"of his system, sometimes by extending his tolerance, or even his"
"approval, to types of speculation apparently remote from his own, but"
"in which he recognises, under a radically different aspect, some of"
"""Indeed!""--Alwyn's glance swept over him with a faint, cold scorn"
"--""And what religion do the scientific and cultured classes propose to"
"invent as a substitute?"""
"""There's no necessity for any substitute,""--said the gentleman rather"
"impatiently.. For those who want to believe in something supernatural,"
"there are plenty of different ideas afloat, Esoteric Buddhism for"
"example,--and what is called Scientific Religion and Natural"
"Religion,--any, or all, of these are sufficient to gratify the"
"imaginative cravings of the majority, till they have been educated out"
"of imagination altogether:--but, for advanced thinkers, religion is"
"really not required at all."" [Footnote: The world is indebted to Mr."
"Andrew Lang for the newest ""logical"" explanation of the Religious"
"Instinct in Man:--namely, that the very idea of God first arose from"
the terror and amazement of an ape at the sound of the thunder! So
choice and soul-moving a definition of Deity needs no comment!]
"""Nay, I think we must worship SOMETHING!"" retorted Alwyn, a fine satire"
"in his rich voice, ""if it be only SELF!--Self is an excellent"
"deity!--accommodating, and always ready to excuse sin,--why should we"
"not build temples, raise altars, and institute services to the glory"
and honor of SELF?--Perhaps the time is ripe for a public proclamation
"of this creed?--It will be easily propagated, for the beginnings of it"
"are in the heart of every man, and need very little fostering!"""
"His thrilling tone, together with the calm, half-ironical"
"persuasiveness of his manner, sent a sudden hush down the table. Every"
"one turned eagerly toward him,--some amused, some wondering, some"
"admiring, while Villiers felt his heart beating with uncomfortable"
"quickness,--he hated religious discussions, and always avoided them,"
"and now here was Alwyn beginning one, and he the centre of a company of"
"persons who were for the most part avowed agnostics, to whose opinions"
"and sensory nerves, its actions are similar to that of alcohol, but more"
"prompt and less protracted; it is eliminated quickly, chiefly by the"
lungs.
"When inhaled, it first causes irritation of the fauces, a sense of"
"strangulation and cough, then a stage of excitement in which the visible"
mucous membranes are flushed and the respiration and pulse quickened; a
"convulsive stage generally follows, with rigid muscles and respiration"
"stertorous; this subsides and complete insensibility is established, the"
muscles being relaxed and the reflexes abolished; in fact all of the
"functions of the body are suspended, except respiration and circulation."
"If the inhalation be continued these too become paralyzed, death usually"
resulting from slow paralysis of respiration (chloroform paralyzes
quickly); the heart pulsating long after breathing has ceased. Atropine
"hypodermically is the best antagonist to the toxic effects of ether,"
also artificial respiration and injections of brandy.
"USES OF ETHER.--When mixed with alcohol, as the spirit, ether mixes"
readily with water. It is excellent in indigestion with flatulence; it
"checks gastric fermentation, expels the gas and overcomes irregular and"
"violent gastro-intestinal movements; hence, is also very good in"
"spasmodic colic. In spasmodic colic, best to combine with cannabis"
indica or belladonna. When used as a vermifuge it should be followed by
a purge. Used diluted one to ten to dislodge worms in the rectum. A most
reliable remedy for collapse. Ether and alcohol are indicated in
"parturient paresis, ether with aqua ammonia may be used intravenously"
when the cow is unable to swallow. Sulphuric ether and alcohol or whisky
"are also good in parturient eclampsia of bitches, though aromatic spirit"
"of ammonia is better; for chills, spirit of nitrous ether; also useful"
in convalescence from debilitating disease. Ether is a very good remedy
"in Thumps. Ether may be used for local anesthesia, applied as a spray,"
preserved a very large piece of the true cross upon which Christ was
"crucified, brought to Scheyern in 1156 by Count Conrad, the Crusader,"
"who afterwards entered the monastery as lay-brother, and lies buried"
"near the altar upon which the sacred relic is preserved."""
"Also the following passage from his letter of July 12th, written from"
Eichstadt:
"""I remained the guest of Prince Ahrenberg for the night, and early"
"in the morning, accompanied by some Benedictine students, I made a"
pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Walburg. Above the altar is the large
silver receptacle into which flows the miraculous oil from her sacred
"relics, which is known the world over."""
[Sidenote: What America Needs is Some Relics.]
"Writing from Vienna, July 20, 1903, concerning the imperial palaces,"
"he says, ""They are awfully big and grand, and cost a lot of good"
"people's money,"" but adds that ""the pride and glory of Vienna"" is the"
"Cathedral, and then exclaims: ""How often have I wished we could have"
"some such church in ----, so that our good people who cannot visit the"
achievements of Catholic life in Europe could form some idea of the
"greatness of the religion of their fathers!"""
One hesitates to differ from so good an authority on such matters as
"this bishop, but really would he not agree, on reflection, that what"
this benighted and decaying country of ours needs to bring it up to a
"level with Italy and Austria and Spain is not a big church, but some"
"relics? Would not some miraculous oil, or some wonder-working bones, or"
"a piece of the true cross, or one of the nails, if placed on exhibition"
"here attract far more attention than a big church, and enable ""our good"
"people who cannot visit the achievements of Catholic life in Europe"""
greater expectation indulged in with regard to probable advance in
"active surgical treatment, and in none did greater disappointment lie in"
store for us.
"Wounds of the solid viscera, it is true, proved to be of minor"
importance when produced by bullets of small calibre; but wounds of the
"intestinal tract, although they showed themselves capable of spontaneous"
"recovery in a certain proportion of the cases observed, afforded but"
"slight opportunity for surgical skill, and results generally deviated"
but slightly from those of past experience. Such success as was met with
depended rather on the mechanical genesis and nature of the wounds than
"upon the efforts of the surgeon, and operative surgery scored but few"
successes.
It is true that to the Civil Surgeon accustomed to surroundings replete
"with every modern appliance and convenience, and the possibility of"
exercising the most stringent precautions against the introduction of
"sepsis from without, abdominal operations presented difficulties only"
faintly appreciated in advance; but this alone scarcely accounted for
the want of success attending the active treatment of wounds of the
intestine when occasion demanded. Failure was rather to be referred to
"the severity of the local injury to be dealt with, or to the operations"
"being necessarily undertaken at too late a date. Many fatalities, again,"
"were due to the association of other injuries, a large proportion of the"
wound tracks involving other organs or parts beyond the boundaries of
the abdominal cavity.
The frequent association of wounds of the thoracic cavity with those of
the abdomen afforded many of the most striking examples of immunity from
serious consequences as a result of wound of the pleura. It must be
conceded that in a large number of such injuries only the extreme limits
"of the pleural sac were encroached upon, yet in some the tracks passed"
"relating to, or done, or to be done under the contract as may be"
required by the Secretary of State:
"(2) If he gives such security, and takes and permits to be taken"
"such other measures, if any, as the Secretary of State may"
"prescribe for ensuring that such ship shall not be despatched,"
"delivered, or removed without the license of Her Majesty until the"
termination of such war as aforesaid.
[Sidenote: Presumption as to Evidence in case of Illegal Ship.]
9. Where any ship is built by order of or on behalf of any foreign state
"when at war with a friendly state, or is delivered to or to the order of"
"such foreign state, or any person who to the knowledge of the person"
"building is an agent of such foreign state, or is paid for by such"
"foreign state or such agent, and is employed in the military or naval"
"service of such foreign state, such ship shall, until the contrary is"
"proved, be deemed to have been built with a view to being so employed,"
and the burden shall lie on the builder of such ship of proving that he
did not know that the ship was intended to be so employed in the
military or naval service of such foreign state.

"guns, or by the addition of any equipment for war, increases or"

Derek is mad at me.
He's not gonna come tomorrow.
I want him to be there.
lneedhim to be there.
I just want someone there who loves me.
I love you.
Whoa !
Hey.
Why are you so quiet ?
I don't feel like talking.
"Derek, there's something I oughta tell you."
I said something to Sara.
What ?
What did you say ?
Stuff.
About how maybe Nikki had a point about black men and white women.
What ?
You said what ?
I suppose.
Always managed to find a bit of money from somewhere.
Do you know his name?
Aye.
Said his name was...
T Dan Smith?
No.
Richard.
Richard Grainger.
"But when you find him, tell him there's £2.10 to come back on that."
~ He won't be collecting it.
~ Off the cliff?
"Something like that, yeah."
"~ It's all part of the job, pet lamb."
"~ It isn't, actually."
~ I had to do it.
"~ Oh, please don't tell me this is character-building because you're living proof that it's not."
I could have you disciplined for that.
"~ Go on, then."
~ Lovers' tiff?
"Right, guv, there's three Richard Graingers in the Newcastle area."
"One is four years old, one's 78 and the other one is alive and well and works at The Ministry in Longbenton."
"So, the dead man's not from the area, then?"
Do I amuse you?
"What, is this that T Dan Smith blokey again?"
"He's called Richard Grainger now, is he?"
"Are there any chocolate biscuits, pet?"
What?
What's funny?
"Grainger Street, Grainger Town, Grainger Market."
~ Yeah?
~ Richard Grainger.
-She kissed me.
-That makes me feel so much better!
-lt didn't mean anything!
-The hug or the kiss?
-Neither.
-lt meant your arms around her body.
-lt meant her tongue in your throat.
"-Well, it was her tongue- l don't wanna hear this!"
-Sorry.
Stop.
-Let go of me.
-Just listen to me.
Why should I?
You lied to me.
-l didn't think it would happen again.
-You were wrong.
-l didn't want to embarrass her.
"-What are you talking about, Pacey?"
This your boss hitting on you.
"If you wanted to stop it, you could have."
And you didn't because you like it.
You are attracted to her and-- lt's really obvious to me.
"If you didn't want her to hit on you, why didn't you quit?"
Because maybe I need this job.
I'm not exactly rolling in money here.
I can't afford a place to live.
I'm not a rich college girl who can quit when the mood strikes me.
That's cool.
You know what?
"Screw the girl, keep your job."
Have your cake and eat it too. lt's fine!
You're still here.
"I should bring him the fuckin' helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am."
"Come on, let's go inside."
"Yeah, it's gone."
-l don't hear anything.
-Let's go back to your mother's.
-They all right?
-They're great.
Didn't I say you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?
Yeah. I need a hit.
Want to see helicopters?
"Come on, I'll show you helicopters."
"I've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you."
I had to get home and get the package ready for Lois to take on her trip.
"Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give the package a whack with quinine."
"Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass."
"I had the cooking to finish, and I had to get Lois ready for her trip."
-lt's Sandy.
What the fuck is this?
-She's a pain in the ass.
-When are you coming over?
-ln an hour.
"-You staying tonight, right?"
-l can't. I got my brother tonight.
"Come on, stop."
Stop.
"We'll talk about it later, okay?"
Good-bye.
-Hello?
-It's me.
You ready?
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
And I got my period at a very young age.
"Oh, my God,"
I-I got to get out of here.
I-I can't breathe.
I don't know why I let myself get close.
"Christine, hold on."
I don't want to hear any more jokes.
"Come on, you joke about New Christine all the time."
"Like how she's so dumb, she has to take off her shirt to count to two."
"Or when you killed that moth, and you said she moved up on the brain donor list."
"Well, that's different."
That's funny.
"Anyway, it's not just your lame jokes, Richard."
It's everything.
It's the pancakes and the princess and the periods.
She's not my daughter.
I don't want to be her mother.
I thought you liked Papa Jeff.
I do.
I did.
I-I don't know.
I just...
I've just got to get home.
Wait.
What do I tell people?
I don't know.
Just tell them I got sick.
That was my mother-in-law.
She had to leave.
Her broom was double-parked.
It's funny.
"Oh, I'm glad you're home."
Me?
No.
I'd make a terrible husband.
Huh.
All men say that.
"Even I say that, and I have 1 0 children and 43 grandchildren."
But you didn't come all the way out here just to hear an old man bragging.
"Well, Rick sent me."
I'm looking for a woman.
"You don't look like you need any help, but the best one I got just went in for the beer."
"Oh, no."
"See, you don't understand."
I'm not just lookin' for any woman.
"I mean, not that Kiki's any woman."
She's beautiful.
"I'm sure she's a special, sweet girl."
"Hey, brahda, just kidding."
Just kidding.
"Who's this wahine, this woman, you're looking for?"
- Did you ever hear of the Wiki-Wiki Club?
- Sure.
I was the bartender there... from '39 to '43.
Good club.
High-class wahines.
Not like the girls working the streets today.
- Did you know many of the women who worked there before the war?
"- Hey, brahda, I knew them all."
- You know what I mean.
- How 'bout this one?
Her name was Diane Westmore.
She disappeared in the attack in '41 .
"Sorry, brahda."
Where is she?
You go to hell!
You gonna burn.
- Garcia.
"- [Garcia] Friends, we're on three-way."
What's going on?
"Hotch, we found some pictures of Kaman's girlfriend at his apartment."
[Garcia] So I blew up those pictures.
"In one of them, she appears to be in a restaurant."
"So I zoomed in on the sign that says ""O'S,"""
cross-checked that with restaurants in the area.
There are five diners.
"Three are in the suburbs, two are in Highland Park, ...and one is in Rivertown."
- [Hotch] What's the name?
Jay-Mo's.
And this appears to be Kaman's and that girl's favorite place 'cause all the pictures were taken there.
- Have you heard of Jay-Mo's?
- It's a few blocks from here.
"Good work, Garcia."
We're on the way.
"You're sick, Kaman."
We done talking!
This ain't the way.
Then tell me where she is.
"If she ain't with you, I know where she is."
[Man] Don't do it.
Leave Tracy alone.
Kaman... [shuddering breaths]
It's too late for her.
And it's too late for you.
Kaman!
"[Garcia] Hotch, a fire alert just went out."
"She said, ""I thought you were going to..."" What?"
"It sounds like, ""I thought you were going to Star City."""
DUD:
"And then the other girl says ""I am..."" Something."
Play that again.
(DISTORTED) What are you...
"Hey, girl, I thought you were going to Star City."
LILA:
"I am, tonight."
It does sound like Star City.
"""I thought you were going to Star City."""
"Dud, check this out."
Robbery arrest from '79.
"""In case of emergency, notify..."""
"""Jeremiah Malcolm."
"""Relationship, Uncle."
"""Star City, Arkansas."""
"Well, I'll be damned."
DALE:
Jimmy...
"Jimmy, you there?"
JIMMY ON RADIO:
"Yeah, Dale."
Come on back.
"Yeah, listen, I'm just coming back from the courthouse."
I checked the records on Ray Malcolm.
"He was born here all right, but he hasn't lived here in 20 years, so I'm heading out to the uncle's place right now."
I want you to do me a favor.
Call Charlie and tell him to come to work early tonight.
Tell him I'm going to stay out there waiting in case those folks show up.
"If they do, man, we're going to be laying for them."
"Damn, this could be a big one."
"I don't know, kid."
I'm too old for you.
I'm 31.
How old are you?
Almost 17.
"Means when I'm 21, you'll be almost 36."
That ain't so bad.
"- Edgar, I have to pee."
- God!
"How are you back there, Tillie?"
"- Hey, I'm pulling."
You talk.
- It hurts too much.
You talk.
It's hard for me.
I haven't had a lot of practice at it.
"When I was a kid up in Michigan, we'd go hunting."
For three days we'd not say ten words to each other.
Everybody just does what has to be done.
- Never told you about my first instructor.
- No.
His name's Sloaniger.
"God, he could talk."
"He'd yell at me, scare me to death."
"I was all thumbs for a while, the way you are."
"Dammit, he stuck with me."
"You know, he finally sent me off soloing."
I cried.
It's true.
"Before, I never felt I belonged anywhere and my parents didn't bother with me."
I kinda grew up all over the place.
That day I was up there by myself and I was just... weaving through clouds and...
"No, he wasn't there."
He really was a bus driver.
It looks like he got sick and quit about a week ago.
And what is he doing now?
I don't know.
"If he's sick, where could he have gone?"
You look sick too.
You should go home and get some rest.
I'll take you.
"I'm not going to go home, I'm going to see my mother."
"Well, I'll take you there."
Pull yourself together.
Let's go.
No one's here.
Woman Come in.
Where's my mother?
She just stepped out.
Is she going home?
"She did say that she'd be going home, yes."
This is a nice studio.
It has your mother's mark on it.
When did I last see her dance?
Hmm...
It must have been just as the Pacific War was starting.
That's right.
"When the war got worse, she stopped dancing in public."
She was dancing with Kayama-sensei.
Your mother's dancing was beautiful!
"You've danced with Kayama-san, too haven't you."
"Yes, many times."
He took me to many ballet performances.
"You can't forget Kayama-sensei, can you?"
You know I got to go do this thing.
Where are my keys?
Over there.
It's a mess. lt's like a pig pen.
"What do you think I got you the dishwasher for, huh?"
I hate doin' the dishes...
Fucks with my nails.
You gotta be smart.
Look at all this powder around here.
It's enough to put us away forever.
Henry..stop.
Loosen up.
What are you doing?
You don't have to go anywhere.
Make them wait.
Nobody knows for sure just how much was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid at the Lufthansa cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport.
"The FBI says $2,000,000, Port Authority Police say $4,000,000."
"The city park says $5,000,000"
Those son-of-a-bitches!
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.
It looks like a big one.
Maybe the biggest this town has ever seen.
"Come here, you!"
Come here!
Look at this genius.
This genius!
"Merry Christmas, Jimmy!"
-Who's this?
-That's my wife.
"Come here. I want to show you something, Jimmy."
Isn't she gorgeous?
I bought it for my wife. lt's a coupe. I love that car.
I've always been loyal to you.
What is this?
So...you're staying?
"Yes, I'm staying."
What do you want me to do?
"Hey, Anthony."
How would you like it if I taught you how to catch the really big fish?
-Would you like that?
-Okay.
"You know, when I was your age,"
I went out fishing with all my brothers and my father.
Everybody.
I was the only one that caught a fish.
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?
"Every time I put the line in the water I said a Hail Mary and every time I said a Hail Mary, I caught a fish."
Do you believe that?
It's true.
That's the secret.
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.
What else have you got?
Everything will be okay.
-Did my brother go back?
"-Yeah, don't worry."
"He's ten times tougher than me, my brother."
He's old-fashioned.
"He didn't want dinner, just wanted to go home."
That's my brother!
Nothing could get him away from that two-mule town.
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.
You folks will be seated right here in passenger car one with the big grapes.
And I'm gonna take these little raisins back to the end of the vine.
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye!
Whoa!
It's the biggest chocolate fountain on a train in North and South America.
The world's biggest is in Guatemala.
I did not know chocolate came from fountains.
I want to put my head in it.
And my feet.
"Ethan, thank you very much for the guided tour."
"Uh, looks like we'll be setting up shop here for the day."
For your troubles.
"Uh-uh, no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no... no."
"Oh, here you go, one more for you."
"Uh, kids... no."
I'm sorry.
"Okay, one more for you."
Oh.
"Ye... actually, uh..."
"Thank you, Ethan."
if you could put that down.
"Kids aren't allowed anywhere near the buffet, or the passenger cars."
But you are absolutely welcome to...
the Juice Caboose!
"Ugh, what a dump."
"Hey, there's someone there."
Regular Sized Rudy?
"Louise, Gene, Tina..."
what are you doing here?
"Hold on, Beanbag, I'll be right back."
I know these guys from school.
"All right, you then."
"- Uh, Wendy?"
"- Hi, Stan."
"Look, I just want you to know."
"If you want to, you know, be with that Briden kid, then you should."
What?
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
"- Stan, that's ridiculous."
- It is?
I would never leave you for Briden.
- Really?
"- No way, that'd be stupid."
I wouldn't have chance with Briden he could have any girl he wants.
"There you go, feel better, p-p-pal?"
What am I supposed to do?
I can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.
"I mean, Wendy says she'll never leave me for him."
But what if she just doesnt wanna hurt my feelings.
"She said he could get any girl he wants and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl."
This is all so crazy.
"I mean, really, how could my day get any worse?"
No-no.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
"No, fuck off, I'm not doing it."
"Oh, geez, you're no fun."
"- Hey, Briden."
- Hey.
"- Hi, Briden."
- Hi.
"- Hey, Briden."
- Hey.
"OH, GOD."
"NO PRESSURE, SAM."
WHO WANTS DESSERT?
SAM.
COME IN.
POLLAN'S CALLING A PRESS CONFERENCE FOR NEXT WEEK.
THOUGHT YOU SAID WE HAD A YEAR.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THOUGHT.
I COULDN'T HOLD HIM OFF ANY LONGER.
"WELL, WHAT ABOUT STIEGEL?"
AM I SUPPOSED TO DROP THE CASE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S LAP?
POLLAN'S GOT CANCER.
AND IT'S GETTING WORSE.
I'M -- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
"LOOK, SAM, I-I KNOW YOU WANTED TO TRY THAT CASE,"
"AND I RESPECT YOU FOR THAT,"
That's the one.
He was convinced that the Holy Grail was there.
For the love of Christ.
"Yes, he was looking for that too, don't doubt it."
"-The Nazis believed in the power of relics, the lance with which Longinus pierced Christ or the Arc of the Covenant."
I've heard of that.
Someone wants to rewrite history and we won't allow it.
"Ernesto, you speak German."
You should go immediately with Irene to Madrid in the 40s.
and find out what Himmler wants.
I suppose he'll be staying at the Ritz.
"Yes, that hasn't changed."
For the moment.
(MAN) Welcome to Spain
"""Willkommen in Spanien""."
-Danke.
"It's not like this is my spot, this is Seo Yoon Jae's spot."
I'm sure that perfect Seo Yoon Jae will take care of it.
Eat slowly.
It's hot and spicy.
I can't eat this.
Are you going to die if you eat it?
Keep it down and be quiet!
Yoon Jae...
"The food must be spicy for you, so how about a nice refreshing beer?"
Huh?
Alcohol?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
I'm not going to die if I drink it.
Father...
Yoon Jae has to drive.
Da Ran...
I don't have a car because it was in the accident.
Yoon Jae...
"You're not even well after the accident, so you shouldn't be drinking."
"I think if I have one drink, it'll help me fall asleep easily."
"-Please give it to me, father-in-law."
"-Dad, dad...!"
Me too.
Alcohol for an 18 year old minor?
No way!
A kid can't drink!
You can't...!
No one's going to deny that you're a teacher...
That's right.
"Since I'm a teacher, I can't watch a student drink alcohol."
You don't have to take me back...
NiaII?
NiaII.
"You know, sometimes when it gets really smelly, NiaII doesn't admit it."
-Do you know what I mean?
-hold on.
Who's the first to admit their farts?
You should be proud of a smell like that.
-It was a creeper.
"-No, it wasn't."
"Man, I would admit that smell."
Let's call it.
"NiaII, NiaII you've been outed."
Zayn.
"I hate to do this, dude."
I just only need you for a bridge.
What time is it now?
You've been asleep for 1 0 minutes.
"-I'm sorry, dude."
"-No, I'II get up."
AII right.
I appreciate it.
Recording this third album has been extremely hard.
We've been waking up in the morning and going straight to the studio.
Then going to the arena  doing a show.
And then going straight back to the studio after a show.
So it's been really tough for us this time.
AII of my 1 0 minute slumber.
"We have to get "" Best Song Ever."""
"It felt like it was the next morning and you were already waking me up and I was like, ""Oh, my God."""
"One, two, three."
"Give me one time short on the ""ever."""
My bad.
"Hey, mi amor!"
"When you're finished playing with the kids, come play with me."
Where is the car?
I got a guy tuning her up in Yonkers.
Going out to the track next weekend.
I'm ready for Le Mans.
You ready to come with me?
Take a chance?
- I can't leave the kid by himself.
"- Excuses, excuses."
You're just fooling around with that register.
"- I have to pay you back, right?"
- That's right.
Good morning!
"The light, Mag."
I'm trying to finish this.
"- Good morning to you, too."
"- Hey, hey, muñeca."
Buen día.
What is it with these space chicks and the hugest tetas I've ever seen in my life?
What happened to the eggs?
The eggs I asked you to bring home last night?
Those eggs?
- I guess they're at the bodega.
- I guess so.
Why don't we go out for breakfast?
We haven't done that in a month.
- I've got to work.
- I thought you were hungry.
"I am, but-- hey, why don't you get the eggs?"
I've got to pick up beads for the dress.
You can't do me a favor?
"Now here I am, and here I'm gonna stay!"
So think it over.
What are you doing here?
"Franz, come home!"
Why that look?
What's wrong?
- It's not a woman's business.
Things will get better.
You think so?
"I've starved and frozen many a time, but things always turned out fine."
So you're Mieze.
I was Franz's girlfriend before.
I'm Cilly.
I don't know a thing about Franz.
"Oh, don't you look smart!"
- What do you want to know?
- Everything!
A guy with one arm ― out of the question!
Buy him a barrel organ or give him a couple marks.
We've got to watch out for him.
You know why.
What good's a guy with no arm?
- Or a guy with no brain!
- Huh?
You can't see he's come to his senses.
He just wants to spy on us!
Rubbish!
I know what he wants.
"I'll try him out, and I'll be responsible."
"Mieze, you've got to watch out for him."
They make him do anything they want.
"I'll get a job, if I have to be an organ grinder."
(grunting) And here's baby boy number one.
I understand you've decided to name him Stewie.
One more to go.
And here he... oh.
"Oh, dear."
"Oh, no, did Dave not make it?"
"Okay, Meg, I've cleaned your room and I did your homework."
Can I be done now?
"Oh, no, there's a lot more things"
I need you to do for me.
There are?
Like what?
"Well, now you have to watch"
An Officer and a Gentlemen with me.
And that's it?
(laughs) No.
"At the end, when Richard Gere carries Debra Winger out of the paper mill, you have to read what's on this index card."
(on TV): ♪ Love lift us up where we belong... ♪
(crying)
"That's going to be you some day, Meg."
I know it will.
I just know it will.
"Okay, Chris, I want to wear contacts, but I'm too squeamish to put them in myself, so you need to help me."
Really?
Is it that hard?
My eyes are too sensitive.
It's like they overreact or something.
Okay.
"Ah, what happened to your eye?"
!
Don't worry about it.
Just put the lens in.
This is where I was in foster care.
"Oh, sorry."
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
It's not luck.
"I mean, you got out of here because you're very talented and people love you and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
"No, hey, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
"Don't buy all the hot dogs, okay?"
I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the cat-lady sketch."
We're two minutes short!
[Cats meowing]
"[Scratchy voice] So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurlene Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
I cast that cat myself.
"Why, they are my..."
Aah!
Ow!
[Peanut growls] Oh!
I don't know what the problem is.
"Okay, sweet, yes."
Best?
I don't think so.
It's 1 0 after 7. I have to go to work.
Just give me one good reason why we shouldn't.
"God, it's a hundred degrees in here, and I'm about to die."
You're trying to change the subject.
I can't breathe.
"Listen, you can be honest with me."
"No, I am being honest, I can't breathe."
Michael.
I'm not budging till you give me a good reason why we shouldn't.
-Because you've gone completely mad.
"-Come on, no muss, no fuss?"
No family... .
"Yeah, okay, they might be a little surprised."
"You think? "" Hi, Mom, hi, Dad, guess what I did today?"""
-They'd get over it.
"-No, actually, I don't think mine would."
"-Well, they'll have to, because I love you."
-Michael.
It's a great story for our grandchildren.
They'll think we're crazy.
-We would be crazy.
-Do you love me?
"Yes, I do."
"See, you already said, I do."
"That settles it, that settles it."
-We're getting hitched today.
"-Wait, wait, not so fast."
Will I have a bouquet?
I'm Eric Stoltz.
Alex is Watts.
Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones.
"Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz."
So Amanda Jones is Conor?
I guess.
At first.
"Now men in general, but that's not the point."
The point is he's into me.
I knew there had to be some reason why he was spending that time with you.
I know.
It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.
Signs.
Love signs.
You gotta tell me about the signs.
I love signs.
First they were small.
"At first when I called, he said, ""Good to hear from you."""
- Totally good sign.
- Right?
And then the next time I called he was with a woman but he took the call and we talked for a while.
- You know it was a woman?
"- Called her ""babe."""
"Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman to go talk to another woman unless he's..."
And it gets more obvious.
"I mean, please."
There was no guy he was gonna fix me up with.
The fix-up was him.
No.
Yes.
He shows up without this fictitious Bill character.
Thanks!
We might have a chance at winning now!
Bridon!

"Dad, I was just messing around."
I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there!
You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
"Hey, your kid is really good at this."
"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole!"
"Just go easy on him, huh?"
You know what this means?
!
It means you're about to get slapped.
So you better shut up!
"If he wants to play ball, you should let him."
I'll do it!
I'll slap the shit outta you!
He's just a kid.
You don't tell me how to raise my son!
I'll slap it again.
"Dad, stop!"
You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself!
"There, there's another slap."
Maybe you'll think next time you act you---
"Slap it, I slap it!"
"Ow, Dad!"
"Dad, you're hurting me!"
"Shut up, Bridon!"
"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?"
"Get outta my way, Mackey!"
We put a thank-you note on the sleeve.
There you are.
What you doing?
Puttin' me name on the sleeve!
Telling King Gob here I gave you the hand!
"Why not take an advert out in ""Loot""?"
"""Moz supplies body parts""!"
"- Shit, man!"
Where'd you get it from?
- I found it in the kitchen.
End of story.
How can it be end of story?
"I mean, whose hand is it?"
The one a bloke killed over the road.
Mrs Slocombe dragged the hand in.
OK?
"Three little words, Moz?"
999.
Three more.
"Fuck off, Kuldip."
"I didn't want the police here, so I gave it to Sonny and Cher."
- Nobody's gonna believe this.
"- No, 'cause you're not telling anyone about it."
The four of are gonna keep the whole thing under wraps.
There's gonna be big posters of it everywhere.
The record company's giving us a big push.
"I'll give you an even bigger one in a minute, knob-head!"
We could all go to prison for this.
Not me!
I'm not involved.
I've got me records to think of.
"- Hey, d'you need any remixes done?"
"Well, yeah, you know."
"I wanna be a doctor, but I gotta get into college fiirst."
What kind of doctor ?
Pediatrician.
I like kids.
- Do you have any ?
- No.
Do you ?
"Oh, I didn't-- l wasn't trying to be smart, Derek."
Wouldn't be the fiirst time.
"Screw you, I'm brilliant and cool."
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
Wow.
"That was cute, that little thing you did."
Can you show me again ?
- What was that shit you just did ?
- Rond dejambe attitude.
- Ballet. I used to dance.
- You used to dance ?
"Used to, as in don't anymore and no, I don't want to talk about it."
"So, is that why you brought up that rond dejambe attitude shit... because you don't want to talk about it ?"
It's really not a big deal.
I think it is.
"This club was so slamming, Lindsay, the dancing. I'm gonna go again."
You are ?
"Well, have you seen anybody get shot yet ?"
What ?
"No, I didn't see anyone get shot yet."
"God, I didn't move to Bosnia."
"Well, I'm still going to pray foryou."
"Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking ghetto."
- Cut it out!
- You're doing good.
- I know.
I've been on ice before.
I like your army jacket.
Is it from a real dead guy?
You're funny.
"Hey, you want to come back to my house and watch TV or something?"
- Really?
- My mom punched a cop so she's gone for a few days.
Uh...
"Yeah, sure."
Whatever.
Thank you so much!

"Leave us alone, Jimmy!"
"Oh, one lucky punch and you think you're tough now?"
It wasn't lucky.
It's such a blessing to have a husband who's so happy.
He's always singing.
- He loves to color my hair and do my...
"- Ginny, please stop."
"I'm really glad you and Greg are happy, but we are not doing well, okay?"
Frank's depressed right now.
Maybe he should take a Pray Away cruise.
We can barely afford to put gas in the car right now.
"It's just, he's really down in the dumps."
- He's usually so full of life.
"- Well, that's one way of putting it."
I just want my husband back.
Drinks on the house.
"No, have the drink with me."
The drinks are on...the house.
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.
Fucking break up my party.
You been away for six years.
Everything is different now.
"I did my fucking time, Jimmy."
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got fuckin' mouths to feed.
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?
Get the door!
"Let me shoot him in his big, fucking mouth!"
Let's shoot him.
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.
His whole crews gonna be looking for him.
This is fuckin' bad.
What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.
Don't worry. I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him.
"Come on, let's get some more tablecloths."
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
"Henry, go open your trunk."
We'll pick up a shovel at my mother's house.
She keeps a shovel lying' around here somewhere.
"Just keep quiet though, I don't want to wake her up."
Look who's here.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Please don't make me do that.
"Come on, you're a guy."
You do this kind of thing all the time.
What do I do?
I don't know.
Just act sexy.
I can act sexy.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm acting sexy.
Looks like you're trying to get a cobra out of a basket.
"Hey, this move killed for me in the '80s."
That's great.
"If a Duran Duran concert suddenly breaks out, you'll be set."
"All right, I got it, I got it."
Here goes.
Hi.
My name is Christine Campbell.
"I'm divorced, but I get along great with my ex-husband."
We're just better as friends.
"Anyway, I'm not crazy."
I'm very stable.
"In fact, I own my own gym."
It's one of those 30-minute workout places for women.
"I make decent money, though."
But most of it goes to my son's private school.
But I'm not a snob.
I'm very down to earth.
I just want what's best for my son.
"His name is Ritchie, we live in Mar Vista."
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Way to play it cool.
"Thank you, Bobby."
- You working for us tonight?
- I'm filling in for Sweet.
- I guess she's starting to show.
- What do you know?
- What's new?
- Nothing much.
Same as usual.
"You not working at The Vanya, anymore?"
There's been shootings in the bar.
I'm happy not to be working there.
It's way too intense.
That's Disciples turf.
What's going on over there?
There's an American crew moving in.
Trying to shove out the Disciples and grab the street game.
"- American crew, huh?"
- That's what I heard.
- See you later.
I'll buy you a drink.
- For sure.
I saw the news about the shooting in Seattle.
It's so crazy in the States with the guns and everything.
I know.
I'll talk to you later.
I wanna know if you've talked to this guy.
Is he still in town?
I'm supposed to be meeting him any time.
"I wanna know who he is, who he's working for and what his plan is."
"This is happening now, so I'm gonna talk to you later."
It's Rene.
What happened with Reardon the other night?
- What a pro.
What a pro.
- I didn't ask him to do that.
- He's aces.
"- Yeah, I know."
I didn't ask him to do that.
He just did it.
Really thoughtful.
- He was hilarious.
- I didn't dislike smooching Jay.
It's hot.
I'm just gonna say it.
"- Just, you know, say it."
- Just gonna say it out loud.
- that gay band We're Gay.
It was great because...
- We're Gay.
- We're Gay.
We had been shooting for a while when he came in.
And we had all gotten pretty tight pretty fast and it was just cool.
He came in and was just so awesome.
"- Yeah, he jumped in."
- Just jumped right in.
"Oh, man, do you remember Rafi put a bunch of Babybel..."
"- You know, the Babybel cheese things?"
"- Oh, yeah."
They come wrapped in wax and Rafi got a bunch of those and balled them up and put them in the back of Jay's jacket as a joke.
"And Jay was okay, but the wardrobe lady was not pleased with it."
"Oh, man."
"I won't name names, but she was angry."
What happened?
Did they melt all over the place?
I can't eat here.
I got to go someplace where they make food that I like.
"Lemon, let's go."
I will not work with Tracy Jordan.
It's just a rumor.
Have you seen any of his movies?
The guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
"I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters."
"Yeah, ""Black Cop, White Cop."""
No.
"""Who Dat Ninja""?"
"No, he... he had to pretend to be this old lady."
"[High-pitched voice] Ooh, ooh, goodness gracious!"
You hooligans better watch out!
[Normal voice] 'Cause this honky grandma be trippin'!
"Oh, yeah, that movie was hilarious."
"I saw it, like, five times."
Where's the love?
[Indistinct shouting]
Right on.
"Hey, let me get two half a chickens and some pecan waffles."
Nothing for me.
"I had, like, four hot dogs this morning."
"Eat, Lemon, eat."
I hate skinny women.
"Hey, Lana, 10 beers."
"So, Tracy, we should talk about the show."
I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way.
"You know, I want it to be raw, HBO-style content."
"Well, it's not HBO."
It's TV.
And I don't think that it's a good fit.
You don't want to overfeed a puppy.
- Oh.
"-Here you are, sweetheart."
- There you go.
Have a little bit of that.
"-Oh, isn't that sweet?"
- Yes.
-Aw.
Aw...
"Listen, does Ralph know about this yet?"
"Oh, no."
I haven't told him yet.
"Oh, you gonna tell him tonight?"
No.
I think I'll wait till tomorrow morning.
"'Cause, see, the man at the..."
down at the pound
-told me the dog's gonna need shots.
-Uh-huh.
"And Mrs. Manicotti's going to the vet's tonight to take her dog, so she said she'd take him along with hers."
Yeah.
"Well, once Ralph sees that sweet little face,"
-he's gonna love him.
-I hope so.
"Say, Trix, how come you never got a dog?"
On account of Ed.
"Oh, he loves dogs, but for the first few minutes Ed's around a dog, he-he itches and wheezes and sneezes."
"Ooh, it's somethin' terrible."
It's an allergy he's got to anything with fur on it.
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Hey, you want me to drop the dog off at Mrs. Manicotti's for you?"
"Oh, Trix, that would be wonderful."
That was a f unny thing to say.
What was the matter with it?
He fell f or it.
Yes.
He f ound it easy to believe.
Martinelli's beach house fronted on the Gulf.
A big place he'd probably built with hot priorities and cold dice.
"All right, get out, quick!"
- Did they go f or it?
- They said they'd send a police car.
What time have you got?
Five to 9.
Hello?
Hotel Southern?
This is Mr. Murdock.
"Give me the manager, will you, honey?"
"Well, this was gonna be it. lf l got that letter, it was all I needed."
"If everything rolls on rubber, I'll be at your place by 11."
- Can't I wait down the road?
- No.
This is Operation Solo.
I don't want you hurt.
"By the way, where is Surf 3181?"
The penthouse at The Gables.
"You won't take any f ool chances, will you?"
Not any f ooler than I'm taking now doing that.
- Be caref ul.
- Sure.
It's funny how loud crickets sound and the way you feel.
"Funny, too, how a kiss stays on."
The way you can still taste it.
Martinelli was still up there.
"AII right, but you gotta get over it."
So I unwrap the paper... and there she is... with her head held high and her ears perked up.
And there I am smiling.
What happened then?
"still, I gotta be the sad clown."
"A front for my friends, my family."
"You know, a brave front."
I've heard you describe yourself this way.
-About what?
"-Well, I do need a place of my own."
So I decided to take you up on your offer.
And which offer would that be?
To check out your apartment.
"Alex, it's nearly 2 in the morning."
But you said you were a night owl like I am and you walked me home an hour ago. I just figured--
What?
"Oh, my God. I'm sorry."
-lt's okay.
-No.
You know what?
It's not okay. I misjudged this whole thing again.
I'm-- l'm just-- l'm leaving. I feel terrible.
There's nothing for you to feel terrible about.
"Yes, there is."
Okay?
"Here you have this life, this great. wonderful life."
And I keep imposing myself on it.
You are not imposing.
I know that I am.
"You're not, okay?"
It's fine.
Please.
You repair what is broken between you.
Peter?
Dad?
Daddy?
Ralphie's dead.
"Ohh, I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry, bubele."
"Shall we say kaddish for him, huh?"
"What's a ""cad dish""?"
Kaddish is a sacred prayer for the dead that will send Ralphie to a blessed life in Olam Ha-Ba where Hashem will welcome him.
"Please don't talk gibberish to our son, Jacob."
"Sweetie, ralphie died 'cause fish don't live as long as people do."
"We'll get you another one, okay?"
- Tie your shoes.
- I want...
I want Ralphie.
"Well, we'll get you a better one."
What is your problem?
All he needed was a hug.
You're late for the partner's meeting.
"Your shoes are polished, Mr. Myers."
I ironed your blue sea island cotton shirt.
Cufflink choices are here.
"Thank you, Rosalinda."
"Yesterday, I noticed you didn't eat your strawberries..."
I-I don't really like them.
"So, today, I put in bananas and peanut butter, okay?"
You got to promise to eat it.
Daddy?
Mr. Myers?
Bezeh hammaqom tehi b'rakhah v'shalom.
"That means, ""may this home be filled with the blessing of joy and peace."""
Please.
Please let go.
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.
"- I said, what's the count?"
"- Look, I haven't even done anything!"
What's the count?
Plus 18.
"Oh, you've gotta be kidding."
"Congratulations, Ben."
"Sorry, we had to make sure you'd keep the count under pressure."
Welcome to the team.
We didn't mean it.
"It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag."
Fisher and Jimmy have always been the big players.
I want you to take Jimmy's place.
I've never done this.
I know that and I understand.
"But I don't trust the girls, and Choi is, well, Choi."
"Look, I've been teaching for more than 14 years, and I've never had a student as impressive as you."
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?
'Cause you remind me of myself 25 years ago.
You in?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm in."
- Good.
Good.
"There's one more thing, Ben, and this is important."
"We're counting cards, we're not gambling."
We're following a specific set of rules and playing a system.
"Apology, Senator!"
"-Michael, excuse me."
"-Hello, darling."
The children are outside.
We're going.
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.
Rocco?
"I'll be in my room, Mike."
"Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada."
I brought the children to say goodbye to you.
I'm very happy for you.
I always knew you were too smart to let any of them beat you.
-Why don't you sit down?
"-No, I'm not going to stay long."
There are some things I'd like to talk to you about.
"Things that have been on my mind, changes I want to make."
"I think it's too late for changes, Michael."
-I wasn't going to say anything...
"-What do you mean, ""too late""?"
What really happened with Pentangeli?
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.
Where is he now?
"He's on a plane, back to Sicily."
All he had to do was show his face.
"It was between the brothers, Kay."
I had nothing to do with it.
I don't want you going!
"Not you, not the kids."
No.
You're my wife and my children.
You leave that to me.
They found his body at the scene of a car crash just outside St. Albans carrying NIA documents.
He was discharged from the NIA six months ago for psychiatric reasons.
So where'd he get the NIA papers?
Pronto.
You all right?
Yes.
Is Julia with you?
Yes.
Thank god.
"Okay, where are you?"
At home.
Where the hell are you?
Better you don't know.
The police came here looking for you.
They found Paolo's body at your studio.
"Kyra, you know I thought I could leave the past behind."
I know you did.
But why did you run?
It's complicated.
Look I need your help.
I have a Swiss phone number.
"I need you to go on the computer, use reverse directory, see if you can get a, uh, name and an address."
"Kyra, it'll take you ten seconds."
Give me the number.
Got it.
"Christian Lenk,"
"Twenty-one Zermatt Strasse,"
"Zurich, Zero-Five-W."
"Great, okay, now you and Julia need to go away for a couple days."
"Go to the inn where she likes to feed the ducks, you know where I mean."
You are creeping me out.
We gave it our very best.
I'm not sure.
Maybe the police?
Who are you supposed to call when you think someone may have taken their own life?
- Helen?
- Betts!
"I just got home, and I found this."
What?
Look at this.
"Uh, ""nothing to live for,"""
"and then at the ending, when he says about the St. Louis Arch."
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
"Well, he-- he can't mean the thing about the Arch."
You've got to be a sherpa to get up that thing.
"So, where is he?"
I--
Oh.
I didn't hear you girls come in.
Oh.
"Uh, I was just doodling the way a depressed person does."
- Ha!
- How would you even climb up the Arch?
"That was a thoughtless, childish, moronic thing to do!"
"Okay, I'm-- I'm sorry, but... on the other hand, what reason do I have to live?"
I don't know.
Why don't you ask the Arch?
"No, I mean it."
"My kids are gone, I have no wife, even my parents have died."
"I'm... nobody's son, nobody's husband, nobody's father."
But... you are the father of our child.
I'm not even that.
- Peralta...
Holt.
I know you're here.
I'm gonna kill you.
- I don't think so.
- Oh...
"- Put down the weapon, Figgis."
There you go.
"Oh, yes."
I've been waiting for this moment a long time.
You ruined my life.
I had to live in Florida for six months!
- It's the worst.
Have you tried the pizza down here?
"- Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted."
It somehow burned my mouth and is cold at the same time.
But none of that changes the fact that you're about to go to prison for the rest of your life.
"- Drop it, Sherbert!"
- What?
No!
"- I've been everywhere, and I finally spotted your minivan with the New York plates parked around back."
We already got all your friends.
So drop it.
- You don't understand.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.
This is Jimmy Figgis;
he's wanted by the FBI.
"- No, I'm Constantine Binvoglio, and I came here to repair a skee ball machine on the the fritz, but suddenly he's trying to kill me."
- He's lying.
"""Constantine Binvoglio."""
It's clearly a name he just made up.
I'm very impressed.
I call even that thing my brother.
But the Hyung Ahjussi already dumped me.
"You punk, don't even know anything.♬  To be honest, even today I'm thinking of you again I pull out my stash of memories  ♬"

Ah.
Yes.
"WheneverI getin afightwith someone,youalways taketheirside."
You never take my side so that's why you're my husband.
- Cops are coming.
"You want to yell at me some more, or should we both get out of here?"
Neither.
"Hey, Mick."
"Oh, it... it's me."
It's Ray.
I-I thought we should talk.
Drive.
Well you didn't waste any time getting back to your old habits.
I like stealing stuff.
It makes me feel good.
Did you ever think that maybe you weren't meant to do this anymore?
"What do you want, haircut?"
"To apologize, sort of."
For Snart.
"I was the one who was supposed to die,"
"The first time I was introduced to all of them at once, it was crazy."
Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews.
Almost all of them were named Peter or Paul.
It was unbelievable.
"Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew."
And this is Petey.
There must have been two dozen Peters and Pauls at the wedding...
This is Marie.
"...plus, they were all married to girls named Marie."
She looks Italian.
And they named all their daughters Marie.
And this is Pete.
"No, I mean Paulie."
I get confused myself.
"By the time I had met everybody, I thought I was drunk."
"Paulie, you shouldn't have."
Welcome to the family.
Sunday dinner?
So beautiful. I want to cry.
"Karen, here's something to help you get started, huh?"
-The bag.
The bag.
-What bag?
"The bag with the envelopes in it, all the money."
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.
He didn't call?
-He's with his friends.
-What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown-up.
He doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was such a grown-up why doesn't he get you two an apartment.
- All right.
OK.
Spare me the lecture.
I already know what you're gonna say so I'm just going to fast forward through all the bull crap that you're about to...
You should be happy for Justin he's your...
Oh.
"I'm so disappointed in you,"
Danny.
Good night.
Let's get high and watch wrestling.
"To be fair, that is what I say first thing in the morning."
"- Danny, Justin's your best friend."
- So?
It's OK to be hurt that he's leaving.
Don't you understand that this is all a ruse on
Justin's behalf?
He's not even really moving out.
Look.
All these boxes are empty.
See?
Oh.
It's all of his khakis.
- I guess he really is moving out.
- Aw.
"Danny, I know how scary it can be to admit how you really feel."
"I mean look how long it took me to admit how I feel about Burski but now I can look you straight in the eyes and I can say ""I love Burski""?"
You don't even realize you said that as a question.
I really do?
I like him.
I do.
OK.
I like him.
I'd rather keep this monkey - than ruin my life loving a man who plays Batman in ketchup.
Right!
I'll change my mind as soon as the dogs stop barking - the stars fall off the sky and the flames of the world are down.
Did you get it all down?
-He did.
"Women are like that, Jesse."
Your mother said the same when she left me.
I love Haitian manioki.
It's the best.
"I'd like to make a toast with you, Marie-Claude."
Perhaps we'll sing the national song of Haiti together one day.
You're wonderful.
"I don't know you, Dad!"
"-No, you don't."
Where's the toilet?
Pee out the window.
I should brush my teeth.
My fiancée has a cold.
"What's wrong with you, Mom?"
Go back to sleep.
This is it.
What's wrong with Jesse now?
He's so weird.
And you hate him.
Are you taking orders from children now?
You're nuts.
It's too late to regret.
-Right.
Did you say that she can see into my soul?
"Relax, Jesse, and let her look."
Don't hide from her.
"Relax, take it easy."
Lilly do you want to come with us?
Oh yeah that'd be great.
"Pizza and a movie, that totally makes up for making me."
Throw away the college of my dreams.
Just 'cause of your miserable stinking secret!
But you said you were okay with it.
I am.
"I just said I wanted to go, didn't I?"
"-Yeah, right."
-Yeah come on you must be starving.
And I can't wait.
To just go out there and get ripped apart by an angry mob of Hannah fans!
Yeah but who cares about us.
As long as Little Miss Center-of-the-Universe is happy!
-It's always about you!
-Always!
-You!
-You!
-You!
-You!
[Echoing]
So who wants to drive?
Will you stop it?
Come on Lilly just come out and say what you're really thinking.
Well I was thinking:
who wants to drive?
And now I'm thinking maybe I should.
I'm not talking about who's driving.
I'm talking about the secret!
You both hate it and you hate what it's doing to your lives!
Just admit it!
Everything would be so much easier for you if I just told the world who I was!
I checked with Dorothy's boss.
"She was let go last night, but on the application... she listed a motel by the airport."
"Thanks, Trudy."
"Where's the papers, lady?"
What papers?
"Come on, where's the papers?"
What papers?
"We can do this nice or we can do this not so nice, now."
"Where's the papers, lady?"
"Come on, where's the papers?"
Freeze.
Dorothy?
I'm Det.
"Crockett, Miami Vice."
"Everything's okay, open up."
"Wait a minute, Dorothy."
Hold it.
I'm a cop.
Dorothy!
Crockett!
Frank Doss was convicted of murder in 1943.
Served 15 years.
"In 1960, became partner to Johnny Cannata."
"Las Vegas, Atlantic City."
Now they're spearheading the drive for legalized gambling in Miami.
"They've been arrested several times, but never convicted."
Morty Price has been with Cannata and Doss since they began working in Las Vegas.
Dorothy Bain is the question mark.
"Except, we think we know why she might have killed Morty Price."
Annie said Dorothy told her stories about... being beaten by her husband back in New York.
That's what drove her and the baby to Miami.
"I called him there, he was no help."
- What?
"Is it timeless, or is it likely to go out ofstyle in the next 20 years?"
I would say it's a new classic.
But 20 years is a long time.
I think everything's gonna be computerized in 20 years.
- Soup won't be computerized.
- Why not?
It's a liquid.
"Dude, did you just give her the family discount?"
Yeah.
She's my neighbor.
I'm trying to work on my karma.
- Doyou know what karma means?
- Yeah.
It means that she owes me one.
I love you.
I'm not following you.
My car's parked over there.
- In Smart Park?
"- No, on Front Street."
"Oh, I parked in Smart Park."
"So, at the end of the next block we'll separate."
At Tyrone Street.
"Yeah, the ""Ice Land"" sign is halfway."
It's the halfway... point.
Ice Land is-
"It's kind of like that point in a relationship, you know... where you suddenly realize it's not gonna last forever."
"You know, you can see the end in sight."
Tyrone Street.
"Yeah, but we're not even there yet."
We're still at the good part.
We're not even sick of each other yet.
"It's my dad, ok?"
He won't let me.
Why?
I...
"It's ok, just... tell me."
"I know it's not true, but my dad won't let me sleep over at your house because he thinks you're gay."
I know you're not.
I just...
I have to do what he says.
I'm sorry.
What if I was gay?
What do you mean?
Would you not want to sleep over at my house if I really was gay?
Hey.
So... don't worry about last night.
"It was almost curfew, and there was a lot of pressure."
Yeah.
But you still want to... right?
Of course.
"Um, Saturday night, we'll do it the right way, ok?"
"Yeah, I'd like that."
I got it all planned out.
We can go to a really nice dinner.
Totally on me.
"And then afterwards, maybe we can go to the beach."
- The beach?
- Yeah.
What's wrong with the beach?
Have you ever had sex on the beach?
"I know it's supposed to be all romantic and stuff, but there's sand everywhere, in all your business, and bugs."
It's...
It's pretty terrible.
"So, one-way ticket to Peru?"
I'm hitting it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah?
About what you said the other day.
I thought it didn't bother you.
"You know, Sam, I saved your hide back there."
And I saved your hide at that church...
And the hospital.
I may not think things all the way through.
Okay?
"But what I do,"
I do because it's the right thing.
I'd do it again.
And that... is the problem.
"Y-you think you're my savior, m-my brother, the hero."
"You swoop in, and even when you mess up, you think what you're doing is worth it because you've convinced yourself you're doing more good than bad..."
But you're not.
"I mean, Kevin's dead, Crowley's in the wind, uh..."
We're no closer to beating this angel thing.
"Please tell me, what is the upside of me being alive?"
You kidding me?
You and me -- fighting the good fight together.
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ] Okay.
"Just once, be honest with me."
You didn't save me for me.
You did it for you.
What are you talkin' about?
I was ready to die.
I was ready.
"Well, it wasn't just that."
"When we met, it was like fate brought us together."
Now what's it doing?
I'm not a big believer in fate.
"Yeah, well, I hate fate."
"Oh, let's not make it mad, though."
I can't believe this.
I'm gonna take the car to go get some coffee with this guy.
What?
I'll be back soon.
"He's really, reay nice."
And he likes my hat.
Okay.
"- So, you're happy."
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
It's all good.
"I mean, Yonk's a lot older, so we're into different stuff, and-and we have different friends."
"And he's away a lot, promoting the Yonk Allen Barbeque Grill."
Okay.
"But, I mean, how cool is it?"
I'm married to Yonk Allen.
It's-it's awesome.
"Yeah, I mean, he was a huge football star, so, you know, he... got hit in the head a lot."
"But he takes really good care of me, and he's very sweet."
"Sometimes mean, but-but mostly sweet."
"Well, yeah, that's - that's just like your dad."
- Yes.
- Yes.
"Hey, babe."
Time to go to the airport.
I'll be right there.
"No, thanks."
Do you have Pac-Man?
No.
Space Invaders?
No.
Do you have Asteroids?
"No, but my dad does."
He can`t even sit on the toilet some days.
"What do you do here, dale?"
"well, I have a stack of nudie books this high."
She`s beautiful!
would you sell me any of them?
"Shit, no!"
I cherish these things!
I use them a Iot!
How do you use a magazine?
I was getting to that.
"A guy taught me something really neat, last year."
Did you ever bop your baloney?
"I guess we`re 1 1, aren`t we?"
"No, we`re 12 with Aunt Edna."
Aunt Edna?
Is she still alive?
You bet!
I can`t wait to see the look on CIark`s face when he hears that.
She came to help when Eddie ruptured his spleen and she`s been here ever since.
She wanted to go back to Phoenix last year but Eddie wouIdn`t let her.
"Without her social Security, we`d never be able to live like this."
It looks like you`ve really got your hands full.
It`s not so bad!
"Eddie says after the baby comes, I can quit one of my night jobs."
"How do you Iike yours, clark?"
So... are we good?
So-
(SIGHS) He basically knows.
He doesn't know jack shit.
FINN:
"Well, he knows that you have some kind of information."
How long is he going to be content just piggybacking your bets?
I don't know.
Forever?
I got it under control.
"You look like hell, Jasper."
Are you even sleeping?
"You know what, man?"
Get off my dick!
You and Callie both get all this money for doing nothing.
- You should be happy.
- We're all in this.
Callie and I are sharing the risk.
I hope you have a back-up plan in case this thing with your bookie falls through.
I seem to remember you wearing something a little different in tonight's photo.
"Screw you, Jasper."
I'm not going to start as long as he's here.
"Yeah, no, Jasper was just about to take a walk."
Aren't you?
I am?
Yeah.
"Yes, don't forget to come spy on me at 8:00."
(DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS)
So I don't really know what I'm doing here.
You're going to have to walk me through it.
Sure.
"Um, we just need to get you in the same pose in the photo."
Are you crazy ?
It's Jimmy Cooper's flare gun.
I found it in the hall closet when I was looking for rain gear.
"Yeah, but it's not raining."
"Well, this was last November."
What ?
"Jimmy doesn't need it anymore, and it's cold, and it's shiny, and it feels so good in my..."
Here.
You try it.
Eww !
I'm not touching your pistol.
That is stupid and dangerous.
"Oh, my God."
Go 187 on that zombie ass.
It's in the kitchen.
Follow me.
Stop or I'll shoot !
"Oh, my God !"
I've been hit !
Mom ?
Taylor... you shot me !
sorry
I came here because I was worried about you.
"I know, Mom, and it really means a lot to me that you did."
"Save it... that's the last maternal instinct I'll ever have, since you shot me."
It was just a toe nick.
You're totally fine.
Until sandal season !
"Taylor, I'm going to have to see a plastic surgeon right away."
"I already told you, there's no way to get you to the hospital."
You're just going to have to tough it out !
Pancakes is hurt !
Are you all right?
Who did it?
This guy who lives across the street from me that I've known all my life.
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me... I told him to stop.
He didn't stop.
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.
He pushed me out of the car.
You sure you're all right?
Huh?
Why don't you go inside and get yourself together.
Clean up.
"What do you want, fucko?"
"You want some, huh?"
"I swear on my fuckin' mother, if you touch her again, you're dead."
Don't shoot.
Hide this.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
"I know there are women, like my best friends who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them a gun to hide."
But I didn't.
I got to admit the truth:
It turned me on.
Mazel tov!
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.
He's settling down now.
He's married.
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.
And you're still bouncing around from girl to girl.
It was like he had two families.
"No, a cash trail is very fucking bad for us."
- Oh.
"- Hey, hold on there, Hunk of the Month."
"If I'm going down, you're going down, too."
I don't know what this is about.
Good point.
Dan and Amy.
They're getting paid cash from the campaign fund to bring down the bill.
"There, you've been blooded."
So join the circle jerk.
Grab a dick.
Wish I could hear what you were saying over that incessant drilling sound.
- What are you doing?
Shh!
What cash?
What Dan and Amy?
Ben's paying Dan and Amy to lobby against the bill and now there's a cash trail and we're all incriminated.
But you're not.
"Oh, my God, now you are!"
Well done.
Now I feel a lot better.
"Did you know, Tom?"
"Ma'am, I am as shocked as you are."
"Shocked and disappointed, Ben."
"Ma'am, Moyes is voting yes."
Ruiz is voting yes.
This comes down to one vote.
We need Congressman Pierce.
My future depends on that dumb fucking elf?
Jeez... where is he?
I'm so proud of how brave you've been.
"I was looking for some lotion, but they didn't..."
Who's Danny Moore?
He's been talking about a beating on you.
Who is he?
- I don't know who he is!
- That kid you bumped into
- and then called a shortarse.
- That was Jay.
You'll have to go and knock him out now.
- Teach him a lesson.
"- If you see him,"
- tell him it's a mistake.
- I'm not getting involved.
He's from a hard family in Northwood.
His brother did time.
"Oh, Northwood?"
"Been nice knowing you, Si!"
"What's this, my dad's bigger than your dad?"
"What are we, 12?"
"- I think he is 12, actually."
"- You're not scared are you, Si?"
"No, it's just I'm not going to look cool beating up a kid."
- And you couldn't.
"- Yes, I could, can we just leave it?"
I'm not fighting anyone.
"Oh yeah, nice one."
Mature.
"Compared to Simon, my first day was turning out OK."
"After a morning of pretending cars were broken and overcharging middle-class women, we had bonded over a pint."
"Thanks, guys."
That was a much more civilised way to welcome me.
It's shame we won't get to do it again...
"Oh, no!"
And all she wanted was for it to come true.
I bet she would still want it to come true.
She wouldn't want you to give that up.
I know. I just-- l don't think that I can do it without her.
What do you want ?
"Do you wanna do it, Sara ?"
I mean you.
Do you want Juilliard ?
- Yes.
- All right.
"Then, it's on you."
You're the one that's gonna have to make it happen.
You're the one that's gonna have to make the dream come true.
[KeysJingling]
"So, I'll see you tomorrow ?"
Yeah.
I promise not to have a nervous breakdown.
Good night.
Good night.
[Sara] I called Juilliard for an application.
They're holding auditions in Chicago next month.
[Derek] Next month.
That's cool.
"[Sara] I'm out of shape, and it hurts."
"If that's what you call out of shape, what does it take to get you in shape ?"
- Practice.
"- Okay, jog around the room, then."
Do some push-ups.
"I'll sit here, and I'm gonna watch."
That's not how I get into shape.
That's it.
Now shoulders down.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
"Believe me, I could see it coming."
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"- Very soon, but I'll see you before."
- I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
- I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
- Yes.
Has her period come yet?
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Lydia's periods have stopped.
You're right.
But I think we should tell Dr.Vega.
I brought some of my travel guides for Alicia and you.
Thank you.
I've said good-bye to Lydia.
I tried to see Alicia but Dr.Vega and the head nurse were there and I wasn't allowed in.
Is anything wrong?
"No, I think Alicia has got an infection."
Can you take me home?
"All right, then i'll tell you."
Mr. Fisk is backing a show.
Miss mansfield is an actress.
That's all there is to it.
"I've known miss mansfield as long as he has, and i've never known a finer woman."
"No, malicious gossip isn't news."
"I don't think your papers want to print it, boys."
"Thanks, mr."
Boyd.
That's good enough for us.
Yeah.
Thanks.
No offense.
"Good night, miss mansfield."
Good night.
"Thank you, nick."
"That's all right, josie."
What else could i do?
Did you really mean what you told them about me?
No.
I was thinking of jim.
"Ever since i've known you, nick, you've been fighting me because of jim."
"You knew how he felt, and you didn't want to hurt him... so you tried to hurt me."
And you succeeded for a while... till i discovered the reason.
What is the reason?
You're in love with me.
I'm in love with you?
"Why... what do your guests think about all this, mr."
Taylor?
I haven't got any guests except mr.
Drew and colonel fisk and his soldiers.
I don't care what they call the place.
"- I did, sir."
And they won't.
Then why did he come to us for help?
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
He says papers fall from the sky.
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
"Papers say white man long nose, round eyes, called Americans help Montagnards."
But Viet Cong say our papers lie.
"Pardon me, sir."
You like this?
"She's a woman, isn't she?"
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
She said she won't ever take it off.
And don't you take this off either.
Now you make your old granddad bring you back when this is dirty and I'll put a clean one on for you.
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
That's a good girl!
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
"He says the Viet Cong takes all the rice, pigs and chickens and forces the young men to fight."
He hates the Cong.
"Tell him if he'll bring his people in with us that we'll give them protection, money and food."
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
What's he saying?
"He said, ""What's money?"""
How do you answer that?
[SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
KIRBY:
Sergeant McGee?
I think the United States Army can spare a litter.
Admit what I did.
Lily's away on a trip with some friends.
I want to speak with her first.
"After that, I'll speak with the press."
"Hopefully, the fact that there's going to be"
A press conference will be enough
To keep mr.
Gerwin at bay for a day.
I'm gonna miss this place.
Regal man:
Excuse me.
This is for you.
Wow.
"You already have my, uh, $92.18?"
"No, it's just what you gave me yesterday."
I can't keep it.
I don't care what you say.
"You know, uh,"
I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks.
I'm not proud of it.
"It's just, uh, I haven't worked in a while,"
And I was hoping to get a little bit of money coming in.
"But the truth is, your $38 was all I got,"
"And, uh, I didn't set out to swindle little girls."
So you're not a prince?
why are you dressed like that?
Bridgette?
"When you're done with those, would you come help me"
"In the children's section, please?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Um, miss aiken,"
This is prince abantu.
This is cancer.
It's not easy.
"Look, it's more important for me than anyone else here to finish school, OK?"
All I want is to see him go to a university before I die.
I've kept you busy with my problems.
You've come to talk about something.
Did Mert do something bad?
No!
No?
"""Holly Ellenbogen- Some Other Kind of News. """
So.
It's been a while.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it has."
Not since...
I want to say prom night.
Really?
Has it been that long?
"Oh, you know, it's funny."
What's that?
"I just wonder what I'm gonna tell my daughter when she's in high school and she asks me,"
"""Mommy, what was your prom like?"""
"I guess I'll just say, Well, sweetie, I went with this very cute boy who was a wonderful dancer."
And then we went to a party at your Aunt Marcie's house.
"And later that night, I walked into her bedroom, and there he was."
With this other boy from our Spanish class.
Doing all the things
I was finally prepared to do with him.
Rrrah!
"Um, look."
"Holly, I"
- I am so sorry.
Well...
"While you're checking out my body,"
"I wish my spirit would temporarily escape, but I can't, so what to do?"
"If you keep this up, I think my spirit is going to go crazy."
Kang Gyung Joon.
Please take good care of Yoon Jae's body.
To me...
"He's a very, very precious person."
Then...
I'll go to the hospital and check to see if your body is doing well.
Give me your phone.
Phone?
-Who?
-My uncle.
Call him and ask how the situation is over there.
Hello?
"Ah yes, hello."
Is this Gyung Joon's uncle?
"Yes, I see the news has already reached the school."
Gyung Joon has been moved to the Seoul Hankuk hospital.
Yes...
"Then when Gyung Joon wakes up, please call me no matter what time it is."
"Yes, yes..."
Your uncle said he's been moved to a hospital in Seoul.
I heard it all.
This guy's hearing is really sharp.
But anyways...
Do you live here by yourself?
"If your uncle and aunt come, you can't be here in this state!"
I live by myself.
They have no reason to come here.
You can go.
No it's cool.
What's going on?
"Well, um, Nathan's talking about quitting the team."
"And I just, I don't know what to say."
"Yeah, look I could never find the words to get through that big wall that he puts up so I really can't help you out much."
But you're so much better with him than I ever was.
He's lucky to have you.
Thanks.
I don't want to keep you from your practice.
Hmm.
Go Ravens.
"Hey, um, I didn't mean anything, about your mom."
It's cool.
Okay.
You could have told me Travis was a group.
It's not like it's some big secret.
Lucas gave me the weirdest look when I said that.
I felt so stupid.
You're not stupid.
You guys just don't like the same things.
"See, that's the problem."
He brings up art and books and I've got nothing.
- Hey you.
- Hey you.
And you.
"Welcome back, gentlemen."
Lets see how soft you all got after that little hiatus.
Suicides.
Now.
"Better be a basketball in that thing, Jagielski."
"Come on, Coach."
It's either this or I miss practice.
And we'll be here for you when you get out of rehab.
B-But I won't know anyone there.
You know what?
I think it'd be a good idea if Tim dried out a bit.
"(slurping, belches)"
"And Lester, too."
He's an alcoholic.
I'm just addicted to seeing you pretty.
"(hiccups) Oh, Lester!"
"I'd better go, too."
I'm a sex addict.
Carpal tunnel.
(crying)
"Oh, this is so embarrassing."
We're all wearing the same smocks!
We don't belong here.
"I mean, look at all these weirdoes."
I sold my penis for meth.
I got drunk and had sex with my boss's car.
I huff propane.
"And the worst part is, I only took those pills so I could go on that Commodores Gold Record and All-You-Can-Eat Jumbo Shrimps Cruise."
And now I can't go.
"Just don't think about it, C-bro."
Kind of tough not to think about it.
"Hey, what're you guys looking at?"
"No, Shrimpy Dave, don't look!"
Is that shrimp?
I'm off the wagon!
Ew.
I thought he'd be eating it.
"Lord, help Shrimpy Dave."
(slaps) Ow!
Madam you go to bathroom.
No...
"Madam you go to bathroom, go... go..."
lock the door from inside.
Are you Laxmi Narayan?
Yeah.
Are you father of Sonu?
Yeah... you came so early son?
You were in Singapore?
Yeah my work has finished early so i thought...
"Papa doesn't know about bra, pantee and design so you came to tell me."
I am selling undergarment since you were not even wearing it.
"And now you will explain me, now get out."
Out?
Why?
One second...
where are you going?
"Bathroom dad, why you are going?"
To get light... no... now i wont let you get light anymore.
See how thin you have become.
"Do eat or not, now i wont let you go thin never..."
"Dad, please get a side or it will come out."
If went inside mine will be out.
I said no...
Dad what is she doing here?
"Son, she is... you know my nature right?"
Now i know
now why hide from Son.
Your dad with me in this room... was finagling the deal.
What kind of deal?
Should i tell Laxmi Narayan Jee?
"I will tell me he is my son, we talk regularly."
- Right.
- This is Lewis Carroll's mirror.
Alice in Wonderland.
"""Off with their heads""."
"- That's chick lit, right?"
- Chick lit?
"I mean, come on."
Not everything in here is dangerous.
You got that cuddly little ferret from a cooking pot.
"- Yeah, he peed in my shoes."
- That was...
That was me.
- That's funny.
"- So what, are you still mad at Artie?"
"No, I'm not."
- I'm not mad at Artie.
I'm mad at you.
"- No, you're not mad at me."
"- Yes, I am."
- You're not mad at me.
"Because when you're mad at me, your neck gets all long until it looks like that."
It's like a giraffe over here.
"And when you're mad at Artie, your neck gets down over here to the right."
Just like that.
"Look, I know the MacPherson-DC thing is still bugging you, okay?"
But everybody has a past.
"But he lied, Pete."
"Artie's past is treasonous, hazardous, there's a crazy man who wants us dead and he wants the Warehouse for himself."
Would have been nice knowing that going in.
Artie should have told us about MacPherson.
"Yes, yes, I get it."
Daddy issues.
"Aw, good-bye, precious."
"If it wasn't for my Ed's darned old allergy,"
I'd get one just like you.
(chuckles)
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-Okay, Trix."
"Now, listen here, I want to tell you something."
"I have got work to do, and I have to do it right now."
I don't want you getting it into your head that all I have to do all day long is just play with you.
So it's back in the box.
Okay?
There.
Oh...
Don't look so sad about it.
"Come on, we'll go in the bedroom."
(door opens)
"- Hey there, Alice."
"-Oh, hi, Ed."
Aren't you coming home a little early today from work?
"Oh, no, I been, uh, showing up to work an hour early."
- We're breaking in a new man there.
-Oh?
Been with us a week-- he's still wet behind the ears.
(groans)
"Say, tell me, Alice, has Ralph, uh, tried to get in touch... (sharp exhale)"
Excuse me.
Has Ralph tried to get in touch with y... (sneezes)
- No.
Bless you.
-Excuse me.
Has he tried to get in touch with you about anything today?
No.
Then you bring me here?
How can i left you there?
Laxmi Narayan.
Now pain is gone?
Pain has just started.
What is she doing!
Why are you taking off your cloths?
How can i show you then?
No... no!
This is wrong... now i got your nature.
And you know my nature.
Laxmi Jee Relax... that's what happen in this age.
I am sorry... why?
Because of the way talked to you.
When?
When i told you to shoot me.
What was you fault...
I am not like that.
"If i didn't had problem, i would never say like that."
After my father left.
I am all alone.
Have to leave this house too.
"You know, that Mundaya was saying... if i don't pay him the money, i have to marry him."
"Better is that, i should kill myself i will kill you... if you talk like this."
"I am here, here it is, how much you need?"
I bought 25000/- only 25000/-?
"Don't worry... take this chain, worth 24000/- only?"
"Only means, its fake."
Take this ring.
It was for my just wife.
Just wife?
Yeah i just told Mina gay my wife.
Blackjack's a great game.
"No, look, it's easy to learn and there's really not as much strategy to it as people think."
"I grew up on it, actually."
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.
"Every night after dinner, my father and I would play."
"I knew basic strategy before I was, like, nine years old."
"If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream."
And what if he won?
He'd still take me out for ice cream.
"Oh, yeah."
"Sure, yeah, he's your dad."
"Ben, you should feel the thrill of winning more money than you can possibly imagine."
I think you should come to Vegas.
'Cause I'm guessing that you could probably use a break from this place.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Okay.
"If you change your mind, you know where we meet."
Yeah.
You're welcome any time.
"You know, I think the best thing about Vegas is you can become anyone you want."
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.
- No.
- Plus 11.
No.
"- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago."
"- Don't call me ""dude."""
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.
I know you have a regular trusted doctor.
"But if you ever want a second opinion, I'm available."
"Well, I'll remember that."
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Danny.
"He's not here, Uncle Steven."
"You're looking awfully serious, L.B."
I guess.
Are you feeling all right?
"Uncle Steven, is Krystle mad at Grandpa?"
No.
"Krystle loves Grandpa a whole lot, you know that."
But I saw-
"There you are, L.B."
I've been looking everywhere for you.
"Hello, Steven."
"Hi, Krystle."
Mrs. Gunnerson just made you a big chocolate milkshake.
So you wanna come downstairs with me right now.
"Krystle, is there anything wrong between you and L.B.?"
"Well, of course not."
"Well, it's just that L.B.'s taken on a new habit, Steven."
He's begun to lie and tell little fibs.
"Oh, I know it's only because he misses Jeff."
I only hope it's just a phase he's going through.
I'm sure it is.
It's probably best for us just to ignore it.
Ignore it.
I guess you're right.
I know you're right.
"Tell me, Mr. Wales, are you still doing your hatchet jobs for World Finance Magazine?"
I won't say a word.
"It won't be easy, but I promise."
Oh.
"Oh, I'd love to."
"Yes, I'll do some shopping, and then I'll meet you for lunch."
Okay.
Bye.
"- Who was it, honey?"
- Louise.
- What are you so happy about?
- She wants me to meet her for lunch.
"- Oh, boy."
Some life I've given you.
- What do you mean?
"A little thing like going out to lunch, and you're ecstatic."
I'm easy to please.
"I'll just go change, and then I'll drive you to the office."
"Honey, I'm a little late."
Only take a minute.
Darrin.
"Larry, I want to speak to you about the Waterhouse account."
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
"Well, I'm talking to you about it first."
Remember the Hoffsteddler-Douglas account?
"- Yes, but..."
- Before I took over Hoffsteddler hadn't spoken to Douglas in 30 years.
"- You did a fine job there, Darrin."
"- Yes, I did."
And let's not overlook the Michael Sales Company account.
"Before I took charge, they couldn't give away ice water in the middle of the Mojave Desert."
- A memorable job.
"Yes, it was."
I've got a ride.
Emily.
"No, it's me."
Spencer.
"It's really very nice of you, but I'm here now."
I'm going with Spencer.
I see.
"Hanna, the man's ID checked out."
It checked out because there was a James Leland related to Mrs. Potter but this isn't him.
This is somebody else.
"If I tell the state people some story about the man being an imposter it'll just draw attention, which we do not want."
"Well, we have to do something."
I'm not doing anything based on what Caleb says.
Leland's coming to the bank.
I will show him the safe deposit box.
And we will go from there.
"- All right, well, call me when he leaves."
- I will.
Hey.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
"Uh, change of plans."
Good.
I'll take you and Mike out for dinner later.
Okay?
"Hey, Dad?"
How were the parent-teacher meetings?
"Oh, they were fine."
"You know, I really like that one teacher, your French teacher."
"- Well, how do you like Mr. Fitz?"
- He was okay.
Okay?
"All right, listen, I'm gonna tell you the truth."
Now.
"I can't, sweetheart, we've got a plane to catch."
"Oh, every time we're close, I feel something good is about to happen."
You've got to be...
You said you didn't want to see my face or hear my voice.
I can't think in there.
"Well, it wasn't my voice."
I thought you'd keep him in check.
I thought I could depend on you.
"- Well, Cari told Bob..."
- That she's going to Brazil...
Please.
"Jon, please."
I'm two cases short.
What?
You gotta be kidding.
You know that baby food was on the way to the lab.
It was contaminated with botulism.
I know.
I probably lost them when I got this.
I gotta make a phone call.
Four were crouched behind their car.
"It was just me and my bike against four men, two. 45s and two sawed-offs."
"I pulled my gun, grabbed my mike and called for backup."
Then they opened fire.
I was hit by a bullet.
"Oh, I hurt real bad."
I went down.
I got up and I got hit on this side...
"Oh, you girls..."
I was speaking very low.
Baker.
What do you say?
Sit down.
"- How they treating you, Rocky?"
- Like a prince.
I get three square meals and real butter on my bread.
What a life.
- Is that a bad cut on your eye?
- Not bad.
Just a few stitches.
I thought you knocked your eye out.
You coming to my trial tomorrow?
"Rocky, I've been worrying about this all last night."
- I can't let you take the whole blame.
"- Pipe down, want the flapper to hear?"
Now get this.
"You got away, didn't you?"
Okay.
I wanna be a sucker.
"But, Rocky, maybe if they thought I was in on it, they'd go easier on you."
In a pig's eye.
"Just because you can run faster, you don't gotta eat yourself."
"- But it ain't fair to you, Rocky."
"- Look, so they send me up."
So what?
What've I got to lose?
The old man's got troubles enough without me.
Forget it.
"I got caught, and you got away."
"But you, Rocky."
"Supposing I was the one who got caught, you wouldn't keep quiet."
- You'd make them send you up too.
- What do you think I am?
"Yeah, it's like a clever little twist."
"The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid."
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.
"Figure that all out on your own, did you?"
"Cone number one, if you want."
Oh...
"Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?"
Oh...
That's just a...
Oh!
"Oh, you saw that?"
Yeah.
Just gonna be going.
Gonna...
Yeah.
"You know, I knew this girl Doreen."
Good-lookin' girl.
"Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck!"
"You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her."
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watching' you!"
"No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here."
"Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt."
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
"Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater."
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.
I can handle anything.
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on.
Sheriff knows who did it.
I saw him going down to Peterson's a little while ago with some evidence some kid gave him.
He found it in an RV or something down there.
Those Peterson's will probably get that kid.
What kid?
"Some damn tourist kid, I don't know."
[Man on the phone] Yeah.
Yeah.
"You know, a sky pilot once said that angels carried messages up to heaven, Buddy."
He might tell him.
"Come on, don't cry anymore."
"[Buddy] All right, I won't cry no more."
"[Jim] Buddy, look here, you got to buck up and be a little man now."
"If Tater knows you was crying about him that way, he'd feel awful bad."
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, Miss Molly."
[Molly] ...how many people we should notify?
[Jim] I guess me and Buddy...
"Hi, Billy."
Go away.
"What'd you do that for, Billy?"
Now you've got yourself stuck in there.
- Just be quiet and go away.
- [phone ringing] [continues ringing]
It's the telephone.
Billy?
It's for you.
"I don't care, answer it."
"I'll tell you somethin', Billy."
What?
You got a hollow door here.
It's made in Japan.
"You know, it's funny."
Looking at these old cases makes me wonder-- did we make a dimerence?
"I mean, çan we make a dimerence?"
Are we butte_ly wings?
Are we the wind?
It's like the horses.
"You try to figure out which one's the best fit for the track, runs harder, or prettier."
But when you admit that it's chaotic--
"Alvin, thank you."
We can talk after the meeting.
I can take it from here.
"Yeah, you'll, uh--"
"Give you, what, a half hour or so?"
Probably.
Right.
"Uh, I might be gone by then."
"But, uh, maybe not."
Let's just see.
Right.
Let's just see.
"Now, this essay about why I want to be Samantha's dad."
"Um, should I read it to you?"
[knock on door] I think I'm going to head out to the track.
- Mind telling Lulu for me?
- OK.
Thanks.
Can I read this to you?
"Uh, no, that's fine."
"There's this part in it about my sponsor, if you think that's OK."
Um...
Your sponsor?
"Yeah, how he said it's OK for me to be in a relationship-- have a relationship, you know?"
Boyz II Men?
ABC?
BBD?
It's the East Coast family.
[ Groans ]
Whoa.
You guys know nothing about the greatest era in music history?
That's it.
I am taking you to school.
We are at school.
"Figure of speech, Prius."
"Okay, so here's my business idea."
"You're in your 20s, early 30s."
- I love it!
"- That was a hypothetical, but I like your energy."
[ Chuckles ]
You and your friends are going out for a wild night.
- What do you do for a ride?
- Call Tom.
"Okay, we're having some problems with hypotheticals."
I'll move on.
You call a cab.
"But cabs are boring, and you and your gang want a memorable night, so instead of calling a lame cab, you call The Mystery Machine from ""Scooby-Doo""!"
"- Travis, this is great!"
"- Oh, The Mystery Machine!"
I always wanted to hang around in that van-- maybe try my luck with Old Velma.
- You mean Daphne?
- I know what I like.
"Okay, well, Tom loves it too, and he's a brain surgeon."
"Travis, you're a genius."
I think I can have this thing up and running in three months.
"What are you, crazy?"
"All right, y'all, it's almost time for the mele, the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
The special blend.
"Yes, this is a magical drink."
You know what?
I'm gonna go get a good spot for the show.
Do you guys wanna come?
"No, no, we're good here."
Okay.
You're fine?
Okay.
And then there was two.
"Listen, I want you to come back with me."
I'm not going back to the other side with you.
"I'm gonna stay right here, get my celebration on and get another margarita made up in my face."
I came a long way to find you.
"Well, I know you ain't come to get a drink."
You damn sure ain't come to dance.
So what'd you follow me here for?
No.
I did.
"I came here to drink, party, scratch records, do it all!"
Do it...
It's just...
Just...
Just...
You know?
What am I saying?
I don't want to do any of those things.
Truth is that I'm exhausted just saying them.
"All right, y'all, it's time for the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
"Cynthia, hi."
Excuse me.
I'd rather be stuffed in a coffin.
I don't mind the shooting. I wouldn't give much if you couldn't defend yourself but jumping bail is another thing.
It isn't square.
I want you to go into town and stand trial on your own feet.
Clear yourself or take the consequences.
"That's the only way to work it out, Brock."
"When you've got something more to say to me, I'll be around."
"That was nice, that was fine."
-Take it easy.
-You can hurt him more than anyone.
"-You know that, don't you;"
-Take it easy.
I thought you were leaving.
I gotta think.
How can a man think without a little music;
-Jim here;
-Around someplace.
"-Out back, I guess."
-Where's Brock;
"Hello, Mr. McCurtin."
"-You tell them about the shooting, Brock;"
"-Oh, hello, Mac."
"Sure, I told them."
What's the matter;
Horton died.
-l figured he was too mean to die.
"-l can get you off, once more, maybe."
You must've had good reason to shoot a man.
"You had one, didn't you;"
Good reason;
"-Why, sure, the best."
-Better come back in with me.
Everything's fine.
Sally Seidelman told me you were retiring.
"Yes, at the end of this year."
"Well, I just wanted to say... ."
"I don't know, I just... ."
I just wanted to say... .
- I don't know.
- Are you sure everything's all right?
- Tell her where you are.
- Donna?
I'm in the Oval Office with the President of the United States and it's because of you.
- Mrs. Morello?
- What a thing to say.
"- We're all very proud of you, Donna."
- She didn't do anything.
- Was that...?
"- It's Jed Bartlet, Mrs. Morello."
I've got a couple of questions.
"When you taught Beowulf, did you make the kids read it in the original Middle English or did you use a translation?"
"- We used a translation, Mr. President."
- Okay.
- We'll call that the James Bond version.
"- Yes, sir."
What are you doing with your retirement?
- My husband and I were gonna travel.
- That's great.
"I'd stay away from the Elk Horn, Idaho area for a little while."
You'll read why in the morning.
Let's talk about Twelfth Night.
- Twenty-two?
- Yeah.
- You haven't had a drink since 22?
"I've seen you on tv, mr."
"Nicholson,"
"In these big,huge trials."
Um... and that's why i came here--
Because i didn't know what else to do.
I'm not from here.
"I go to school here, and my parents are in nebraska."
I just don't know anybody.
I'm so scared.
Don't be.
All right?
I called my partners.
They're on their way down here right now.
"Thank you,tom."
Thank you for helping me.
"I swear,i didn't mean to hurt him."
That's exactly what we're gonna tell the jury.
The los angeles police
Are asking for help from the community.
This person of interest is believed to be a white female
Between the ages of 20 and 24.
We'll handle it.
I promise.
"These are my partners-- Luther graves,"
Alden tuller and ron trott.
"Ron,this is ann diggs."
She's the girl they're looking for in the stein murder.
"What did you use,a knife?"
"Yeah,from the room service cart."
Why did you come to a law firm?
Why not go to the police?
"Anything i say to the police could be used against me,right?"
"But then again, I do look good in purple."
Are you sure?
No cites for a loose load on the Golden State?
Of course.
Baker and Poncherello.
They came in this morning.
They didn't respond to the dispatches because they're not on their bikes.
They're at Poncherello's.
Does anybody have Poncherello's phone number?
Yeah.
I shouldn't have let them go home.
I shouldn't have...
I'm too nice a guy.
That's it.
I'm just too nice a guy.
You go to the drive-in very often?
I don't have to.
I can watch it from right here.
Saves me a fortune.
How do you know what's going on?
You can't hear it.
"Well, during the winter, you kind of have to figure it out, read lips."
"But during the summer, all the car windows are open."
It's like stereo.
"Hey, how do I get my nickel back out of here?"
Mr. Nice Guy.
I'm gonna have my name legally changed to Mr. Nice Guy.
"Boy, never again."
Never again.
"- Hey, sarge..."
"- Later, Park, later, later."
"This is your noon news update, Larry McCormick reporting."
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The fuckin'shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean to say that.
I just mean that he's scaring me.
I just need help.
"Help me, please."
You know anything about this fuckin' restaurant business?
He knows everything about it.
He's in the joint 24 hours a day.
"Another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool."
That's how often he's in there.
You want me to be your partner?
is that what you're tryin' to tell me?
You want me to be partners?
What do you think I'm talking about?
"Paulie, please."
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
"God bless you, Paulie."
You've always been fair with me.
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
I hoped to find him recovered and so I'd explain to him everything.
But when he came back...
I won't say he was worse.
It's not that.
But he was a total helpless person.
I don't know what would he told you.
He told me the same.
I couldn't leave him in that spot.
It was a terribly unfair situation for me.
I thought that with me by his side I could help him.
How is Luisa?
Who told you about Luisa?
I heard from mom.
"Well, from Berta."
She was talking to her.
"What a lousy, filthy bad omen bird she is!"
What's omen?
"It's a sign, a premonition..."
I sense your eyes like dark violets...
Who wrote that?
Mine.
-It's beautiful.
And why wouldn't it be?
Are you gonna write more poetry?
I don't know.
What did Berta say about Luisa?
"That she's a whore, more or less."
But why do you care?
And what did your mother say?
Nothing.
"She said she knew you were dating some girl already, but she didn't know her."
And Berta said she was very tall and young.
"-Look, they're red on the inside."
-Nice.
-Look at that.
"-Quite cool, huh?"
You look like some sort of sexy secretary.
"Let's move out, men!"
e've got days off scheduled.
"Hey, have fun going home."
"See you later, yeah?"
"Have a fun flight home, you."
"I'II try but I'II miss you too much, Liam!"
See you later!
hello!
spend every single day with these lads.
t's really weird to not have the other four lads around me.
But do actually look forward to going home.
"Sing it, O2!"
"Let me hear you, London!"
How we doing in the back?
So baby if you say You want me to drive o KFC
I Iove chicken.
I Iike holmes chapel.
Pretty much every other part of my Iife has changed apart from coming down here.
It's just exactly the same.
My first kiss was down there.
"I kissed a girl, Iike, a bit further down."
"We were, Iike, against a tree."
It was pretty steamy.
"Come on, come on."
He just missed an open goal!
"Oh, we're gonna catch this."
e don't realise how much we appreciate our family and hometown until you're gone.
You're a guy.
"Well, you used to be."
"So, what do you think?"
I've still got it.
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?
"It's yelling, bleeding, dilating."
"Oh, the dilating!"
Is this the video of the birth?
It's Phoebe's.
Why were you watching it?
I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day..
you were right.
It's about a girl who moves to the city in search of stardom..
but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.
It got four stars.
Wait a minute.
Those aren't stars.
"-Anyway, you wanna take a look?"
-Well..
-I'm not really in a sexy mood.
"-Hey, what's going on?"
Remember the first time you saw Jaws..
how long it took to go back in the water?
We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.
You gotta get past it.
Just get back on the horse.
"Otherwise, the horse is gonna go into the bedroom and change into her sweatpants."
"-Okay, you don't know."
You didn't see it.
-Childbirth is beautiful.
Is that your friend?
Your friend Clementine?
"Yeah, you know, as long as people are coming over, maybe she could come over too."
To the apartment with Grace and Jack?
"Wouldn't she be, like, the third wheel?"
Wouldn't she be a fifth wheel?
"Fine, I don't care."
Might as well get that out of the way.
What out of the way?
Making friends with your friends so that hopefully she'll leave you alone.
She's an old friend from a long time ago.
"I never slept with her and I'd never sleep with her and if I tried to sleep with anyone other than you, she'd probably kick my ass."
What does that mean?
That means I said the wrong thing.
I just want her to meet you.
And John.
Fine.
Bring her over.
"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
I wasn't thinking.
Were you on the phone with your wife?
"Yeah, that was Amy."
She wants you to come over tonight.
She wants to meet you.
Why?
You're my friend.
She thought maybe you could be her friend.
Really?
"Okay, I thought maybe you could be her friend."
My friend and her friend.
I don't know.
Why not?
Because my eyes are filled with someone else.
What are you smirking at?
Huh?
You are in serious trouble.
You're going to need fucking flippers... to wade through the shit you're in.
The lady was so upset...
I had to sack out on her couch.
Hysterical crying and shit.
"You know, I'll have to write this up."
You know that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Oh, yeah."
There was one time... me and my friend Dennis...
we were 8 or 9... we were in the front row of the grand stand... and I had a Coke in my hand.
And when I looked down...
"I mean, it was a direct hit."
And I said right there and then...
"I said, ""I'm going to live in one of these buildings... with a view like this."""
What?
You want to go inside?
Shh.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Open your eyes.
I want you to look at me.
My face is so fat...
I don't think Ray wants to sleep with me anymore.
I'm growing a mustache.
"No, it's the medication."
They're not here.
Ray took them to the movies.
"Look, come over."
I haven't felt this good in years.
"Clark, Cline, Clackey..."
"Culver, Jones, Charlie."
"Keep going right in, boys."
You boys are going to love the army.
-Elliot.
-Elliot.
Right.
"Hurry up in the back of the bus, all the way."
Nothing in this world is going to stop me from coming back.
"-I love you, Selena."
"-I love you, Ted."
"Hurry up, hurry up."
On the double.
"Let's go, boys!"
Cut them off.
"Hey, you!"
Snap it up.
"On the double, let's go."
"You know, you can write to her later on government stationary."
Good-bye.
Let's go!
"That first winter away from home, I took shape as an individual... and toughened."
With spring came the promise that perhaps I'd found my place in life.
But part of me would keepescaping.
"I'd find it running in memory back through Peyton Place's fields... orwandering down the streets, now emptied of young men."
I've got a couple of funny ones.
This is from Ted Carter.
He says:
"""The food they serve here must have been warmed over from World War I""!"
"-Oh, you remember Fred Cole."
"-Yes, I know him."
"He says: ""Dear Hyde, I joined the Navy because I liked the way... they kept their ships:"
"Alright, buy it at four."
I'll try.
You knew something.
"Well, I told you."
It was too late when you told me.
If I'd had the pleasure of knowing you before.
Do you think he's going to get it at four?
"No, but it's a good buy at five."
I couldn't get it.
"Alright, buy it at five."
"I'm sorry, it's going to six."
Buy it at six.
I won't buy it at all.
Cancel the order.
You mustn't get mad just because you missed a good buy.
Who gave you this tip?
I specialize in tips.
Give me your card.
I'm afraid I don't have one with me.
But I'll be happy to call you when I get the next tip.
I usually don't do this.
"I'll call you, Mrs. Ryan."
"And if you're not in, I'll leave the message with your husband."
"I have no husband, I am a widow."
Who was your husband?
Peter Ryan.
Peter Ryan!
Did you know him?
"Everybody knew Peter Ryan, the financial wizard."
We were married in Europe.
He brought me to this country.
A short while after he died.
Betty... .
- Rodney asked me to take care of you.
- I don't need your help.
But I need yours.
Rodney was a better boy for having married you.
"When I was 6 years old, I was in love with Rodney."
"For years afterwards, I never even thought about anybody else."
"I was a kind of flashy girl, I know, but Rodney liked flashy girls so that's the way I was gonna be."
"The funny thing is, Rodney always loved me as much as I loved him."
But you taught him appearances count more than feelings!
I was wrong.
Rodney discovered it.
Let's... .
Let's keep what's left of the family together.
"A little brighter one, please."
- Did you hear about Mr. Rossi?
"- No, what?"
- He's leaving town.
- Leaving?
Not really.
They're trying to get him to be principal of a high school in Portland.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
I got it firsthand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Ms. Thornton."
- I suppose that's firsthand.
- We won't be able to keep him here.
- This is kind of nice.
Can I try it on?
"- Sure, come on."
Merry Christmas.
"You know my rule about technology, Sleet!"
Give it to me!
I'm sorry...
"Dermot, give it to me!"
It wasn't my...
"I don't care if it's yours, you're not having it in my fucking dojo!"
I'm sorry.
Sorry if we've offended you.
And I don't like Simon Cowell trying to get rid of this place to turn it into telephone towers.
I'm not having it!
I've told him I will defend my sanctuary to the death and I'll say the same thing to you now.
"Seriously, the total lack of respect..."
SLEET YELLS Konichiwa!
"What, what is this?"
What is this?
These are our power stances.
"I get this, this is not powerful at all."
"I know, it's weird."
He...
Get out of here!
I hate you!
OK.
"Just back out, Dermot, slowly."
Back out.
Slowly back out.
"Leave me in peace, this is my haven!"
You are now a suspect in the murder of Simon Cowell.
"I don't care, I'm glad he's dead."
"He's not dead, he's been kidnapped."
I was trying to fool you.
"Oh, shit!"
"Thank you, Philip."
What's she doing here?
I have no idea.
I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
What is she doing?
Lately she just likes hanging out here.
-Why?
-I think she's lonely.
But it's Valentine's Day.
Can't we ask her to go?
"Well, no, she's way too emotional."
"And by emotional, I mean crazy!"
That's just my Chinese food.
She has food delivered here?
"Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy."
I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.
And you thought she was gonna be in our way!
"Open the champagne, and I will be right back."
-I've got a surprise.
-You got another ex-wife back there?
Please start drinking.
-I'm just gonna grab the phone.
"-Rachel, wait."
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
-What are you doing?
-Do you need the phone?
No.
"Ross is too nice to say it, but this is his apartment."
"We need boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place."
"But, Mona, I live here."
Happy Valentine's Day!
"Or, something to remember me by."
-How long has it been this time?
Saiba.
We buried their warriors so the Paathars sent women?
It's a woman who shall kill Jilaan.
Muraakis give only one chance.
"This full moon night, we shall conquer Paatharghat."
"Conquer me, and you conquer Paatharghat."
Who are you?
Doom.
"Barbaric Muraaki, you have never been this close to a woman, have you?"
Get lost.
I've come to kill you.
You will have to defeat me to win me over.
Show me your face.
Why do you need to see my face to fight with me?
I need a reason to fight.
Then lower your gaze.
Why?
Saiba's beauty is like the sun...
It's wise to lower your gaze.
You got a reason to fight.
Now do you have the courage to fight?
Just her and me.
Jungle Trap.
This is your Paathar's dense jungle.
A huge tree at the end.
And a dagger on the top.
The first one to get the dagger gets to draw blood.
"If I draw your blood, you give up on Paathar."
And what if I draw yours?
My Ghat will belong to you and so will I.
Jungle Trap.
"One hundred paths, One hundred wrong ones."
"Yeah, wrap it up."
"-Get the fuck out the car, bitch!"
"-Motherfucker, you know who I am?"
Who the fuck is this?
You know who the fuck I'm with?
"You ain't no fucking cop, that's for sure."
-The fuck you going to do with that?
-Stick it up your mother's twat!
Goddamn it!
What?
Little piece of shit.
"The cork, it got stuck in the bottle."
Homemade crap.
That somebody cared enough about to carry all the way from the old country for you.
What a fucking week.
"I talked to Ronnie, asked her if she's even heard from Ralph."
Little fucking kid's got a respiratory infection now.
"She just heard about Pie-O-My, she's sick about it."
Hello?
We're talking about Justin here.
"Sorry, I was thinking about my mother, her skin condition."
"Oh, my God."
Did I forget to take that out?
What's wrong with you?
"Really, Ma."
Dad's right.
It's not a bad drive.
It's interstate up to Boston.
"If you don't want to accompany me,fine."
Your sister can come up from Florida.
"Come on, she's not going to do that."
Of course I'll go.
"So, you get along with your mom ?"
"You know, you all tight and shit ?"
Yeah.
"We got along, tight and shit."
-How come you never talk about her ?
-'Cause there's nothing to say.
It's because you don't talk about her.
What do you want me to do ?
"I don't know, just say something about her."
"I mean, you don't say anything about her."
"Well, she's dead."
"God, what do you want me to do,"
-run through the streets screaming ?
-lf it helps.
"Well, it won't, so drop it."
Didn 't mean to press you about your mom.
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
Get along with your dad ?
Y'all tight and shit ?
"Yeah, we're both tight and shit."
Our DNA matches.
- [ Sara ] What is this place ?
"- Well, in a few months, it'll be Club Med for the homeless, but right now... just an old furniture spot I used to work at last summer."
"Hop, step, back."
Okay ?
"Real simple, do it with me, right ?"
Try it one more time.
"Add on the next part after that, all right ?"
"Six, seven, eight."
"Step, back, break, spin, out, up, step."
Chilly on that ?
Your petticoat's showing.
Ek Number!
All's well!
Do Number!
All's well!
Teen Number!
All's well!
Chaar Number!
All's well!
Paanch Number!
All's well!
Swing those picks there.
You think this is a strawberry festival?
Shake a leg with that pole.
"Come on, get it up there at the double."
This is a fine time for things to go quiet.
Blast them Thugs.
Why don't they come and give us a good fight?
Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist.
"Come on, hurry up, I told you."
How can we get a nice little war going?
What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal or one of them sacred tombs?
"What do you want to do, start the Indian Mutiny again?"
"Annie, get your back into it!"
Hurry up!
He's even snarling at poor little Annie.
"You can't work 24 hours a day, you know."
"In another 24 hours, my time will be up."
I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me.
"Get it up, hurry up."
He's tired.
It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do.
"Wayne, Sherry was here when it happened, but she told me not to tell the police."
"Julia, I need for you to tell me exactly what happened over there, all right?"
We were talking with Alan.
"He got excited, then he started to gasp for air."
He gets angina.
"So you called 911, right?"
"No, no."
I-I tried to give him his medication.
What do you mean you tried?
Sherry stopped me.
"I went to help Alan, but she grabbed my arm."
I just stood there.
"I-I couldn't, I couldn't move."
I...
I...
"- I killed him, Wayne."
"- Shh, shh, shh."
"All right, listen to me carefully, all right?"
I killed him.
"Call Alan's lawyer, and do not say anything, anything to anyone until he gets there."
You understand me?
"Wayne, could you come down here and help me?"
"No, and please don't call me."
"I will help you, Julia, I will, but for right now I have to keep my distance, I'm sorry."
"Excuse me, coming through."
"- Let's move, right here."
"- Okay, swing it."
"Come on, come on, let's go!"
"One, two, three."
Carotid's been lacerated.
Start a twilight drip.
"Yes, doctor."
- It's a nice word for titties.
- Where's Mom?
- What doyou mean?
What do you think she's doing right now?
I don't know.
Screwing her new boyfriend probably.
- I think she's buying us presents.
"- Yeah, Robby."
Right now she's probably buying us each a car!
- It's a man.
- I think it's a woman.
I can tell it is.
What should wewrite?
"""I have a big wiener""?"
I want to poop back and forth.
What?
What does that mean?
"Like, I'll poop into her butt hole... and then she'll poop it back... into my butt hole."
And then we'll just keep doing it back and forth... with the same poop.
"Oh, my God."
I'm going to put that!
"""I want to poop... back and forth."""
"Oh, God."
"She's gonna think we're a crazy, perverted person."
- Ooh!
She thinks we're crazy!
"- No, tell her like how I said it."
"No, she'll never write back."
"We have to sound like we're a man, you know?"
That's just lame.
It's stupid.
"But you said I could do half, and you've done all of them before this."
- Luise?
Want a drink?
"- Yes, of course."
"Mark, stop it."
Stop.
- What are you doing?
- I feel like playing.
I am not in the mood.
If you fuck me the others will respect you again.
- What do you mean?
- You stopped talking to Vanessa.
When she had to move to Virum.
Just like you.
And where is she now?
Leave me alone.
Fuck off back to Virum.
POWER
"Power means being able to do what I want,   when I want, the way I want."
If something goes wrong like assault or other crime   our parents have the power and money to hush it up.
Nobody would dare say anything to me or tell me off.
Or tell me what to do.
Girls and boys look up to you and want to know you.
You can choose who you want to talk to.
Being in the group I'm in...
People know you are not...
I can provide all the stuff people dream of.
All the people who do ordinary 9 to 5 jobs   dream of living my kind of life.
I need something from my jacket.
The orange one.
This one?
"Hi, Hanne."
- We're leaving.
999.
We were expecting the mayor.
"You're just going to wait for an hour then ride a bus, then slepp on a subway..."
Schlep.
"""Schlep."" Not ""slepp."" ""Schlep."""
Get the gumbo out of your Yiddish.
How do you feel about the L.I.E.?
I hate the L.I.E.
Take the Grand Central.
Catch it at Astoria Boulevard.
"Go ahead, I'll show you."
Santos was a good cop.
You're doing a vile thing.
It's wrong to blame a dead cop and steal a widow's rights.
You keep saying that.
Nobody's doing anything.
You've got all the answers.
Don't even have the questions yet.
"Well, I got a question for you."
You hungry?
Swing by that diner up there.
The North Star.
Best Philly steak sandwiches in New York City.
Or do you call them Philadelphia steak sandwiches?
Who we going to meet here?
What are you talking about?
You surface in front of my car at the cemetery.
You show just enough leg so I'd stop.
And the Grand Central is the long way around.
Who we going to meet?
Albert Holly.
He was Eddie Santos' partner two years ago when Tino Zapatti got probation.
"All right, then."
- (Knock) - (Parrot) Come in.
Shut up!
Come in.
(Parrot) Shut Up.
Come in.
"Oh, come in, everyone."
"I've brought Constable Wilson, m'lady."
He's going to perform the ceremony.
"Oh, good."
"Well, now, you stand over here."
That's right.
"Stokes, you're going to be best man."
You stand next to the groom.
"James, you're to give the bride away."
And Ethel and her mother will be the bridesmaids.
"We're the bridesmaids, Mother."
That'll be nice.
What am I?
The congregation.
Right.
"Go and fetch the bride, she's waiting on the landing."
"As soon as you hear the wedding march, come in."
"We don't want it to be too loud, so I've put in a soft needle and stuffed a pair of bloomers down the horn."
"That's the best thing to do, that is."
"This is ridiculous, Mr Twelvetrees."
Do we 'ave to do it?
"Yes, Ivy, we do."
His lordship gave strict instructions to humour Lady Lavender at all times.
Otherwise she might not leave him her money.
"Be quiet, Mabel, and hand me the parrot."
Haven't you got anything religious to put on?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do!
This is my place.
Get out!
I did what I did.
"You don't have to be happy about it, but maybe we could help each other out now."
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
"Bronze piece, about this size, with a hole in it, off-center, with a crystal."
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
I know it.
Where's Abner?
Where's Abner?
Abner's dead.
"Marion, I'm sorry."
"Do you know what you did to me, to my life?"
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
"Well, say it again, anyway."
Sorry.
"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
"It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
You going to give it to me?
Maybe.
I guess I'll just...
I'll see you at work.
Yeah.
Is this the right decision?
Yeah.
Beth happy about it?
Yeah...
"I dunno, we'll see."
You don't exactly look happy.
Happy?
Happy comes later.
"Right now we're on a 30-day trial basis, kinda like a vacuum cleaner."
- How about the lieutenant?
- What about her?
- Is she OK?
"- What do you want me to say, Kay?"
You want me to say that Beth and I have come to a big understanding?
We haven't.
"Maybe we will, I dunno."
All I know is I gotta try.
"Allie's front tooth is falling out, I'm the tooth fairy, no one else, OK?"
"Zack slides into second base and breaks his collarbone,"
"I take him to the ER, no one else!"
"I remember what it was like when I broke my collarbone, and my dad wasn't there to take me to the hospital."
"The kids are kids, the rest of the people involved are adults, OK?"
All right.
"Just asking you how you are, that's all."
My car should be ready tomorrow.
Thanks... for the ride.
- Annabella?
- Yes.
- Tell me about the gloves.
"-You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?"
"-Yes, I am."
-Pretty close?
-Pretty close.
Did he talk to you about my party?
He sure did.
About my daughter?
"No, I didn't know you had one."
-He didn't mention her?
-No.
Oh.
Didn't tell you what she did?
He didn't mention her.
"Priests are pretty tight-mouthed, then, huh?"
That depends.
-On what?
-The priest.
Sure.
"I mean, what if a person, uh, came to you you know, that was a murderer or criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?"
"I mean, would you have to turn him in?"
"Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no."
-You wouldn't?
"-No, I wouldn't."
But I would try to convince him to turn himself in.
Mm-hm.
"And, uh, how do you go about getting an exorcism?"
I beg your pardon?
"If, um-"
"- If a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something how do they get an exorcism?"
I'd have to get them into a time machine and get them back to the 16th century.
I didn't get you.
"It just doesn't happen anymore, Mrs. MacNeil."
Already did.
I told you to stay away from them and I meant it.
"Now, go on, get him out of here."
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing to say.
"You came to me for help, right?"
"It may not have turned out the way either of us wanted it to, but... it's how it turned out and it's all right."
I do... and besides...
I got to imagine myself being a daddy.
(chuckles)
I like how it feels.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(kisses)
Bye-bye.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
Man:
Why did they stay at a BB?
Woman:
It was a nice BB.
I thought the mission was that he had to get to Fort Lauderdale to get his job back in a blaze of glory.
"Yeah, but the wife didn't know that."
She likes BBs.
It was a really nice BB.
What kind of people would stay at a place run by a pedophile?
Plot twist... they didn't know that.
That Russian girl was 16.
"Yeah, but they assumed that the old guy was interested in the mom."
Are you almost done with him?
I want my turn.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
She has this book club.
It's a couple of ladies from the school.
- My school?
- Yeah.
"They sit and pretend they read, but mostly it's just gossip."
"Hey, if you help me, we can get out of here really quick."
- Help you?
- We just need set out some sandwiches.
"Oh, uh..."
"Boy, I just..."
I don't know how much of a help I would be.
"You know, I..."
I once worked for two weeks at McDonald's and I accidentally gave away the secret to the secret sauce.
"It's ketchup and mayonnaise, by the way."
"Christine, are you embarrassed by what I do?"
No.
I'm not embarrassed at all.
"But I mean, why didn't you tell me you were Marly's housekeeper?"
"I'm sorry, should I have said:"
"""Before you get too attached to me, you should know I'm a housekeeper""?"
"Well, you came right out with the Portuguese thing."
"I'm kidding, I'm kidding."
"No, I..."
I don't care what you do.
I am not like one of them.
"Great, then help me so we can get out of here."
Okay.
I'll...
I'll help you.
I'm excited.
You take a look at him while he's sleeping.
"You know how cute he is, with his tush all squished up in the air like that..."
Did you see him?
See who?
That-a-way!
We're in lockdown!
This door stays closed till you hear the all-clear call.
The perimeter's sealed.
He's not getting out this way.
My jewelry box!
"Jamie, Mommy told you..."
"All right, Jamie, you've had your fun."
Now it's time to give that back to Mommy and go to sleep.
Jamie...
I asked you to give it to me!
Would you look at this thing?
It's amazing.
We've got to come up with something really great to do with it.
What if we tied mattresses to ourselves and jumped off it?
Nah.
We could do that off the roof.
We could launch mannequins into the Prestons' Jacuzzi.
Uh-uh.
It's not good enough.
We could get a squirrel to dive off it into a cup of water.
Not good enough.
Not for her.
Not this old beauty.
"Well, how about if we got a vat of Jell-O..."
No!
It's not good enough!
I got it!
You're both disgusting.
I don't want to be the guy gossip girl made me out to be.
So what are you gonna do?
Go backpacking... if you'll have me.
"Well, it's too late. i'm..."
I'm taking someone else.
"- Oh, really?"
who?
- It's me.
Him.
"Yeah, we're gonna have a great time."
Melissa and i.
Oh. really?
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa but thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants me to do.
I want to do something for me.
And we'll just go as friends.
Don't worry. it won't be anything romantic Unless you know we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie
So i can maybe try to picture you with a backpack.
What's wrong with my tie?
Mm. i need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
So i'm the one who does the good deed
And that guy goes off with the girl?
It's good to be that guy.
Do you...you go here to n.y.u.?
"Just take us through the logistics, Train Brain."
Okay.
Each of these blocks is a train car.
This is taking too long!
I need chocolate!
"Gene, quiet."
Sorry.
It's okay.
"Now, this is us here in the Juice Caboose."
I can see us in there.
Just kidding.
We're not inside a block.
Tina!
Okay.
"The only time the door to the caboose in unlocked, is when Ethan makes a juice box delivery, every hour on the hour."
Every hour on the hour.
Sounds like a robot.
Wait!
What if Ethan is a robot!
?
Gene!
Focus!
You guys are embarrassing me.
"In front of Rudy, which is hard!"
"Even if we get out of here, you still have to get all the way up to the kitchen car."
The chocolate is kept inside the chocolatier's refrigerator.
He's from Germany.
The chocolate's from Switzerland.
- We're from America.
- Yeah...!
"Now, the only time the kitchen is empty is when it's a passenger's birthday and the whole staff comes out to sing the ""Chugga Chugga Choo Choo Happy Birthday To You"" song."
"So, we know how to get in, but how do we get out?"
"Hey, this is with a typewriter."
It's from a finance company.
So it is from the finance company.
So it's better than no letter at all.
So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.
"So they want the fourth, the fifth the sixth, the seventh."
So they want the Plymouth.
"""Sugar Lips"" Shapiro."
"Amazing, ain't it?"
I believe it.
I believe it.
- You believe what?
-My wife.
"She says, ""Darling, you won't believe it but I found the most adorable baby on our doorstep and I've decided to keep it for our very own."
"Now, you won't believe it, but it's got exactly my eyes and nose."""
"Why does she keep saying ""I don't believe it""?"
I believe it.
I believe it.
I believe it.
"This is it, gentlemen."
Don't bother to scrape your shoes.
"Okay, gang."
Meet our new guests.
This is Lieutenant Dunbar and this is Sergeant Bagradian.
A lieutenant?
Knock it off.
Knock it off.
The pleasure's all mine.
- How are things?
-What's doing on the outside?
"Yeah, what's new in the States?"
"Well, the skirts are shorter, if that's what you mean."
MAN:
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
katherine:
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
We got here early.
I know about you and the girl.
"We know, okay?"
"Now we can offer you two a way out, a way through."
"And if you do what we say, if you help us, we won't have to hurt her."
There's no need for violence.
Violence is what got us all in this place to begin with.
This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.
It's a partnership.
And it starts by you getting her to open that door.
DAVID:
Fuck you.
EMERSON:
"Oh, shit."
Your leg.
"Bu next time you're staying, all of you."
Bye.
- Have a good night.
Come on you guys.
I don't mean to be rude but Can I get an autograph?
Oh yeah sure.
Thanks.
I'm a big fan.
Thank you.
Wow that is... a lot of tequila.
I'm just letting you know now that tequila and I are a wild mix.
Things might get silly.
All right but only if you do a wrap around.
"Go like this,"
I'm not going to let you put your penis n my ass either.
"It's an out hole, not an in hole."
Why are you being such a prude?
I'm not being a prude.
I'm just not a porn star OK!
You wanna announce our lake of sex in front of everybody?
I've just got the wedding on my mind.
Oh what a surprise.
You haven't had any input BTW.
"BTW, Jesus."
It's because I work and I don't sit at home eating chips and dip and obsess over the wedding.
What?
It is disgusting what you are doing.
You're a pig.
I'm a pig?
Hi.
Hi.
Are you guys Ok?
"You said you all moved to Paris, but Mom said your parents died back in Algeria."
Papa died 12 years ago and Mama died two months later-.
12 years?
We had grandparents until 12 years ago?
Why didn't we meet them?
Your mom shunned them until they died.
"She didn't speak to them, only to me."
"Aunt Rosa, where's Maurice?"
Please tell us.
Do you know who Isabelle Moretti is?
- The actress?
- Yes.
Talk to her.
- What does she have to do with Maurice?
- She knew him.
Look her up and talk to her.
"This isn't Hollywood, she's just an actress-."
Now leave me alone.
Who are you talking about?
Why should we talk to Moretti?
Why can't you tell us?
"- I don't want to, okay?"
- Why not?
Who are they talking about?
"About Madame Isabelle Moretti, no more and no less."
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.
We start with Romeo and Juliet and end up with Isabelle Moretti.
"Suddenly Mom jumps out of windows, has abortions, she's a Communist."
I don't know who you're talking about but it sure isn't my mother.
And to top it off you invent grandparents.
Great.
"We""re going to be together, Lisa."
"L""ve got it all arranged so Clara won""t have to know."
"That""s it?"
"That""s your big announcement?"
"That""s what you wanted to tell me?"
"Well, what did you expect?"
"For me to say I""d leave Clara for you?"
Yeah.
I did.
I just did.
Sleep with me.
Just tonight.
"L""m afraid to go home."
Is she smiling or...
"Have you seen what I""ve turned her into?"
My daughter.
"My brilliant, talented, grown-up daughter hates me."
"No, she""s ashamed of me."
I have six dental practices.
I employ 50 people.
I put bread on their tables.
I work seven days a week... to build something my mom and dad could be proud of.
"Now it""s meaningless."
"Overshadowed, negated by David""s mortal sin."
- Maybe I should go.
- You have to understand.
"When I first met Clara, I never imagined I would ever..."
"Back then, her accent was so strong, she""d say, ""David."""
"That was the only thing she""d say that I could understand."
"But still she""d talk and she""d talk... and I""d watch her."
I could watch her forever.
I used to look at her... and think I had more respect for this woman than anyone I have ever known.
"-Oh, BIanche."
"-Yes, it is, it is."
Or I wouldn't say it.
You just have to watch around the hips a little.
"I want you to look at my figure, you know?"
"I haven't put on one ounce in 1 0 years, stella."
I weigh now what I weighed the summer you left belle Reve.
The summer Dad died and you left us.
"It's just incredible, BIanche, how well you look."
Sure you wouldn't like another?
well....
"well, maybe I will just take one tiny nip more."
"Just to put the stopper on, so to speak."
"Now, don't get worried."
Your sister hasn't turned into a drunkard.
She's just all shaken up and hot and dirty and tired.
Waiter.
Waiter.
-You want it hot?
-ScaIding.
-stella.
"-What is it, hon?"
There's only two rooms.
I don't see where you're gonna put me.
We'II put you right here.
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible beds?
-feel all right?
"-wonderful, honey."
I don't like a bed that gives much.
"stella, there's no door between the two rooms, and StanIey--"
-will it be decent?
It's not what you think.
"Amira, you are planning an attack at school."
Please!
"Please, Drew."
Let me at least try to explain.
After we broke up...
I was lonely.
"I went online, started talking to this guy from back home."
"A friend, but he didn't like this country."
I started saying that stuff because I thought that was what he wanted to hear - just to keep talking to someone.
But it wasn't real.
"Not for me, Drew."
Never for me.
None of it?
No.
"Please, Drew, you know me."
And you told all of this to Mr. Harris?
Yes.
"And I showed him all the texts from Kasym,"
Where I am telling never to contact me again.
What he was talking about was crazy.
So what is Mr. Harris going to do?
"He say he'll tell the principal that he believes me, then we see what happens from there."
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I know you only did this because you care for me.
And it's made me realize that I feel the same way.
Can we talk later?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
"I told him I was texting with someone from Chechnya,"
Nobody in this town will pick him up.
Why?
"Well, 'cause everyone in town is here."
Quaint.
I like that.
What?
"Well, that was nice."
What was that for?
You're different from any guy I've ever met.
"When you talk to me, you look in my eyes, and..."
And what?
"When I hear your voice, it sounds really smart, and that makes me feel special."
"Me, too."
"So, any time you're ready to open up, I'm ready to listen."
I blame you.
What?
I blame you.
"I only kept this job to take care of you, you and the..."
"And the, the..."
Kids?
"Yeah, the kids."
I was just a bag boy who didn't have sense enough to leave.
And now that's what I am for the rest of my life.
"Oh, Alan, what you do for a living is only a little of what you are."
It's not mostly what you are.
"Well, then what am I, mostly?"
Mostly...
You are a person that I love a whole lot.
And I want you to be happy.
"Well, right now I am not happy settling for what I am."
What the hell are we looking at?
George...
I don't know.
You're going to White Cross.
- Give me those.
"- No, no, please, please, please."
- I know where he's going to be.
- Who?
Kevin Grey.
"If Grey moors up the boat here at the end of the runway, in theory, he could just walk onto a plane."
- What's the flight schedule tonight?
- I'll get on it.
"Don't let me keep you, DS Chohan."
- How's Anna?
- She's good.
Ran into her last month at the Old Bailey.
She was on terrific form.
Tore the case apart.
Told me she'd finally left you.
- We're working things out.
"- She may be but not you, Harry."
I want DI Orwell kept up to date on everything to do with the Lau case.
You're gonna both be running it from now on.
OK?
Mm-hm.
No sign of Grey's boat.
Clear line of sight to the harbour entrance.
- How many flights are left after this one?
"- Er, two."
Athens and Paris.
The first two cities to host the Olympics.
Where does your freakish general knowledge come from?
"My dad used to sell encyclopaedias, until the internet came along."
"Harry, speedboat approaching from the harbour entrance."
'Cause I'm gonna drop truth bombs.
You know how pissed off I was when U S Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racist.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight-up mentally ill.
Sure.
I got mental-health issues.
Sure.
"Well, you know, who doesn't, really?"
"Hey, has anyone seen Liz?"
Or Pete?
She went out.
"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
I'm in charge.
Oh.
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Miss Maroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't think you'd like it, 'cause we work a lot of hours and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like risky."
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"""Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."""
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
I'm going to be tougher with him.
I promise.
Huh.
It's weird.
I just have this vague feeling of you actually being a good mother.
I hate you!
"I hate you, I hate you!"
I hate you!
"Reese, this is crazy."
You've been staring at that damn thing for four days.
We're getting rid of it.
No!
Wait!
I finally have an idea.
What is it?
I'll have it in a second!
Just wait!
"It's over, Reese."
"Once the board's gone, things should go back to normal."
Did you know that the Newmans put a statue of a naked guy on their front lawn a week ago?
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
No!
We are not getting rid of this!
"Reese, what is the big deal?"
What is so special about this board?
I think it's my last time.
Last time for what?
For anything stupid and reckless and fun.
"Maybe it's because I'm almost 18 now, but lately I've been hearing this voice in my head that says,"
"""That's dangerous, that's stupid."
"You're gonna hurt yourself."""
"And the old voice, the one that says,"
I know how much that stuff meant to her.
How is she doing?
"Come on, monica."
You know your mother.
I mean not good at all.
I don't even know what to say to her.
"I've been helping her with the house while taking care of my bills,"
But there's only so much i can do.
I mean she was making more than me.
i really hate to see her like this.
"Know what, dad?"
I forgot...
I need to go make a phone call.
Can you watch my bag?
"- Baby, just use my phone."
- There's probably no service.
"Sure enough, she's right."
Hmm.
Hoo.
"How was your run, regina?"
"It was good, mother."
"Well, any other time it'd be ""mama."""
"You still mad, but that's okay."
- You'll get over it.
"- Mama, i really don't wanna go through this again."
"You know, your nagging is getting real old."
"Now before you go storming off to your room like usual,"
Do you mind getting the door this time?
It's your shift.
I've already done mine.
oh god.
I don't know why you're making me come over here and do this.
School was never easy for Dirk.
"We didn't have much money, and... well, you know, kids -- They can be cruel."
They picked on him.
They picked on him?
They called him poor and dirty and stupid.
They even had a nickname for him.
Dirk the jerk.
"And after what happened to his mother, he..."
His mother?
"Yeah, Jane, my wife."
She died when Dirk was 13.
Cancer.
"I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her."
And he was a great kid.
He made sure Jane got her medicine.
"He helped her, cleaned up after her."
"But, you know, you -- you watch somebody die slow, waste away to nothing... it does things to a person."
Horrible things.
I didn't know about his mother.
He... he wouldn't talk about her.
Not even to me.
Lot of anger in that boy.
I'm sorry.
"Well, we'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. McGregor."
"Um, you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?"
"Oh, he wasn't."
I had him cremated.
All of him?
"Well, I kept a lock of his hair."
"Oh, that's..."
That's nice.
Where do you keep that?
-You're a fine one to ask me how it went.
-blanche.
You're a fine one to stand there accusing me of it.
-I won't stay in this house.
-blanche!
-blanche.
"-I, I, I took the blows on my face and my body."
"AII of those deaths, the Iong parade to the graveyard."
"Father, Mother, Margaret, that dreadful way...."
"You just came home in time for funerals, stella."
And funerals are pretty compared to deaths.
How do you think all that sickness and dying was paid for?
"Death is expensive, Miss stella."
"And I, with my pitiful salary at the school...."
"Yes, accuse me."
"Stand there and stare at me, thinking I let the place go."
I let the place go?
Where were you?
-In there with your PoIack.
"-blanche, be still."
That's enough.
-stella.
"stella, you're crying?"
-Does that surprise you?
"Mitch, we gonna play at your house tomorrow?"
"No, not at my house."
My mother's still sick.
"-AII right, you bring the beer."
-Break it up down there.
-I made that spaghetti dish and ate it myself.
"-Now, honey, I told you and told you we were playing Jack's beer."
What's so funny?
I sold a whole street once.
"When I had the business, your father was still alive."
Yeah.
He used to come home and go upstairs.
I had his supper ready for him on the table.
"When he came down, I went up... and I had a little - a little snack, a little supper- nothing much."
I was always very busy.
Do you remember Mr. Goldhar?
- Yep.
- He came every day.
[Woman] That must have been who she was talking about before.
"Oh, did I"
- I mentioned it already?
"Well, you were wondering ifhe was Goodman or..."
He was a very nice man...
Mr. Goldhar.
And he loved me - not in that way.
But
"- Oh, well, he - he put his arms around me."
He kissed me.
He loved me.
He laughed.
He did anything I told him to.
He came every day for breakfast.
"He was there at about, uh, 6:30, 7:00 for breakfast."
He says his wife is still sleeping.
She doesn't make him breakfast.
I remember
- I didn't think I would remember anything from there.
"I remember you came down, and you should have been sleeping upstairs."
You climbed - You used to climb out of your crib.
- Yeah?
"Because after all, Don Vito, money isn't everything."
Can I sit down?
Your kindness to that widow made me ashamed of myself.
The rent stays like before!
I'll even lower it.
I'll lower it $5.
I'll lower it $ 10!
Can I offer you some coffee?
I'm late for an appointment!
I can't this time!
Ask me another time!
You'll have to excuse me for now.
I wish I could stay longer!
Just call me and I'll be here!
He won't be back.
He'll hide out in the Bronx!
"-Vito, what do you think?"
-We'll make a big business!
-New York City.
"-Would you speak up, please?"
New York City.
-Are you the son of Vito CorIeone?
"-Yes, I am."
-Where was he born?
"-CorIeone, sicily."
Did he at times use an alias that was known in certain circles as Godfather?
Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.
"Mr. Chairman, I would Iike to verify the witness' statement."
For years many of my constituents have been of italian descent.
I've come to know them well.
They have honored me with their support and their friendship.
"J ust don't even speak to me, okay?"
I can't believe you can't even be nice to me at a time like this!
Why do you even need me to be nice to you... since everybody else in the world is?
Graham. ls that you?
They said the pizza will be here in twenty minutes.
I'm not hungry.
Graham?
"No, it's me."
I'm just calling to thank you.
Thank me?
For what?
For sending Graham over here.
I don't know how you knew... but he is exactly who I needed.
Good.
How is it going?
How is Andy?
We don't-
- We're still waiting to hear if the angioplasty worked.
"By the way, I hope you understand about Sharon."
Sharon?
"You know, she just really felt like she needed to spend the night..."
"- in her own bed, you know?"
"- Sure, of course."
"Patty, you're the greatest friend."
- Go back to sleep.
- Okay.
Here.
"Now, you prefer your coffee at least two days old, right?"
I insist upon it.
You've been amazing through all this.
"No, I just don't think it has hit me yet."
"So Andy, was he working really hard or something?"
"Well, your instincts are admirable, but you don't have to put aside your feelings for the sake of any of us."
I'm not saying I want to be the woman's best friend.
I'm just saying...
"I have been so busy blaming her,"
I don't think I've ever really seen her for who she is.
OK.
"So, what are you proposing?"
The truth of the matter is Holly is a part of our family now.
"I think I should embrace that, if only to set an example."
"I mean, we all have to put the past behind us where it belongs and move on."
- You think I'm crazy?
"- No, Nora."
I don't think you're crazy.
Good.
"Because if there's one person I count on to be my reality check, it's you."
Saul?
What?
It's the past.
It's not behind us.
You have to tell me what.
Tell me.
William and Holly had a daughter.
- What?
- Her name is Rebecca.
She's 20 years old.
She's here in L.A.
"I'm so sorry, Nora."
I'm so sorry.
- No one wanted to upset you.
- No one?
Who else knows?
Who else knows?
Are you going to clean it?
The Blue Diamond Hotel is right beside it.
I want to go there.
Do you see that bufalow?
"Yes, On the right."
Follow it.
It takes bath everyday in it.
What Madam?
You're just wasting time.
There's nothing in my bag.
I can see that you're a riot without a weapon.
"Show me the bag, okay go ahead."
See this is a pant.
And this is my Gun!
Where did that come from?
Put the gun down and surrender.
Yes I'll put it down but first let me think where it came from?
Give me the gun or...
I'll beat you so bad.
No Madam don't come forward.
A stupid fool like you will shoot me!
You're scaring a Jatni with spray.
"Ma'am this is my gun, actually the holi is coming that's why."
But when I saw your physique I got scared and...
I hid the gun in his bag.
Let him go.
Please Ma'am.
Let him go!
Gentleman is telling me to let him go.
Let him go.
You'll have to file an application for it.
"I obliged you, Aren't you going to oblige me?"
When my snitches get killed.
Those fuckers give me a giant hard-on.
"Some get laid, others freeze!"
We're on the wrong team.
"No, that's his last fuck."
We'll hump again.
You sure?
Big Luc to Fat Ass.
"Mercedes wagon, local plates, 4 men on board."
It's headed your way.
Long-haired guy is Frank Chenaf.
I nabbed him for a holdup 1 0 years ago.
A mean fucker.
I don't know the others.
Said and Jamel Attia.
I say it's for tomorrow.
Nabbing 'em in the act's dumb.
They'll fire at us.
We may lose them to avoid bloodshed.
What do you suggest?
"We hit 'em at night, and gun down the lot of them."
What about our ethics code?
I've wiped my ass with that for years.
They killed 9 men.
9 families call me every week hoping I'll have good news at last.
I owe it to them.
It obsesses me.
"Stay home, let Vrinks deal with it."
I've worked 2 years on this case.
It's my collar as much as anyone's.
"OK, but you'll be back-up."
You only move in on Vrinks's orders.
"Yeah, well, I gotta be able to sleep at night."
Just came from the federal court house.
James McGovern is pleading out.
- How much time did he get?
- 18 months.
No one should have to choose between obeying the law and watching their child die.
At least the judge postponed his surrender date for six weeks.
Then he gets to bury Kyle before he goes to prison.
"No, John maybe not."
The NTCC moved Kyle up to the top of the list.
What about Amy?
She just went to the hospital.
Kid on a motorcye cracked up doing 140 on the B.Q.E.
Kidney's a match.
"Hello, John."
Where are you going?
Home.
Something happen to the kidney?
I don't want it.
- Why not?
- Kyle McGovern's gonna die.
We'd both have a kidney if it wasn't for me.
"If I turn it down, it goes to him."
You could die waiting for the next one.
I'll take my chances.
That's the wankiest idea I've heard.
You must be shell-shocked.
"Well, what are you-"
- Wankiest?
"Foolish, ridiculous, possibly even stupid."
I think that's the best idea I've ever had.
I don't know. I'm feeling a little bit weird.
You know everything's going to be okay.
I feel it.
"So, you pick out a dress yet ?"
Dress ?
"Yeah, you know, girls wear those sometimes."
Stepps.
Main Squeeze Night.
Couples only Saturday night.
"We already talked about this, remember ?"
Yeah.
"We talked about it, but I didn't know we decided on it."
"Well, it's Stepps."
What is there to decide on it ?
I don't know. I just thought that with the flight and everything... that maybe we should cool it for a little while.
What ?
"Well, uh, what are you saying ?"
Are you saying that you don't wanna be with me ?
You don't wanna be seen with me ?
What are you saying ?
"I'm just saying I'm confused, that's all."
Confused about what ?
Me ?
A little bit.
I don't know.
Yeah... no... maybe.
Maybe ?
"So, hold on."
What ?
"Are we talking about Stepps and school, or are you talking about the grocery store, the sidewalk and museums ?"
"Break it down a little bit better for me, 'cause I don't get it."
When is it okay for us to be together ?
Are you serious?
Y-Yeap-a!
Anybody know how to play the guitar?

"Hey, I'm Cleveland Brown, and we had a good time tonight-igh-igh-igh, and we talked about addiction which is no laugh-- (laughs)-- laughing matter, which is why I'm back here telling you all this and we killed a pirate and whatnot,"
"but please, addiction no bueno es bad."
"C-Bro, we going to that party?"
You betcha!
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
You're the one who got a problem with Detective ***?
"- Yeah, that's right."
- How can I help you out?
Previously on Chicago Fire...
- His name is Casey.
- How much?
"You stop him for good, I'll give you two."
Move it in.
[Siren walls]
I got him.
"You're cooked, youngblood."
It's gonna be all right.
We're all right now.
It's over.
"I get that surgery, the department doesn't like how it looks,"
Really likes improv.
- Anyway.
- One summer mommy had to work for ones.
OK.
"Well, look, I basically, since I got Trent back to"
"Tampa, he agreed to give me this."
Oh.
"Hey, what's that junky old piece of crap?"
- My grandma's wedding ring.
- It's so pretty!
- Thank you so much for doing that for me.
- I didn't just do it for you.
I did it for my best friend.
Did you just call me your best friend?
"- Yes, I did."
- I don't think I want that anymore.
You need to try that.
"Look, I already know you're my best friend even though that pissed me off quite a bit."
But I need to know if you'd be willing to be my best man.
Hey.
Of course.
Baby bird.
"Let's get married, huh?"
"Well, summer, fall but definitely not this season."
"Hey, buddy."
***
"Oh my god, you're so annoying!"
"OK, Shelly, would you ever have sex with me and then lie to my face right after?"
"Oh, no, sweetie..."
I get all my lying done beforehand.
There's still some ladies in Detroit who think they slept with a chunky-eyed Isaiah Thomas.
- Where may I find him?
I heard there was a pipe burst in the new underground parking garage.
The one they're building for the docs?
I heard the place is filling up with water.
"It'll set construction back six weeks, probably more, with winter coming on."
"Doc, I hope you've got yourself a really big ice scraper... 'cause winter could start any time now, and up here, the winters are long."
- It's not like Boston.
"- Up here, very little is like Boston, I find."
That's the way we like it.
There's a crack in the parking lot.
You know what?
"I got one of those, too."
In the back of my pants.
"Hold on, Doc."
"You got to fill out a maintenance form, 44-B."
"Johnny should have one here somewhere, but..."
You know what?
You better take a seat.
This will just take a minute.
My name is Stegman.
"Dr. Stegman, Chief of Neurosciences."
"Pleased to meet you, Doc."
Earl Swinton.
I don't know where he keeps these things.
It's got to be here somewhere.
Hell.
Hello?
Is somebody there?
Is somebody there?
Who are you?
What are you?
Who's there?
Is he telling the truth?
Is Tucker not my son?
"You gotta believe me, I never meant to hurt you."
What is that supposed to mean?
Why did you lie to me?
(struggling)
I'm so sorry.
Melody!
"Look, put him in interrogation until NOPD comes."
Let him go.
Do what?
"Look, I said just let him go, damn it."
I probably would have done the same thing if I were him.
Lasalle...
"Look, just do it!"
Stay the hell away from my kid.
Get out of here before I change my mind.
PRIDE:
You believe him?
I don't know what to believe.
"Melody did seem pretty clear about it, though."
"I mean, she kept saying she was sorry."
"I mean, how could she do it, King?"
Bring a little boy into my life and tell me I'm his father...
when I'm not?
"I don't know, Chris."
Something you gotta ask her.
"Well, it won't change anything, so what's the point?"
"The point is, you deserve to know."
"It doesn't matter, all right, it is what it is."
Christopher.
It's not something you can pretend didn't happen.
"Doctor, I assure you, if anybody's playing jokes, it's Judy here."
"Come on, Judy."
Don't touch that chimp.
"Look, fellas, this animal's the property of the United States government."
(JACK):
"Captain, you are wrong."
"Doctor, will you let us prove it to you?"
"Ok, convince us."
"Hey, Judy."
"Judy, it's Mike and Jack."
She has a stubborn streak.
"Judy, don't you have something to say to us?"
(SQUEAKS)
"Judy, this is getting silly."
"Now, say something."
"Look, I will ask her to give me a kiss."
"Now, if she does so, will that prove to you that space helmet or not, she is our chimp?"
Not necessarily.
"And let me warn you,"
Sally is reputed to be a very aggressive chimp.
- Don't get too close to her.
- I'll take my chances.
"Ok, Judy, now look, you've had a lot of fun, but the game is over."
Now you lean over here and you give your old friend Jack a great big kiss.
"Now, come on."
Pucker up.
(SCREECHING)
"Jack, you all right?"
"No, no, Sally, don't do that."
I told you not to get too close.
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
- You'll have to stall him.
- Me?
"I don't work here anymore, Andy, it has to be you."
You can do this.
All right.
"Uh, hey, Tom."
- What's up?
- Keith asked me to tell you to submit your debrief in writing this time.
He always debriefs me in person.
"Yeah, but he and Rebecca"
Are still going over case files.
"I guess it's taking them longer than they thought, huh?"
"Okay, thanks."
"Uh, tom."
"I texted you... about getting together to maybe, you know, clear the air."
There's no air that needs clearing.
We have nothing to talk about Andy.
"Agent Locke, uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Sorry, who are you again?"
Mariana.
Been here two weeks.
"Uh, look,"
I don't think Andy told you the truth about director Mullins.
What are you talking about?
Something really weird is going on.
I've been trying to reach him for the last 45 minutes.
Ben.
Where are you?
I need more time.
"Right, so CTU can track me."
So I can get the list and you can get the money.
"Ben, I am trying to help you here, but you have got to give me some room."
"Well, I had a great day."
"I haven't learned a thing about comedy, and August and I had a huge fight."
"Oh well, how would you like a nice doughnut?"
"from this bag labeled ""donuts""."
Ahh!
You touched doggy doody!
Since when is doggy doody made in Taiwan?
They have dogs in Taiwan.. big ones.
"Funny, right?"
- I don't know.
"You know,"
I don't think I'm ever gonna see my coat again.
"Okay, Harry, why don't you sit down, you'll feel a lot better?"
Right here.
Excuse me.
Damn!
"You know, at least I can take comfort in knowing that I treated my coat well."
Such as yesterday.
It was hot on the bus.
I took it off and folded it neatly and placed it under the shade of my seat.
What?
You left it on the bus.
No-o-o!
You know they have a lost and found Harry.
Oh you mean I might see my coat again?
Oh I am so happy.
"Dick, I've been thinking about this ""humour"" thing."
Why don't you try what those guys on TV do?
Everybody says they're funny?
"- Oh, yeah, those guys!"
You know..
The McLaughlin group?
"Yes, dear?"
It's Mrs. Richards.
A fatal accident?
She's had some money stolen.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty,"
I tell Polly.
"That's all right, but don't tell anyone else, not even me!"
You know nothing!
- Basil?
"- Yes, dear?"
You've got to help me handle this.
She's in a frightful state.
I can't get a word in edgewise.
She's had £85 taken from her room.
"I said we'll search everyone, but she insists we send for the police."
What do we do with someone like that?
She just keeps on!
"Mrs. Richards, how very nice to see you!"
Are you enjoying your stay?
There's no need to shout.
I have my hearing aid on.
"Mrs. Richards, I've explained to my husband..."
I've just been up to my room.
"£85 has been taken from my bag, which I had hidden under the mattress."
"Oh, yes?"
It's a disgrace!
I haven't been here a day.
- What sort of staff do you employ?
- Mrs. Richards...
"If you knew anything at all about running a hotel, this sort of thing wouldn't happen!"
"Well, what have you got to say for yourself?"
What?
"Well, whatever you say."
And we should analyze it more deeply.
"Yes, we'll analyze it."
So I'll come back next week?
Excellent.
My pleasure.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
What are you doing here?
I was just leaving.
Don't freak out.
I just wanted to see you.
But I'm harmless.
Dr. Roncero's office.
"Hi, Lola."
I've just taken an elephantsized dump.
One and two and three.
Forward and hold.
Can you take over?
Alicia never came back.
"I didn't want to scare her again, so I didn't go to her house until a week later, when I had to see her father."
It rained all week.
The next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident on one of those rainy days.
"Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute, day or night."
"He asked for the best nurses,"
"I've got a very good reputation here, and they recommended me."
"When he saw me, he remembered that we'd met and he'd a moment of doubt, but he ended up hiring Matilde and me exclusively."
That was four years ago.
And here we are.
"Right, Alicia?"
"- Yeah, seriously, Ted."
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid... that's...
Embarrassing.
- Your Highness.
- Let's go.
Oh.
Ew.
"Marshall, take that off."
- What?
I think it looks kind of cool.
- Cool?
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band... and rides a motorcycle without a helmet... and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos and a drug problem.
"Not a... a big one, just, uh, enough that he deals a little bit on the side."
"And he can never, ever be true to one woman."
Finish that damn pickle and do me!
"Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go."
- Why would we care how...
"- Usually, it's like this."
- After you.
- Oh.
Thank you.

"Well, why..."
- Why don't we think about it?
"- Okay, I will."
I just did.
I want to do it!
"I'm so sorry, but I could really use the money,"
- and I think it could be fun.
- There you go.
A star is born!
D-d-don't worry.
It's not gonna change a thing.
"My job with you always comes first, I promise."
"Come on, we've got a million things to do."
We gotta talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
I hope your afternoon is free...
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
I like the other one better.
The one on the trolley cars.
What do you think?
I don't know.
"My god, it's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that."
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
I can't believe it either.
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember, your predecessor, Marissa Kessler."
Murder victim.
Multiple stab wounds.
Does that ring a bell?
"Sorry, sorry."
"All right, Randy and the Captain are probably already there."
I'm here.
My scouts just informed me.
I am sorry about your father.
"Jake, you're outmanned and you're outgunned."
There's too many of us and we are too desperate to give up.
You cannot win this.
I'm giving you one last chance.
"Walk away, put your guns down and return to town, and no one else will be harmed."
"Jake, I need an answer."
What's it gonna be?
Nuts.
"Sorry, I didn't get that."
You can go straight to hell.
About my father... you're the one I'm coming for.
I want to go home.
Our orders are to take people out of the conflict zone.
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman?
What is all this?
"Sir, wheels up in five minutes."
Roger that.
Jericho's been moved up to priority #1 on the list.
Thank you.
"Oh, God, thank you."
This is all thanks to you.
Don't worry.
We're gonna get things back to normal again.
"All right, saddle up."
My father expected us to make a stand here.
To defend our home.
That's what we're gonna do.
Smoke bombs!
Are you building a case to keep Brandon away from me?
No.
What are you... ?
Then why are you pumping Dani for information?
"You know I fell off the wagon, why not just come to me, Stef?"
I wasn't pumping Dani for...
"You didn't just drink, Mike, you got into a fight."
- You had blood on your hands.
- So what?
You afraid I'm gonna hurt Brandon or something?
"No, Mike, I'm worried about you."
I'm fine.
Ok?
- I'm getting it together.
- Where'd the blood come from?
It's stupid.
I got into a fight.
At the bar.
"Some guy was bothering the waitress, and..."
I must have broke his nose.
It was bleeding like crazy.
So you did...
So you didn't see Ana that night?
Is that what this is about?
You think it was her blood?
"You were so mad at her, Mike."
"Which is why I stayed away, just like we talked about."
"Yeah, you didn't talk to her?"
You didn't see her at all?
You didn't try and scare her off so she wouldn't turn Brandon in... ?
"Stef, I swear."
"I did not talk to Ana,"
"Bye, dad."
"Hey, I already know where I'm going to hang this."
Dad?
Yeah.
"What, Sarah?"
What is it?
I don't think I wanna go.
"Hey, what is this?"
What're you trying to do here?
I just came to say hello.
No need to get testy.
You and I both know I cannot change Sarah's path.
I can't influence her to make a different decision.
"I can't this, I can't that."
"It's all about you, isn't it?"
What?
Wonder why that is.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
"Where's Sarah in this equation, Tom?"
You're not making the choice.
She is.
"Come on, that is pure semantics, and you know it."
The only reason that she's changing her mind is because I'm a different person.
"So, you know what?"
"Actually, yes, it has everything to do with me."
"Hey, dad, what's going on?"
Nothing.
"Oh, I was just describing to the officer about my wallet, my lost wallet."
"So, thank you, officer."
"Well, we'll be sure to put every resource we have on this, just for you."
Let's go.
Marjorie?
Unbelievable.
That was one of the things that he had:
enormous trust in young people.
Lou put me in charge and gave me his checkbook.
"And he said, you know, ""You distribute the fees."""
And I grew a beard because I wanted to look older.
I'm serious.
How old were you when Lou died?
- I was 11.
- That's what I thought.
"- I was 11, yeah."
- Did you know him well?
- I have a sense for him.
- Right.
"And I saw him, you know, once a week, maybe."
"- That's all, though?"
"- That's about all, yeah."
"- Did you ever travel with him, or..."
"- No, no."
"That's why I wanted to talk to you, because you spent a lot of time with him."
"- Oh, yeah, me and my family did."
- Your family did too?
"He used to spend Christmas with us, yeah."
- He spent Christmas with you?
"- He loved Christmas, yeah."
He absolutely loved it.
"I can remember him lying on our bed watching cartoons with the kids... and then falling asleep, you know?"
"They'd just say,"
"""Lou's sound asleep, Daddy."""
"That's when we'll leave... ""You know, leave him be."
"He's tired."""
"Lou was very willful, you see?"
"Oh, God, can't you help her?"
Just help her!
It wants no straps.
"Hello, Regan."
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.
"You might loosen these straps, then."
"I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan."
I'm not Regan.
I see.
"Well, then, let's introduce ourselves."
I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the devil.
"Now, kindly undo these straps."
"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
"That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras."
Where's Regan?
"In here, with us."
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
"Could you help an old altar boy, Father?"
"Your mother's in here with us, Karras."
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll see that she gets it.
If that's true then you must know my mother's maiden name.
What is it?
What is it?
Thank you.
"Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good."
Nothing you could do could make it any worse.
I can't do it.
I need evidence that the Church would accept...
-...as signs of possession.
"That's why I brought you along, just in case."
But we didn't come to fight.
We came to burn railroad bridges.
"If you don't like the plan, you're free to drop out now."
"If you come, you'll do it my way."
[train bell]
- Cloudin' over.
- Yeah.
Is it gonna rain?
Might could.
"It rains one minute, shines the next."
[conductor] All aboard!
[train whistle]
"- Good morning, conductor."
- Morning.
Didn't you get on at Marietta?
You're the one who saved Xiao-Mei.
We owe you a lot.
"Oh, that's just my duty, it's nothing."
"Drink up, come on Mr. Jeng."
You could help this old fool.
"Thirst and respect, huh?"
"Mr. Wu, why did you say you were a fool?"
(laughing)
"If I tell you son, you'll still never know why."
(laughing)
"Oh yes, I understand you."
"Well, I feel like"
"I'm half drunk and half sober, half of me is mad and half of me a fool."
"I work half a day, and I get half day's pay."
Everything is just half and half again.
"(laughing) Well then, you would be half an old bald head and half a young man,"
"Well, the hit I can take."
"It's the not swinging back, that's what bothers me."
"Standing up for the truth the way you did,"
It's what I've been telling the American people
I'm gonna do for them.
That's why I'm in this.
"John, I don't know what to say."
Stop trying to argue yourself out of a job.
What's up?
"Royo, it's me,"
Aisha.
It's about the deal.
"Isaac ain't gonna bitch out, is he?"
You said this was happening.
He's still in.
"But listen up,"
"I know you ain't down with the split, never have been."
- Maybe I can do better.
- You?
Money ain't coming in like it was.
"That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together."
"If Isaac doesn't make it back from this meeting, wouldn't be a lot of tears."
You still there?
I'm here.
"Well, I'm still listening."
Good.
"Okay, he's got it."
"Oh, no."
- What?
- Locke signed in downstairs.
He was just bumped up to head of field ops.
He has a debrief scheduled with Mullins.
Are you angry because I'm here all fine?
Is that why you're mad?
Ok!
You can miss exits.
How can you go that far?
Are you stupid?
Fine you can forget your phone.
But wasn't there a phone booth?
You could have called!
I didn't think I would go that far.
I didn't even know that I didn't have a phone.
Did you know that I was waiting for you?
"No, I don't."
Excuse me!
Who are you?
I said I'm sorry.
"I'm really sorry, I want to die ok?"
Why are you so angry?
Is this worth it?
Did I do it on purpose?
"You even missed planes, did you forget?"
-It's twice now.
-Three times!
-Were you counting?
-I was never late!
Because it's always on your schedule.
You don't even care about my schedule.
"Whenever you call and say 10 or 20 minutes, I always had to go even I was on the toilet."
"Even then there could be traffic, or something could be wrong with the car."
You can be late!
But I should be able to call you!
The performance is driving me nuts!
"I let my guard down, fell madly in love, planned a huge wedding, and the guy didn't show up."
"- Wow, that really sucks."
- No kidding.
Must have been so humiliating.
I don't like to dwell on it.
"I mean, just standing up there in your wedding dress... and all those people staring at you?"
"The point is,"
I know a little bit about anger.
And it's not healthy to hold on to it... or to take it out on other people.
Especially someone as sweet as your mum.
It's killing her that she can't connect with you.
"I gotta tell you, whoever that guy was, it was his loss."
Thank you.
Because you must have been so hot back then.
Yes.
Way back then.
Oh.
Here she is now.
Talk to her.
It'll be fine.
I promise.
"Hi, sweetie."
"Listen, um..."
I don't know what to say.
Neither do I.
But we can try.
Really?
Yeah.
So where do you wanna start?
"Well, the fact that dad's engaged to a 25-year-old..."
Or that I think I have a crush on joy... and I'm pretty sure she's feeling it too?
"Oh, wow."
The band is too loud.
"Ten minutes, Yuri."
Ten minutes.
All I asked was that you hold Mikhail... for ten minutes.
Is that a long time?
No.
That is a very short time.
How long can you hold your breath?
"I know a fellow in Odessa once who could hold his breath... for five minutes, 33 seconds."
Did Mikhail talk to anyone while he was here?
"Nicholas, please."
The man is trying to speak.
He was talking... to her.
"So, what did you and Mikhail talk about?"
I told him he had a phone call.
The caviar is fresh tonight.
Did I tell you what a pretty girl you are?
"Let me ask you something, sweetheart."
Do you have any idea what will happen to you if you lie to me?
I will never lie to you.
"Because if you lie to me, pretty girl... you won't be pretty anymore."
Get back to work.
All she needs is a good f-
What are you doing over there?
"Oh, Mikhail, I missed you."
You're so tense.
I'll help loosen you up.
What's this?
You playing hard to get?
Is this a game?
Fine.
Have it your way.
Why?
- No.
"You just won a really big battle, my friend."
Come on.
"So we're not gonna get married, but I have to get rid of my pants."
Mm-hm.
And we both win.
All right.
I'll get rid of them if you like.
You're getting a lot of bids on this place?
Yeah.
"I know it's crazy, but it's a neighborhood in transition."
"Is that like young, hip, gay couples or something like that?"
Yeah.
"Hip gay people, young couples, young families."
ANNA:
Wow.
"God, this reminds me of where I grew up."
I bet it's got one of the...
Wait a minute.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, that's it."
We used to have the exact same one except my mom used it as a desk.
So when do all the fabulous people arrive?
"Well, actually, the open house is tomorrow."
But I have this one buyer and I wanted to make sure his girlfriend likes it first.
"Oh, he has a girlfriend, huh?"
"Yeah, I have an idea."
For this house.
For me.
"And hopefully, if you like it and things continue to, you know..."
"Anna I have a plan, okay?"
Listen to this
I've done all my daydreaming
"Oh, that sleep walk should be over by now"
"As for me, i moved to St. Augustine, Florida, where it hasn't snowed in 50 years."
- [ Engine Starts ]
- And you know what?
"I auditioned, and i was back on TV."
"[Male Announcer] And now it's time top lay north Florida cable's... second-most popular game show, Lucky Numbers, with your host, Russ Richards."
- Hey!
How are ya?
- [Audience Cheering]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Hey.
What a great-looking audience.
"My goodness, I'd love to take you home with me tonight."
How 'bout it?
"Tonight, after the show?"
Dinner for 250?
Okay.
I'll make the margaritas.
"All right, now..."
"[Narrating] You know, sometimes i walk past an appliance store... with 45 TV sets in the window, and i'm on everyone of them."
"At times like that, i say to myself, ""Why me?"""
"I mean, ""Why me?"""
"If i had to answe rthe question, i'd have to say, ""Just lucky."""
"You're making my dreams come true Doo-ooh, doo-doo, doo-doo"
Nights were warm
Dreams were easy
No one standing
Overhead
Conversation
Okay.
The police said the safe was locked.
The old man held out on the fucking guy.
As plain as day.
"Carlos, you want another helping?"
Carlos?
Carlos?
- You want more ham?
"- Oh no, I'm fine."
Thank you.
See you in a couple of days.
"Mickey, wait."
"Carlos, there's someone I want you to see."
Let's go.
"Come on, help me clean up."
Sean:
"Six months ago he came to me and asked for a loan, to stay afloat."
He shouldn't have been in that position.
I shouldn't have given it to him.
"The thing is, this is not a small loan, 25 grand."
Yeah.
Come on.
"There's a bodega on every corner of the Heights, Carlos."
What makes Eddie's profitable?
Eddie!
Why is Eddie in debt?
Eddie.
"If he sells the place, I get my money back, and I'm not forced to have this conversation."
We both know he ain't gonna sell it.
We both know he ain't gonna be able to work it for quite some time... if ever!
"The way I see out of this, for all of us... is you take over."
"The bodega, it's a cash cow."
Do not desire it.
Miss Dashwood.
Col. Brandon's lawn is perfect for kite launching.
Mind the pretty ribbons.
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte and her master appeared with Lucy.
The last person I expected to see.
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.
I'd not seen you for so long.
You sly thing!
It was the Dashwoods she wanted to see.
"I've heard nothing but ""Dashwood"" for I don't know how long."
What do you think of them?
My mother wrote of little else in her letters.
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.
You are quite rude today.
He's to be an MP.
And he is forced to make everybody like him.
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.
Here he comes!
"Now you shall see, Charlotte."
"Hello, Mr. Willoughby!"
"You must meet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr. Palmer."
"- And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele."
- Welcome to our party.
May I sit beside you?
I've longed to meet you.
I've heard nothing but praise for you.
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are too excessive in their compliments.
The praise came from another source.
"What ""regulations""?"
"Lockout devices must be in place during the cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery."" OSHA, 1989."
Yeah?
Write your congressman.
And hurry that up.
"Congratulations, Reznik."
Youjust made my Shit List.
She's copping his joint.
"He starts telling' her ""baby this"" and ""baby that"", chatting' her up like motherfuckin' Barry White."
"Tellin' her what he wants to do, and how he's gonna make the coochie feel and all that."
- That's right.
- So dig.
"She's stops, she looks up at him with these big puppy dog eyes and she's all: ""that sounds good puppy but me no have no coochie..."""
And the brother's like:
"""Say what?"""
And he looks down and sees that she is really a he!
"Man, that's bullshit."
You telling me the ho's wearing a thong and the fool can't tell the difference?
"She had a tuck job, man!"
"Come on, Jonesy."
You know how they do it!
- You might.
I don't.
"- Yeah, wathever..."
"Ei, Reznik?"
You up for some cards tonight?
Can't.
Got plans.
Shit.
Nigga says the same damn thing every poker night.
"What's up with you, man?"
You used to be all right.
-Ninety seconds.
Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
Except all I did was think about it.
I know.
It haunts me.
"Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy."
"After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver."
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.
I could do that.
Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.
"-Oh, thank God!"
-I know.
Come in!
Hi.
I'm sorry to barge in on your Valentine.
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.
"-Oh, my God."
-Poor Ross.
"We watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes."
You know that birthing tape you wanted to see?
It's here.
We should warn you before you watch it.
Don't watch it.
You saw it?
Is it scary?
It's ironic how footage of someone being born..
can make you want to kill yourself.
"Honey, she may not have to watch it but she's going to have to do it."
Now I'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?
"I have something to show you,"
"I just don't know if you'll be able to handle it, that's all."
I'm fed up with your mysteries.
I'm tired.
"Nathan, it'll take five minutes of your time, no more."
And then I'm out of here.
You'll never see me again.
I give you my word.
- You give me your word?
- Yes.
I give you my word.
"You know who I am, you know where I work, you're a lawyer."
"If I do anything wrong, anything at all which..."
It wouldn't take you five minutes to blow my career out of the water.
"Nathan, believe me, it's important."
You have to see it.
I swear.
It's important.
Come with me.
Five minutes.
10 minutes... no more.
And then...
I'm gone.
You brought me here just to tell me this?
What the hell does it mean?
Or is that all part of the message?
You come out with these little riddles of yours and expect me to...
"You see that guy, the kid in the orange jacket?"
Do you see him?
"Yeah, I see him."
So what?
Name of Dennis.
"But, man, she couldn't wait"
"So she's goin' out on dates with every Tom, Dick and Harry"
"And if you ask me, yo, shit""s gettin"" scary"
So how you gonna handle this
"When your ho""s in Los Angeles actin' so scandalous"
"Yo, you can""t blame her you didn""t take the time"
"And now ain""t no sunshine"
Ain't no sunshine
"Just for you in ""92."
"You know what I""m sayin""?"
Ain't no sunshine
"So if you don't want to do no time, you better take time and try to draw the line."
Or you're gonna be the next fool in line doin' time.
"You know what I""m sayin""?"
Like my man said.
"Ain't no sunshine, fool."
"Ain""t nothin"" happening"" up there."
"You know what I""m sayin""?"
"Yo, me and Frost is outta here."
(MEN WHISTLING)
COP 1 :
"Ain't nobody talking when I'm talking, fellows, so shut the fuck up!"
The following items you place in the envelope as I call them off.
An empty wallet.
Legal paperwork.
First three out of the tank.
COP 2:
Line up single file along the bench.
Let's go.
Open your mouth.
Stick out your tongue.
"He thought I was one of the guys that was trying to sell him out to, uh..."
"Well, to you."
He did all this to you?
Yeah -- with jumper cables.
"Tell me something, Mr..."
Sodor.
I have my sources at Mr. Schmidt's operation.
How come I never heard of you until now?
"He hired me on the qt, because he was always afraid of traitors."
And then you hacked the alarm system
"I set up in the Tampa warehouse, and then all of a sudden, I'm the traitor."
Sugar?
O-one sugar.
Just one?
Two.
"Listen, Schmidt was a paycheck."
I got no love for him.
I just want to go home.
And I can help you.
How can you do that?
"You want to catch this guy, right?"
I know where he lives.
You know where he lives.
Nobody knows where he lives.
Except me.
"I'm telling you, I was his secret weapon."
"In fact, the only place I ever met him was at his house."
"If you want to hit him, you got to hurry."
I just wish --
I just wish I could see that son of a bitch bleed.
Okay.
Give us his address.
What?
"Pauline, I'm in a meeting, you lardy trout!"
Wh...?
Insurance?
Hop it.
I just wanted a quick word with you about Enid and myself.
What are you talking about?
"Pauline, get Roberts."
Enid and I are in love.
"'Yes, we're in love.'"
'And why are you telling me?
'
Because I have to assume that you have feelings for her as well 'and that you want the best for her.'
'Are we talking about Enid Sutcliffe?
' 'Yes.'
Why do you think I care one way or the other about her?
Because I know what the situation is.
"Get out of here, you fat fool."
Coming shouting the odds in your cheap suit.
No-one's shouting.
"Can we not shake hands, like gentlemen, for Enid's sake?"
Enid's nothing to me.
"She's a spinster with a crush, that's all, whatever she's told you."
How dare you.
You've had what you've wanted for years and years and you say she's nothing to you?
You're despicable.
Tubby!
Ha-ha-ha!
Come with me!
You'll stay where you are if you want to keep your job.
"I love you, Enid!"
And don't let him back in!
Yes.
"And he's sincere and easygoing, and sexy,"
I just really like him.
Daddy?
Christine.
What?
- That's my date.
- That's my father.
- You're father?
- Your date?
You got to be freaking kidding me.
Don't answer that.
"Hi, we're not home right now."
"So leave a message for Christine,"
"- Ritchie, - and... say it."
Matthew.
"Oh, come on."
"Hi, Christine, this is Jeff."
Haven't heard from you since our date.
Don't know if you got my message so I thought I'd leave another one.
"I'm hoping that you didn't get the first message, because now there'd be two messages on your machine and that would make me look not cool."
And I think we both know how cool I am.
Bye.
"Well, he sounds cool."
Why aren't you talking to him?
I thought you liked him.
"No, I do like him but he's new Christine's dad."
I mean we had a great first date and everything but don't you think that's weird?
That he wants a second date with you-- absolutely.
Shut up.
You'd marry me in a second.
"Besides, I'm too busy to date."
Sergeant Wu got a hit on Kimura at the palms motel.
"But when they went to check on the room, they were attacked."
- Are they okay?
- For the most part.
But it wasn't Kimura.
It was a woman.
And we're thinking he's working with a woman who's not to be messed with.
So watch yourself.
"You too, Hank."
We keep the cats on this side.
"If we kept them with the dogs and the birds, they'd be screeching and hollering all night."
"Okay, how do we know which is the cat we're looking for?"
"Well, the name of the owner is on every cage."
Do you know the name of the owner?
"Yeah, Schade."
Adalind Schade.
Okay.
"Oh, hello, Majique."
You don't look very sick to me.
"[Cat yowls, cage rattles]"
"Yep, that's probably the one."
How's it going?
Everything all right?
"Yeah, there's nothing happening out here."
All right.
See you in the morning.
"All right, stand back."
Stand back.
Don't get too close.
We got to knock this thing out.
"If you don't have any drugs that'll do it, a 2x4 would be fine by me."
- How's Juliette?
Who did it?
We did it.
Better not be anything missing.
This is private property.
So was the radio private property.
So were Manfredi and Johnson.
What about the radio?
"Yeah, what about it?"
Cut the horsing around.
We know he's the stoolie and what the payoff is.
- So let's get on with it.
-Let's get on with what?
"What is this, anyway?"
A kangaroo court?
Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.
"You're all wire happy, boys."
You've been in this camp too long.
You put 2 and 2 together and it comes out 4.
Only it ain't 4!
"What's it add up to you, Sefton?"
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy.
Because I'm telling you the Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barracks.
"And whatever you do to me, you're gonna have to do all over when you find the right guy."
Watch it.
The kommandant.
"Achtung, Herr Kommandant."
"Good evening, sergeants."
"Little coffee klatch you are having, eh?"
"Gloomy in here, isn't it?"
Where is the barracks chief?
"Yes, sir."
- What?
- Get up.
How do you know Emma?
- The name's August.
- (DOG BARKING)
"And it's a long story, but trust me, you wanna hear it."
"All right, August."
You're not a cop.
Who are you?
You got two minutes.
Think of me as Emma's guardian angel.
Guardian angel?
I see you've been doing a pretty crap job.
I've been looking for her for the past two years.
"Now I finally find her, and she's robbing convenience stores with some deadbeat."
Tell me again who's doing the crap job?
Let me tell you something.
I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her.
Two years?
Where were you the rest of her life?
I'm not perfect.
This world?
Full of temptations.
"Turns out, I'm not that great at saying no."
Not built that way.
But I'm here now.
So who are you?
We were in the same home as kids.
"And I thought she'd be safe inside the system, but now that she's out..."
"Back then, I promised I would take care of her."
"Well, we promised to take care of each other."
You love her.
"Don't ever go back to the department, Colt!"
They'll use you up and hang you out to dry on Christmas!
You'll wind up sitting there with your freezing family waiting for the phone to ring!
"Don't worry, Dad."
They'll call you.
That's right.
And it'll be Bob Pogo on his hands and knees begging you to come back.
There's no reason for us to be worried.
Everything's gonna be fine.
That airline cannot go on without you.
Now enjoy your show.
Psychedelic dandelion!
I've been dosed!
There's a lizard in my brain!
"I'm Roger Dunbarton of Mohican Airways, and we are back!"

"Call today for a ""reservation""!"
I'm going to bed.
It's only 7:30.
- It's midnight in my mind.
- Frank...
I liked him better when he yelled at us.
God.
"Oh, God."
Why did he buy that damn TV?
No.
"So once a week, I can have BBQ with my brother."
"Or order a large pizza, or have raw fish."
He's so happy.
I have the dates.
"Yesterday, Mother and Hyang Gi's mother got the dates somewhere."
-When is it?
-Last Saturday of next month.
At Hyang Gi's pension.
Ok.
I would be lying if I say congratulations.
I won't congratulate you.
So today was our break up day.
That's too bad.
"Had I known, I wouldn't have gotten lost."
I wasted all that time.
I see why you got angry.
I knew something was wrong.
I practiced this moment way too many times in my bed.
I guess practicing helps.
You told me that we won't be able to get past this fall.
It's ok.
It's much better than I thought it would be.
"It's like, ""It's finally come."" Something like that?"
Good for you.
You're so ok.
I told you that I practiced.
Don't smile.
I don't want to see you smile.
You want me to cry?
"No, no, I can't do that."
You want me to cry my eyeballs out?
And maybe faint?
"Well, I honestly think that you're a train wreck."
Hi.
Hey.
You look nice.
Thank you.
I'm glad you called.
Yeah.
"Um, I called to give you... this."
Found it...
"Grady's, yeah."
"He asked me to take my shirt off to see if I was wearing a wire, and the mouse ears, I don't know."
You don't have to do that anymore.
Case is closed.
"Okay, so how does it work, the dying part?"
"Well, in Switzerland, a doctor would give a patient such as yourself a lethal dose..."
"- Oh, my God."
- Of sodium pentobarbital with a drink.
"There is no pain, no suffering, you just fall asleep."
"An option is to go to Switzerland and be what they call a death tourist, and fly..."
So?
Did you ever find out if your mom was a drug dealer?
"Oh, yeah, she's like a kingpin."
She has a whole empire.
You're such an idiot.
Hey.
Who's cat is that?
It's Casper.
"I gotta go out of town, for another job."
How long will you be gone?
Maybe a few months.
And who will you be this time?
Hard to say.
- They're talking to Phan and his crew?
"- Phan's crew, yeah."
Thanks for the info.
Just letting you know what it looks like.
Gotta think about this a little bit.
Things are moving fast.
Let me know what you wanna do.
"I'm gonna go visit the shoe shop next door, OK?"
Don't go anywhere else.
Come straight back here.
She's such a good kid.
God knows how that happened with all we put her through.
"Yeah, I worry about that."
You know Bob's new girlfriend?
What was her name again?
Lorna.
How did they hook up?
I have no idea.
Bob keeps his business to himself.
"I think they met at a club, or something."
I think she's having an affair with Jim.
You know anything about that?
You're kidding?
"Alison, don't lie to me, please."
I won't tell anybody you told me.
I think it happened just the one time.
When?
"When he was on his way back from Seattle, I guess."
When he was on the island.
That's the DEA building.
They've got offices over there.
"Do you know that for sure, the DEA got offices in there?"
"Well, he needs me."
You have your law and...
I have mine.
"Best thing you can do, Blake, is to get out of here as quick as you can."
You need medical attention.
Take the canoe.
"It's easy going now, but it won't be when the heavy snows come on."
Will you come with us?
"No, I'll stay here and work the mine."
"When you come back in the spring, we'll divide what I've found."
I came to say good-bye to Buck.
He never would have forgiven me if I'd forgotten that.
"Would you, Buck?"
You could have skipped that.
You're only making it tougher on everybody.
"Oh, Jack, put your arms around me."
"Well, I'll be seeing you."
Yes.
You'll be seeing me.
I'll be seeing you too.
Every day and every night and every minute.
This isn't the end.
It can't be.
Careful of that first stretch of rapids.
After that it's clear sailing.
"Good-bye, Thornton."
And God bless you.
"Good-bye, Blake."
"Good-bye, Jack."
"Good-bye, Claire."
"It's hard to say no to that call, isn't it, Buck?"
"It's all right, boy."
Otherwise it's impossible.
I won't use it.
You can trust me.
Would you trust someone like you?
You have my word.
Can he sleep at night?
Your partner.
I remembered.
He was in the Social-Political Brigade.
"You know, Franco's Gestapo."
He killed a girl at a protest in Vallecas in '71.
Shot her twice.
He's aged badly.
And I'm glad.
Hello.
How are you?
That's Marina.
She and my daughters were close friends.
Quini took her to the hunting lodge the other day.
"After they were together he asked her not to get dressed, and he tied her to the bed."
Then he left the room and came back with another man.
Who was he?
She didn't see his face.
"All she knows is he smelled good, like expensive cologne."
And that he had very soft hands.
He took photographs of her.
"Quini threatened to show them to everyone in town, if she told anyone."
The night my daughters were killed...
"Marina was with Quini, but not the whole night."
Do you think she'd be able to tell a judge?
She couldn't even tell you.
I have to go.
Dinner.
Candlelight.
And a promise that you will try to get to second base.
Done.
"You're meeting with Carol Finnerty, deputy special agent in charge of the president's Secret Service."
- I need a favour.
- This is a favour.
I need another favour.
I need a pass for my daughter.
- John--
- You don't understand.
"She's a freak for this kind of stuff, so if I get her in, I'm Dad of the Year."
I will owe you so much more than just candlelight dinner.
- I'll make a call.
- Perfect.
Thank you.
You're the best.
--A truly historic handshake.
What President Sawyer is proposing to Iranian president Al-Sharif is withdrawing all American troops across the entire Middle East and for that he'll ask his G8 partners for help.
"It's all about money, and who won't like this deal are American companies who do business with the American military."
Wanna grab the door?
Em.
I'll get it.
- Hey.
- You're late.
- She thought you weren't coming.
- Why wouldn't I be coming?
"Hey, you, little face."
"Come on, get your stuff."
"Let's go, baby."
"- Bye, Mommy."
I love you.
"Well, it depends on the size of the bottle and the size of the ship, to be honest."
"The way you have to, you have to force the ship through,"
SHIP through.
Can I use the toilet?
"That's probably not a question for me, right?"
"He's speaking to you, right?"
So...
Of course you can.
I can put shit in a bottle.
"Dermot, what the hell are you doing?"
!
"What do you mean, Dermot?"
!
What?
What's going on here?
!
"Sister, one second."
"Elsie, what are you talking about, don't blow cover yet."
It's time to blow cover.
"You've almost ruined it, you just fell asleep by eating one of those fucking chocolates, you idiot!"
I couldn't help it.
"Do you stand up, or are you going to sit down?"
I'll stand up.
"OK, ready?"
Let's blow this case wide open.
I've lost all control of my body.
"I'm so sorry, Elsie's had a..."
"It's all right, like, why is she calling you Dermot, right?"
"Well, what happened, she's, like I say, she's not..."
"Well, I'm no woman!"
What?
"I'm DI Sleet, from..."
"Come on, its my turn."
Please?
Just keep it legal.
"Wait, you sure your parents wont come home?"
They could.
"But, this isn't their Jacuzzi."
Brooke... whose house is this?
I don't know!
Does it matter?
Here you go.
"Wow, for the diet special that looks pretty damn tasty."
Oh!
Sorry.
"Things have worked out pretty well, huh?"
"Karen's café gets to stay open, and I get to see a little more of my sister-in-law."
"So, how are you doing with things?"
"Uh, we had our first counseling session yesterday."
Dan and counseling.
It's kind of like Hannibal Lector at a salad bar.
"Well, if you think it would help, I'd be happy to talk to Nathan."
I think he'd like that.
"I know you like my women, Keith, but come on!"
Deb's still my wife.
Won't be for long if you keep this up.
I'm taking Nathan to dinner tonight.
Do you have a problem with that?
- Yeah.
He needs a break from you.
- You can't stop me from seeing my own son.
"Oh, actually I can."
"By telling you nicely, or calling a lawyer."
Your choice.
You're not as important as this body.
When he said he was busy everyday...
I guess he had time to exercise.
"Then...when he said he was too busy, and didn't have the time,"
I wonder if it was all an excuse?
I wonder if he just didn't want to see me?
"What do you mean, he didn't want to see you?"
Even on that day...
He was on his way to see you.
That's right!
You said he even had something to tell you when he saw you!
The thing he was going to tell me when he saw me...
You think it was to tell me that he loved me?
What if it's not?
Gil Da Ran...
I love you.
Like this!
I'm sure he was going to say this to you.
Yeah...
I'm sure you're right.
"I'm sure that's it, right?"
That's it...
And here I am on my own...
How stupid I am.
"Yeah, yeah..."
That's stupid.
Let's pack up some clothes.
This color looks really good on Yoon Jae.
This color looks really good too!
Wow...
This color suits really well too...
Here.
Thank you.
I'll drive up to Joe's Cabins.
I'll take a look at the junction.
"Yeah, I-I'm Reed."
Latham Reed.
"But you might as well know now, Mr. Mason, I-"
- I just can't remember.
What can't you remember?
"Here, sit up."
Nothing.
"From that moment yesterday afternoon when Somers offered me a highball and I said no, make mine lemonade."
Thought it tasted funny - for lemonade.
Used to be an alcoholic.
For three years I didn't touch a drop.
Didn't even smell a cork.
I'll kill that Somers.
Someone already has killed him.
Yeah.
Edie told me.
First good news I've had since she brought me to.
Where did she find you?
Mmm.
You'll have to ask her that when she comes back with more coffee.
"You took a certified check yesterday, isn't that right?"
"A check for $50,000?"
A check that Somers asked you to deliver and endorse over to a hospital fund?
How should I know?
"When she found me, she said that I had $7,000 in $500 bills."
- Now-- - [door opens]
Now what?
"I couldn't spot her, Perry."
"No sign of Axel, either."
"What about your store, Ladyjaan, and your customers?"
Is it not right for us to go back to where we belong?
"Not for me, Ladyjaan."
Are you not angry at what they did to you?
"Of course, I'm angry, Ladyjaan."
But I still have both my eyes and I have such friends.
"Haroun, you have found so much more than wealth here."
You came for a dream and found love.
"Now, what did you bring for me?"
It's for Hameeda.
"Well, actually... it's for you both... together."
Lotus root.
You put this on her on the night of your wedding.
It's for a lifetime of deep loving.
Here it is.
What do you think?
It's uh...
It's beautiful.
Is this yours?
"Oh, yeah."
"It's an old bakery, actually."
I just love the idea of making old things new.
There's something cool about it.
"Forgive me, Doug, but I have to return to where I belong."
You showed me such love.
Thank you.
But it cannot be.
I do not expect you to understand.
But there is no other way.
I'm sorry.
I will carry your love with me forever.

I remember a summer evening in Gramercy Park.
"-Evening, Mr. Bourne."
-Good evening.
-Mrs.
Bourne.
-Good evening.
Must be Thursday night.
"Bran, every Thursday we have this mad dash against time."
Why?
So we won't have to rush.
I'm never late for dinner with your mother.
It's a matter of principle.
"-Jessie, darling."
"-Hello, dear."
-On the dot.
-As always.
"-Horace, good evening."
"-Hello, Brandon."
The first of the season.
-The flower I love best.
"-Hello, Hannah."
"-Thank you, Brandon."
"Kiersten, where's Tony?"
[Kiersten] He's at the Mexican restaurant.
[Rossi] Is someone around him?
"Yes, uh, but I can't really make out his face."
What about his body?
Is it young?
Is it old?
"Uh, 25 maybe."
Wait.
He's wearing a mask.
- Like the kid?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
It only covers one side of his face.
"His ear is gone, and, um..."
[Rossi] What do you see?
It's a black guy.
He's black.
You make him sound like he's Freddy Krueger or something.
"No, but I do think he's severely burned."
Explains why he chooses this time of the year.
- He doesn't have to hide his scars.
- What about his victims?
He's punishing them for wronging him.
[Garner] Wronging him?
What about his second victim?
Have you looked at Josephine Davis' life?
She was the nicest woman in the world.
How did she wrong this guy?
"He's had interactions with all of his victims, some more personal than others."
So he's acting out of revenge.
Kiersten and Tony didn't even speak to him.
"Maybe not that night, but at some point in the past."
I want you to go back in the kitchen and stay there till I tell you to come out.
"That way, in case they get trigger-happy, you'll be out of the line of fire."
And then you'll let me go?
I'll let you go.
(PLAYING HARMONICA)
"Byron, is that the road you went down?"
"Look, don't go in there fucking around."
"In and out, you got me?"
Now what do you think I'm going to do?
"Don't worry about it, all right?"
You sure this is it?
Yeah.
(WATER RUNNING)
(CAR APPROACHING)
You got it straight?
You got it straight?
Yeah.
"Hi, baby."
"Come on, Fantasia, let's go."
"It'll be a few minutes, Ray."
I got to pack my stuff up.
What the hell are you going to pack?
All you had was that little old goddamn purse.
"It won't be long, you all come on in."
Shit.
I'm going to be right back.
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.
"Man, she better not have bought any fucking clothes."
How much she got to pack?
"Come on, come on."
"Be careful, honey, I love you."
(mutters)
Smells mighty familiar.
Krammar's Delicious Mystery Appetizer!
"All right, where is she?"
- Where is she?
!
"Alice, come out here!"
-Uh... upstairs on the phone.
"Upstairs on the phone, huh?"
Today was the most humiliating day
-I've ever spent in my whole life.
-Really?
How would you feel if you gave your boss dog food to eat?
"Terrible, unless my boss is a cocker spaniel, I tell you."
Dog food!
It's a miracle I wasn't fired.
"I know who did it, too."
Alice's mother.
"She come over here to cook me a tidbit, that's what she did."
"She don't care what Alice gives me to eat, just as long as Alice can scrimp and save and live around here in the lap of luxury!"
"Those ain't the facts, Ralph."
Those ain't the facts.
"They're not the facts, huh?"
Then why would we have dog food around the house?
And in our ice box?
!
"What, have we got a dog or something?"
"Ralph Kramden, you have just reached the first plateau!"
What are you talking about?
!
"I'm not talking about it, and I'm not saying it."
Just put your nose in that bedroom there.
It's all good.
I'm happy.
I'm very happy.
"well, get off the phone then before I start crying."
All right then.
Okay.
Love you.
See you.
-talk to you later.
"AII right, bye-bye."
-Bye.
t's amazing man.
That's literally why I auditioned for the show in the start.
"Like, I just wanted to be able to give back to my mum and stuff."
So it's wicked to be able to do that.
It's really cool.
Tonight is the biggest show we've ever done.
I'm just throwing it out there.
"e are playing to 65,000 people tonight."
It's just insane.
Good luck.
Look at the amount of policemen...
-...we've got.
-I can't get over how many police bikes there are.
They've got 40 policemen on us and then they've got like 1 000 policemen on the streets.
"It's quite scary, but it's quite fun at the same time."
We literally have like a small army.
We do have the army.
Let's take over this place.
What is that girl doing out the top of the car?
With an english hat on.
She is a literal rebel.
Zach didn't even sleep with Hallie.
And even if he had how could I blame him?
I practically...
pushed him into Hallie's arms.
She was right.
Maybe I do play victim sometimes.
Everyone's been right about me.
"You're afraid of a real relationship, Dale."
I've just had a blind eye to it.
I've scared of getting hurt.
Because he's too perfect.
I've kept Zach at arm's length.
You are so afraid of getting hurt that you end up picking guys that have absolutely no substance.
Hey...
Am I gonna live the rest of my life...
with guys like... this?
Just to... avoid someone... real?
No.
Hell no!
I'm ready to change.
If I get... one more chance...
I won't screw it up... again.
If I just get one more... chance.
I'll be right there.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to come by and talk.
"Look, I think we've done enough talking."
I'm really not interested in talking with you.
I just wanted to say that I understand that this isn't gonna work.
"You and I, that is."
Ok.
Why did you hang out with me?
- All right.
"Bye, Mom."
I left a wake up call for 9.
Do you want something to eat?
You mean this is one of those basement breakfast places?
I don't know how long we can keep doing this.
"Well, it won't be long."
- You'd go back to your foster parents?
- Not a chance.
But I've saved up enough to get out to Arizona.
I have a friend in Flagstaff.
You gonna miss me?
"It was nice knowing when something goes bump in the night, it's you."
What have you got to be afraid of?
Forgot this.
Honey?
Put on gloves if you're gonna do the dishes.
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I can't do this anymore.
"Last night after I left, I felt awful."
I'm sorry for what I did and what almost happened.
I should have figured it out.
At least I should have listened to you.
"Yeah, well, it was terrible but all I could think about was my mom."
I'm sorry.
I was so mean.
"- Well, I had it coming."
- No.
I was thinking.
A could have given that ticket to mom but they made you do it to make it hurt more.
Says here they got reason to believe they're headed for Houston.
Seems to me they just may fit the description of the folks you boys are after.
Son of a bitch.
Think we may even have a photograph of them.
They ran out of a convenience store earlier.
Surveillance camera?
"Yeah, I think so."
Texas.
"Looks like they're headed our way, boys."
"Hey, you got another cup?"
"Sure, if you don't mind drinking after me."
"No, not at all."
Goddamn.
Texas.
Whew.
You think it was our people who whacked that state trooper?
We'll know as soon as we get the photo.
Hurricane...
He's waiting on the bad guys the way a kid waits for Christmas.
"Yeah, well, Hurricane's a force of nature."
I like old Hurricane.
Nice fellow.
You know what he told me this morning?
What?
He said he was thinking of coming to L.A. and joining the force.
You're kidding.
Honest to God.
He said that he thought me and him and Mackintosh would make a hell of a team.
No shit.
(LAUGHING) He said he wanted to take a crack at the big time.
Jesus.
What did you say?
I was right.
Only $ 100...
I'm short of money right now.
I've been out of work...so just give me a little time.
"You understand, don't you?"
"You've got balls, young man!"
How come I never heard of you before?
You've got a lot of guts.
I'll find you some work for good money.
"No hard feelings, right?"
"If I can help you, let me know."
You've done well for yourself.
Enjoy the festa!
"Oh, this is too violent for me!"
What've you got there?
"Michael, your father loves you very much."
"Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942 to the present time, you were an employee of the Genco Olive Oil Company?"
That's right.
But in actuality you were a member of the Corleone crime organization.
"No, we called it the Corleone family, Senator."
What was your position?
"At first, like everybody else, I was a soldier."
-What is that?
"-A button, you know, Senator."
"No, I don't know."
Tell me.
"When the boss says ""push a button"" on a guy, I push a button."
"See, Senator?"
Mr. Questadt.
-You mean you kill people?
-What?
You kill people at the behest of your superiors.
"Through this bucket list, we want you to see that life is precious and beautiful--"
- I'll hook up with girls at the club...
- Excuse me..
And I'll have one night stands everyday.
"Stop, stop, stop."
We'll stop here!
Don't stop and let me continue.
"Do you think this broadcast is a joke, Sin Joon Young?"
It's not.
I'm being honest here.
What wouldn't I be able to do if I were to die soon?
What about drugs?
"Will you drink and drive, gamble, use public restrooms?"
"Do you want to date me, PD No Eul?"
Let's say I'll die in three months.
For only three months.
Really deeply.
Only... 3 months.
"Really passionately, with all of my strength."
"Well, since it was just a test..."
Those jokes don't really matter.
I'm not joking though.
I said I wasn't joking.
- Jin Young...
"- Do you not want to, PD?"
- Jin Young...
"- Do you not want to, PD?"
What do you mean?
I'm so thankful!
Top star Sin Joon Young is proposing that we date.
"If I said I didn't like it, I would be crazy!"
PD No!
Because you're kaputt.
Get this guy out of my hair so I can go.
To the kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
"Why, I'll kill you for that!"
Shut up.
"Security officer, huh?"
Always screening everybody.
"Only, who screens you?"
"Great American hero, from Cleveland, Ohio."
Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor.
When was Pearl Harbor?
Or don't you know that?
"- December 7th, '41."
-What time?
Six o'clock.
I was having dinner.
Six o'clock in Berlin.
They were having lunch in Cleveland.
"- Am I boring you, boys?"
-Go on.
"He's a Nazi, Price is."
"For all I know, his name is Preissinger or Preisshoffer."
"Oh, sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back like a good little Bundist."
"He spoke our lingo, so they sent him to spy school and fixed him up with phony dog tags."
He's lying.
He's trying to get himself off the hook.
- He said shut up.
-You heard what he said.
"Okay, Herr Preisshoffer, let's have the mailbox."
The what?
The one you took out from the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Let me show you how they did it.
Me too.
I'm glad you came.
How can anyone live two years in a place like this?
"The bathroom's clogged, no water, it's disgusting!"
"I'm used to it, but you don't have to be."
"I can't allow you to live in a place like this, you go home tomorrow, there's a train at 9."
"No, I'm yourwife."
- I'm staying here with you.
- But Chicco?
- He has to become independent.
- As of when?
As of now.
"When we're organized, we'II bring him here to live."
"We're a family, we have to stay together."
"It would be wonderful, but I can't allow it."
What's that?
"It's the neighbors, they fight all the time."
Not anymore.
hold me.
But you leave tomorrow.
- Think they're asleep?
- Warrior's rest.
- Let's go home.
"- No, I have an idea."
"We end with a blast, Iet's burn down the town hall."
Aren't you coming?
"No, I have to bodyguard his wife."
Goodnight.
Why don't you stay here?
Be serious.
"It's the first time we've been alone, even Mom's not here."
"It's all pretend here anyway, right?"
It's a pet scheme of mine.
- A recreation spot for the kids.
"- Kind of a kindergarten place, huh?"
"No, it's for the big fellas too."
You'd be surprised how tremendously it's helped to keep the kids from becoming...
Hoodlums like me?
- You've cost me a lot of prayer.
- I've been in kind of a retreat myself.
- Yes.
Will you be here for some time?
- Depends.
I got a little business to attend.
- I gotta find a place to live.
- Get a room here in the parish.
- Not a bad idea.
No place like home.
"- Yes, and it's great to have you home."
- I came back to take a look at your kisser.
- Stick around and take a lot of them.
This is Maggione's.
Go in and get a furnished room.
"Remember her, don't you?"
Took a lot of good lead pipe out of that cellar.
Church is just around the corner.
I can drop in to see you from time to time.
- See you at Mass Sunday?
- Sure.
I'll help you with your collection.
- It's a deal.
- Fair enough.
- Mrs. Maggione at home?
- What do you want?
You can read my mind!
You really understand me.
You talk in such a romantic way!
"It's late, let's go to bed."
That's good.
You first.
"No, you first..."
Come on!
"No, I mean, I dare not, I really dare not."
"Come on, just give me some face."
"No, I..."
"Alright, I'll listen to you."
I think my husband doesn't like me any more.
"We have married for 7 years, and I went to Britain for one year."
He didn't look at my eyes when he talked to me.
"I can't help, so I didn't look at his eyes when I talked to him too."
"Foon, he sent me to university and wanted me to study law, actually, I studied something else."
What's that?
Fashion design.
What kind of subject is it?
Needlework.
Woo!
What a wonderful world.
The world has changed a lot!
Even needlework can be a subject in the university!
So you should go out to see the world.
You've rung my bell!
A man should fight for his future!
I think I should go somewhere!
"Maybe the nearest city, Hong Kong."
Are you going to Hong Kong?
"Yes, Master."
"That's teenager for ""okay."""
"Now, you see what happens when you..."
"Oh, God, I do sound like that."
(cell phone chimes)
Yes!
"Thank you, God!"
You passed the evaluation?
Close enough.
I'm on probation!
- Congratulations.
- Wow.
- Probation party!
- What did you do to turn it around?
A lot of things I'm ashamed of!
"Waitress, a round of hot water and lemon for my friends!"
"Previously on ""2 Broke Girls""..."
"I am choosing to take this disaster as a sign, and while they're rebuilding this place"
I'm gonna go surprise Randy and try to rebuild us!
"Fine, use my car, but I'm going to be driving it."
I'm coming with you.
I finally got the gas pedal extension where I like it.
I'll just call AAA.
Cool.
"Later, hater."
"Wait, you're really leaving?"
Who leaves someone on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere?
"My friend, Sloppy Joe, has a one-engine plane."
He might be able to fly y'all all the way to LA.
"Well, that's a wrap on the first day of filming here in Austin, Texas."
So Randy's not in Los Angeles?
He's in Texas?
"Uh, excuse me."
Is there an OrangeJulius stand on this floor?
I'll sell you this one.
It's almost full.
Why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl?
He'll be back.
"As for your case, don't you worry."
"I've argued in front of every judge in the state, often as a lawyer."
[ Slurping ]
This court rules in favor of Montgomery Burns.
I find that he is clearly the boy's biological father.
[ Happy Chattering ]
"Uh,Judge, these won't be ready until Thursday."
"You know, we should really stop hiring him."
[ Whistle Tooting ]
- Cool train.
Where does it go?
- Beats me.
But it won't be back for three hours and 40 minutes.
- Once it had snow on it.
"- Wow, Bart!"
Mr. Burns gives you everything you could ever want.
My parents use that old love excuse to screw me out of toys.
"Well, I'm sure you'd like to be alone with your possessions."
"Um, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer... you can have this blazer."
- It's a Bob Mackie original.
- Wow!
A Bob Mackie!
"Uh... sorry, Bart."
[ Groaning ] Oh.
"Bartholomew, you don't need him."
I can be your school yard chum.
"Oh, you want to play some more."
"Well, bring it on."
"Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?"
"Hmm, looks like we've got a music lover here."
Reinforcements!
"All right, soldiers."
Looks like it's on us to save the day.
"Luckily, I've got a plan."
"Eska, Desna, listen to me."
You've got to help us stop Unalaq.
"I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy."
We will never turn on our father.
"Please, if you let me out now,"
I can still stop him from destroying everything.
"Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe."
"Desna, he won't be your father anymore."
You don't know what you're talking about.
Our father is the wisest man in the world.
"If he says what he is doing is right,"
I believe him.
Huh?
"You know, if I wanted some ball of evil lurking over my shoulder all the time,"
I'd have stayed home with my mother-in-law.
"All right, spirit army, your general is here."
Follow me!
It's working.
It's not working.
Get me out of here!
Whoo-hoo!
Aah!
"All right, guys."
Rescue time.
"Warm, nurturing, homebody."
- It's my mom's.
- You live at home at your age?
"Well, yeah, it's temporary."
"See, I used to live in New York."
I moved to L.A.
- Because I had this fiancée...
- Should have seen her apartment.
Steel.
What is it with people that want to live in a warehouse?
"Hi, I'm Nora."
- How do you do?
I'm Elise.
- You have something you need to do?
I do.
I'm organizing the linen chest.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
"Elise, when do you think I'll have my first date?"
Don't get ahead of yourself.
We do have work.
"Your dating techniques, your appearance, your hair."
What...
What's wrong with my hair?
- A little product wouldn't hurt.
- I don't need product.
"No, just for a little volume."
"Now, I need to prep you on what you're going to say."
"Oh, well, you know, I'm..."
"I know that I look young, but I've actually been dating for about 20 years, so I..."
And yet you've never sealed the deal.
"Well, maybe I've never wanted to ""seal the deal."""
- Don't be defensive.
I hope I won't.
You never know.
"Hey, girl!"
"You're not from around here, are you?"
Let me see...
You're...
"twenty, maybe twenty five."
Your hair is black.
But your soul is deeply bothered.
Here it comes.
"Yes, my child."
I'm blind.
Blind as a bat.
Then how you know I'm a woman and how old I am?
I've been sitting here for the past 40 years.
The only thing I do here is listen to the sounds.
"Ma'am, if you don't mind."
I...
"I'm sorry, but it is necessary."
[Greta barking]
"We do a routine investigation on any accidental death,"
"Particularly one like your brother's, where"
There weren't any witnesses.
I don't know what to say.
The police told me it was an accident.
"Yeah, I read the report she gave to our detective"
The next day about how you brother parked on the hill
On account of the dead battery.
"Well, I've been thinking about the past four days"
As how I should have gone out and helped him.
I should've insisted.
But I don't understand how the car got down the hill.
"Look, all I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie."
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night after the show, she got somebody fired."
- Really?
"- One of the crew, the sound guy."
There were some wires on the floor.
She was like... complaining and
"I mean, I met the guy when I was."
He was a nice kid.
Now what's he gonna do?
What's he gonna do?
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer billy logan, right?"
My what are you doing here?
"My god, come in, come in!"
I can't believe this.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the web site, so I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew after-hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here,"
"I have, well, a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."""
Not much of a note.
Gulp it down quick.
Then you won't taste it.
I know.
"You want your daddy to give it to you, don't you?"
Daddy will give you the medicine.
Give it to me.
There.
"Be a nice girl, now."
Or you'll never be strong and big like Daddy.
"If Daddy took a spoonful first himself, Baby might do a patty-cake for him."
This is delicious.
This is...
All for a nice little elephant girl.
This is lovely.
You ain't so stupid as you look.
That's better.
"Annie, don't ever worry me like that again."
"There you are, you two."
I've got letters for both of you.
There.
Sgt. MacChesney and Sgt. Archibald Cutter.
Look what it says here.
"""Miss Emaline Stebbins requests the pleasure..."
"""of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company at a""..."
What's that?
"""...betrothal dance preceding her marriage to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine."
"""8:00 p.m. Friday."" That's tonight."
"I worried so about you, dear, while you were away."
Perfectly awful things must have happened at Tantrapur.
It was rather touch and go there for a bit.
- You haven't told me yet about it yourself.
"- No, I haven't, have I?"
We have to work through this.
"- We have huge issues, Peter."
- All couples do.
I'm guessing our issues are pretty unique.
This...
This is really not the right time to talk.
- When is the right time?
- When it's not my dead husband's birthday.
Fair enough.
- I have to get back.
- I'll call you later.
Where is everybody?
"After Shane tells Silas that man is in the DEA,"
Silas tells Shane he's your boyfriend and you don't care about Judah no more.
"So he smashed the cake and run upstairs, and Silas go outside to fuck up the stucco with a basketball, and Andy go upstairs to get norched."
I eat from stress.
Shit.
Silas.
Silas.
- Talk to me.
- You're insane!
He's a fucking DEA agent!
Yes.
"Yes, he is, but it's okay."
He's okay with it.
So he's a crooked DEA agent.
Even better.
"Peter protects my business, Silas."
"Well, maybe now, but what happens when he breaks up with you?"
Or do you think you're so great that that's never gonna happen?
- What happens when he dumps you?
- He can't do anything to me.
Bust that shit up!
Bust it like it's Dyson's douchey-ass face!
Yes!
That face is never kissing again.
- What else?
- We wallow.
Kenzi break-up mix on repeat all frigging afternoon.
- You have a break-up mix?
"- Dude, you have so much to learn."
Yes.
And then it's girls on the town.
"We're gonna burn this city to the ground, baby!"
I don't do that.
I'm not much of a party queen.
Drinking equals losing control equals someone gets dead.
"Yeah, but what a way to go, dude."
"Okay, fine."
We'll cut loose somewhere safe.
"You know, this is what I don't get, okay?"
"I did nothing wrong, and I'm the one whose day has gone to shit."
"For Dyson, it's like, ""Bo who?"" Totally unaffected."
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're gonna party.
We're gonna forget about it.
All right?
We'll see about that.
"Okay, this is me in the bar."
- And this is me going back to bed.
"- Oh, no."
We are not wasting hours of dress-up.
I don't care if I have to slather you with fairy dust.
You ever seen 'em?
"""Eeeh!"""
"And the mom's like, ""What the fuck?"
"""Oh, my God, why don't you just listen?"
"Why don't you do what I tell you?"""
And the little kid get up all disrespectful.
"""I don't know!"""
"""How come you can't be a good mom, Margaret?"""
Gonna call the mom out by the first name.
I wish I would call my moms out by her first name.
"I would no longer have a mouth on my face, do you hear me?"
I'd be talking from a hole in my neck like Terrie from the smoking commercials.
You ever see her?
¶ You know I'm gonna do it for you ¶
She be...
"""Hi."
"""My name Terrie."
"""And I'm a smoker."
"""And you put on your wig, put in your teeth,"
"""and go about your day."
"I'm a smoker."""
A what?
"""A smoker."""
A mimosa?
"""A smoker!"""
I'm sorry.
"But for everybody who has seen that commercial, that is not just cigarettes."
"That's meth, nigga."
That's what that is.
"Oh, oh!"
"Oh, I would love to see her drinking from a water fountain."
I would love it.
"Really, James, it's your own fault."
"You can't expect to worry yourself sick over Paul's death, and do your own job at the same time."
"I know, but-- - no ifs or buts about it."
You worried yourself into a really low state.
Now look what's happened.
I'm sorry.
"You're right, of course."
"I understand how you feel, but I want you to pull yourself out of it."
Promise?
If you promise not to go on about it.
It's a deal.
You just relax while I go boil another kettle.
Drink that up.
There's another one to come.
Who is it?
It's me.
May I come in?
If you don't mind catching flu.
How are you feeling?
Jolly good.
"James, let me ask you a question."
"Tris, I'm really not up to it-- no."
Shush.
Tell me...
"When is the last time we stood up to siegfried,"
I mean faced him out to the bitter end?
- Ah-- ah-- you see?
"You can't answer, can you?"
Because neither of us ever have.
We've always given in to him.
"Well, this time, I'm going to do it."
Do what?
"I'm sorry, sir, no visitors."
TRIP:
You let me in before.
I have new orders from Major Hayes.
"Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me during the last session."
I think she caused some nerve damage.
MACO:
You'll have to speak with the Major.
This is a Starfleet ship.
I don't have to ask Major Hayes for anything.
MACO:
"Step away, sir."
REED:
"Stand down, Corporal."
The Captain gave Hayes control of the Bridge... posted macos on every deck.
-Is he still on the surface?
-Yeah.
Retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority.
I'd advise securing the Bridge first.
If Hayes gets wind of this... we could have a fire-fight on our hands.
"Perhaps we should approach the Major, and explain the situation."
-He seems like a reasonable man.
-That would be risky.
"If Hayes sides with the Captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the Armoury?
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.
"They'll side with us, but Hayes posted two MACO there."
-Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
"-What about you, sir?"
You heard me.
REED:
- Mikhail's back.
- Bring him to me.
How can I bring him in when I've got my hands tied behind my back?
Let me deal with him my own way.
This is not a democracy.
You do what I say.
You understand?
Mikhail has caused no trouble.
"If FBI had the list, believe me... we'd have major war with Italians, with everyone."
"If he is here, then list is still in France."
I will convince Mikhail to take proper course of action.
"So, bring him to me."
I meant no disrespect.
I'm just worried.
Remember when you told me about Goradini talking to the FBI?
And Pietro?
And Andrea?
"I took care of them for you, Dimitri."
But Mikhail is different.
I know you feel like he's your son.
"Yes, Dimitri."
- is this also Mikhail's place?
"- No, my friend's."
Mikhail and I used for come here to escape.
You looked comfortable with that gun stuck in that guy's neck today.
That didn't scare me as much as when you tried to drown him in the Jacuzzi.
I lost it.
Sorry.
How long you been working at the Bohemia?
About a year.
I used to dance.
Nightclubs.
wayne!
this is mine?
i own this?
- all yours.
"- i have never gotten anything this nice in my entire life, wayne."
- so then... you like it?
'cause the guy i got it from said it's in great condition.
"- matsui, your favorite co-  please stop talking."
i just need a minute.
ahh.
"oh, yeah."
this is my helmet?
- that's your helmet.
"put it on, baby."
it matches the bike.
you look so good.
- thank you.
[chuckles] [sighs] how'd you afford this?
- don't worry about it.
it's a gift.
- is it from your college fund?
"- i was born in a trailer park, i was raised in a trailer park, i'm assistant manager of the dollar king, and my woman is cindy wegman."
- what?
"- that's who i am, baby."
- as long as you're sure.
"- well... you see, baby... meeting you brought so much joy in my life and -- [engine turns over, revs] [shouting] and i don't want that joy to end, so i was thinking, maybe you'd do me the honor of..."
[engine revving]
- whoo!
[laughs] [engine shuts off]
- you got to be kidding me.
- want to go for a ride?
- what?
- I never applied.
"Oh, my God."
I cannot believe he actually did it.
"Months ago, Chuck joked about applying for you."
He said you had too much pride to admit N.Y.U. Was a mistake.
Looks like he actually did something right for once.
Congratulations.
"Oh, thanks."
You're not at the gala?
Yeah.
I thought it'd be best for everybody if I didn't go.
I see my father is still working his magic.
It's not all him.
"Yes, it is."
It's just that no one else sees it.
You make my mom happier than all of her ex-husbands combined.
"It should be you with her tonight,"
Not some guy who pulled a disappearing act.
"Well, I am already in the tux."
"Elliot, what are you doing here?"
Your father invited me?
He said he didn't think you had plans tonight.
Not me.
I hope that's okay.
"It's okay to be mad at him, Eric,"
"But it's okay to let him try to make it right, too."
All right.
I'm heading out.
Wish me luck.
You don't need it.
You're the only one for her.
After Dr. Van Der Woodsen organized
- Yes.
- Why did you fire Pete?
- Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"It's not so fun being hands-on with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
- Can we talk about this on Monday'?
"- No, I want Pete back."
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe.
And I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
Fine.
I thought you were gonna quit.
"Yeah, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Holla at your boy!
"Hey, you will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer."
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.
Excuse me.
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, you think there's two lines and we're all in this line-- you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
Can you believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"What do you want on yours, baby?"
"I want all the hot dogs, please."
He's always doing fine.
"You won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction, the Nobel Prize for literature."
That's a lot of pressure on a little suicide note that you know everybody's gonna read.
It's just so dark.
Doesn't even sound like him.
But dark is good.
Dark's like the new black.
Look at Louis CK.
Got his own show.
He's dark.
"If I was gonna kill myself, I know exactly what I'd do."
"I would, uh..."
I'd kill myself with kindness.
"Take a handful of pills, hop in bed."
Maybe some Enya.
In some countries...
Get this.
"In some countries, it's illegal to commit suicide."
It's against the law for you to kill yourself.
Okay?
Are you with me here?
"Sir, I want you to focus, okay?"
I realize you're dead.
Step out of the vehicle and put your hands behind your back.
"If you wanna play tough guy, we've got all night, all right?"
"Handcuffs seem like overkill, but I have to arrest you."
You have the right to remain...
Bad law.
- Hello?
"- Hey, Chelsea."
"It's me, Julia."
- I've been trying to call Eddie.
Or a selective one.
You want me to refresh it for you?
"I'm sorry, John."
Here it is.
The off-ramp costs me five million.
Another $35 million for the subway stop.
You'll get some from me.
The rest I got to beg Albany.
I got better things to beg for from Albany.
I got a solution.
How about a spur off the Canarsie Line?
- Are you crazy?
A spur is $ 120 million a track mile.
BankExchange is good for the poor.
It's good for the jobless.
It's good for the whole city.
"As for subway stops, infrastructure, off-ramps we can't afford it."
"Then, you'll have to forget the whole thing."
I love the second act opener.
Then you won't want to miss it.
"""This Was a Real Nice Clambake."""
I'm building up my IOU's with Albany.
The governor needs to step up with a new subway stop or I won't support him for reelection.
And the off-ramp?
Next year.
- It's already in my budget.
- Next year's too far.
"You're only a boss, Frank."
I'm the fucking mayor.
Mayors rule.
BankExchange.
My way or the highway.
"[Man on TV] Oh, that can't be goo for his lower back!"
"Human Baboon, you stinker!"
Stop your evil ways.
[Thwacking]
"Oh, no, you don't."
"[Arthur] Tick, help!"
Egad!
My cold has escalated into double vision.
I'm the real Arthur.
He's a clone.
I Arthur.
What matter of rare quandary is this?
How can I be sure which Arthur is the real Arthur.
[Starts to sneeze]
Look!
"Tick, look!"
He's turning into a monster!
Monster?
Where?
Can't see anything wrong with him.
"Um, Arthur?"
"[Sighs] If you two don't stop this roughhousing, somebody's gonna get hurt and end up crying."
I know how I can prove I'm the real Arthur.
I'll tell you something only you and I would know.
"Go ahead, Arthur-like person."
"Oh, uh..."
OK.
"Remember that time my sister gave me that V-neck sweater vest for my birthday and we tried to return it to the store and they'd only give me credit, and I was so upset, and then at lunch they put onions on my cheeseburger,"
after I expressly asked the waitress not to?
"Do you remember that day, Tick?"
Oh.
Indeed I do.
"Big, big jackpot on Monday."
Garfunkel?
"Yeah, I'm probably the biggest Garfunkel who ever lived."
"I mean, after all I've done for her."
"You know, I give her money almost every week."
But doesn't she work for you?
"That's not the point, exactly."
"Adrian, Natalie is a human being."
"Now, all this attention can throw a person off balance."
Especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly.
"You know, I once wrote a book on body language and it spent all of three minutes on the best-seller list."
"Now, I was very young and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva."
I didn't like myself very much.
"So, now, you're on her side."
"The question is, why aren't you on her side?"
Why aren't you happy for her?
Natalie is your friend.
Maybe you're afraid she doesn't need you anymore.
Maybe you're afraid of losing her.
Or maybe I just feel insulted.
Insulted?
What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I am putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
91.
Number 91.
91.
Number 91.
91.
"No, Rihanna is out."
We cannot go to...
"We cannot be seen at a Rihanna concert, guys."
"No, I've got the perfect thermos."
We gotta hunt!
We have to go and kill something!
Hopefully not an innocent something.
I don't like killing innocent animals.
We'll pick on the animals that obviously deserve it.
First thing's first.
Let's go buy some guns.
What do you mean that there's a ten-day waiting period?
That doesn't seem real.
We have the right to bear guns.
I know that's a fact.
That's one of the commandments.
"Dude, it's the law."
"If a man disrespects you in a bar and pours a beer on your head, you have the right to shoot that man."
Shut up.
"God, gimme a gun!"
"Just gimme a gun, man!"
All right.
All right.
"So, we can't have guns."
"We just need weapons that can kill things, and money is no object."
"I've got a credit card, so let's make it happen."
- Do you have one of these?
- Mm-hmm.
It's pretty inten...
You should get one.
29.99 APR.
Not bad.
"So, Aaron, what kind of career do you think I should go into?"
"I got into math and computers because there was this deep, dark..."
I don't know...
hole inside me and math filled it.
"You need to figure out where your hole is, and try different things until you discover what fills it."
"Wow, I was not expecting to say this, but this really might be your fault."
I got to find her.
I got to find Mary Webber.
I got to talk some sense into her.
- I started this.
I got to end this.
- Whoa.
Wait.
No.
"What about my ""pornado""?"
Yeah.
"Whatever, Neil."
"Yeah, everyone knows you're eating Marci's pudding snacks."
"Yeah, that's right."
"Yeah, I've seen you."
Son.
"Friends with Benefits The Benefit of Mentors August 26, 2011"
Where should we go for lunch?
Let's do vegan.
"I just bought a leather jacket, and I wanna balance it out."
Who are you talking to?
Some loser I can't get rid of.
He won't stop texting me.
So you're texting him back?
"Well, I can't just ignore him."
That would be totally rude.
"Plus, you never know."
"Not an E. Oh, just..."
OK.
"I think this is probably wrong here, but..."
Den...
Beds...
Time's up.
You were so close.
You found five answers.
Let's take a look on them.
"Kilmarnock, south-west of Glasgow."
"Dumfries, in southern Scotland."
"Cumbernauld, you'll know that from your tax return, I imagine."
"Airdrie, North Lanarkshire."
"Ayr - you were trying to work out what that rogue Y was, and it was Ayr, south-west of Glasgow."
So you got five answers there.
They're all places in Scotland.
They are all part of the perfect solution.
"You nearly put Aberdeen in there, that would have scuppered you."
But let's see what you could have got to get the full ten points.
Elgin.
"Now, what were you calling Elgin there?"
Igle.
Igle!
What's that Igle?
Elgin.
And Bearsden.
"Bearsden, a suburb of Glasgow."
That's what you needed to get the perfect solution.
"Nonetheless, you got five points - not half bad."
"At the end of the round, Araucarians, you're on 12,"
Lutrophiles you're leaping ahead - like the otters that you are - on 21.
We're at the final round for a place in the semifinal.
"Again, Mark, that picture makes me really uncomfortable."
"Good, go with that."
Why does it make you uncomfortable?
"Because I've never seen it before, and I don't know where you got it."
I'm sensing anger.
Let's give it a place to go.
Rip out a few sets on the muscle-maker.
No.
Break something.
Just don't break anything that's...
You know what?
Just break my nose.
"Look, Mark,"
"I can't give you what you're looking for, because the things that I'm feeling I can't put into words."
And that's the problem with people.
"We want to use words, and words are dumb."
You know how the grizzly bear processes loss?
"Yeah, I think they go to sleep for like six months, and nobody bothers them."
"The grizzly bear climbs to the top of the nearest hill, and it roars, Neal."
"Neal, this is your hill."
"Yeah, I am not going to..."
Yah!
"Oh, that feels so good."
Hoo-ah!
"My friend, you have lost your she-bear."
And I am not going to stop until I hear you roar.
Naa-ah!
Ah.
Ah.
Ow.
"Ah, oh, no."
"Uck, oh, no."
But...
"I see other freelancers, they don't work this hard."
For normal freelance people that is true.
But I feel I can do more.
So why do I... have to be like other normal people?
I think your rash not going away has nothing to do with your job.
Make sure you take the bedtime pill.
I did.
"If you did, you'd be complaining about being sleepy."
Shit!
What do you think?
See!
It's okay.
It's as good as if you did it.
"Actually, Jerd is like you 5-6 years ago."
"People are saying he is Yoon 2, you know?"
So why did you ask me to come?
Wasting my time.
Adidas Japan.
I'll do it!
"Shit doc, I'm sorry."
That was automatic.
Good.
You get to work on an international brand finally.
I know you've been dying for this.
You know how hard it was to land this?
I need your best this time.
What's up with you?
Are you possessed?
"No, I was just thinking if I had anything else to do?"
"If you do, make sure to clear your schedule."
Make sure this is your first priority.
"Hi, Norman."
"Oh, hi, Allison."
What's the matter?
Same old thing.
Grownups who act like children.
"Hey, could I walk home with you?"
No.
You'd get home late.
"You mean, your mother wouldn't like it."
- Well... .
"- Come on, Norman."
Come on.
Spend the afternoon in the library again?
Yeah.
Isn't it awfully dull going there every day?
Yeah.
Then why do you do it?
I like books.
Good place to do my homework.
"Besides, where else could I go but home?"
Go down to the water.
Sit in the square.
Take a walk in the woods.
I can't.
"You know, that was a nice speech you wrote for Mrs. Thornton."
I'm sorry I did it now.
Why didn't you read it yourself instead of Rodney Harrington?
Because I was afraid I'd cry.
Still might cry every time I think of Ms. Thornton not getting that job.
"You know, you just might turn out to be a great writer."
"Norman, I hope so."
"You know, every time I touch a book or read a story or even when I just open the dictionary something inside of me goes thump and my heart starts pounding, and my stomach."
Don't worry.
I'm fine now.
Going through all that without a father made me realize
That I don't need one.
I understand that I've lost the right
"To be a father to you, but..."
If there's any way that we can get to know each other...
On your terms...
"Serena may want a relationship with you,"
But I don't.
"Serena, stop it!"
You can't do that.
"The room was on loan, and I'm taking it back."
And I don't care if I did leave it in the closet.
"Borrowing without asking is stealing, Jenny."
"Dad, tell her to stop!"
"Uh, Serena, please."
I think it's great
"That you're moving back in, but this is Jenny's room now."
All her things are here.
You can stay in Chuck's old room.
No way.
That room is haunted by Chuck's depravity.
Jenny can take it.
I'm sure it wouldn't bother you.
"Okay, what-what's going on with you two?"
Nothing.
Fine.
Whatever.
Serena can have her old room back.
"All right, that's ridiculous."
"Serena, I'll have Laryssa make up Chuck's bed for you."
"I knew Paulie was still pissed at me, and he's such a hothead."
And I was worried about Jimmy.
"See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was into drug deals with me"
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me.
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
"Now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope the cops never found, then disappear until I can get things straightened out."
Karen!
Fuck!
"- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?"
- I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.
That was worth $60.000!
I need that money!
That's all we got!
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?
I had to.
They were going to find it!
- They would have never found it!
"- They would have, I swear to you!"
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
- They would have found it.
"- Why did you do that, Karen?"
"Oh, my God!"
- I had to do it.
I will find Phillip's killer.
She won't.
She's been two steps behind me this whole time.
Behind you?
I got to Austin first.
And I got to the knife.
"And although it wasn't the actual murder weapon, thank you to my contacts at the NYPD,"
I have the address to the prop master's cousin in San Pedro who kept two of the last prop knives for himself as souvenirs.
You see?
I am close.
Okay.
And may the best detective win.
Don't worry.
I will.
You realize she picked your pocket.
"Oh, yes."
Whose address is on that piece of paper?
It's a casting director my mother wanted to have a meeting with.
Hmm.
Kendall is going to be mad when she finds out.
Like I'm scared of her.
She is a master of Krav Maga.
And she is deadly with a sniper rifle from a mile and a half.
Good luck.
I could not sleep last night.
I kept having nightmares that I was sleeping with Bozo the Clown.
Please tell me you found out more.
"Okay, relax."
I spoke with Tyler's ex.
He does not have a clown fetish.
[Sighs]
[Exhales] But...
Glad to see you've started to eat again.
You've been gone a long time.
I had business to do.
Did it have anything to do with me?
Maybe.
I have a right to know.
Have you sent the ransom note to my husband?
"My dear lady, the less you know, the better it's gonna be for both of us."
Especially for you.
Don't leave.
Please.
You mean that.
Do you?
I just wanted you to know that I read the books that you brought me.
Ah.
What did you think of them?
I liked them.
What I could read of them.
It's so dark in here.
It isn't easy to read.
No problem.
I'll bring you another lamp.
Anything else you want?
Do you think I could have a television set?
Smart.
"You think you're pretty damned smart, don't you?"
What do you mean?
You think your kidnapping will be on TV and you can find out what's going on.
I'm not thinking that.
"Well, it won't do you any good."
It won't help you get out of here.
I've thought of everything.
Any responsibility I might have is to my clients.
- So there is something?
- You trying to trick me?
I can't have this conversation.
- lf there's a conversation to be had...
- Ready!
"All right, see ya, Mom."
Mm-hmm.
See ya.
"All right, Dad, let's go."
"[Jessie] lf l get something long, I couldn't dance."
"[Lily] I love this, you don't need a longer one."
- What about yours?
- l'll find it a week after the wedding.
I'm just going to go on the record right now to say I really don't like salmon.
Would you look at how beautiful your daughter is?
- Don't I know it.
- Dad hates all fish.
- That is untrue.
- [Eli] Just have pizza.
- We can have pizza for the kids.
- Are we getting paid?
- Can we pay you not to play?
- [knock on door]
"Since Eli's friends are playing, would you like to invite your friends?"
"- No, thank you."
- Somebody want to get the door?
I didn't know planning a wedding would be such a big deal.
- You'll find out soon.
- l'm not getting married till I'm 40.
- You mean when you're old?
- Sorry.
"Hey, where is he?"
He took my car.
- Kono.
- I'm on it.
"Shoulder wound, through and through."
- Dana?
- The surgeons are working on her.
"Listen to me, did Dawkins say where he was going after the bank?"
"I saw a passport and now that he has his money, he's gonna disappear."
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoo!
Damn it.
"Dawkins was on his way to the airport, saw our check point and made a U-turn."
"He's in the H-3 tunnel, headed into Halawa Valley."
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh, what?"
We're about to lose traffic cam coverage in about two seconds.
He's gone.
"I'm sorry, there's no other cameras on that road."
All right.
Wait a second.
"Why, hello there, sailor."
"Cath, I need your help."
"I'm pursuing a suspect in a black Mercedes, he's headed west to the Halawa Valley."
- Can you give me a visual?
- You want me to access an IKON reconnaissance satellite for your car chase?
This guy has killed three people already today.
"Yeah, look."
This could raise some flags.
"Classify it as an NSA request from a black ops drop box, okay?"
"Come on, Cath."
I need this.
- You don't know that?
"- Oh, my God."
- I don't think so.
- You tell the story.
"It was just someone driving by and went, ""Denzel."""
"A car full, of..."
"No, there were like six people."
"They were like, ""Denzel."""
And they were drunk.
This was probably a Friday.
I remember a lot of people getting out of bars this night.
"Friday night, 7th Street, Avenue A."
"- Yeah, at like 1 a.m."
- We're in the middle of the action.
- Did you happen to think...?
- Hello.
Not a real punch.
"Oh, I was so terrified I would hit you by accident."
"There was a take where you were supposed to, but you didn't."
Pete asked me to slap you and I couldn't do it.
- I started to cry a little bit.
- I saw you two having that discussion.
I was like:
"""She's gonna hit me."
"I'm ready for it."""
It's gonna be cool.
It'll be a good reaction.
That was the only time I started to cry a little because I felt like...
- You actually started crying?
- I was hiding it.
- At the thought of hitting me?
- Just the thought of hitting Michael without him knowing.
!
"No, Yoon Jae's home to get some clothes."
"Honey, Son-in-law seems different, doesn't he?"
"He doesn't seem to mind his manners, and he doesn't think too well of us."
He treats Da Ran with no care.
Right?
"You felt that too, right?"
Yes!
"Even so, I like him even more!"
I think he's comfortable with our family now!
"Now, he seems to be our son-in-law so I'm really happy!"
"Well, if it's because he's comfortable, it's a good thing."
Got it.
Come in faster.
Yoon Jae lives alone too?
His parents live overseas.
Don't just touch his stuff!
We have to hurry up and pack some clothes.
Oh!
I told you not to touch anything!
Come here.
This is where the clothes are.
Pick out some outfits to wear.
"Ah, you surprised me!"
What should I do when you take off your clothes like that?
"It's something you see all the time, so why are you so surprised?"
Change your clothes quickly.
It's something you always see.
Why are you just sneeking a peek?
Just look at it.
I've never seen it.
Why's she acting like that?
"Yeah, really."
"You've been dropping a lot of cash lately, McGee."
"New phone, new watch, new teeth."
What's up?
GIBBS:
Ducky matched the dental records.
The body downstairs is Lance Corporal Finn.
"Ziva, when did you...?"
McGee  how long does it take to put on a clean shirt?
Ten seconds.
"With buttons, a little longer."
Rhetorical question.
Contractor's off the hook.
He's been out of town for a week.
Going to check on the real estate agents this morning.
That's all you did?
No.
"While you and McGee were watching the sunrise,"
I was pulling Lance Corporal Finn's SRB.
And I would have to say it was spotty.
He was Unc' on the range and failed his swim qual.
So they made him a supply clerk.
Right.
"Six months ago, he signed out on a three-day pass before deploying to Iraq and never returned home."
- Get me his C.O.
- He's in Iraq.
I'll contact MTAC.
"I put in a request for Finn's bank records, earning statements and medical records."
TONY:
Night wasn't a total loss.
ground radar picked up a shovel about ten feet from the gravesite.
Already sent it to Abby.
- and to the left?
- Uh-huh.
- Go see if Dad's found his bathing suit yet.
- Gimme a hug.
Yeah.
"Thanks, champ."
"- They are paid to teach, not..."
- To preach.
"I know, but he's six years old, and he also believes in the tooth fairy..."
- and that George Washington never told a lie.
"- Well, it drives me crazy."
"- Mary, wanna turn the ball machine off?"
"- Yes, Mr. Governor."
"Thanks for seeing me, Dad."
- Why wouldn't I see you?
- Partisanship.
I gotta love at least one Democrat.
"You know, Dad, I'm getting some reports that you might not be ready to back me."
That you're opposed to my confirmation...
- You've heard quotes?
"- No, I haven't heard."
Just that we should expect to be reading of your opposition.
"Pardon my Swahili, but you're being led a line of pure bullshit."
- I haven't said a word.
- Maybe it's just that.
Maybe you've been quiet.
- I hate the press.
"- I know, Dad."
"- When I left the mansion, I swore I would never talk to them."
- I remember.
"- I suppose you're gonna force my hand on this, huh?"
- You wouldn't have to say much.
He's making his way north.
He'll surface.
Aubrey.
"Hey, so I was able to filter out most of the visual noise from the doorbell video."
Did you find the vehicle that was following Aldo?
"Yeah, I'll send you a link."
It's a '97 Intrepid.
Did you get a plate number?
"I couldn't from this angle, so I went through all the traffic cams in the area."
The car belongs to Ted McKinney.
He's former military.
He actually served in Booth's unit.
Booth's not gonna like this.
"Me either, Cher."
That is not something I wanted to see.
"If you think I killed Aldo, you're nuts."
I don't know what to think.
Why were you following him?
That's my business.
"Well, you're in here, so it becomes my business now."
You really think Booth's the guy for this?
They have a history.
I can't think of anyone better.
BOOTH:
Recognize that car?
It might be mine.
It might be yours.
"Oh, I think it's yours, 'cause that is you inside of the car."
Following Aldo.
That's not true.
"""That's not true?"""
Come on.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
We can come and visit as much as we want to.
But I want to stay here.
Everything is so good here now.
I don't want to live there.
You don't like people there.
You said so yourself.
"Yes, but you..."
But then we won't see each other.
You can come and visit.
- You want to go out and play?
- Yes.
Then go.

He still won't tell me who he did it with.
I'm just gonna miss... seeing you.
Mostly what I feel is just afraid--
Afraid that I'm gonna hurt it or be the wrong sort of mother.
You are gonna be a great mother.
You're my best friend.
"You always have been, and you know the rules--"
"Never let a girl come between us, right?"
I know about you and Marjorie.
You think I wanted to fall in love with her?
You think I wanted to kiss her?
It just happened.
You guys shouldn't get married.
You can't marry Adam because I want you to marry me.
"Well, I don't have it."
- Is there anything else?
- Yeah.
Why did you bring them back here in the first place?
I was hungry.
My last meal left me just a little unsatisfied and they were yummy.
You might think about curbing that appetite.
"Hey, hairy palms, what's it to you?"
You jealous much?
I have to find Olivia before she hurts someone else.
"In the meantime, keep the door locked and your eyes open."
- Where are you gonna look for her?
- Furies always have sisters.
"Big, strong Dyson."
Is it true you're a cop now?
How tame.
I know Olivia's sick.
Tell me where she is so I can help her.
Someone tried to kill our sister.
No one we don't trust gets near her.
"Ladies, we're here under the auspices of The Ash, okay?"
Wanna mess with that?
"- Well, we can't get her out."
- That's why you bring a Siren.
I promise.
We'll do what we can for her.
It cuts the stems and pulls off all the pretty petals.
Someone's breaking in!
Not asleep.
Not me.
I'm fine.
- I gotta go check on our house guest.
"Almighty Lord, word of God the Father, Jesus Christ God and Lord of all creation who gave to your holy apostles the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions."
Grant me your unworthy servant...
-...pardon for all my sins...
-Bastards!
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
See the cross of the Lord.
"Be gone, you hostile power."
"-O Lord, hear my prayer."
-And let my cry come unto thee.
-The Lord be with you.
-And also with you.
Father.
"I cast you out, unclean spirit!"
"-Shove it up your ass, you faggot!"
"-In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!"
It is he who commands you!
He who flung you straight from heaven to the depths of hell!
-Fuck him!
-Be gone...
"Fuck him, Karras!"
-...from this creature of God.
Be gone!
"In the name of the Father, and of the Son and the Holy Spirit."
"By this sign of the Holy Cross, of our Lord Jesus Christ who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit."
Damien!
Amen.
"God, defender of the human race look down in pity...."
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!
-Shut up!
-She'll never forgive you!
- Shut up!
Of course I'm sure.
The mayor's wife left a letter.
"Wait, what about the film?"
You promise me you'll destroy it?
"Previously on ""Death Comes to Town"":"
That's a brooch?
And why do we need a camera again?
For my investigation.
"Marnie, I need to know who really killed the Mayor."
"But if Shuckton is going to continue to grow or even survive, we need to bring in some new money."
What's that?
You want a kiss?
"Well, if that's what you want."
"Oh yeah, Shuckton, I still got it."
I'm your soul taker!
I got it.
Two for two.
I got two souls.
I'm your man.
"Oh yeah, I still got- Ahhhh!"
Ohhh.
Shit.
"And now the sad, freaking news."
It appears that one of our own has become the story.
"Heather Weather was killed yesterday, which leaves us to wonder, who could have killed this aging bright light."
"What, you don't like the picture?"
I picked it out myself.
"Ma'am, can I talk to you for a minute?"
I've live on the air here.
We have some questions regarding your involvement in the case that you're reporting.
Levon!
"Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds."
- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!
First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.
"Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem to think I'm giving you the best of it."
"Don't do it, boss."
Let's go outta here.
A thousand dollars.
It's a bet!
It's a bet!
"I think you make one big mistake, mister."
"But, well, we go outside."
- Thornton's crazy!
"- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!"
- Ten-to-one he can't!
- It's a bet!
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!
"- Gee, boss, he can't do it."
He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.
You're not only doing this for money.
You're afraid of getting stuck here and losing that Blake woman.
"Oh, all right."
Your dog is to pull the sled a hundred yards from the standstill.
That's the bet.
A hundred yards.!
"Yeah, that's what I'm doin'."
"Uh, where's the powder room?"
He ain't got one of them.
My bathroom is right through there.
Thanks.
"Rick, I want you to check a... a light blue sedan for me."
License number 5567 A.
It's a... a government vehicle or a rental.
"And the driver, well, he's, uh, early 20s, blond..."
"Yeah, government type."
Yeah.
"Uh, thanks."
What are you doing?
The Iron Man contest.
"Oh, no, T.C."
No way.
I told you.
I am not entering that.
Don't start again.
Not even to save Island Hoppers?
"I mean, I figure what I need is better promotion, better advertising."
"What could be better than to have the company name... in front of the public in a big, fancy..."
"Oh, I see."
You're entering the race.
Did I hear somebody mention a race?
"Oh, yeah."
It's the Iron Man.
It's a big event with men and women if you're into competitive suicide.
"See, first you swim five miles in rough water."
Then you run a complete 26 mile marathon.
"Then, finally, the people who are still alive, they bicycle a hundred miles."
T.C. here is gonna enter.
"[J.D.] I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back,"
"I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things, even a woman eating my former bangs."
Voilà.
[Cheering]
"See, that's the thing about being an extra mile guy."
You never know who it's gonna rub off on.
"""Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you."""
"[High pitched Southern accent] ""Oh, have you, Stanley?"
"I wasn't expecting any."""
"- ""I hope you like it."""
- Aw...
"- You're hating this, aren't you?"
"- No, that's not it at all."
I don't believe for a second that you really want me to leave.
"You gotta feel it, Lyle."
Get involved.
What do you people say?
Let's take it from the top?
"""Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you."""
Again.
Do it with some force.
"Okay, honey, finish up."
We've gotta get to school.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
Does this map look like Portugal?
I have no idea.
But nobody knows what Portugal looks like.
"I mean, even the Portuguese think they live in Spain."
Sorry I'm late.
This is all I could find.
Ok?
"Winter break and then the month of July, and this is the first time she's even ever been around the house."
I don't think she's actually a mom.
She told you about my mom taking pills?
Did she?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You know everything about your mom?
The bulls and clippers are on tonight.
The point spread is perfect for a killing.
You want to put 50 on it?
You want to tell me why you stole my palm pilot?
What are you talking about?
From the office earlier today.
I want it back.
"You know what, screw you!"
"You know, my father's a little embarrassed to tell your mother, but..."
Heh heh...
I'm not.
I didn't take anything.
"All right, man?"
[Engine starts]
I want to set something straight.
Burton:
Ok.
I never told Anne about your flirting with me.
My mother saw us in the pool one afternoon that summer.
"I don't know where Anne was, but..."
"We were wrestling around in the pool, and my mother saw, and she jumped to a conclusion and told my sister."
Ok.
But it was the truth.
"Liz, you were a kid."
Go.
Make a big panic.
Let's Go.

You've got a super tale to tell.
sugee koto ga matte'run da ze
Dragon Ball Super is brought to you by Bandai and these sponsors.
"At long last, the God of Destruction Beerus has set to work."
"The Kaio take notice, and fear that a new battle may begin..."
"Elsewhere, a large crowd of friends have gathered aboard the cruise ship where Bulma's birthday party is being held, however..."
Vegeta's not coming because he's training?
.
And Son-kun too?
.
"At the same time, the God of Destruction Beerus set off towards the north Kaio's planet, where Goku was, to find the Super Saiyan God..."
I will find him...
"This ""Super Saiyan God"" guy."
Aim for the Dragon Balls.
Aim for the Dragon Balls.
That's great.
This-- this is nothing.
I hope not.
This is unexpected.
"Yes, well, uh, turns out that Bill is gonna have to work late again."
Oh?
"Uh, so, we won't be able to use these ballet tickets, which is why I'm giving them to you and Stephanie."
"Well, that's, uh-- that's very thoughtful of you."
"Well, I can see the two of you are really hitting it off, and since I feel I had some hand in this,"
"- and, uh--"
- Wait.
You were watching us?
"No, I--"
"I was just getting the mail, Paul."
I can't help it if Stephanie's laugh travels like a hyena's.
Your friend Stephanie.
"All I'm saying is, uh, please take the tickets."
I will.
"And, uh, I better call Stephanie right away, see if she's available."
So... cross your fingers for us.
Fingers crossed.
Enjoy the evening.
We will.
Oh.
You're home.
As usual.
"I supposed you want dinner, as well."
"I, uh, haven't even given it a thought."
Where-- where have you been?
I was just next door offering Paul our ballet tickets.
"Uh, well, it turns out he's dating someone."
Stephanie.
"I mean, aren't you happy that you decided to wait?"
"Not to wait, but to wait to do it again?"
'Cause you're worth waiting for.
"And if Jack's not ready, then he's not ready."
Let him do whatever he wants to do.
You just have to stay committed to yourself and your beliefs and who you are.
Wow.
I wish we had been closer the last few years.
"Well, it would have been awkward, considering my mother and your mother were not so friendly."
Yeah.
Think they'll ever be friends?
Yeah.
I do.
My mother is clearly not interested in being with my father anymore.
How's that going?
"For you, I mean?"
Is it weird?
"Uh, yeah."
(CHUCKLES)
"Yeah, it is."
"But you know, she should be who she is, too, and I just have to get used to that."
Do you think your dad and my mom will ever get married?
Think we'll ever be sisters?
I wouldn't mind.
I always kind of wanted a sister.
I always wanted a nice sister.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Let me get that.
"Ugh, she better not have come back."
(SIGHS)
RICKY:
Who is it?
It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar from Boston?
"Yes, it sure would."
Do we know each other?
"Oh, he's from Boston too, but you wouldn't know him."
- Not unless you had your house robbed.
-Maybe he would.
"We were gonna be officers together, remember?"
Only they washed me out.
Glad to see you made it.
It couldn't be that all that dough had something to do with it.
His mother's got $20 million.
"Heh, 25."
They've got a home in Nantucket with an upstairs polo field.
- Better put a canopy over his bunk.
"-Lay off, Sefton."
"With all your mother's pull, how come you're not a colonel by now?"
"Lay off, unless you want your head handed to you."
Tea is being served on the verandah.
"Animal, where are the napkins?"
"Do be seated, Bonita, heh."
What a perfectly charming table arrangement.
"They must have copied it from House Beautiful, heh."
Animal!
"How many times have I told you, you always gotta pour from the left?"
"Thank you, James, heh."
Don't encourage them.
Those are the barracks' clowns.
Where'd they get you?
Over Frankfurt?
On the Schweinfurt run.
- Flack or fighters?
-Fighters.
A little more exotic than I'm used to.
"Yes, I wouldn't imagine prison food isn't very tasteful."
"No, but they sure gave me plenty of it."
One year is a long time to be locked up in solitary.
You seem to be in very good shape.
"Gee, thanks."
Isometrics.
And you're not very pale.
I'm a quarter apache.
"Oh, a true American."
"So, why exactly did you go to prison, Mr. Davis?"
"So, why exactly did you go to prison, Mr. Davis?"
"Now, I don't know how it works in Japan, but in this country it is considered rude to grill your dinner guests."
"Japanese thanks, sh..."
Do not be so familiar.
What?
Shu-short for shuji.
"That is your name, isn't it?"
You will call him Mr. swanato.
Japanese let's go.
Nick saved my life.
He has proven much to me already.
So you may call me sh...
"It's a good name, huh?"
!
Toast.
To our friends and our enemies.
May they both feel the warmth of our embrace.
May they both feel the warmth of our embrace.

That's Tommy's.
This is crazy.
"You haven't spoken to me for over a week, since... ."
"Allison, I understand how you feel."
You'll just have to accept what's happened and make the best of it.
Mother.
"As soon as I can, I'm going to get dressed pack my things and leave Peyton Place."
I never want to see this town or you again.
- You can't mean that.
- I mean it.
I'm going to New York.
"Please, Allison."
I was only trying to protect you.
I was an accident you hated and tried to hide.
But I loved you from the moment you were born.
Try to believe me.
"Well, how will you live?"
What'll you do for money?
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.
Suppose you can't find a job?
"Then I'll live off some man, the way you did."
God.
"God, help me."
Allison.
Allison.
Didn't want you to come here.
I couldn't say goodbye to you in person.
- You know I don't want you to go.
- But I'm going.
You stay here.
"You belong here, both of us, together."
- We've been friends since we were kids.
"- Goodbye, Selena."
-Fuck your mother.
"His car was stolen by some Puerto Ricans.They took his cell phone, too."
I don't know what to do.
I already packed a suitcase for my aunt's in Daytona.
Take it easy.
Don't do something you'll regret.
Three weeks before their wedding.
Maybe he needs to be in rehab.
"You can hire someone to do an intervention, apparently."
"Girls, come on."
We're a family here.
Now I gotta spell it out for you?
Take it easy.
Let me figure out how to handle this.
"Please, don't hurt him."
...fight plan will win out.
At this stage the fight is getting closer because....
Why am I always having to come here?
"-How are you doing, man?"
-Did we come at a bad time?
The decorating ideas.
You want to come in?
I'm sorry for the mess.
"Please, this is nothing."
"So, there is a page from Metropolitan Home."
"Now, wait till you see how a mirrored backsplash can amplify a room."
You want something?
Something to drink?
We gotta go.
If you've got a cup of coffee.
"-He loved that little man, by the way."
-Gobbetto.
I need new hair.
"Hi, Mom."
This is Rebecca.
"It's kind of a new relationship, so don't say anything too embarrassing, OK?"
"Oh, hi, Rebecca."
He wet his bed till he was 12.
Oops.
Wanna sit?
"Hey Weasel, you wanna move your stuff off the table?"
We gotta cram for the math test tomorrow.
"My name's not Weasel, it's Morgan."
I thought you liked it when I called you Weasel.
I've never liked it.
"You like it so much, it's your name now..."
Weasel.
- What an assertive little sister you have.
"- Oh, it's the uniform."
"When she takes it off, she has a vulnerable side, I'm almost certain."
"OK, Morgan, soccer practice."
Remember what we learned last week?
Don't kick the coach.
"Hey, before we get started, why don't we take a break?"
Can I get you something to drink?
I got full access to all the major appliances in the kitchen.
Aren't you gonna show me your house first?
The house?
You wanna see the house?
Sure.
"Uh, this is the house."
Are there any other rooms?
"Uh, yeah, there's probably one right through here."
Do you wanna...?
Haven't you been taking care of her?
I don't have too much money.
What about all the money that I gave you to hold for me?
I bought all these things.
I haven't been able to sell many of them.
It may interest you to know that some time ago
I heard that mother was starving in a little town called Podesin.
I couldn't get money even for myself.
Where's Zina?
Have you been taking care of her like I asked?
Yes.
"Well, at least I can thank you for that."
You're going to have to sell some of this stuff.
I need the money.
I'm going to marry Zina.
Where is she?
Zina!
They said you were killed in a German camp.
Did Gerry tell you that too?
Yes.
Gerry told me you were dead.
Well...
I'm glad I'm here to dispute that.
I married Gerry.
I'm his wife.
You didn't even have to tell me.
Mother always said that you were the one with brains.
I was the dreamer.
I was the dreamer they took to the Nazi prison.
"I loved you, Zina."
That was the dream.
And what became of it?
And he's very blunt with Da Ran too...
Right?
"-You felt that too, right?"
-Yes!
That's why I was so happy!
He must finally feel comfortable with our family!
"Now it really feels like, he's become our son-in-law, so I'm so very happy!"
Well...
If it's because he's become comfortable....
It's a relief then.
It worked.
"Hurry, hurry."
Hurry up and come in.
Does our Yoon Jae live by himself too?
His parents are overseas.
Don't carelessly touch random stuff!
Let's quickly pack up what we need.
I told you not to touch things!
Come here.
The clothes are in here.
Pack up a few things to wear from here.
Oh my goodness!
You scared me!
How can you...be undressed like that!
Why are you surprised when it's something that you probably see all the time?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Why steal glances when you see it all the time?
"Here, just look."
I haven't seen it!
What's wrong with you?
"When I was completely naked in the hospital, you ran over and hugged me."
"'Yoon Jae, I thought you were dead!"
What?
You said you saw twenty Ree.
Yeah?
What you talking about?
You woke me up.
Mmm-hmm.
You said you saw twenty Ree by the creek.
"Well, yeah, twenty, a dozen, it don't matter."
I wasn't gonna hang around counting fucking feathers.
As a matter of fact what was you doing down by the creek all by yourself?
I'd already brought up plenty of water.
Hey!
"Answer me, Fitzgerald."
I asked you a question.
Don't question me on account of you feel guilty.
Answer me or I'll blow your head off.
"You got a short-term memory, boy."
Your ass would be floating around the Missouri right now if it wasn't for me.
You want to ask questions?
What you want to ask?
"If you want to know, ask it."
Hmm?
You want to know why you left
"Mr. Glass back there for dead, huh?"
Or why you left your little boyfriend running around?
You want to know if he's still alive?
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause you ain't a man yet.
It's 'cause you was scared shitless.
You're scared now.
The Ree.
What of them?
You get used to me.
You funny.
- You...
- In here.
What's the status of your crew-served weapons?
"We have two 81 s, four 60s twelve .30 calibers, three on each wall."
One 4-deuce.
"Besides crew-served, we have six M-79's."
No .50 calibers?
I'd give an R and R in Bangkok for the smell of a .50.
KIRBY:
"You hear that, sergeant?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Know where there are any .50's?
MULDOON:
"No, sir."
Neither do I. You better tell Sergeant Petersen.
I almost forgot.
Captain MacDaniel needs corrugated tin.
- It's been hard to come by lately.
- Sergeant.
"Yes, sir."
I know.
"""Tell Petersen."
"Tell the scrounger."""
Petersen!
What happens if Charlie hits this camp before you get it completed?
"If he does, and he's too strong for us to handle we have 3 LZs within 4 clicks to send 10 choppers each to reinforce us."
One is by that shale cliff you saw on your way in.
And the second is to the west of here near a deserted Montagnard village where some of these people used to live.
"The third is to the north, near an old bridge."
What if Charlie overruns the camp?
Have a spot?
Rather.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir."
"Too watery, sir."
"Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach."
- We'll be the judge of that.
"- Wait, sir."
There's a fly.
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.
"There it is, sir."
It just dove under the ice.
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.
I got him.
Hear him?
Humming like a beehive.
He's gone.
Ain't that a shame?
There he goes.
"Come along, Mitchell."
I think we'll forget the punch.
"Tommy, you know we have Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition."
That's right.
The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough...
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.
"I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service."
"One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment."
I've got a feeling they don't like me very much.
It's just as well.
"- The army's no place for sentiment, I says."
"- This way, Mrs Dashwood."
- My dear Colonel.
- I found your mother starting out herself.
She had determined to come on her own account.
- Mama!
"- Oh, my love!"
My love!
Thank God.
"Oh, thank the dear Lord who has given you back to me."
"Oh, I was so frightened."
"I had no news, you see."
I expected you home and you had not come.
Let me look at you.
"Oh, how thin you are."
"Well, I shall feed you up."
You will have all your favourite things.
"I am very thirsty, Mama."
We must let her rest.
She is still very weak.
"You go to sleep now, Marianne."
Mama is with you.
She will not go away.
"You need sleep too, my dear."
I can see that.
This is my place now.
"Colonel, I cannot find words to acknowledge what we owe to you, or to thank you adequately."
The glimpse I had of your sister is sufficient thanks... not that I need any.
"If ever a man deserved his heart's desire, it is you, Colonel."
"At last, we are alone."
"Oh, my dear Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness."
Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.
He told me so himself.
What's he waiting for?
I'll get it out of him.
Crates are loaded up.
I want a lead and a chase car.
Don't do the scenic route.
Let's get it behind ssr walls a.S.A.P.
"I'll wake up the eggheads,"
Start figuring out what the hell this stuff is.
"And, boys, drive carefully."
I don't want to be the one who sunk manhattan.
"I don't envy you, buddy."
My pal jack... he's got a special gift for interrogations.
"He's real convincing, gets guys to spill their guts."
That's not an expression.
We've had to use a mop.
I need a doc.
My arm's broke.
What's the point of fixing you up if we're just gonna break you again?
Was that dame working for you?
What dame?
The one on the boat...
"English broad, solid right hook."
English?
Yeah.
What's she look like?
"♪ let's jam that boogie, babe ♪"
"Ohh, damn it!"
What the...?
♪ why don't you come back ♪
♪ let's jam that boogie ♪
W-watch where you're going.
You're lucky this is a company car.
- I know I promised.
- Won't you come for my birthday?
"Pramod, I'm really sorry..."
- I have to go to class.
Bye.
"- No, wait."
"So, here you are."
Please excuse the formalities.
You only need to read the last three pages.
Did Helene invite you to my birthday?
- No.
- You can't rely on her.
- Then I better do it.
- Thanks.
There are a few things I don't understand.
Can we look at it?
What does that mean?
It means that you and Anna have 100% control of the fund.
"No, not that."
Here it is.
The part where it says I have to live in Denmark.
"Yes, we haven't talked about that yet."
To build an organization like that you have to live in Denmark.
- Can't I just come to board meetings?
"- No, it's a demand on my behalf."
Why should I do that?
Because I said it's a demand on my behalf.
You mean that?
I can't spend half a year here and half a year there?
Have I said anything I don't mean?
"Maybe everyone else kisses your ass, but I won't."
- What do you mean?
Thanks... for the bus.
Nicolas.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
I have to go.
We have to go back to Brussels.
"Come on in, Victoria."
Then she is the mayor of this beautiful village.
"Well, I have no other choice, so I'm the mayor."
It is a big responsibility because I love these people and I want them.
I want...
That they are happy.
It is difficult to understand what happiness is.
It is not conditional.
You can not say:
"""I will be happy if I have this, if..."""
"When you say 'if', it means you're not happy."
"That's why we're all happy here, hear 'yes'."
"I heard from somebody here in this beautiful country,"
She did the stuntman.
"Yes, I was the stuntman coordinator, but it's just one of my professions."
I'm black karate belt and I have the fourth level of Shotokan.
I have...
I'm a diving instructor.
I was the first Bulgarian to cross the Swim Channel.
Do you know where the Channel is?
Between England and France.
But  I...
I've never seen a mayor and bare feet.
"Occasionally, when I go to the capital,"
I put my sandals or shoes.
Gil's been down at the nursing home with your mother.
"Obviously, they're gonna call you, but I said...."
"You know, I felt I should be the one to...."
I suppose we can't say we haven't been expecting it.
For some time now she'd been gradually winding down.
-And at least it was peaceful.
"-Oh, no."
I just wish we could've been there.
"So, what were her last words?"
Do you remember?
Her last words were....
"Actually, yes, I do."
She said the two of you deserved each other.
Ah.
"Anyway, I'll just, you know."
I'm just really sorry.
"So, what sort of fruit does he like on his cereal?"
Bananas?
He's not keen.
I know what you mean.
"There's always those long stringy bits down the side, aren't there, you can't bring yourself to eat."
Why is that?
"Oh, no."
God.
-What's happening?
-It's those two guys from school.
Gary and Jamie.
Oh?
They look nice.
"Yeah, except watch how they completely ignore me because I'm about as interesting to them as a fly."
Bet they don't even say hello.
"-Hey, Julie, you all right?"
You told me I didn't have to go into the family business.
You said I should make my own choices.
"Ah, so you managed to do your own thing, huh?"
"Yeah, uh, for a while, yeah."
And I think I went to college because of you.
"But, you know, people grow up."
Yeah.
Responsibilities and--
"But still, um you took an interest in me when no one else did."
That matters.
So thank you.
"Well, you know, the only thing that really matters is, uh that you're happy."
"Are you happy, Sam?"
[ENGLISH SDH]
"When I told dad I was scared of the thing in my closet, he gave me a .45."
What was he supposed to do?
I was 9 years old.
The weapon training and melting the silver into bullets?
"Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
"Lock the doors and windows, close the shades."
And most important
Watch out for Sammy.
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
It's called being a good son.
"Dad's gonna be here, right?"
He'll be here.
Promise.
"- Where is he, anyway?"
- On business.
- And that's why you ran away.
- I was just going to college.
"Come, give me a hand."
Come on.
That's it...
Excuse me so much!
I'm just a little dizzy.
Maybe I haven't eaten sufficiently today.
- Thanks a lot...
"- Don't be in such a hurry, Miss."
First I'll make you a nice cup of coffee.
So that you'll feel better.
"Bruno, bring the girl to the apartment."
I'll come by soon.
"- Many thanks, I really am fine again..."
- He's my brother!
Allow me:
Mechelke.
"Now just come here, Miss..."
And then nothing more.
No news and no address.
"Just poste restante, the main post office, Berlin."
My letters are there now.
He didn't even pick them up.
What do you want to do now?
Turn to the refugee centre?
Should I give the refugee centre a sob story?
That he promised me...faithfully his mother's ring.
He promised to return for me but then let me down till I cleared off to the West.
Away with it!
And I don't even know his address.
I won't be kicked to the curb like that!
I've had enough of compassion and humilation at home.
But I'll find him soon and settle the score.
"Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max."
There's two things the Slop won't do.
Alert the proper authorities of my flight pattern or step foot in Texas.
I'll drop you here.
"When I agreed to follow you cross-country to chase your ex-boyfriend,"
"I didn't realize I'd be thrown out of a plane, scavenging for my belongings and fighting a snake for my favorite pants."
"You can have them, sir!"
Ah!
Found my toothbrush.
"Max, that's disgusting."
"Oh, you're right."
This isn't mine.
"Ah, found a purse..."
Under this syringe.
Anything in there?
"Uh... nah, pretty tapped out, which is too bad 'cause you could use a two-day heroin nap."
I meant my bag.
Look what else survived!
Ah-ha!
My Popchips!
Only to meet an unfortunate end.
"Oh, no, Max, my wallet."
"Mm, yeah, I know."
You've aged a lot since that license picture.
"No, it's gone."
All of our cash and our credit cards were in there.
What are we gonna do?
I'm freaking out.
"Nah, nah, nah, calm down."
Caroline will get us out of this.
"Oh, wait."
You're Caroline.
Fine.
Here.
Take it.
- Keep the bell.
- What?
"I thought we were gonna handle this like adults, Jess."
"Yeah, well, I thought you were the love of my life, so..."
"Suck it, Mr. Crabs."
- You hit that guy.
- Whatevs.
You know.
You know what?
Maybe I didn't have respect for you before because if this is what respecting you feels like this is definitely not how I felt.
So you recognize.
"Represent, what?"
"Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest."
I've been messing with you.
It's just that I wanted my old room back.
"You know, you're right."
I've been away a long time and things have changed here.
So I guess I kind of gotta get used to that.
You can keep the big room.
"See, now you're just deep dogging me, man."
I'm not scared of your mind games.
"I'm taking the small room, Winston."
"- Schmidt, that's not what I mean..."
- No.
Listen to what I mean.
You can double reverse dog me until the cows come home.
I'm not falling for it.
"What do you take me for, some kind of idiot?"
Yes.
Oh!
He just... he just kicked me!
"Annie, tell him off."
"Oh, that's Mitchell."
- I'd better warn him about this.
Can...
"- Yeah, yeah."
Just put the Hoover round and maybe just dust a little.
Thanks.
Mitchell?
Is that another ghost?
"It's bloody Hogwarts, this place."
"No, Mitchell is a vampire, actually."
Vamp...
"At last, someone normal."
I'd better go and...
Are you gonna do both beds?
- Do both beds.
Do...
- OK.
"Just in case, you know, in the night, me and you just want to... in the night, just sort of do that."
- You've got to be joking.
- It won't be for long.
"It's just until his dad recovers, and then he'll be out of here."
I will make sure of it.
"We just thought, with you having gone through it..."
Me going through it is exactly why I can't have him in the house.
The kid's still feeding.
Staying clean from meat is a day-by-day...
"No, no, a minute-by-minute thing."
"How am I gonna manage if he's giving it, ""Oh, let's go out on the razz,"
"""find some women, drink them dry""?"
Crap!
I thank the Lord that I've been blessed...
Let's thank the mums.
"Hello, mums."
"Here to keep an eye on Dad, are you?"
"Richie, it's not going very well, is it?"
...than my share of ha... ppiness
Ha ha ha.
"Thank you, one and all."
"Happy hunting and if you can't be good, be careful."
I've done that one.
Er...
"And if you're in a car, please drive safely."
"Thank you and good night, one and all."
I love you all.
"Well, tough crowd but I think I got the measure of 'em."
Ooh.
They probably couldn't afford flowers.
This will do for our dinner party.
"Richie, I've got some rather bad news for you."
- You're under arrest.
- That's the bad news.
I wasn't that bad.
I stumbled on a couple of punch lines.
It was our alibi-it collapsed.
"Mr Forsyth, he followed us here."
It's pris for us.
"- Are you coming quietly, sir?"
"- No, it's just the way I walk."
Note that down.
I want all to know I was still cracking woofers.
Woofers or ancient double entendre that everybody else gave up in the playground?
"♬  Oh, we were destined  ♬"
"♬  Oh, underdone  ♬"
"That girl, Eul, doesn't know her place."
How could she linger around you?
"Noona, from your perspective,"
I think I'm better than Eul.
Of course!
"Even though you're still unemployed, you can't give yourself to Eul."
Eul is in a lot of debt and doesn't even have a great personality.
She only mooches off of you.
So that's why I'm telling you this.
"Oppa, there is a woman I know who cooks well, has enough money, and doesn't fall too far behind in terms of looks."
"I... am not good enough, Noona."
"Because I am not good enough,"
I cannot accept Eul.
"Ah, Eul left her cellphone."
So clumsy...
That oppa is not normal either.
Eul!
No Eul!
What is this?
Yes.
This is No Eul's phone.
Hello?
Why are you picking up No Eul's phone?
"We were together, and Eul left her phone behind."
- Who is the person picking up the phone?
- What about you?
Who are you?
- I asked first.
"- When you ask for someone else's identity,"
I believe you should reveal your identity first.
"You know, actually, we have a lot in common."
Okay. I'll bite.
"Well, we both went through tough divorces."
-Sherri was married?
-You didn't know that?
-lt never came up.
-What did come up?
Never mind.
Scratch that.
Where should I take her to dinner?
Where did you go so I can take her somewhere else?
Last thing you want is for her to start comparing you to me.
Exactly.
Wait.
What do you mean?
You want your relationship to stand on its own.
-Right.
"-Well, that's what I meant."
Okay. I thought you were trying to rub my nose in the fact that you dated her.
"Alan, I would never do that."
"Well, thank you."
I don't have to.
You think you could kill a guy with a piece of toast?
No.
"Because if you did, you could eat the toast."
The police would never find the weapon. it's the perfect crime.
And part of a nutritious breakfast.
"Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later."
Where you going?
-Out for dinner.
-With who?
"Jake, look, I think-- l think you're old enough to know that your dad's not just a dad."
Maybe you got a point there.
- You bet I do.
I'll make it easy for you.
I'll be your personal secretary.
You just talk.
Tell me what you want to say.
[Clears Throat]
My dearest...
precious flower.
Ah.
Thank you for your note of October 16.
It's always good to hear from you.
- And how are things in Toledo?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
This-This is not an application for a car loan.
It's a love letter.
Let your heart do the talking.
"Laverne... this is gonna knock you off your pins, but I still love you."
Ah.
All right.
"When I give my heart away, it's for good."
- Good.
- I even loved you when you were married to me... and you cheated on me with Morty.
"After all, you're only human."
I was thousands of miles away... and there was Morty with his thriving sausage business to bring home the bacon.
"- Boy, that must have hurt."
- You bet your life it did.
"- I have feelings, you know."
- Don't tell me.
Tell Laverne.
"Laverne, I have feelings, you know."
I don't need you and Gus to use my heartstrings for a taffy pull.
Arsey.
"Anyway, how can I help you?"
"Can you tell us who you issued this to, please?"
I can try.
Here we are.
6733.
"He gave the name of, T Dan Smith."
T Dan Smith.
A-ha.
That's what it says here.
"So, T Dan Smith, until recently, leader of the council, has fallen on hard times?"
"Well, probably not."
"Some people aren't comfortable about using their real names, you know."
And not just the thieves.
There's a lot of shame in falling on hard times.
Sad.
"Yeah, I can see the tracks of your tears."
Aren't you supposed to take their identities?
I'll tell Mr Dawson.
"I can do a full audit of this place, sir."
"Maybe get it shut down, you know."
"Hey, and I thought we were getting along."
What was pawned?
Four weeks ago.
And all on the one ticket.
~ All this?
~ Aye.
He said he'd be back for all of it.
"Mind, they all say that, like, but I believed him."
And all this is definitely his?
No question in my mind.
"Well, if he's half-inched anything, I'll be back to see you."
- Just the children.
- All right.
"Meter's running, hop in."
I got it.
I've been waiting here forever.
"You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people."
We're exactly on time.
"Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up."
"I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months."
We have seats on the 50-yard line.
Deliver the children to this address.
You'll be paid after you arrive.
This is a big fare here.
"If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip."
"Now, everything's been arranged."
I'll see you Friday.
- OK.
"Goodbye, Uncle Bene."
- Goodbye.
"Have fun, you two."
Look at that dummy.
"Get off the road, you dummy."
These civilians don't know how to drive.
They ought to be kept off the streets.
The streets belong to us professional drivers.
"Taxis, buses, trucks."
That's all that should be allowed on the streets.
"You see, I happen to know a great deal about driving."
I have a perfect safety record.
"Come on, get out of the way, you bum."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Sickle."
I don't want vegetables.
I need meat.
Didn't you get paid today?
I quit my job yesterday.
"Oh, I need you to be home early on Thursday so I can pick up my check."
How come you quit?
"They were disrespecting me, Julius."
"My father always worked two jobs, which made my mother so comfortable, she'd quit her job over anything."
"Check, please?"
And I mean anying.
"Now, do I look like I have your check?"
All that hollering at people.
I don't need this.
My husband has two jobs.
I don't need to be here right now.
Hold my calls.
Who are you hollering at?
"""Hold my calls."""
Hold your own damn call!
I do not need this!
My man has two jobs!
"My mother seemed to always find work when she needed it, so my father didn't complain that much."
"That's okay, baby."
I guess all those other people are just crazy.
"That look means ""I know I'm wrong, but I'll be damned if I'll admit it."""
How about steak sauce?
We got steak sauce?
"Hey, killer."
Oh!
Oh...!
"I've heard what you've been saying, Meadowlark."
What?
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
"Hey God, i really don't know what you mean."
Seems like salvation comes only in my dreams.
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
"Hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Don't tear it away from me.
I need you to hold on to.
Don't tear it away from me.
I need someone to hold on to.
Don't tear it away from me.
I need you to hold on to.
Please don't tear it away from me.
I need someone to hold on to.
Don't tear it away from me.
I need someone to hold on to.
Don't tear it away from me.
I need someone to hold on to.
Don't tear it away from me.
I need you to hold on to.
Don't tear it.
"Please, don't tear it."
"Please, don't tear it."
"Don't take it, Don't !"
"Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide."
"I lost my ignorance, security and pride"
I'm all alone in this fucking world you must despise
"Hey God,"
[laughter]
That Carl is crazy.
The annual bridal sale...
- is now...
"- Max, hold my hand."
Open!
[all shouting]
"Ladies, ladies, one at a time."
Oh!
"Well, I may be limping down the aisle, but at least I won't be limping in something Swiffer might sell to dust off ceiling fans."
[woman screaming]
"Oh, my God, girl!"
here she comes!
Here she comes.
"My girl, Rhonda, had that dress first."
"Oh, your girl is gonna have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands."
"Hey, Max, Caroline!"
Try it on!
Follow me to the changing room.
"(Caroline) I'm never coming out in this dress, I'm scared."
"(Max) So on the count of one, two..."
Maybe it's not that bad.
(both) It's bad.
Okay.
"So you're telling me,"
"Versace got murdered, but no one's taken out whoever made these?"
I know.
I feel like Tweety Bird is gonna sue us for copyright infringement.
I feel like we should have giant toilet paper rolls under here.
"Well, maybe we'll like these better when we're out of this bright light."
"Max, we are the bright light."
"Ladies, you forgot the matching hats."
- Reinhold.
"Bye, Reinhold."
"You used to be my girlfriend, Cilly."
"Nah, not anymore."
"Maybe we'll get back together, Cilly."
"Well, you'll keep an eye on the fat one."
We can use him.
He already spent time in Tegel
I don't like our two new guys.
Weaklings.
We'll take that one.
Looks pretty solid.
Right.
He seems a little dumb too.
Does he want to do it?
None of your business.
"Karl, go follow him."
"Hey, stop pushing!"
"Wait, I'm just looking for someone."
Did you see someone with a furry brown coat?
I didn't see no-one.
Furry brown coat?
Where are you from?
Who sent you here?
"Well, since you didn't see such a guy this really shouldn't bother you."
Lot of people with furry brown coats show up here.
"See, he knows!"
But then one has to know who sent you.
That still doesn't mean that I have to tell you about my business here.
When you ask someone if they saw someone with a furry brown coat... then he has the right to ask you who sent you.
I don't need to tell you who I am nonetheless.
No no buddy.
"Now I'm torn, aren't I?"
"I mean, I don't want stolen goods on me hands, but if it's a chance of meeting you again, Sergeant..."
"Your T Dan, what's he look like?"
Ooh... 40ish.
Short dark hair.
A bit taller than you.
"Beautiful skin, soft blue eyes."
How much did you give him for this lot?
£42.10.
"It's a hard life, isn't it?"
~ There you are.
"~ Thanks, John."
There's no missing person's report matching the dead man's description.
The pathologist hasn't got anything yet and won't have until tomorrow.
And we've got no Gwendolen Howard on any of our files.
"Making progress, then(!"
)
"Don't shoot the messenger, Inspector Bacchus."
She never irritate you?
No.
"Our man's not a thief, John."
That pawnshop bloke could have sniffed out a thief out a mile away.
We watched him do it.
He's pawning the family silver.
"This is a man with a wife, who's got rings and necklaces."
"At least, she did have."
"So, where is she?"
What's she waiting for?
~ It's dead.
~ 'Right.
How do you know that?
'
"All right, bad news."
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
"Left, right, left, right, both, both, both."
That's so cool!
"I still can't let you go to Florida, though."
Terry feels like a whore.
"He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences."
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
"Great, Hitchcock's in."
Who else?
I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
"Shut up, Hitchcock."
"Obviously, we're all going."
"What's up, squadron?"
"I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies."
"Yeah, about that."
"Um, there were no tickets left."
"But I brought my minivan, so..."
Road trip!
I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
"Needles, needles, need... whoa!"
So many dogs!
I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
All right.
This is gonna hurt.
OK?
So now it's time for you to be honest about how you feel about Justin.
Let me put this in a way you'll understand.
You've been an emotional grower.
Now you need to be an emotional show-er.
I mean Justin's your best friend.
Have you ever even told him that?
"No, but in my defence I"
- have a really good reason not to.
- Why is that?
Because he wants me to so bad.
"I'm disappointed in you, Danny."
Good night...
Oh.
You want to get high and watch wrestling?
- To Candace and Justin.
Cheers.
- Thank you.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Did he say happiest day or last day?
"Babe, you can sulk about this whole Danny situation this whole time."
Now I know that you said you want to do whatever you want to make me happy.
"If you want to make me happy, you go out there and you get Danny"
"Yes, ma'am."
"- Guys, I'm here."
Where's Justin?
- You just missed him.
- He went out looking for you.
- Aw crap.
Let me go see if I can catch him
"Well, look like those guys will never..."
- I got the text.
Mine is not the only heart you harbor
And I love America
God!
Can she be cruel...
"Hi, Joce!"
What's wrong?
I just had the worst day!
I don't know how much more of this crap I can take.
"I've been there for hours, re-acessorizing the bulletin boards."
How is the hottie?
So completely taken.
"It's hopeless, Josie."
It's completely hopeless.
I'm beginning to think I'll never get on staff... and my summer money is running low.
Look on the bright side:
You are the star of public television.
They are running your office tour again... for the fifth time this week.
They must have it on a loop.
- Come here.
- I'm horrified!
Hey did you see that?
She was coming out of the fax room.
So?
She never sends her own faxes.
What's the big deal?
Maybe she had something to do in the fax room.
So what I'm thinking.
I'm loving this tone.
"Tone for a just, isn't it genious?"
It's good she does LOB ingenious...
I'll have her messenger over some for me.
Vuitton Gellys is planning a hostile takeover of Fava.
That's great.
Beautiful.
Some deal I made.
You'll live like a king.
You'll be a hero.
You'll live better here than most people outside.
Some deal!
Alive.
Pentangeli is alive.
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth.
"He engineered it, Michael."
When Frankie went to make a deal with the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.
He thought you double-crossed him.
"Our people with the detectives said he was half dead, scared and shouted that you'd turned on him."
"They already had him on possession, bookmaking, murder one and more."
The FBI has him airtight.
"He's on an army base, 24 hour guards."
We can't get to him.
You've opened yourself to five counts of perjury.
What about Fredo?
What does he know?
"He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him."
"Roth, he played this one beautifully."
I'm going to talk to Fredo.
"I haven't got a lot to say, Mike."
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark.
I didn't know all that much.
What about now?
Is there anything you can help me out with?
Anything you can tell me now?
"I just figured, you know, if you can't beat 'em I'm like a big shark."
Shark.
Yeah?
I stop swimming and die.
"Oi, come on!"
Hey!
C'mon!
# If I should fall from grace with God Where no doctor can relieve me
# If I'm buried beneath the sod But the angels won't receive me
"# Let me go, boys Let me go, boys"
# Let me go down in the mud Where the rivers all run dry
# This land was always ours Was the proud land of our fathers
# It belongs to us and them Not to any of the others
"# Let them go, boys Let them go, boys"
# Let them go down in the mud Where the rivers all run dry
I should've come up before.
"Paul, have you got the keys?"
"- You're not going yet, are you?"
- Yeah.
Better get some sleep.
We've both got a big day tomorrow.
Don't tell me you've forgotten our little arrangement.
I'll see you at six minutes past ten.
All right?
- Goodnight.
It was great.
- Thank you.
Sweet dreams.
"Tommy, wait."
- I can't do it.
- Course you can.
- A deal's a deal.
"Do you see him here, laying down the law?"
No.
"Tomorrow, I tell Travis I quit the band, then I'm gone."

Erica.
"Please, have a seat."
He won't listen.
"I mean, he's being irrational and unreasonable."
Why is he doing this?
"Well, those are all valid questions, but they're not for you and I to discuss, so..."
Why not?
Why?
Because.
"In here, we talk about you."
Right?
Your life...
"and your choices and, lo and behold, your list."
But I can't just ignore what's happening to him.
"Kai, he has no one."
"I feel responsible, and so should you."
"I mean, you let Dr. Fred send me to his future for a reason."
Yes.
I did.
"And, you know, it's a decision that I've since come to regret."
"Well, then why did you agree?"
"Because I thought that it would help you, that it might provide for you some useful, you know, perspective."
"But instead, you've gotten completely caught up in his life."
He hoped that I may help you fill it some how.
How are you going to do that?
I'm an interior decorator.
Oh yeah?
So why did sawamato pick you?
Oh yeah?
So why did sawamato pick you?
He said that was your choice.
That you had described exactly who you wanted.
So you work for him?
No.
Mr. sawamato is my god-father.
"So who is he, Vic?"
We don't know yet.
Don't know yet?
"That's very impressive, Vic."
"We're spread a little thin right now, dino."
"Yeah, right."
Shit.
What's this I hear about you and carmine settling down?
"We want to buy a house, you know."
"We want to buy a house, you know."
"A house, what like this house?"
"No, not like this."
What's wrong with this house?
"Oh come on, huh?"
I don't need anything big.
What the fuck does need have to do with it?
Do you think I need fourteen bedrooms?
Do you think I need eight rooms to take a shit in?
"Christ Vic, if all I had was what I needed,"
I would be living in a cardboard box with a fucking blow up doll.
How'd it go with Dr. Klein?
"- Oh, fine."
Fine.
Good.
Any change since your last physical?
No.
Everything's
- Everything's fine.
"Oh, great."
"You want a drink before dinner, honey?"
[Clicks Tongue] No.
"Well, there's some fruit, if you wanna munch."
"No, uh"
- No munching.
"Bob, is"
- Is there something you're not telling me?
"Well, I just have to go on a little diet."
I have to start counting the calories and... try to get rid of that.
"Oh, that?"
"Honey, that's just a little happy fat."
I think it's cute.
[Chuckles]
"Emily, fat isn't cute unless you're nine months old and you're playing with a Busy Box."
"Well, it shouldn't be hard to lose three or four pounds."
"- Uh, eight pounds."
- Eight?
"Well, I know you can do it, and I'll help you every step of the way, Bob."
I'll help you every inch of the way.
"Emily, uh, why are you making such a big thing about eight pounds?"
"Well, eight pounds are not easy to lose."
"Well, they are for me, once I set my mind to it."
"- Uh, w-what's that?"
Have you seen other things?
Other creatures?
There's more out there than even you and I know about.
I photograph and study what I can.
"So, Shannon, if you would do me the honour of being my guide, tonight, I will find the beast for you."
I'd be delighted.
"- Here, let me help."
- Thanks.
"So, you're with Kyle?"
Filming Kyle.
There's a difference.
- That the beast freak?
- We just call her Shannon.
Good.
It's always better if they look like they don't live under a bridge.
"- So, I'm Tom."
And you are?
- Busy.
Jo.
You are Jo.
"So, what are you, a film student?"
Yes.
I'll let you be in my documentary if you leave me alone for two minutes to set up.
"So, you're hunting the hunter, so to speak?"
"Right, I'll just let you get on."
"Excuse me, but if you're going to interview anyone about the beast, it has to be us."
We've known about it for years.
What are you looking for?
I don't know.
I can't stand still.
"OK, water's in bowls, wolf snacks are in place."
We're all set.
"- Oh, father, but..."
"Oh, there you are."
"Daughter, I want you to meet one of my oldest and dearest friends, mister, uh-uh.."
"Tyler, Douglas Tyler, I'm delighted Miss Thatcher."
How do you do?
"Ah, Mr. Tyler and I have a mutual affection, my dear."
- The theater.
- Oh.
"Ah, shouldn't we be going, father?"
There's no hurry.
I was just about to ask Mr. Tyler up for dinner.
But we have such an early dinner.
"Then we should get started, don't you think?"
"Why, by all means."
"Oh, look here now, Tyler, that's taking an unfair advantage."
- There you are.
- My guest you know.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Commodore, I paid without thinking."
"Well, it's a bad habit to get into."
Quarter's a bit down nothing elaborate you understand but cozy.
A little teaser to loosen us up a bit.
Thanks.
"Now, let me see just when did you say this money would be available?"
Hmm?
Money?
"Oh, the money."
Anytime.
"Tell me, um, did Miss Thatcher go out?"
"No, no, no, she's about somewhere."
"- Sit down, my boy."
- Thanks very much.
"Now, as I was saying, the production, Hooray For Love is taking on fine shape."
"Oh, Miss Pugh, your uncle's here to see you."
Forgive the deceit.
Your landlady didn't look the sort to approve a gentleman caller.
"To be perfectly frank, she's the first person I've met for weeks who didn't recognize me."
She doesn't hold with the pictures.
Ungodly.
Ah!
That's...
That's charming.
It's from Rose and Lily.
The real Rose and Lily.
They ran away to join the ATS.
"Rose thought if she could fix a propeller in a film, she could learn to mend an engine in real life."
Ah.
They're both mechanics now.
Um...
Baker's planning a new film.
Air-raid wardens.
Wants me in it.
He's pretty much left the part up to me.
"So, I was thinking, newly retired cat burglar, not quite reformed."
That's why he's so good at the rescues.
He knows the way in and out of any property.
"Thing is, in the hands of the wrong writer..."
"So, I was wondering if you would consider putting your time and talent..."
I don't do that anymore.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
You'll get-
- You'll get soap in your eyes.
Here.
Hmm.
- I want you to meet my girlfriend.
She needs your help.
She's desperate to get out of the country as fast as possible.
And since you're an expert in that kind of thing --
You -- your girlfriend?
It's a new thing.
"Well, if she's your girlfriend, where did you meet?"
Both of you at the same time.
"One, two, three, go!"
A f-friend's house.
I-- the Internet.
"Uh, my friend's Internet house."
"I hope you get eye cancer, Dixon."
W-w-w-w-w-wait.
You don't understand.
"No, I-I understand well enough, okay?"
"And so spare me the sob story, spare me the desperate tale of woe."
"Well, I-I don't have a desperate tale of woe."
But I do have three very well-armed friends.
That would be us.
You might want to invite us in.
"Dixon, you slack-jawed, traitorous nimrod!"
I -- that's your spy friend!
"I-I tell you I'm going off the grid, and you bring the most radioactive man in Miami to my door?"
!
"Are you gonna invite us in, or do I have to start shooting?"
God.
Fine.
Yes.
Come in.
Quickly!
Don't saunter!
"Well, um, we're meeting for breakfast."
"So, maybe we'll get into some of that."
It just seems a little strange that he's suddenly here now.
"Yeah, I get that, but come on, you remember how good he was before he left, right?"
I'm just...
I'm trying to focus on that. (CHUCKLES)
"Mmm... actually, I kinda remember him being a little off."
He wasn't off.
"What do you mean ""off""?"
"He was damaged, Emma."
"I wouldn't have used that word when we were little, but he was damaged."
- When Brandon James killed all of his...
"- He went through a lot, okay?"
We should definitely be able to understand that.
And maybe he's better now.
People can recover.
"Em, he just left you without any explanation."
What about that?
You should be careful.
Yeah.
"Okay, I shouldn't have called you."
"- Wait, are you pissed at me?"
"- Um, I'll see you later."
"(KNOCKING) Hey, sleepyhead!"
I've been texting you since dawn.
Ready to check the storage unit?
"Let's go, go, go!"
"Yeah, just give me one sec, okay?"
One second.
Meet me out front.
Thank you.
"This place is, uh, nice."
"Oh, my God, you're right!"
I'm free!
Yeah.
So if you think about it-- but not too much-- it's actually good that Carly and I hooked up.
"Yeah, it's really good."
"I mean, this guy goes at it like he's still in his 50s."
"Hey, have a cigar, you big crazy!"
"Hey, don't try to make this okay."
You still slept with my sister.
"Promise me you will never, ever do that again."
I promise.
You just winked.
"No, I didn't."
You did it again!
"No, I didn't!"
"You swear, right?"
Yeah.
Of course.
Hey.
"That night, even though she still couldn't get a beer,"
Robin realized the true power of the ring.
♪
"Hey, Robin."
Did you ever figure out how you're gonna get a drink at the bar now that you're engaged?
"Oh, sure."
I know a way that's gonna last forever.
Scotch on the rocks?
Coming right up.
"Now, before you say anything about the hat... this new girl's ass is phenomenal!"
"Hey, Marshall, you got to see this."
The catalog must have mixed up my order.
You won't believe the jeans they just sent me.
Place looks good.
I'm excited you finally get to see our renovations.
Can't believe that excites you.
"God, you sound like a brat who lives in a dump in New York."
Don't be shitty.
My house is not a dump.
Wouldn't know.
I've never been.
Lots of fights happened in this room.
Only with you.
We're going out.
Get yourself dressed up.
It's gonna be a big night. (LAUGHS)
"OK, could you stop doing that?"
It's really annoying.
I planned on going away for a week.
- You know this is important to me.
"- I know, but it wasn't supposed to start for 10 days."
They changed it.
I don't know what to tell you.
You're not being really supportive right now.
You know this is an amazing opportunity for me.
Tell me the good version of this conversation.
"""You got the job?"
"""Congratulations, Ashley."
I'm so happy for you.
"""Although I admit to being a little disappointed,"
"""I understand that these things happen."
"""I'm so proud of you, baby."""
That's basically what I said.
I would never say that.
I am proud of you.
Why would I drive his car?
Manoj said that you were fired because of you didn't maintain the car properly.
I was his driver for 3 years.
"If that was true, he could've fired me long ago."
My current employer verified with him before giving me this job.
You can cross-check if needed.
"If it wasn't you, who would've driven the car?"
I thought that he was going to sell the car.
He didn't say anything when I asked him.
"One day, I saw a lady driving his car."
I heard that she was staying with him.
I presumed that that might be the reason for firing me.
Do you know her?
No.
I have not seen her while I was working for him.
How did she look like?
"She was young, fair, and stylish."
Age?
She was a young lady.
Would you able to identify her?
I can't be very sure.
We will enquire again if required.
Give me your number.
You mustn't leave the town now.
"Okay, Sir."
"Yes, aunt."
How are you?
I'm okay.
Tell me.
What's the matter?
Did Varun call you?
I have deleted his number.
"One more shot, and I kill her."
Papa!
Lower your weapons.
We have lost.
Not just yet.
Back to your mother.
Lock 'em up!
One night away to bury my brother and what do I come back to?
Taylor and his officers got out.
It's in the nature of captives to want to escape.
It's the jailer's job to stop 'em.
They had help.
Obviously.
The lash will loosen their tongues.
Put 'em onboard ship.
Won't find it so easy to launch an escape from there.
"No, you take 'em!"
And you stay with 'em till I send for ya.
Excuse me.
I got hit over the head by two men over there.
Shut up!
"U, lad!"
Come here!
"Mr. Atkins obviously needs all the help he can get, so you go with him."
What will happen to the women?
Leave the women here.
It'll give captain taylor something to consider if he tries to plan another escape.
And what are you gonna do about those 2 men?
What I always do to people who try and cross me.
We have to get those women to safety.
Come on!
"Hey, who are you?"
Molly?
"Molly, I'm hungry."
"Well, go downstairs and fill up your big cereal bowl."
By myself?
Take your bobblehead.
"Mike, come on."
Sunday's my only day to sleep in.
What if your mom and sister are down there?
You've eaten meals with my family before.
"Yeah, but you're always there with me."
"Sweetheart, this is your house now."
You can go do whatever you want.
"Well, what I want is for you to come downstairs with me and have breakfast."
Go!
Fine.
"You know, you're meaner now that we live together."
"Whoa, there he is."
"Morning, Victoria."
You just getting home?
"Yeah, I had a little car trouble."
Maybe I can help.
"I'm not a mechanic, but I know what's what under the hood."
"This is actually more of a ""too stoned to remember where I parked"" problem."
"Well, as a sworn police officer,"
"I cannot comment, but I commend you for not driving a motor vehicle while under the influence."
Wasn't really my choice.
But thank you for not harshing my mellow.
No problem.
"And for the record,"
Johnny law...
"Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow."
And I'm walking the line.
"I was only waiting to take Miss, uh, Miss what's-her-name home."
Or maybe she doesn't want you to take her home.
Silly of her if she doesn't 'cause I'm a pretty nice fella and I think she's divine.
'Get out of here before I throw you out.'
"- Oh, you're gonna get tough?"
"- Yes, I'm gonna get tough."
"- Well, start something."
- That's just what I'm gonna do.
[grunts]
'I'll drag you out of here by the neck.'
Let go off my throat.
Let go.
Let go off me.
Let go.
"Well, fancy meeting you here."
- What...
- Shh.
[knocking]
"Hello, partner."
"""Breathes there the man with soul so dead"
"""who never to himself hath said."
"You're an angel."""
That gives me an idea.
I'm gonna write a little song about you someday.
[clattering]
"Now, that's hardly a friendly attitude."
Do you have to annoy me?
"I just dropped around to tell you I'll be back tomorrow night, and the following night and each consecutive night for an interminable period."
I hope you enjoy the new show.
This is my last night.
Leaving us?
Tch-tch-tch.
"Yes, love it!"
Let's choose team-mates.
Who's sporty here?
"Everyone, who's good at sport?"
No!
"Whatever it is that's happening out here, no!"
And why is water boy strapped to a column?
Water man.
"But, yes, I completely agree."
We're playing jugball.
"As I say, no."
"You're going to the Legal Department, where I put you."
"Come on, it's eight-all."
"I'm sorry that this massive grain company is getting in the way of your cretinous game, shredder."
"It's not cretinous, it's brilliant!"
"And if you actually cared about this company, you'd give people squeakier chairs and lower the price of toilets or whatever."
"Right, guys?"
Yeah...
"Well, something like that."
OK.
"Well, clearly, someone's a little bit tired."
So let's go and get a nice glass of milk.
I'm not tired!
You're tired.
You're tired and you're fired.
Excuse me?
You're firing me?
"That's right, Flave."
It's time to make way for a guy who knows what's really needed here.
Ha!
You don't even know how to wipe your own bottom.
"Not me, the Professor."
- You're giving me a ride.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know why it burned down.
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?
He didn't want to go to a foster home.
"He didn't want to leave, and I didn't want him to leave either."
"It's like, you force me to live amongst these pod people and the first cool person I meet, you kick him out of the house."
I did the best I could.
So did I.
Come on.
The police want to ask us some more questions.
"Dispatch, is there a description...?"
Thank you.
Just follow my lead.
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.
- I'm sorry.
- Ryan Atwood?
We got some questions for you.
- It was an accident.
"- Yeah, you were there?"
Yeah.
Then we got some questions for you too.
"Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney."
Please don't ask him any questions unless I'm present.
"Ryan, keep your mouth shut."
You too.
"Dad, I know."
I understand how important the model home is to the new development.
"We'll sell the lots by Christmas, I promise."
You got a lot of hell on your plate.
MAN:
"What are we doing here, Ray?"
This man needs help.
Are you just gonna sit there while he bleeds to death?
"Nothing you do is going to change anything about what happened to you, Mr Morrison."
What are you talking about?
That man in the woods when you were eight.
The one that took you in that shed.
He wasn't from another planet.
He was just mean and crazy.
You shut up about that.
"You're just going to hurt more people, that's all."
It's not going to make what happened to you go away.
Shut up!
- LISA:
Allie...
"- It would be easier, wouldn't it?"
Blame it on them.
They came down and took you.
You stop it.
It's a lot scarier to think that the monsters might be us.
Shut up!
- Ray!
- You shut up right now!
Ray!
She doesn't mean it!
She's a little kid.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
DOROTHY:
"One day, you're gonna stand in front of the Lord, and you're gonna have to explain what happened here today."
You are gonna have to explain.

"- Okay, see you later."
- Good news.
I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
That is good news.
Bye.
"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced center combat-area problem?"
Five words:
transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
That... that's brilliant.
It's what I do.
"But wait, there's more."
I also invented two new chess pieces.
The serpent...
and the old woman.
"Okay, now I have to ask."
What do they do?
"When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves."
All right.
"Unless... it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress:"
"a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
Elegant.
That's because it's simple.
"Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you."
And...
And what?
And a third person.
It's three-person chess.
I keep daydreaming about the stuff that I wanted to do.
Get really drunk at a college party.
Go windsurfing.
Get married and have kids.
Stupid stuff like that.
It's not stupid.
Even after I got really sick I kept talking myself into believing that I had more time.
At least enough to do some of those things.
Sean Simmons?
You know what?
Hold on a second.
"Sean, I can't get you into college, and windsurfing's nuts."
But you know what?
"Come on, let's get out of here."
- For real?
"- Yeah, come on."
Not unless you have someplace else to go.
- I'm supposed to get him home.
"- Yeah, could you call his mom for us?"
- Tell her we went on a date.
- I'll have him back by curfew.
Maybe.
Say maybe.
Abby.
Abby.
"Listen, I got ahold of Sonia Riley and I told her to call you here if she hears from Eric."
I'll keep my eye open for messages.
Can you get this banana bag to that guy?
My leg-splint girl's screaming.
The Soupbox for lunch?
"Oh, you' re busy."
We could go to that place across the street.
Hey.
Speaking Japanese
speaking Japanese you should have bought American.
Speaking Japanese
"hey, guys how's it going?"
Come on in.
Right this way.
So you guys want to hear a joke?
So there is this little boy.
He finds a welders mask.
"Get out of the Van, fucker, slowly."
Let's go jerk off.
So the kid is walking down the street and this old mans pulls over and offers him a ride.
"Come on, Mike, not that joke, Jesus."
That joke is older than fire.
That joke is older than fire.
"So the old man leans over and says, so have you ever heard of falatio?"
And the kid says no.
So they drive another mile or two.
"The guy leans over and says, hey, have you ever head of sodomy?"
"The kid rips off his mask and says, look man, I'm not a welder."
I guess you had to be there.
"Ok, OK, now let's see the Booty."
Let's see what he got here.
"Fully automatic, who did the conversions?"
Right.
Never mind.
That's it.
"That's the ticket, come on."
"Get down, get down."
"Take it, take it!"
Shoot him!
I'll keep my word.
Forget the rules.
I want him dead because he exposed his identity.
"I'm the boss now, and you'll do things my way."
"Okay, you kill him for me."
"Ifyou blow it, you're dead meat."
I paid you well enough.
"Eddie, this could be a lead."
"Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu, was cut down in Club Nine."
The killer was never caught... but he accidentally blinded a singer.
What was her name?
Jenny.
She hasn't recovered yet.
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.
He's no ordinary assassin.
I hope we'rejust looking for one man.
If I'm not mistaken... this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
"It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not."
He risked his life to save the little girl.
And if he did hurt the singer by accident... he's probably contacted her.
Ifwe meet again
We'll find out where we stand
But perhaps there will be no tomorrow
Only time will tell
-Jeffrey?
- I'm notJeffrey.
I'm sorry.
I don't see too well.
I mistookyou for my friend.
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?
"No, hey, so you're a little on edge."
A giant glass spear in the back will do that to a guy.
It's not a spear.
"What is it, more of a spike or a skewer ?"
"Dude, you're doing a terrible job of trying to keep my mind off the pain."
"You're supposed to talk about something else, not the thing causing the pain."
"True, but the real question is, what are you doing to keep my mind off of your pain ?"
'Cause right now you're not looking too good and I'm starting to feel...
What was that ?
"Uh, seems like we hit something."
"Oh, God, not a body."
"All right, well, pull over or something."
"All right, go out and check,"
I guess.
With the zombies ?

"Uh, no."
We're not.
No.
It's just something we do.
I used to sing that to Kaitlin when she was little and scared.
"Is that why last night, when I asked you to honka-honka me..."
- you only honka'd me?
- I didn't think you noticed.
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.
Just take the cuff off.
"No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop."
"Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy."
"All you have to do is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop."
"- Thanks, baby."
- Mmm.
Are you too woozy to do it one last time before we seek emergency medical attention?
Only one way to find out.
"I'm sorry, bro."
I totally overreacted.
You think?
I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.
He died?
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?
He smells like Marshall's hand.
And wait...
You-You forgive me?
Absolutely.
"Hey, I got a couple cee-gars."
Get over here!
"All right, so where are those cee-gars?"
We'll break 'em out in a minute.
"Hey, Barn."
- Ted?
"- Barney, what is your sister doing here?"
"Nothing, bro."
"Or should I say ""bro-in-law""?"
Sometimes.
"Yeah, you get to move around, change of scenery, meet new people."
Well...
I never thought of it that way.
You seem like a real people person.
Oh.
Outgoing.
Not like me.
No?
Thanks.
I bet you're really good at it.
"Well, there's only one way to find out."
"Boy, am I glad to hear you say that... because it's the one subject he's having trouble with."
You think you could fit him in?
"""Him?"""
Frank.
Frank?
Are you kidding?
At his age?
"Well, I'm afraid if he doesn't learn it now, he's never going to."
"You know, I would teach him myself, but I'm way out of practice."
Ah!
Oh.
Um...
"You know, you should never have to practice."
"Well, that's easy for you to say."
You're a professional.
"But for us laymen, if you don't use it, you lose it."
"Well, how long has it been, you know, since you... used it?"
Oh...
"I use it a little bit every day, you know-- the bank, the grocery store-- but it, you know..."
"It's probably been a good ten, 15 years since I was any good at it, you know."
"- It's an honor, sir."
- I've been meaning to have you up here for some time.
- Really?
Excuse me.
Willie?
"Thank you, Willie."
"Yeah, you betcha."
You unseated that old bastard Bettis.
He must've voted against me 70 percent of the time.
You know what this is?
That's a shark steak sandwich.
Fucking shark steak.
- You want half?
"- Uh, no, thank you."
- Are you a vegan?
Had lunch?
- No.
Uh...
So you choose not to break bread with the president of the United States?
Thank you.
"When I was in the Senate, Bettis could always be counted to leave half a grand at the poker table."
"Always stayed in, never folded."
Always wanted that miracle card.
"- That's good, isn't it?"
- Mm-hmm.
"Now, Truman, he was a poker player."
"Damn fine one, as I understand it."
"Son, I understand you may be making a mess of our plans... to put Laine Hanson into the vice president mansion."
"Right now, sir, I cannot see supporting Laine Hanson."
- How old are you?
"- Me, I'm 28."
"And at that age and experience, you think you're the one to sit and judge Mrs. Hanson?"
- Stay out of this.
- No.
The government does watch us.
You got microwaves and satellites.
"I'm with you, man."
- Do not agitate him.
- Screw you.
"Dr. Bryar, answer the phone."
My old man used to have tracking devices in his cars.
"He said it's for theft, but it's so he can find out where I go."
And what about personal recordings in televisions?
You don't think someone's monitoring everything you watch?
You know how many patents are issued for devices to monitor people?
"Look it up, man."
"Here he comes, Ted."
He's the agent who's playing the hero.
"Answer the phone, Ted."
- Stop this.
It isn't going to help.
- What the hell do you know?
"Ted, he doesn't know what he's talking about."
- He's just a kid.
- Who you calling a kid?
Sit down!
"Oh, now you're going to tell me what to do?"
He'd only have one gun if you weren't here.
"- I'm with you, man."
"- He's not with us, Ted."
He's not with us at all.
"Answer the phone, Dr. Bryar."
It's the Higher Authority.
"They're coming for you, Ted."
Blake?
(melissa) I've caught blake and holly
One-on-one several times.
"(blake) when melissa walks in,"
That's not really the threesome I had in mind.
(jake) everybody will eventually stab you in the back
"For $250,000."
"(gia) this is (bleep), this game."
Graham backstabbed me.
(crying) I'm not losing my friend
Because of something I did.
You guys all had a preconceived notion of who I was.
"Honest to god, I really think it's (bleep)."
(crying) just tell me what happened.
You're okay.
(woman) this is crazy.
Everything is about to change here tonight.
"(erica) oh, my god."
"Oh, my god."
"It's all coming up right now on ""bachelor pad."""
(woman) that was the most shocking exit
"In ""bachelor pad"" history."
(kasey) I have control of this game.
Justin and alli were both going back and forth to both sides.
They had to go home.
(erica) I felt bad for alli a little bit.
"She looked sad like she was, like, fighting tears."
"(kasey) if you don't choose a side,"
You're gonna get canceled.
(woman) she went out gracefully.
She did.
"(kasey) 2 down, 16 to go."
What was your mission?
To have fun.
And drive the wheels off it.
That takes serious effort.
You have ruined it!
They were new!
I should've got some second-hand ones.
Running an old knacker is a good idea because track days aren't covered by road insurance.
If I wanted to get insurance it'd be around £120 for the day.
So I go out without it.
"If you broke it though, stick it in a ditch and go, ""Look!"
"What happened? "" I've heard that happens."
Yes...
I've seen cars pushed onto the road.
This is the Palmer Jaguar.
A track day thunderbolt.
And a more fitting remedy for a man who had once proclaimed...
I am a driving god!
Oh my goodness!
This is a properly great car.
It uses the three-litre V6 out of Jaguar's X-Type.
It has 300bhp and it weighs 600 kilos.
"That is very, very light."
"And it means it's very, very fast."
It really can travel at some incredible speeds.
"Straight up to...120, 130."
Absolutely awesome power in this thing.
Turn it in far here.
Use that torque.
The lowdown power.
Come on!
HE LAUGHS MANICALLY Yeeeeeees!
Mmm-hmm.
I'm fine.
"Nothing, huh?"
Doesn't look like nothing to me.
"You got a new tie there, huh?"
Classy.
Gray.
Didn't know that was the new power color.
Strong choice.
Thanks.
Mr. Gates.
"Okay, fellas, we all have a lot of work to get back to, so I'm gonna keep this snappy."
I've looked through all of your proposals.
"And while I think all of you have more than a little something to offer, the proposal that hits the nail on the head is the one that shows the most leadership and vision that is gonna be required to take this company into the future."
"Congratulations, Felzner."
"Thank you, sir."
You are welcome.
And you can move into that new office of yours whenever you'd like.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Mr. Gates?
"Yes, Allan?"
"Listen, you said that you liked my work."
You said that it was strong...
"I said I liked your work, Allan."
And I do.
"Okay, so why am I not getting the promotion?"
"I mean, I've been here longer than Felzner."
"Felzner is the future, Allan."
It's as simple as that.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
"A double espresso, and make it quick!"
I'm just about done with the glasses.
Did I ask her if she's done with anything?
No.
Why would she inform me then?
That's just her way.
This way of hers is starting to get on my nerves!
You must be Max.
I've got the 503 for you.
503.

This is a beautiful room.
You don't have to sign anything.

There's breakfast upstairs in the cafeteria.
I'd have a problem just simply asking...
I just couldn't come out...
- That's why I have this 10 Euro bill for you.
"- I found it, and would like to give it you, because you need money..."
That way we can approach one another  for both my sake and yours.
"It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long."
Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
"Oh, thank you."
I'll see you guys later.
That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
I wish you'd get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks.
Maybe later.
"-Gunther, can I get a scone?"
-Want anything?
I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I love!
I want her to love me back.
And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
The One With The Birthing Video
How do you guys like living together?
-It's been good.
-Yeah.
-Except he's so uptight about crumbs.
-There was a drumstick in the couch.
I'm not uptight about crumbs.
"It's just, crumbs attract mice and mice leave droppings."
And that's how the plague started.
If you wanna relive that again... .
"Mice didn't start the plague, rats did."
"Rattus norvegicus, to be exact."
"Oh, good God, Ross."
"In the parking lot over there, I have to walk a bit."
"All right, then."
"- It comes out to 18,400 won."
- Here.
"Out of 20,000 won, 1,600 won is your change."
"Thank you, good bye."
"Oh, hi."
Noona.
"I didn't want to make dinner, and we don't have any ramyun either."
- You're here?
- Yes.
I don't think we have any of those red bean donuts you like.
Anything is fine with me.
"Honey, pick a variety of ten, I'll pay for it."
Why are you passing over the sausage?
Stop butting in!
Idiot...
I haven't gotten to ten yet.
And what if you never get to ten?
"It's in the order of arrival, pick them in the order they arrived in!"
Really!
Don't even dream of having a husband who you're with all day.
"They go on about how we're such a beautiful couple, my life sucks."
"Thanks, Unni."
I'll be going.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
You don't need to come out!
Why are you coming out?
"Just because, I wanted to get some fresh air."
"You said you were going to take a break, when did you get here?"
"Well, with any luck we may be in Krems by morning."
Maybe even catch a barge up to Linz.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Are you starting that again?
Anybody cover?
Somebody step on that crumb.
"We warned you, Sefton."
Sure you warned me.
You were gonna slit the throat of that stoolie.
Here's the knife to do it with.
Only make sure you got the right throat.
We're looking at it.
Hurry up on that door.
"What are you trying to do, gum up the works?"
That's right.
"Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the morning, like Manfredi and Johnson?"
"Look, Sefton,"
I had my hands full keeping these guys from tearing you apart.
"I called it last time, didn't I?"
Are we gonna listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
How do they know?
"You told them, Hoffy."
- Who did?
- You did.
Are you off your rocker?
Uh-huh.
Fell right on my head.
Sprechen sie deutsch?
"No, I don't sprechen sie deutsch."
Maybe just one word?
Kaputt?
It's Paul's nephew.
Punk.
- What happened?
- Don't know yet.
"Detective Santos was signed out, that we know."
"But he carried no radio, wore no vest."
- Any backup?
- Zero.
Total breach of department policy.
What was the guy doing?
Taking a meeting with a drug dealer?
You got me.
But it adds up to a dead kid and a dead nephew of the head of the Zapatti family.
"Here's a guy headed for Attica on a 10 to 20, and he cops probation."
Probation?
No jail time?
Probation's a sentence in New York these days.
Which he skips out on 2 years later.
We've been looking for him ever since.
The mayor will want to step up for the wife.
I wouldn't do that if I were him.
"And who are you, again?"
Internal Affairs.
Listen we can bury Santos.
"And if it turns out he was dirty, well good cop turns bad."
Happens all the time.
Sure.
"We'll give him a full-dress funeral, to boot."
Who is she?
A lawyer for the Detective's Endowment Association.
I guess she'll be representing Eddie Santos and his family.
- I was wondering when you'd ask.
"Well, I wouldn't be surprised if she was trying to."
She'd better before that Pearl Danvers makes a tramp out of him.
"Lay off, will you?"
I'm through with that dame.
I was out with her to tell her goodbye.
- Yeah?
What did she say when you told her?
"- She said, ""Goodbye."
"Call me up soon. """
"Shame on you guys, wasting your time in idle chatter."
Look at Joe over there.
"Hey, Dombrowski."
"What do you got there, a honyock back scratcher?"
A slide rule to figure out these stress formulas.
What's that got to do with running a lathe?
Nothing.
It's to do with designing one.
Aw.
"Running a lathe ain't good enough for you, huh?"
Now you gotta learn how to design one.
"It ain't your time he's wasting, is it?"
His going to school don't hurt you.
"No, he's always got his nose in a book."
"Well, it's his nose, ain't it?"
And a plenty big one at that.
"- Hey, Cliff, why don't you stop?"
"Hello, fellas."
How are you?
"Hello, Tommy."
I got news for you.
- This came from the division super.
Ahem.
- No more fruit.
"- You live with these people, Jess?"
Seriously?
Stay here until you find a better place to live.
"I don't like you, stretch."
I don't like anything about you.
- And I'm not afraid to...
- I got this.
"I've got a place to live, Spence."
It's over.
I spent six years trying to figure you out.
All you are is a guy with really beautiful hair.
I'm happy you cheated on me.
"Thank you, because if you hadn't, I would have married you."
And then you would have hurt me all over again.
"And, yeah, I was scared to start over."
I didn't know what to do.
"And, yeah, I'm living with three guys I met on the Internet."
"And, yeah, stranger danger is real."
But I love these guys.
"I barely know them, I just met him, but I love them."
I would just take it easy with the love stuff.
All of them.
"Give her the shirt back, man."
- What happens if I say no?
- You know what happens?
Schmidt happens.
- Aah!
What was on your hand?
"- Thumb ring, bitch!"
You got some Schmidt on your face.
You know what?
Would we stay for you!
?
You two have no conscience at all!
Yu-lu...
Yu-lu...
Are you angry with me?
I know I said something wrong... but I didn't mean to hurt you
"Don't cry anymore, okay?"
"I'm apologizing to you, Yu-lu!"
Look at me!
I swear I won't say it again!
Ta-pei
"Where are you, Ta-pei?"
Ta-pei
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
What are you doing?
"Any orders, Brother Chin?"
Where's the old fellow called Chang Seventh?
He went to gather some wine-making materials
He stole our master's nine-dragon jade cup lf you can't find him by tomorrow
Then just move this winery out of here!
Yes-please report to the master that I want to keep renting this place
The rental's up 30 per cent
About the nine-dragon cup... I'll surely make him to give me back!
Stop!
What are you doing?
come to give back the nine-dragon jade cup give back the nine-dragon's jade cup?
"Give way, be quick!"
"Bastard, you dare come to start trouble?"
The cup's broken!
Report it to Master!
It's time you gave back to the community.
"If you want to help,"
You could contribute to ann's defense fund.
That's blackmail.
"Don't tell me the law,al."
Everything i said is legal.
"If you want to stay out of these cases,"
Quit screwing around.
He might have pardoned you... but your wife never will.
"Ron,tom, these are ann's parents."
Great.
"You haven't talked to the press,have you?"
"Ann,what have you gotten yourself into now?"
"I'm sorry,mom."
You should be.
This is why we didn't want you to go to college out here.
They remind me of my parents.
Mr. Diggs?
"Tom nicholson, from hastings,nebraska."
It's right near where you folks live.
We've just posted ann's bail.
"Listen, i'm sorry about all this,"
"But,uh,ann's gonna be okay."
She's not gonna be okay.
We read the papers.
"She killed a man with a knife,"
And she's not denying it.
They called her a whore.
I'm not a whore.
Then why's it say so in the papers?
Get them out of here.
I don't want them around for trial.
"Oh, put those greasy newspapers in the dustbin, Henry."
They're smelling the place out.
It's like French perfume to me.
"Ahh, tomato soup."
My favourite.
Sir.
Oh.
"Oh, you're very kind."
lsn't she kind?
Don't mention it.
Erm...have you been in any good pubs lately?
"Oh, delicious soup, my lord."
Do you have a French chef?
"No, just an ordinary, plain cook."
"Eh, Stokes?"
"Yes, very plain, my lord."
"Hey, Cissy, did you not speak at a meetin' of the United Workers Party?"
"Yes, I put myself up as candidate for the party in the local by-election."
- Do you think I'll get in.
- Nah.
Not with that eyeglass and the posh accent.
We all thought you were patronising' us.
I found the whole thing very embarrassing.
"I'm sure nobody could hold you responsible for the actions of your children, my lord."
"Which would you like to taste first, my lord?"
"The stout, the raspberryade, or the Montrachet?"
The bishop's arrived.
They're all having coffee in the drawing room.
"Well, I'll be off now, then."
"Erm, you can take those cold chips home with you."
Oooh.
That'll be nice.
"No, you are, Charles."
This was all your idea.
"- Well, what should I tell him?"
- I thought my lack of words said it all.
- But Kisan was great.
- Don't care.
I don't want him.
- Why the hell not?
"- 'Cause I don't trust him, that's why."
"And you don't need to know what I'm gonna do, Charles, till after I do it."
"So, you don't trust Kisan, you don't trust Berg, and you don't trust me, for that matter."
"All the same now, Charles, but I'm talking about the player."
This ain't all about you.
When are you gonna realize that?
"Man, this is fucked."
You're gonna put politics over performance?
You're gonna stand here and let your ego keep us from getting a player of Kisan's caliber?
"- Do you know what subtext is, Charles?"
"- Yes, sir."
"Good, then go fuck yourself."
And that is about you.
( man chattering )
- ( door closes )
- T!
"T, where are you at?"
T!
- ( line ringing ) - ( phone ringing )
"- Yo, what's up?"
"- Yo, where are you at, man?"
- I'm at the house.
- Then why didn't you answer me?
I just did!
And the dog.
"Richard, I want you to do something for me."
Get a hold of the kennel association.
See if you can trace that dog's background.
"Otis, trace a dog?"
"Well, they told me that, working with you,"
I'd learn something every day.
"Look, you can get the dog's registration number"
From the girl.
I want to know everything possible.
"You know, uh, name of the breeder, place of birth..."
All that sort of stuff.
OK.
And don't make a big deal out of it
"Now, especially with the girl."
Audrey dear.
It's Hester.
"I know, dear."
Another senseless tragedy.
"No, no, no, there's nothing you can do about it."
Just leave it to the police.
Yes.
I'll tell you why I called.
I've called the vet.
"Yes, I'm going to take Greta to get her shots."
"No, I'd be glad to do it."
"It'll give you a chance to rest, dear."
"Oh, yes."
"And, uh, by the way, um, you know that tag, that other tag"
That Greta's wearing?
"Well, I know it sounds silly."
"But, uh, I'd like her to keep it."
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
"If I get caught and you're with me, you're in trouble, too..."
You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that?
You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake IDs and passports.
Those cost money.
We have a stolen car!
We make it legit.
We take a VIN number off of another car.
"Emma, I'm not going to have you in the seat next to me..."
"Wait, wait, wait, seriously, wait, wait, wait!"
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
"We can fence them, and then we'll have the money."
We could do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
"So, you want to steal the watches to help me get away with stealing the watches?"
Yes.
That is exactly what I wanna do.
- I can't let you risk everything...
- I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.
Staring... with wide eyes at the sky.
"After that, he was possessed by the eye."
He could see nothing else.
And he kept drawing that picture.
I can't forget that eye either.
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.
"The moon also gIitters, but it's not frightening."
moonlight is nice.
"Yes, it was on a night just like tonight... a strange thing happened--"
Stop it!
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.
I never told... you a scary story.
"When I was in the kitchen, I heard a feeble voice saying:"
"""hello, hello."""
I heard a feeble voice.
I Iooked... and saw a strange boy poking his head in.
"He said, ""Your Suzukichi--"""
Suzukichi again?
"""Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool..."
"""so I pulled him out..."
"""and carried him here."
"""I put him on the grass over there."""
This was what the little boy said.
He was a skinny little boy.
"And sure enough, he was soaking wet himself... with water still dripping from his hair."
I was so shocked.
I rushed out to see.
I saw...
Suzukichi lying there.
Looking quite dazed.
And what happened to the skinny little boy?
When I Iooked around... he was gone.
It was for you.
I've been trying to call you.
"I just had,like,the most amazing stream of consciousness right now."
"I'm gonna write us a rock opera, you know,that we could,like,sing together."
"How we met and how we made love,and it... it's like..."
# The sky was opened... #
I can't sing.
And that's okay.
God.
It's like every time
"- that I see you,I,I,I..."
- Johnny.
I'm just so into you.
God!
You know what?
"I want to,like,get tattoos together and drink each other's blood."
We need to break up.
- No.
"- Johnny, you asked me to give another week."
I gave it another week four times.
- It's not working.
"- No,it's working."
"Okay,it,it's,it's just working so well that you just can't see it, and that,like,terrifies you,man."
"Look,we're in different places."
You want to drink my blood.
"I want to go have margaritas and,like see a movie or something."
I can't take all the emotion and crying.
And on my birthday.
Uh...
I'm so sorry.
You didn't remember my birthday?
!
- ...just because...
"- You're in a cafeteria, Mr. McCullers with kids trying to have lunch."
"I don't think that's the audience you want, is it?"
"Hello, Mrs. Marin."
I'm James Leland.
"Have a seat, Mr. Leland."
I'm sorry.
My regular assistant didn't make your appointment.
All I know is...
- ...you need to speak to an officer.
- Ah.
I'm Esther Potter's nephew.
She died recently.
I'm sorry.
She was a loyal customer.
"I'd like to talk to you about her accounts, her safety deposit box."
Um...
"Actually, we were under the impression Mrs. Potter had no living relatives."
She certainly was the last of the Potters.
"Her sister married my grandfather up in Syracuse, where I'm from."
I think technically that makes me a great-nephew.
Yes.
"Well, uh, the State Revenue Agency will need to see your ID before I can release any information or give access to the safe deposit box."
- I thought so.
- Yeah.
I brought copies.
"Oh, good."
Leland  Daley?
"Yes, we're architects."
I will get these to the Revenue Agency.
It's a little late in the day to expect a response.
I have business in the area.
"We're going for the Lincoln, OK?"
"Ok, we go for the Lincoln."
"Ok, we go for the Lincoln."
Wait a second.
What's happening?
In the car.
They're in the car.
In the car.
They're in the car.
Shoot em!
Aahhh.
Hang on.
"Luckily, the bullet passed right through."
Just missed a major artery though.
And he still lost a lot of blood.
Is he going to be all right?
What do you want a warranty?
"No, I want him checking out on me."
"No, I want him checking out on me."
You should have thought about that before you brought him here.
But this guy seems pretty tough though.
He'll probably pull through all right.
Man.
That's the biggest god-damn tattoo I've ever seen.
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus.
"Guy certainly isn't afraid of needles, huh?"
How long till he comes to?
You got me.
This stuff is supposed to keep him calmed down but I'm not sure for how long.
This stuff is supposed to keep him calmed down but I'm not sure for how long.
I haven't gotten into anesthetics yet you know.
Sit down.
You can't punch the leader.
"You are not a leader, okay."
You're a fuck up.
You've always been a fuck up.
I need you to calm down.
"Okay, we need to figure out a plan before that sick fuck comes home."
What about the skylight?
That's like 25 feet up.
"Even if we stand on each other's shoulders circus style, we won't be able to reach it."
We tried that already.
Text.
I thought you said the signals are blocked.
"I'll just ah, hit send and throw it to the skylight."
"It's a signal jammer, okay."
"We find the jammer, we kill it, then we call for help."
"Look, it's a new plan guys, all right."
"You guys, you sweep this are out here for the jammer,"
Blair and I will take the bedroom.
You don't tell me what to do.
Can you wait for me?
Riley.
Yeah.
Hey.
"I need you with us, okay."
We gotta find that jammer.
He's right.
No.
I'm a fuck up.
"No, you're not."
We all make mistakes.
"Look at me, I'm in deep with Timmy Song, right."
"And fix the bogs, and oil that very squeaky door."
And lower the price of grain.
"Er...yeah, maybe."
I mean -
"People are starving, Marcus."
I haven't eaten bread for weeks.
I thought you were on a wheat-free diet?
"Not by choice, dickhead."
I can't afford it.
"The grain companies are fucking us in the arse, and expecting us to swallow it."
"Yeah, that does sound bad."
"It's a disgrace, and a little more urgent than a squeaky door."
You haven't heard it.
It's like...
Eee-whoo-whaaargh...
"But, yeah, ending starvation."
I'll add that to the list.
"Salve, Grumio."
"All right, landlord."
Obvious question - why are you licking a bag?
"Oh, yeah, I got in a load of posh nosh last night."
The bag's still got salami juice on it.
"Lovely, lovely."
Do you fancy a dab?
"No, I'll leave it for now, thanks."
"Oh, no, I've still got Rambo's card."
"Oh, yes!"
I've still got Rambo's chuffing card!
"Yep, my master will like that."
"Your master must be quite the foodie, sir."
"Oh, he's one of the foodiest fellas you'll ever meet."
"What else is good here, then?"
Oh!
"Yeah, uh, my feet were hurting, so I... same reason I never wear mine."
What?
"Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
"Oh, you mean like a rave?"
"Oh, is it still a rave if you don't roll?"
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
Want me to get you one?
Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
"All right, cool."
"Um, it's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
But you are telling me that could tell me something if you wanted to tell me?
Was that a question?
It felt like a question.
Well...
Tell me if this feels like an answer.
No.
Jackson?
In here.
Is something wrong?
Y-you could've warned me.
You're the one that walked into the boys' locker room.
I can feel it closing in on my nuts right now.
And after that conversation with the Bossman?
"I don't know, I'm starting to think maybe we are on the evil side of things here."
"Maybe you're just not emotionally cut out for this, Joe."
"Yeah, maybe."
"And clearly, you're not either."
I ever tell you the story about my dad?
"What, your real dad or your adoptive dad?"
"Asshole, my adoptive dad is my real dad."
"Okay, okay, good."
I didn't wanna hear a story about you searching for your biological father.
"- Shut the fuck up, Joe."
- Done.
Please continue.
"My dad Carl was a loving man, tough man."
- Like you.
"- Much more loving, much tougher."
"He worked in the, uh..."
"in the mills in Bethlehem, all right?"
Provided a decent living.
He took care of us.
Supported us.
Nothing lavish.
- Right.
"- So, one day, he gets a call into the big boss's office."
First time he's met him in 30 years.
"So, what did the boss say?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
What the fuck kind of story is this?
"You see, it's not about what the boss said;"
"it's what he didn't say, Joe."
"I'm sorry, OK?"
It's something with my family.
I can't talk about it now.
"Look, I got to go."
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Hey.
"- Glad you called, man."
- It's been a while.
- Thanks for coming.
It's bad enough my dad was in love with another woman.
Like my mom wasn't enough.
- But another kid?
- I guess you weren't enough?
I almost died and yet there I am back in the same place.
- Ready to do it all again.
- But you didn't.
You didn't use.
"And that's good, man."
"- Yeah, but I came close, bro."
- Of course you did.
This whole thing is textbook you.
"Look, I know you, Justin."
You didn't become a medic for nothing.
You can't stand to see people in pain.
And right now you and your family are suffering.
There's nothing you can do to make that go away.
"If it gets overwhelming, you know the drill."
"Find a meeting, work the steps."
I don't get it.
"How could he lie to us about his own daughter, knowing what it would do to us when we found out?"
And her.
"Rebecca, right?"
I don't know anyone who fits that description.Doctor's ethics.
"If you knew, you wouldn't tell?"
"No, I probably wouldn't."
"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California, no less was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient."
Is that a threat?
"No, I mention it only in passing."
"Incidentally, I mention it only in passing I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession."
"Father, wait a minute!"
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.
"Well, I get passes to the best shows in town."
"Mrs. K, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go."
That's too bad.
I hate to go alone.
"I love to talk film discuss, to critique."
You want to see a film with me?
I've got passes to the Crest.
It's Othello.
Who's in it?
Debbie Reynolds:
Desdemona and Othello:
Groucho Marx.
Are you happy?
I've seen it.
One last time.
Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
"No, answer the question, Father Paranoia."
All right.
You know who I think really did it?
Who?
The Dominicans.
People find out.
They always find out.
Nobody will find out as long as you don't say a word.
Understand?
"- No, I won't."
- Good.
"Now, you run on home now."
"- Thank you, doctor."
- That's a good girl.
Thanks.
And don't worry about your job.
It'll always be waiting for you.
Thanks for the beautiful bed jacket.
"Hi, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Hi, Allison."
"- Hi, Ted."
- We were just leaving.
- Don't let me rush you out.
- We have to go.
"Goodbye, Selena."
See you soon.
They say it'll bloom for a month.
You can plant it in your yard as a reminder of your operation.
Here's a book on humor.
Surgery's nothing these days.
You'll be up before you know it.
"I went to see Mr. Rossi today, talked about how to get to college."
He said he might be able to wrangle me a scholarship.
He talked Mr. Partridge into taking me into his office as an office boy.
How about that?
That's just fine.
"Only thing is, if I work there a year, it'll be eight years instead of seven before I can pass the bar exam."
"She ran away from the home and me, you know?"
But I didn't give up!
I have brought her back!
"And that, too, after she has a child!"
I see... but how did you accomplish all this?
One has to apply his mind for the children's welfare.
One cannot live on love alone.
One needs money.
One needs comforts...
"And luxuries, too."
What happened?
My heart...
Janki!
Janki!
I want a truck-load of flowers.
Have the house washed...
Have the boss's white attire ironed.
And I want 200 kgs of ice...
That's a must!
We'll lay the boss's body on that... or his body will stink till his brother arrives from Nepal.
He must be given a National Hero's farewell!
He is leaving us so much!
I'll ask his daughter and let you know more.
Hang on.
What happened?
Everything is fine.
Call off everything!
Bless aunt!
The worst could have happened if she had not rushed you here on time.
She carried you all the way as if you were a child!
"You ought to take part in the Olympics, aunt!"
India would be assured of at least one gold medal.
Of course not.
"You're being funny, aren't you?"
Mum and Roger had a big row  then had gone off to the kitchen to talk quietly.
Then Roger came out.
Then why did you split up with Roger?
Did he have another girlfriend?
I don't think so.
Do you have another boyfriend?
Don't you think you would know?
"Who would I be seeing, the milkman?"
No.
He's too young.
"No, Marcus."
I haven't got another boyfriend.
That's not how it works.
"Not when you're a 34-year-old working mother in a youth-obsessed, anorexic, soulless culture."
"Don't worry, Mum."
I won't go to McDonald's.
I hope she makes you itch.
"You know, really itch."
- I just can't believe how you could do that.
- You bloody pig!
What were you thinking?
Do you have shit for brains?
Let it out.
Let it out.
You're a bastard!
I hate you for what you've done.
That's good.
"I wouldn't mind if you did it once, but you wanted to do it twice."
- I wanna put my hands around your throat...
- You don't have to do that.
"But, Mr. Connors, there has to be a reason you thought initially that it was sabo..."
I said I wasn't thinking.
Okay?
My son just died.
PRIDE:
"Mr. Connors,"
"I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you, but our job is to find out what happened to your son."
"You know that, right?"
Sure.
Of course.
Do you know of any reason why somebody might have wanted to hurt Jared?
I-I don't know.
"What about you, Ms. Wells?"
Did you see anything suspicious?
(sighs) No.
(clears throat)
"We were just chasing each other around the track, you know, messing around."
Jared was showing me how to race.
So it was your first time.
I've been in racecars before.
I'm the advance coordinator for Warbury Racing.
We're in town this week for the race.
You two work for the same team?
"Yeah, about a year now, yeah."
That's how I met Jared.
We've been dating ever since.
Was he a good driver?
He was great.
RUSS:
"Well, he's been racing his whole life."
All the way back to go-carts.
He was gonna turn pro after his discharge.
Mr. Assanai why are you back?
I thought you got better.
I miss you.
So I thought I'd visit.
Yeah?
Room 5 please.
Number 117.
"That day if I thought of you only as a patient, I wouldn't have felt anything."
"But being that we're friends,"
I felt sad.
So I hoped that you're feeling well.
And I wouldn't have to see you again.
"I'm feeling well, doc."
I just wanted to see you again.
There is one thing I wanted to tell you.
But I didn't get to tell you.
"When you told me to go to the beach,"
I really went there.
I never thought I'd want to sit and watch the sunset.
But you told me to.
So I watched it that day.
"Honestly, seeing the sunset was a waste of time, but that day I don't know why, I..."
I sat there for hours.
That day I felt like
I could breathe easily.
And I was happy.
Just like every time I see you.
"Thank you very much, doctor."
I thought you said you were feeling well.
I hope next month we won't see each other again.
FEDERALPROSECUTOR SAMELLISIS WIDELYEXPECTED
- Is that one of those...
- Yeah.
I wasn't here when everything went down
"Between Artie and MacPherson, but I know it was bad."
Here.
"Yeah, this feels right."
Yeah.
It must've been bad.
"I mean, all that stuff with Ogawa."
Giving Dickinson the file.
He wanted more than the sword.
He wanted to mess us up as a team.
It worked.
"Well, I don't know how to work with him right now."
The thing about Artie is that he's lost
A lot of people in his life--including agents.
So now he just shuts everybody out.
It's a defense mechanism.
That's not an excuse.
It's not a reason to keep secrets as compulsively as he does.
It's not meant to be an excuse.
Just an explanation.
"Artie acts like he doesn't care,"
But he does--about you both--a lot.
And that scares him.
"Well, I guess he needs to work that out, doesn't he?"
"You know, just because he lost people,"
It doesn't make us expendable.
I'm not a red shirt.
I'm not.
She's upset because I don't communicate.
"Did she not notice the word ""secret"""
Yeah?
"""To Mr. Thomas W. Smith."
Subject:
Promotion.
"Effective July 12th, you'll report to Division Superintendent James to assume your new duties as assistant general shop foreman. """
"- Well, congratulations, boy."
- Thanks.
Well...
You seem glad to get rid of your old foreman.
"No, we ain't."
Glad to see you get it.
"Hey, Tommy, who's gonna crack the whip in your place?"
"As far as I know, the job's still open."
They'll fill it the way they always have.
Move the best man up.
"Well who would you say the best man is, Tommy?"
Heh-heh.
"Kid, if they ask me, I'll have to tell them you're all pretty good."
Ha-ha.
You know darn well I'm better than pretty good.
Sure.
You're the guy that wrote those books Dombrowski's always studying.
"There's one for you, wise guy."
"Hey, there she blows."
Let's go back.
"Till Monday, I'm still the best man."
"Yes, sir, Mr. Smith."
"Hey, you big ape, you."
Get in there.
Tommy was kidding.
You've been here longer than the rest.
You can run this shop as well as you run that drill press.
You didn't sign anything?
Why ask a question like that?
Do I look that stupid?
Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic.
That's all it'll amount to.
"We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple without firing a shot, just by strategy."
We've done things like this before.
It's just a lot of fun.
- Fun?
You want to go.
- Darling...
"- Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!"
"- Right, sir."
He called you sergeant.
Why?
You're not in the army.
"It's just an old habit, hard to break."
I'll see you tomorrow.
Why don't you come right out and say you don't want to get married?
You'd rather be with him.
Why fool me by telling me how you hated him and his ugly face... and all the ugly faces in the army?
- I didn't say quite that.
Be fair.
"- Please, sahib, hurry."
"- Come on, Sergeant!"
- Can't you wait a minute?
"Sure, I can wait, but I'm not so sure about Cutter."
- Can't you trust me?
Kiss me goodbye.
"- No, never."
They're probably slicing Cutter's ears off by now.
"- I'm coming, Mac!"
"Hi, Daddy."
He was the one that got the license for this building.
Nice guy.
[Woman] You gave me a little bit of a scare... when you told me you had pains in your chest and back.
You have to let somebody know.
If you're having pains in your chest and your back-
In my chest that goes through to my back.
- Is that what's happening right now?
- Mm-hmm.
You know what?
"I think maybe I better take you back to the area, just to be safe."
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm
-Yeah -
- She might be pregnant.
[Laughing] How do you say-
She
- She says maybe you're pregnant.
[Laughing]
- That would be interesting.
- It would be a very good thing... if you would - if you would find me a really good husband.
It's already too late.
"If you're pregnant, it's already over..."
- [Claire] Oh.
"- I've seen you with a new young man around here, Claire."
I know that you do have someone new in your life.
- Oh.
- Do you remember that?
Memory is one of the things she hasn't got.
And I think his name is Albert.
"- Oh, Al..."
"..but it is meant for your child, but Im sorry to say.."
..that sister-in-Iaw doesnt have any child.
And however you might be related to us..
..but you are not our real brother.
"My friend, please come back."
"Without you, my Iife is incomplete."
"My friend, please come back."
"Without you, my Iife is incomplete."
Come and look at my condition.
"Without you, all my happiness is incomplete."
"My friend, please come back."
You came to my Iife as my..
You came to my Iife as my..
You loved me more than my near ones did.
people say that you were a stranger.
people say that you were a stranger.
"My friend, please come back."
"Without you, my Iife is incomplete."
"My friend, please come back."
I pray to God that wherever you are..
..may you always be happy.
I pray to God that wherever you are..
..may you always be happy.
"Even afterforgetting, I cant forget you, my companion."
I always think of you.
I always think of you.
"My friend, please come back."
"Without you, my Iife is incomplete."
"My friend, please come back."
"Brother, you are counting your money!"
How much money did you collect?
Nothing.
-My butt too!
What do we do?
!
-What's going on?
"-I don't know, I don't know!"
Oh please!
"Oh mother, father!"
Oh please...!
Oh Jesus!
"Oh yes, right there!"
"Oh please, please!"
Jesus!
To commit such dirty deeds in such a divine school like this...
"It's because of an allergy to mushrooms, if you take the medication and put on some ointment, you'll be better soon."
I should have checked the body sooner.
Is our school nurse's office a welfare office?
Or a hospital?
So unbelievable...
Is he an idiot or something...?
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
The money that was in the house was spent paying for the taxi last night...
"But with my whole strange body thing, I couldn't go to the hospital."
I came because I was worried something may happen to precious Yoon Jae's body...
But...
Did you get into a lot of trouble?
-Are you okay now?
-Yeah.
This guy must be really healthy!
I mean the medicine worked like a charm on his body!
Make sure to eat something when you get home.
And take your medicine too.
I'm...
Don't tell me you're claustrophobic.
"Oh, my God."
The FAA needs to ground all air traffic.
Where's the secretary of Homeland Security?
- He's at the White House.
- Who's the deputy sec?
Wyck Halsey.
He's also at the White House.
"Oh, Jesus."
"--Happens, our thoughts go to terrorism."
I've had enough of this.
Walker told us to stay where we are.
"Madam Secretary, gentlemen I'm gonna ask you to accompany us to the Blue Room."
- Who is this man?
- He is...
- He's a concerned citizen.
"- Good morning, Mr. Secretary."
- You killed the secretary of defence.
"- Well, he wasn't doing a very good job."
"Okay, so, would the remaining secretaries please join us in the Blue Room?"
"- Sir, I'm on with Agent Reid."
- How they doing?
VP just puked all over Air Force One.
"I'm General Caulfield, vice chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff."
Have the nuclear launch codes been switched?
"- Yes, and new codes are active."
- The stock market's collapsing.
"Travis, I need you to suspend trading immediately."
"And there's gonna be a run on the banks, so close them now."
- You guys good?
"- Yes, sir."
Who were they?
We couldn't find out...
Do you have any idea?
I do.
Some migrants probably just felt threatened.
It's not worth the worry.
Prince Daeso will be furious.
Keep quiet.
"Yes, sir."
"Since you killed Jumong, I'll give you the reward I promised."
One states your new title as a noble.
The other states your new estate.
"Come on, take it."
I'm honored.
Bubunno.
Yes?
I'll appoint you as Vice Commander.
Help Naro prepare for the war.
You're familiar with Jolbon... so organize the spies and think of ways to strike the enemy.
I will.
Eupru is a few hours away.
A man named Buwiyum is head of the pirates now.
But we don't know where he lives or what he looks like.
"Gosh, I'd rather look for a needle in a haystack."
"Commander, what should we do now?"
Do you know your way around Eupru?
"This is Sanchun, Magok and Geodu."
I'm sure the pirates trade their loot.
We should ask the merchants in the area.
I've done business in Sanchun and Magok before.
I'm sure they'll help us.
"I'll go to Magok with Oi, Mari and Hyupbo."
We are stronger...
What are you ?
Some goddamn wind-up tin soldier ?
- This is my wife we're talking about.
- I know who she is !
And I have known her and cared about her a hell of a lot longer than you !
You can do whatever the frak you want !
I am going after my wife !
"Missiles are loaded, Admiral."
Open launch tube doors.
"Doors are open, Admiral."
What are you doing ?
Getting ready to nuke the planet.
Radiological detection.
- They've opened their missile doors.
- He's bluffing.
"- I can't let you do that, Sam."
- I am not asking you for permission.
Sergeant Mathias.
Load target package three-bravo.
Set ground zero for the underground structure.
Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee ?
They're loading a targeting package.
It's a bluff.
Don't let him rattle you.
The risk to us is unacceptable.
Turn back the Raiders.
The ships cannot turn back.
He won't launch it.
And D'Anna was explicit that she and Baltar make it to the planet's surface.
"So, is that what all this is really about ?"
"""And the heavens opened up, and they saw the eye."""
Yeah?
Yeah.
"Uh, he's sick in the hospital."
We just come by to water his plants and look after the place for him.
Hospital?
Is it serious?
"Uh, yeah, it's pretty serious."
They're still trying to figure out what he has.
Damn.
(SIGHS)
It's good you guys are looking after the place.
Yeah.
"I mean, we don't mind, so-"
(CLEARS THROAT) But I better get back to it.
"No, dude."
We're over here tonight because we're not in the photo from last night.
It's that simple.
"Well, it's not like fate decided it."
"Presumably, we made decisions yesterday that made us end up here today."
"All right, my brain just kinda melted a bit."
What was the original question?
"The question is, if you could choose something to show up in the next photo, anything, what would you choose to see?"
I'm a little ashamed at how good it felt to buy this dress.
Back to the question.
Easy.
I want a pile of money so big that I'm fuckin' buried in it.
You are so predictable.
Me?
What about you?
We all know what you wanna see most.
A rock.
(SCOFFS)
"Come on, wrap up your gear."
You're coming with me.
Hurry up.
Guruji.
If it ain't young Toad Face.
Fancy meeting you here.
Vile dog.
"For that insolence, you shall grovel before my son."
"You shall grovel, I say!"
Look here.
"I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen, and I don't grovel before any heathen."
"Kabul, take him to the tower... and teach him the error of false pride."
Take him away!
"In those drear gray hours before dawn, just go out and chase elephants."
Beats counting sheep a million miles.
"What do you mean, elephants?"
This ain't elephants.
"This is Annie, my Annie."
I'll find her if I have to turn out the whole British Army.
What the blazes is this?
"Good morning, gentlemen."
Good morning.
What the blazes are you here for?
I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
"Higginbotham, I could just fall on your neck."
I got a better neck than mine you can fall on.
That's a good one.
"Hello, there!"
"Tommy, hello!"
How wonderful of you to meet us.
"I came here to surprise you, and here you are, surprising me."
"- Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney."
You left it blank.
Korean?
Korean?
I am not familiar with Korean.
Dealer's choice.
Whatever releases the most tension.
Mmm.
"Oh, that feels so good."
Thank you.
I can't tell you how much I need this.
It has been a long time.
"Oh, I love pleasuring people."
So do I.
"I mean, it's not my job, but it is a job that I love doing, if you know what I mean."
I know exactly what you mean.
"So, Joey, do you have any problem areas?"
I hold a lot of tension in my upper thighs.
We'll get to your upper thighs.
It's just the top of my quads.
"As a matter of fact, if you want to do, like, the full 80 minutes on the thighs, I'm good."
Whatever you want.
"Oh, I need this."
You have no idea.
"Oh, you got great hands."
"Okay, Joey, what I want you to do for me is just close your eyes."
"Quiet that mind, okay?"
Just listen to my voice.
Feel the sound slide down my throat and come out through my mouth.
"Down my throat, come out through my mouth."
Down my throat...
Keep...
"Keep going, keep going."
No.
What's the name of the company making it?
Wentworth Drug.
This is gonna hurt somewhat.
I've got to remove the bullet.
"Hello, is this Nielson and Co."
Brokerage Office?
"Give me a customer's man, please."
"Hello, my name is Clementi Sabourin."
I'm at the Savoy Drake.
I want to open a new account.
What are the margin requirements?
Fifty percent?
Then buy me twenty thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at the market price.
What is the stock selling at?
Two dollars?
I'll be down at your office with the money before the market opens.
What is your name?
Mr. O'Hara.
Thank you very much.
Can you tell me where I can find Mr. O'Hara?
"That desk over there, sir."
Thank you.
Mr. O'Hara?
Yes.
My name is Clementi Sabourin.
I spoke to you on the telephone.
"Oh, yes, you're the gentleman who wants to open a margin account."
"Now, would you mind signing this, please, just a formality... and I'll fill out the rest."
Can you tell me the name of your bank?
I can do better than that.
I brought you a cashier's check for twenty thousand dollars.
"But that, no."
It isn't clean!
"You can catch germs in no time,"
licking just anyone like that.
What happened after that?
"After Touchy, Ducky and the Morin girl arrived."
They came from the hotel.
"We turned to look, we saw this kid crossing the street, he almost got hit and jumped into the field."
"Ducky got out of his car, all excited."
He came up to us and asked:
"Touchy, what was that?"
"- A black guy, I think."
"...Touchy said, coming out of his truck."
Ducky was looking all around.
"Touchy saw that I had gun, so flicking his hair, he said:"
I'm gonna go catch him!
And he ran in the corn behind the kid.
"Ducky stayed with us, saw the statue and went..."
"He looked at me, then turned to the field."
Nothing was moving in there.
"Nothing at all, at all."
Ducky started yelling:
Touchy!
No answer.
"He was getting scared, he said:"
Was he alone?
How should I know?
They hang out in gangs.
It was no joke.
We were all staring at the corn field... even the Morin girl... who was quite... quite drunk.
Ducky was getting more nervous.
"Touchy, did you catch him?"
You just need someone to distract her friend.
"Oh, thank you, that is really solid of you."
I didn't volunteer... oh!
She's hot!
I volunteer.
"So, how'd it go with Emma?"
Not great.
"She, uh, did not think it was a date."
"Neither did Kevin, the dude she ended up making out with."
"This whole ""taking action"" thing is a disaster."
Except for Kevin... it's working gangbusters for Kevin.
[groans]
"Amy's nice, but she's so boring"
I almost didn't have sex with her.
You and Amy had sex?
How did that happen?
"Well, that's a conversation you should probably have with a parent."
Hey!
Holy hell!
She's boring from inside the house!
Okay.
She's not the first woman to stalk me after a night of mind-blowing sex.
"Mason, you go distract her..."
"Dude, Amy works here, in payroll."
She works here now?
!
"Well, she's not the first woman to get a job to stalk me after a night of mind-blowing sex."
Did you guys even talk last night?
She's worked here for three years.
She started here three years ago just to stalk me?
!
Jack?
- Would you like to see them?
"- Oh, we will."
Indeed.
Don't spare the horses.
Take the next slipway.
"Off, here."
Here we go.
"Hang on, laddie."
Let's turn the tables on these buggers.
Tally ho.
Big Ben.
Akan is a cunt!
"Oh, my."
Looks like Akan's already begun.
"By tomorrow, these poor chaps will be super robotic soldiers like yourself."
Look out!
"On your feet, lad."
On your left.
Hang on.
I'm gonna buy you some time!
Seal the door.
Can't tell you the number of times I've dreamt that I was riding up in this lift.
It's a pity I can't...
"It's just the landing gear, laddie."
"Now, listen to me."
"When you kill Akan, I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as they are, understood?"
"No, I'm afraid I shall not be coming with."
But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years.
No.
It's lodged in his jugular.
"If you uncork it, I won't be able to..."
"The thingamajig in your pocket, quickly."
What she said about the Nazis and the rest made me sick.
My father...
"Was scared of her, totally under her thumb."
"It was her place, you see."
"No, you have no idea what it was like living here."
It's always the same.
"If you had read Freud, you'd know how much damage your parents do to you."
It starts...
Even before you're born.
"Ah, yes, you read, uh..."
Yes.
I wanted to study psychoanalysis.
I wanted to go to university.
They wouldn't let me.
"Well, Stanley, lying is never very clever, but lying to a police officer is a very serious offense."
I'm not lying.
Everything I've told you is the truth.
Mr. Ellis?
Yes.
"How are you feeling, Mr. Ellis?"
Can you tell me what happened?
You don't know?
"Well, you didn't leave a note."
No.
Whisky and a sleeping draft-- it's fairly evident you tried to take your own life.
Why was that?
Isn't it obvious?
Not to me.
People had the wrong impression about Peggy.
"She was a strong woman, opinionated."
But they don't understand.
I'd been married to her for 22 years.
MAN:
"Well, where does the [inaudible]?"
"Yeah, you got to-- you can't do that, right?"
"Hey, you guys can't do this stuff"
"Until he's wrapped, right?"
I'm the director.
I'm the boss.
Don't wrap until you get the word directly from the top.
I'm sorry if you were misinformed.
It obviously was a boo boo.
"And again, I'm grateful."
"It's the best makeup we've ever had,"
The best Toxie we've ever had.
But there might be some major miscommunication.
"And if it happens, it'll be a four-hour wait."
"So please-- this didn't matter, this one."
"But please just check first, right?"
"Please, please, please."
"Tox-- uh, David, thank you very much."
It was a wonder day.
Are you satisfied?
Everything all right?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
But you're OK?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
We can't do any better.
We cannot do any better.
I can't make the movie any other way.
This is the best-- this may be harder than most of the days.
I don't know.
But the only good-- the only thing I can suggest
"Is when we're outdoors, we only have so much daylight."
So I could get in no problem?
Well assuming you had Miley's grades and SAT scores.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
I am very tired here so I need to get this clear.
This may sound crazy.
Let me get this right.
If Miley and I were somehow I don't know.
"Smooshed into the same person, we could get in?"
[Laughs] Well if you put it like that I guess you would.
Unfortunately that's not the case.
Although oddly enough You do have the same eye twitch.
That's not the only thing we have in common.
It just so happens that Miley and I are.
The same.
Sign of the zodiac.
"Sagittarius, which means we're the fire sign."
And over-excitable eyelids.
I gotta go.
[Door closes]
"[Singing to the tune of ""Singing""]"
Problems.
She's got nothing but problems.
She's lost Jesse and Lilly.
All because of the wig.
If she came clean.
All her problems would just go away.
Or would they just begin?
[Mimicking cats screeching]
She's going to be home any minute.
And I don't know what to say to make her feel better.
"I know, I know."
It's terrible.
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Ms. Moroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't-- I don't think you'd like it."
"'Cause we work a lot of hours, and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I like risky.
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
All of 'em.
"Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe."
"Karl Robe, you say?"
Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other.
To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.
That's a metaphor.
Sure.
You should tell that to Us Weekly.
"Hey, Lemon."
You like karaoke?
I know a joint.
"No, no, I-- I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy."
I'll take you.
"I was ready to earn an academy award nomination trying to mask my horror over how badly it sucked, but it's actually pretty decent."
"Thanks, bro."
You mind if I take a crack at it?
"Yeah, knock yourself out, bro."
All right.
"Holy shit, you got skills."
"* Left to look at but what lies inside me, * * my first reality * dude, you go to be in my band, bro."
- That was sick.
"- Count me in, bro."
"- Holy shit, bro."
- What are you guys called?
- Hot lunch.
"- Count me out, bro."
- What?
- Hot lunch?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
"You know what a hot lunch is, right?"
"Yeah, like salisbury steak, like taco tuesday."
"No, no, it's not like salisbury steak."
It's like a euphemism for a sexual term.
It's like when you're doing a chick and she takes a dump on you.
- No way.
- Yes way.Like a cleveland steamer.
- What's that?
- Same thing.
"Dude, I guess I'm never gonna go to cleveland."
I gotta take a piss.
"Sean, are you all right, dude?"
Yeah.
He don't look too good.
"You think I should, like, make him some tea or something?"
With a tremendously big sound... the ground started shaking.
Suzukichi was terrified.
He didn't move.
Staring... with wide eyes at the sky.
"After that, he was possessed by the eye."
He could see nothing else.
And he kept drawing that picture.
I can't forget that eye either.
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.
"The moon also glitters, but it's not frightening."
Moonlight is nice.
"Yes, it was on a night just like tonight... a strange thing happened..."
Stop it!
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.
I never told... you a scary story.
"When I was in the kitchen, I heard a feeble voice saying:"
"""Hello, hello. """
I heard a feeble voice.
I looked... and saw a strange boy poking his head in.
"He said, ""Your Suzukichi... """
Suzukichi again?
"""Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool..."
"""so I pulled him out..."
"""and carried him here."
"""I put him on the grass over there. """
This was what the little boy said.
He was a skinny little boy.
"And sure enough, he was soaking wet himself... with water still dripping from his hair."
I was so shocked.
I rushed out to see.
I saw...
Suzukichi lying there.
"Wilson, Cats, let's go."
Christo.
Yep.
"When the footage comes in, overlay it on the gris map."
"We get lucky, maybe we can trace Valera's escape route."
You got it.
All surveillance cam footage from the 900 block of Shortridge.
Thank you.
Any idea just how many cameras big brother's got pointed on downtown Atlanta?
"8,200, give or take."
Excellent.
I need this.
Make it happen.
I'll download the SANs and work it up.
Graham.
"Max Collins said he didn't know his mother was in town, right?"
Lab just ran prints lifted from Jessica's hotel suite.
We got a hit.
"Max, it's your fingerprints."
This isn't what you think.
What were you doing in your mother's hotel room?
She wanted to talk.
About what?
About Sara.
"Whether you guys were still happy, same as always."
"Since when do you two have an ""always"" kind of relationship?"
"What do you want me to say, Dad?"
"She was a crappy mom, but for the last six months, she's been trying to make up for it!"
She wants to be a part of my life!
Okay.
Do you have any idea where she is now?
No.
"Anyway, uh, Serena might be a little upset."
"Well, you were right."
She can stay in Charles' room.
It's getting crowded around here.
No kidding.
"Throw in your ex-husband,"
And now we're a Nancy Meyers movie.
I hope you don't mind.
I know it's awkward.
"Well, I mean, it is a little unusual, don't you think,"
For a doctor to move in to his patient's building?
"Well, not if he's the father of the patient's children."
What are you getting at?
Is it possible that...
Will's also trying to get close to you?
Absolutely not.
I'm the one that told William to stay away
If he couldn't make good
On the promises he made to the children.
And I'm sorry if this is uncomfortable for you.
"But if William wants to move in to be closer to the kids,"
I'm not gonna stand in his way.
Mmm.
Holland?
"Hi, it's Rufus."
Um...
I have a favor to ask.
...And the social scene at N.Y.U. Was criminal.
"Ten freshmen, a keg"
And a tub of hummus on a card table isn't a party.
It's a tragedy.
Hmm.
"[laughs] Yeah, you mean, whenever Seth would let me."
Bought you a souvenir.
"Aw, shucks."
It's everything I ever wanted.
"Everybody needs their Shangri-La, kid."
- You ever see that YouTube video?
- YouTube?
"- What, are you watching YouTube now?"
"- Yes, I am."
"And they got this one, shows this dog, he runs right out in traffic, right out in the middle of the freeway, cars and trucks comin' from every angle, just to save the other dog's life."
"Okay, YouTube is a masturbatory wormhole."
The point of the story is  he does whatever it takes to save his pal.
Like nothin' else in the world matters.
Nothin'.
Whatever happened to that Seth and Richie?
[phone vibrating]
"You know he's not going to answer, right?"
He knows you betrayed him.
"I'll talk some sense into him, all right?"
Show him we can all do this.
"You really think you can live happily ever after with him, don't you?"
I can sure as hell try.
[phone beeps]
- [Seth] Yeah.
- Seth?
!
Seth.
"- Hey, listen to me."
- It's okay.
I know why you did it.
Just meet me back at Uncle Eddie's.
"Okay, you got it."
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I changed my mind.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story is gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison?"
When your stupid bitch of a boyfriend turns on you?
They killed your aunt.
They almost killed Lydia.
Who do you really think is gonna be next?
"I don't trust anyone, including you!"
I know the rules ofthe game.
I'll keep my word.
Forget the rules.
I want him dead because he exposed his identity.
"I'm the boss now, and you'll do things my way."
"Okay, you kill him for me."
"Ifyou blow it, you're dead meat."
I paid you well enough.
"Eddie, this could be a lead."
"Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu, was cut down in Club Nine."
The killer was never caught... but he accidentally blinded a singer.
What was her name?
Jenny.
She hasn't recovered yet.
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.
He's no ordinary assassin.
I hope we'rejust looking for one man.
If I'm not mistaken... this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
"It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not."
He risked his life to save the little girl.
And if he did hurt the singer by accident... he's probably contacted her.
Ifwe meet again
We'll find out where we stand
But perhaps there will be no tomorrow
Only time will tell
-Jeffrey?
- I'm not Jeffrey.
I'm sorry.
I don't see too well.
I mistookyou for my friend.
How the hell could you think it's okay to sleep with a teenage girl?
!
I don't know what you think you've heard...
Are you calling my wife a liar?
You know damn well what I'm talking about.
"I'm giving you a dignified out, Wallace."
Take it.
"I have to make this official, sir."
Is that your wife?
Amanda McNeil?
I've got to get out of here.
I understand.
You don't understand a damn thing.
"Sir, Amanda's body surfaced in connection with Sara Collins disappearance, so I need to know where you were Tuesday night."
"Uh, fixing the irrigation in my orchard."
Did you have any company?
Yeah.
Peaches.
Does that count?
"Look, I don't have an alibi."
- Is that what you want to hear?
"- No, not really."
Look...
I've lost my wife...
I've lost my friends...
I've lost my city.
"Look, Agent Kelton, you do what you want."
I've had enough.
It must be quite a change to go from running a city to running an orchard.
Do you ship the peaches right after harvest?
Why?
I'm just wondering if you have a refrigeration system on your property.
I can see through... anything.
May I help you?
Where's Vanessa?
Vanessa?
What can she do for you that I can't do?
"I can do everything she do, honey, and a whole lot better."
"Walking around here, thinking she cute... showing them little pencil legs."
"Honey, I seen better legs on a pool table."
And another thing...
"Vanessa this, Vanessa that..."
talking about how cute she is.
I've seen something at the zoo cuter than she was.
"Come on, get in there with your half-dead self."
Thank you.
Let me tell you something.
Here's my phone number.
"Call me, sweetie."
"We can get together, have champagne at my house."
"The bubbly kind, you know?"
"And I got one of them little bikini nighties, you know?"
See-through.
"We now run the market in D.C., Baltimore... and Philadelphia."
"At the rate we're going, in three months... we'll be ready to make the move on New York... because if I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere."
Goldilocks.
"Hello, Mr. Byers."
How are you?
That's great.
The boat comes in tonight.
You brought me back something?
Nothing.
We're just about to have lunch.
Hey!

"His peers, his public."
They'd find out what kind of a husband he is.
Letting the great Gillian Booth rot away.
His vanity couldn't stand it.
"He'd, he'd... be shamed into action!"
"Yeah, as long as he was your husband, maybe."
I wonder what my partner is saying to him now.
What is she saying?
"Well, in that red file is a report of the search we did in your dressing room and the dental resin we found on the sink in your bathroom."
I think your husband's about to find out how he got that bite mark on his neck.
Please don't.
Stop her.
Don't let him see it.
Please stop her.
This should be interesting.
"Sneaky, pathetic bitch."
Frame me for murder.
How could she?
It was to blackmail you into a marriage.
I was duped.
- I want an annulment.
"- Yes, Philip."
File the papers today.
I'll call the movers.
I want her out of my home.
Every last trace of her.
I don't care if she dies in the gutter!
No!
"No, Philip!"
Don't say that!
"- He's leaving. / No, please."
"- Go talk to him, talk to him."
"You know, there's two kinds of doctors."
There's the kind that get rid of their feelings and the kind that hold on to them.
"If you're gonna hold on to your feelings, you're gonna get sick once in a while."
It's part of it.
"You know, people come in here and they're sick and they're bleeding sometimes they're dying and they need our help."
And helping them is more important than how we feel.
"Hell, I've been doing this eight years."
I still get sick.
Take another minute.
- Did he go up?
"- OMFS, ENT and Plastics all in."
Both carotids and IJ's intact.
He must have turned right when the blast hit him.
- Good.
- How's he doing?
"Oh, he'll be all right."
How are you?
Ask me tomorrow.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He might need some fluids soon.
No.
Morphine boluses of 10.
I heard you were gone.
"No, I'm still here."
Good.
You know I don't like nobody else helping me.
I know.
You've always treated me like a man.
Just try and relax.
What is that?
"That monitor's just a little sensitive, that's all."
You had a little trouble.
"- But don't get off on the wrong foot, huh?"
- I'm not getting off...
"- If you have any problems, come to me with 'em."
- Just keep him off my back.
- Just try and cool it with him.
- I will.
"If you have any problems, come to me."
I'll handle him.
- Do me a favor.
"- I'll be happy to work with him, believe me."
He's a good cop- basically a good cop.
- He's got good hunches every once in a while.
"- Fine, fine, fine."
- Give him a chance.
- Keep him off my back.

"You got your B.A. in Criminal Law,"
Master's in Criminology.
"Top of your class at the academy, excellent review by your Captain."
And you aced the Detective exam?
- How'd I get so lucky?
- Sir?
Why Internal Affairs?
And don't blow smoke up my ass.
You were the only department with an opening.
I'm flattered.
"Lina Flores, wanna meet your new partner, Abby Kowalski?"
Show her the ropes.
"Don't look so worried, I still have three more months."
Sorry--
My husband is a very big man.
Little Carlos takes after his papa.
You're having a boy.
- That's great.
"- Not really, I wanted a girl."
"Ladies, less chat, more work, eh?"
"Got you two off-duty officers, possible involvement in an altercation with several bar patrons."
Hazy way for a good cop to lose everything.
For sure.
- That's gross.
- It's gross.
Totally.
"Listen, I really do have to say that I never, ever thought I would fit in anywhere in that school, and I'm just so happy to have met you."
Christine?
What are you doing here?
"I'm having coffee with my new friend, Marly."
What in the hell are you doing here?
This is my house.
And your friend is my housekeeper.
"You did great out there today, man."
Your swing is really coming along.
I didn't hit the ball once.
"No, but the ball didn't hit you either, so we're doing better than last time, huh?"
"- Let's get washed up for dinner, slugger."
"- Thanks, Dad."
- You did great.
"- Thanks, Uncle Matthew."
"- I'm serious, you did great."
- Thanks.
Really great.
"I'm proud of you, pal."

[DOOR OPENS]
[SIGHS]
Bad day?
I made a new friend.
"I finally met someone at this school that I connect with, and she's Marly's maid."
A maid?
"Oh, dear."
And she has the audacity to hobnob with a wealthy industrialist like you?
- Don't say that.
"Without you, I would have no reason to live."
"But with you, I can handle anything."
I'll find Martina.
I'll get her to confess.
No matter what.
Have faith.
You'll see: we haven't lost yet.
"For the love of God, hurry up!"
I'm not risking my life for 20 Scudi.
I think I heard a woman scream.
- You hear women everywhere...
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.
"Well, I didn't hear anything, so let's go back to our quarters."
Let go of me.
"- If you scream, I'll kill you."
What did I do to you?
What do you want from me?
I know you told the judges that Beatrice paid you to let me into the castle...
Why?
It's not true.
You lied in court.
Who paid you?
"Tell me, or I'll strangle you."
"Shout if you want - you're the one they're looking for, not me."
You're finished.
All I have to do is call them.
You're right.
I'm finished.
"Thanks to you, they think I'm a murderer."
So it won't cost me anything to twist your neck!
Who paid you?
"75 $100 bills, one, two, 3,000 more, plus the $10,000 and the $5,000 makes $201,000 exactly."
The perfect embezzlement.
[chuckling]
"You may say that Rome wasn't built in a day, but neither was Fort Knox;"
neither was the treasure of the Incas.
"The undiscoverable acquisition of $201,000, bill by bill, month after month, year after year, is a financial feat worthy of Clem P. Sandover--"
C.P. Sandover.

"Yes indeed, if Croesus, Kreuger, Rockefeller could afford to brag a little, well, in due time, why not the perfect embezzler?"
I only make these notes because someday people may recognize the...

Oh.

- [exhales] - [phone ringing]
Hello?
Who?
Who?
"Oh, Mr. Sandover."
Listen-
"- Sally, listen to me."
You handle receipts-- incoming receipts.
I thought you were on a train somewhere.
"Look, I got home late and I do have a date tonight, so--"
"Sally, did we get any money today?"
Was any cash received in the office?
Cash?
Just the one loan deposit.
That wad?
"I mean, how much?"
How much was it?
"$45,000, but you already know about that."
Two aliens have orgasms.
They don't even have bodies.
Oh!
You're an alien in this country.
And I wouldn't certainly complain about your body.
Do sit down.
Well being a German alien and a scientist.
What do you think about German alien orgasms?
I want you now.
That's too good.
What's your hurry?
I'll do anything you want.
Do you want to hit me?
You are sick.
"Sure I'm baby, I've got so many problems with my brain it's a real pain in the ass."
"Ho, yeah."
"Look stop, I'm gonna come."
"Give it to me, baby, give it to me."
"come on , come on."
Suppose orgasms are killing people.
What would you say about a person who had multiple orgasms?
I would say this person is very sick.
And would you be interested into studying such a person?
Being a scientist?
And German alien?
Come on...
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
"I'm sorry, I can't stay, I must go with, she's in great danger."
I'm sorry.
Shit.
"Excuse me, do you know anybody here by the name of Adrian?"
"- You're crazy, you have an erection!"
- So?
Someone could come in.
I don't care-
"- Ricky, what is this?"
"Sorry, I can't control it."
I see you and I get a boner.
How can I talk to you when your thingie is pointing at me?
You don't have to look.
I won't have sex with you now.
Who asked you to?
And I'm not getting pregnant anymore.
Forget it.
Why do you have to punish yourself?
What are you guilty of?
- Did you ever count how many pregnancies I've lost?
- We've lost-
I don't remember you ever being pregnant.
"What is this, a suffering contest?"
You don't know what it's like to give birth to a dead child.
"Ricky, I'm not pretending."
I really don't want to adopt.
I don't want to be the one who poisons your soul.
You deserve Amuka.
You deserve sex in a sauna with a normal woman.
You deserve children.
I can't raise a child I'm not sure I'll be able to love.
What about me?
Please go home.
I'm not going.
Why don't you pick up?
- I thought it was...
It's just Insurance.
You weren't going to kill my men after all.
No.
"We weren't, we..."
"Shh, shh, shh, shh... (WHISPERING) Now I can choose not to kill you."
"So, shall we discuss where your transport is?"
Uh...
"How many people have you killed, rescuing me?"
I don't know.
"Less than I'll save, if I get that information."
That doesn't make it right.
It's still playing God.
Mmm...
"It's a doctor's prerogative, is it?"
Don't preach to me.
"(CRYING) No, I'm not."
I'm sorry.
I've spent my whole life trying to prove I was different from him.
Only to realize that I'm just the same.
I've killed people.
I killed my own fiance.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
It was my fault that we were abducted.
He hated the camps.
"He hated the danger, and I made him stay."
Because I wanted to save that boy's mother.
"But, I didn't save her."
She died anyway.
"So, they'd blame you too, would they?"
"They're dead now, and you'll never forgive yourself because neither would they?"
(SNIFFLING) They deserved to live.
Most of them listened to the chief and refused to go.
They killed the chief.
And did this as a reminder to anyone who resisted them.
How many of them were there?
And where did they go?

The last village that I visited they didn't kill the chief.
They tied him to a tree brought his teenage daughters out in front of him and disemboweled them.
Then 40 of them abused his wife.
And then they took a steel rod.
Broke every bone in her body.
Somewhere during the process she died.

"- Wait a minute, you're seeing someone?"
- Who is this?
"Dad, this is the reporter from Manhattan Monthly."
"- Ike, this is my dad."
- Whatever.
"Honey, look, what I don't understand is what you see in this guy Scott."
You deserve somebody better than that.
"Someone like, like... like you."
Excuse me.
I really need to ask you a question.
"No, no."
No more questions.
I need to talk to my daughter.
- Are you eligible or not?
- Answer that question.
"Dad, I really want to talk to you about this, but not in front of him."
"Could you give us, like, five minutes?"
Molly has muffins.
And she's very eligible.
"Yeah, she told me."
"Look, last night you said that nothing would make you happier than if I found the right guy."
And you think Scott's the right guy?
No.
I don't know.
It was just one motorcycle ride.
That's it?
A motorcycle ride and a kiss.
And a kiss?
That's not what Johnson saw at the party.
"Yeah, believe it or not, he cracked."
"The point is, it's not serious."
"Like, Scott's going on a blind date tonight, with someone else."
I couldn't stop.
"I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move."
And then I guess itjust... took off..
"That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words."
"You didn't see it, did you?"
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
Now they're mostly.
"These creaking, howling sounds."
They all like this?
"Well, once it was a man talking really fast."
What'd he say?
I couldn't make it out.
Some foreign language.
Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
It's not a question of believing them.
"Like I said, they're honest people."
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
"Shucks, no."
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schooling' and stuff.
"All right, all right."
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
I thought about my wife with a slime like you.
"- All right, buster..."
- Stay out of this.
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.
But why not?
He was trying to kill you.
I'm a witness.
Shut up and listen.
Connie will take care of it.
You just go home.
Do whatever it is you'd normally do.
Just act as if nothing happened.
"When he doesn't come home tonight, call his brother, ask him where he is."
"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
He said he'd do it yesterday!
"Every hour he puts it off, there are more things that can go wrong!"
"Every hour he puts it off, there are more things that can go wrong!"
Mackay always goes to the pub on a Friday night.
When he comes out...
Mackay always goes to the pub on a Friday night.
When he comes out... (SPEAKS ITALIAN) Get an alibi for Friday night.
(SPEAKS ITALIAN) Get an alibi for Friday night.
Can't it wait till tomorrow?
Can't it wait till tomorrow?
Told the customer she could have it tonight.
Told the customer she could have it tonight.
Oh.
Oh.
"Well, it's cutting into good drinking time."
"Well, it's cutting into good drinking time."
Yeah.
Just...watch the legs.
Yeah.
Just...watch the legs.
"Oh, bugger it."
"I'll call the lady, tell her we'll deliver it tomorrow."
"Oh, bugger it."
"I'll call the lady, tell her we'll deliver it tomorrow."
"That's why I like working for you, Don."
"That's why I like working for you, Don."
You're corruptible.
(LAUGHS)
You're corruptible.
(LAUGHS)
"When it comes to beer, I am."
"When it comes to beer, I am."
- Huh?
You about ready to take the wheel up here?
- Learn the how-tos of driving?
- Huh?
"I mean, you had your learner's permit about seven years, bud."
I'll just do that later.
"Hey, come on."
Changing subjects.
Who wants some waffles and ice cream?
"Oh, I know I do."
"But I'll take my ice cream first, because real men eat dessert first."
Dessert first!
All:
Dessert first!
Dessert first!
Dessert first!
Did you quit work?
Why would I quit?
You're not going to work?
I don't work on Sundays.
"It's Monday, not Sunday."
Do you have two Sundays on your calendar?
"Yesterday was the last day of your break, Sunday!"
What's wrong with you?
Is it a side effect from your painkillers?
Stop taking them.
Stop taking them and go to the hospital.
Isn't it Sunday?
You were complaining about how your break was ending.
You were so fixated on that that you didn't even know the day had passed.
"It's way past seven, you're already late."
"If it was me, I'd fire any employee who was late on the first day after their break."
Yes.
"Now, I must warn you, the retrovirus is still experimental."
"In fact, it's only been tested on cell cultures in a laboratory, and so far, without much success."
I'm hoping that what we can learn from your daughter will help me perfect it.
We've got a problem.
Why didn't you just radio me?
"Yeah, well, I could've, but... this way."
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.
"If they find Ellia, they'll kill her."
"Sheppard, this is McKay."
"What is it, Rodney?"
"The villagers are on the move, and it doesn't look like they're going to a picnic."
Are they heading for the caves?
"Not at the moment, no."
All right.
Get back there and sit tight.
"We're losing time, guys."
Ellia?
Ellia?
She's not here.
Good Lord.
What?
She took the retrovirus.
You said it wasn't ready.
"It's not, not by a long shot."
What'll it do to her?
To be honest I have no idea
colonel Sheppard come in.
Go ahead.
We've got another problem.
"Ellia's gone, and she's injected herself with the retrovirus."
Why would she do that?
It's the closest any of us actually ever came.
Yeah.
"Jamie wasn't really spawned by Satan, was he?"
No.
"If he was, we'd have a way better house."
"You're the one, Jamie."
Show me the way!
There's a lot of things I can handle.
A lot of things I've managed to survive.
I'd even say I've thrived where others would have just thrown in the towel.
"Yes, honey, you certainly have."
"Now relax, and let the bubbles do their work."
Soothing.
- Sooth...
"- Dad, we finish..."
I told you to stay the hell away from this bathroom until I said so!
This is a child-free zone until further notice!
Soothing... soothing...
"You know what, Hal?"
I'm done.
I give up.
What are you talking about?
Jamie wins.
He beat me.
"All those years, all those terrible things those kids have done."
"It doesn't make me stronger, it's just worn me down."
"Like termites eating away at a house, until all that's holding up is paint."
"I'm just paint, Hal."
Jamie knows it.
You'll do a better job than I can.
I trust you.
"No, no, no."
-No longer with us.
Is a better place next to the ...
Carmen.
"Carmen, wait!"
"I do not want to dip your feet, my love."
I'm not your love.
"See, what I said Carmen it will leave only one stick."
"Get out, I'm just Carmen."
"Ramon, it's unbelievable, everyone came."
"Least the guy who stayed behind, it was cold."
He is not here.
You're a great friend.
"Thank you, friend."
"Do not look at me, had nothing to do."
"So, it was love, thank you."
He thanked the penguin wrong.
"Hello, how are you?"
-I knew.
Small-Erik health.
"Well, all friends present and assembled we will not rest until they are all fat."
That's right.
The funniest sound I've heard
I could not understand a single word  isnowspreading throughout the land
I still can not understand
Isaidandthenpartner what is the name  notdareto tellme the same thing
yourownmusic I can not understand
But has a sound that makes me dance like crazy
"I bring a lot of fish, my courtesy."
"Shows how to do it, brother."
Who is that guy?
"Call him the insect, he's fantastic."
Let me repeat I told you before ...
We'll trap him.
- I'm going down there.
- I'll go with you.
"Garcia, have Detroit PD set up roadblocks."
[Garcia] Got it.
Chris Edwards is a husband.
He's a father.
He's a general contractor.
[Morgan] Check any subcontractors who've worked with him.
"Okay, that is a humungous list."
What do you want me to do with it?
Anything that requires flames...
"plumbers, electricians, welders."
Did he fire a welder recently?
Okay.
"Uh, he's been using Vinnie's Welding and Fence, but he hasn't hired them back in months."
List of employees coming up.
- It's still a lofty handful.
- [Prentiss] Okay.
We think he's been following the investigation.
Look at volunteers with Detroit's Finest.
"Okay, I'm crossing employees with volunteers."
- Nothing.
"- Come on, baby girl, keep checking."
- There's gotta be a connection here.
"- Okay, I'm gonna long-shot it, and I'm gonna cross the Michigan business directory with the payroll company and see if I still got what it takes to find stuff."
And I do.
His name's Kaman Scott.
- [Morgan] You got an address?
- I'm working on that.
Kaman...
"Kaman, come on, man."
"Office...""Future  Wellness""."
Apartment... 12.
Don't fret.
It won't be bleeding for long.
Now it's a habit!
"Well, kick it!"
"""Future  Wellness""."
"With what they'll get from us, they'll qualify for a new plaque: ""Past  Flabby Cankers""!"
Hit it.
Big time.
"My half brother, Léo, Mickey."
Edgard Venom.
"What does he poison, this Venom?"
He's the fat pussy with a small...
I can't see his full livery.
He heads the Office of Buildings and Investments.
He's investing in me.
He's pumping shit into your veins.
They all screw you 'cause you believe in the system.
All that's in vain 'cause you don't have taste.
Do you get off on family affairs?
You unhealthy paranoid.
I want the recipe!
It's too complex.
You wouldn't get your head round it.
Around what?
That you and your Venom brothers swap guided missiles for Afghan dope?
Dope which you blow up in the street?
Laundering fallout through Buildings and Investments to get clean books?
"As for official stamps, we've got Mr André at the Ministry."
And where is Simon Venom in all of this?
Simon's untouchable.
"- l'm on your side, I swear."
I'm gonna tell you as soon as I can.
It's in the best interest of your case if we can cooperate.
I need to know what you're trying to do.
We're trying to do what we always try to do... put bad guys in jail.
including my ex-husband?
"I have no idea, and that's the truth."
And if I don't cooperate?
"Well, I'll get anxious and depressed, start offering you jobs down here or something or vacation property."
Just kidding.
"To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'd do if you don't cooperate."
[knock on door]
- Hey.
"- Hey, sweetie."
I'll be back down in a second.
She... she ate.
Good.
How much?
Enough.
So how's it going?
You're asking me that?
Sorry.
What?
- What what?
- l'm asking you.
"Well, I don't understand."
You're... you're asking me what?
I don't know what I'm asking you.
"Rick, we really can't talk about this."
"Karen, Karen, I know something's happening."
"If you know what it is, I think you have a responsibility to tell me."
Excuse me.
"I'm a kind fairy, come to help you."
"Ooops, isn't this fun!"
We don't need any help.
As you like.
But I know what bothers you.
Maybe I know how to make Elisa more respectful.
"Don't be scared, silly, am I a spook or what?"
!
"Definitely not, dear lady."
You can look me up in the caves under the old castle.
But come alone!
Leave this type at home.
- Can I have another slide?
-No.
- What a bold-faced hussy.
-A witch!
"Wait here, I'm going on alone."
"And leave me here, in the wilderness?"
I'll die of terror!
"If I don't return, carve on my gravestone -"
For his passionate love hath he died a dreadful death.
"Goodbye, good servant."
The wine.
"Oh, horrors!"
"High time, your Grace."
"So Elisa doesn't want you, and you a Duke?"
She might want you if you looked like Henry.
A young helper come to serve at the mill?
"Young, you said?"
I'll give you the likeness of your choice.
- How can I repay you?
"- I don't want anything, but if you don't win Elisa within three full moons, the magic'll wane."
I have some questions to ask him.
That's none of my business.
Ifthe guy you're talking about is my friend... he sure doesn't need your help.
"Starting now, you're offthe Weng case."
Inspector Chan will take over.
You're getting another case.
- What's the reason?
- I don't trust you.
Siding with the suspect is not the way to catch him.
"Sir, you don't understand how I work."
You said it!
That's why you're offthe case.
I won't give up the investigation.
Bullshit!
"Chang, you'll be Chan's assistant."
"Yes, sir."
Release the man you just arrested.
Give him 24-hour surveillance.
He'll lead us to Weng's assassin.
- Have you got that?
"- Yes, sir."
Will you kill again?
I thought the people I killed deserved to die.
Now I believe everybody has the right to live.
"No, I won't kill again."
I hope I can keep my promise.
I've been followed.
"Weng's men, and the cops too."
"Don't worry, I lost them."
Weng hired Paul Yau to waste you.
"Don't worry, you can use my guns and ammo."
- Where are you going?
We were horsing around.
"No, we weren't."
Ahem.
What do you want from this vortex deal?
My company is in debt for 2 million.
"I've borrowed against the house, and my equity line is under water."
So what do you need from the deal?
At least $2.5 million.
"I need 2 to take care of the debt, and that would leave me with $500,000 for Jeremy."
For Jeremy?
I have cancer.
I'm scheduled to go to the hospital at the end of the week.
I'd like this closed by then.
"Oh, God."
I'm...
"I'm sorry, Liz."
I-- melanoma.
They think it might be heading for my lymph nodes.
So what are they gonna do for it?
I'm gonna have surgery.
They're gonna cut it out.
"I'll do radiation and chemo, and that will be that."
"It's not a big deal, Burton."
"They'll operate, they'll take it out, and that will be that."
"Well, what about Jeremy, does he know about this?"
Not yet.
[Front door opens] When you gonna tell him?
Ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
"We'll talk tomorrow, ok?"
Yeah.
Good night.
- Yeah. you always told Frankie and me that a man is measured by the strength of his enemies.
But you're wrong.
A man is measured by the strength of the love others have for him.
I hope one day you and I can put away the pain and actually talk to each other. your son Brandon.
You're not gonna fucking believe this shit.
the prodigal son returns.
kid.
I take it you got me something.
Not exactly.
Exactly what then?
A business proposal.
Unless this conversation you ain't walking out of here.
Just hear me out.
Sit. plus a whole lot more?
I'm listening.
here's the deal...
Give me a call when you're ready to make some money.
do you?
Why not?
He's as greedy as his brother Frankie was.
follow him.
And another thing-- see if anybody heard anything.
book the fight.
l want to go as far away as possible.
Yeah?
Where would you want to go?
as long as it's sunny and there's water and there's really nice beaches.
We can always take a ride up the West Coast.
Yeah?
That would be amazing.
Hey.
good.
"They're called ""roving bugs""."
It's a technique used to remotely activate a phone's mic and eavesdrop on the owner.
The FBI's been doing it for years.
Did one of the Seleção do this?
Dunno.
Micchon?
Any luck?
Got it!
"It's from No. 01. ""Request MPD to investigate Eden of the East."
What?
!
What does he want with Eden?
Takizawa-kun?
What's wrong?
Thought I bailed on you?
You had this poster in your other movie theater too.
Somehow it seems like they're linked to my movie-related memories.
What now?
It'll take some time for your friends to wire money.
I've got enough cash for us to take the Chinatown bus.
You wanna wander around the city for a while?
But-
I think I might've lived around here when I was a kid.
And I'm curious about that room...
Maybe I can find some proof before my past disappears forever.
"didn't you say ""it doesn't have a golden ring""?"
Did you mean...
This is Juiz.
Hey babe.
Something really neat's about to happen.
Do tell.
The son of the hardline party's leader is the culprit behind the missile attacks.
"Oh, my God, dude, I got out of there like I had a fucking map."
How about a little bit of consideration for a dying woman?
"Oh, I'm not dying."
I'm just here for some tests.
"Okay, pipe down."
"Wait, where's Pierce?"
"Wait, where's Amy?"
"No, no, no, no!"
"No, no."
- That's Amy.
- Shit!
"- Oh, my..."
"- Yeah, what a shame."
We should use this finger to wipe your tears.
Whoa.
"No, no, no, no."
"Dan, get out of my car."
Do you think I want to be in this fucking Minecraft piece of shit?
I am an emissary of the president and I demand that you get out of my car.
You colossal fucking fanny pack.
"You don't get it, do you?"
They only sent you 'cause they knew that you would fuck it up.
"You're so stupid, you don't even know that you're being used for your stupidity."
"That's bullshit, Dan."
I can tell from your eyes and because it's fucking bullshit.
Where's Richard?
"- This isn't fucking over, Egan."
"- Just get in and drive, bitch."
- Okay.
Shit.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- It's just a glitch.
(SIGHING)
Gaston has escaped the Bastille.
And the King and Aramis have not returned from the Mausoleum.
This is not a coincidence.
ATHOS:
We ride for Saint-Denis.
(GRUNTS)
And I would apologise for the surroundings.
"But I imagine, as a soldier and a priest, you are well acquainted with death."
More than I'd have wished.
"Yes, I too am acquainted with death more than I'd have wished."
Death has a grip on me.
One I cannot break.
I am so sorry.
I don't want your sympathy.
That's not why you're here.
"But there is something I need from you, Aramis."
"Without it, I will not find peace."
"A truth I need to hear from your mouth, and don't lie."
You and my wife may think I'm a fool but I am not a fool.
I know.
Say it.
It will serve... no purpose.
You are a musketeer.
You only exist to serve my purpose.
I am ordering you!
Why dredge up the past?
Admit!
Admit you slept with the Queen!
I slept with the loneliest woman in Paris.
Don't you dare make excuses!
This woman suffered years of neglect and betrayal from your part.
- Good and you?
- Not so bad.
Can we talk?
- Okay.
"- ""Talk."""
In your truck.
Okay.
Now that was just right.
(EXHALES)
"So how did you make out, super chief?"
Did you find the missing Goldi-link?
You falling' in Goldi-love?
"It's better to Goldi-let this go, before I Goldi-lose my shit."
"Oh, take your drink, you Goldi-lush."
Tread Goldi-lightly.
"So, that's no toe-curlin' then?"
It's impolite to kiss and tell.
Nothin' wrong with a little stank on the hang down.
Nothin' wrong with a little takesin' out in the trades.
A little hizzin' in the skizzins.
"No, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little goin' to the bone yard, I know that."
Nothin' wrong with a little bacon makin'.
Nothin' wrong with a little shot twixt winds and waters.
A little building the blanket monster.
I know there's nothin' wrong with a little pituitary poke.
- I know that.
- Nothin' wrong with a little making' the beast with two backs.
Makin' feet for children's stocking's.
Testing the tube steak.
"Look, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little crawl up the skin slide."
- I know that.
"- Nothin' wrong with a little,"
That I am valuable.
That I matter.
And that I deserve to know everything I can about this world that you send me into every day so at least I have a fighting chance.
"You know, in spite of everything..."
"In spite of everything, I like you."
I think you're great.
And I want you to think the same of me.
I screwed up.
"Honey, my key's not working."
Where's him?
Him's not here.
- What room you looking for?
- My room.
Who are you?
You're cute.
And you're faking it.
You never con a con artist.
You had your chance to walk away.
You won't get another.
- Pete with you?
"- No, listen."
I'm a bit busy.
- Can I call you back?
"- Yeah, no, sure."
Everything okay?
It will be as soon as I can get back to work.
I got some bad news.
Leena tells me that your ferret escaped and she's tried to call for it.
She doesn't know its name.
"I don't even know if you finally did name that thing, did you?"
"No, actually, I never did."
Put some food out and it'll come back.
"Sid, what can I tell you?"
You know how I...
"How I felt about Claire, huh?"
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"We're ready, Mr. Fowler!"
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
Whoops!
We're hooked.
I'm terribly sorry to have this happen at such a tense moment.
"Mr. Fowler, we're ready!"
"I said, I'll be there."
"I'd better watch this, Lieutenant."
Do you mind?
SID:
"What's the story, huh?"
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"We're running a little late, Sidney."
"Let's move it, huh?"
"Lieutenant, what about this robber?"
Do you have any leads?
"Well, sir..."
"The truth is, it seems to be a little bit more complicated than a robbery, sir."
Oh?
What the Lieutenant is saying is that he's come to the conclusion that Claire may have been murdered and the robbery may be a cover-up.
Murdered?
That's insane.
"Don't you think you should have come to me first with this, Lieutenant?"
"Well, I tried to, sir."
I've been looking for you ever since last night.
I was with my lawyer last night.
"We meet for chess once or twice a month, and last night turned out to be a marathon session."
"Oh, yeah?"
I am gonna punch a hole through your face.
I'd like to see you try that.
Yeah?
"- Ooh, you're gonna die!"
"- Oh, I am gonna rip your face off..."
- You're gonna die!
"- Make a shirt out of it, and I'm gonna wear it."
"I'm gonna take one second to take my shirt off, and then you're gonna die!"
What the...
"Hey, listen, lady."
"You wanna beat up on your little boyfriend, you go do it somewhere else."
Watch the car.
"- Dude, where the hell is your fighter?"
- He'll be here.
- He'll be here when?
- Soon!
"- Okay, you have five minutes to put a fighter in that ring."
- Okay.
Just got off the phone with Charlie.
"- Well, where is he?"
- He's in jail with Dee.
- What?
- Apparently they got all hopped up on amphetamines... and beat the shit out of some guy in front of the bar.
- Amphetamines?
"- Yeah, like, steroids or something."
I don't know.
"- Damn it, Charlie."
- Look at the dude he was supposed to fight.
- He's the scrawniest...
- I know!
Charlie would have killed that guy.
Let's see what else you could have got.
"A sidecar - cognac, Cointreau lemon juice, sugar, syrup."
And you could also found Negroni.
Don't think I've ever heard of it.
"Gin, red vermouth, Campari, garnished with an orange peel?"
I bet you could do with one now?
LAUGHTER
"So, at the end of that, you had one point, that's taken you to seven."
The Lutrophiles are on 11.
In round three you're faced with a super-hive.
"You're looking for a number of answers that fit a certain category, but your challenge is to use every letter to find one, perfect solution."
"Team Lutrophiles, we're kicking off with you."
"Would you like the A hive, or the B hive?"
I think go we'll choose the A hive.
You're choosing the A hive.
You are looking for...
"You have two minutes, reveal the hive."
So...
You've got...
Cowdrey's maybe somewhere?
"Yep, yep, yep."
"So, who've we got?"
Gower.
"Hang on, you've got Brearley."
Gower...
That's clashing with Brearley.
Put the other Y for Cowdrey.
"Oh, OK."
Put the other Y.
There we are.
And then put Brearley round it.
Right.
DuBois.
DuBois.
It's a French name.
"It means ""woods,"" and blanche means ""white""  so the two together mean ""white woods""  like an orchard in spring."
You can remember it by that if you care to.
"You are stella's sister, are you not?"
Yes.
stella is my precious little sister.
I call her little in spite of the fact that she's somewhat older than I am.
"Oh, just slightly."
Less than a year.
will you do something for me?
Sure.
"Yes, what?"
I bought this adorable little paper lantern at a Chinese shop on Bourbon.
Put it over the light bulb.
"will you, please?"
I'd be glad to.
I can't stand a naked light bulb any more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action.
"well, I guess we strike you as being a pretty rough bunch."
I'm very adaptable to circumstances.
"well, that's a good way to be."
-You're not--?
-Married?
"Oh, no."
"No, I'm an old maid schoolteacher."
"You may be a schoolteacher, but you're certainly not an old maid."
"Why, thank you, sir."
I appreciate your gallantry.
So you're in the teaching profession.
Yes.
-Yes.
"Oh, you Jews are so Old Testament."
I did my job.
How are things?
"Barney and I are still under the same roof, if that's what you mean."
"He does the dishes, I sort the socks and ironing, we don't talk."
So all back to normal.
"As in, you mean, are you off the hook?"
"No, I didn't mean that."
(Quiet knock on door)
Just a sec.
Wendy rang.
"Something about a meeting with John Bartrop, which typically you didn't share with me."
I don't know any John Bartrop.
Who is John Bartrop?
You were apparently due at Fuzz's school an hour ago.
"Oh, shit."
That John Bartrop.
Sorry.
"Um, Red, can we talk later?"
Why?
"He is a beautiful student, an absolute pleasure to teach."
"You don't have to sugar coat this for me, you know."
I mean every word of it.
"The other teachers' comments have ranged from,"
'Is everything alright at home' to 'Have doctors mentioned medication?
'
"(Laughs) Well, Finnegan has issues."
His attention span isn't enormous but he's so engaging and clever.
Wow.
"Well, he does like your classes."
English is the only subject he seems to study.
He expresses himself beautifully.
But you have to tell her.
You owe her and you owe me.
She doesn't give a shit.
You are so infuriating.
Is that the language you use in this house?
I just think that it would be good if you told her.
"If you don't, I will."
I'm going to see what's going on.
We thought he was dead.
- We didn't think he existed.
- You're still lying.
"No, I'm not lying."
Jørgen tried to find him in India lots of times.
He never reacted and so we assumed that he wasn't...
"- I don't have time for this, Mom."
"- Jacob was a big, immature child!"
He fucked everything with a pulse.
He was drinking himself to death.
He did drugs.
"He had grand ideas, but did nothing."
"He probably means well, but you can't trust him."
"- He wants to save everyone, but..."
- I don't care if he's fucked a goat.
I have a right to know who my father is.
- You can't manipulate people like that.
- We're not.
Fuck off and leave us alone!
Not right now.
You're far out.
What's Jørgen's reaction?
Anna?
- Should I come along?
- Haven't you heard about Selena Cross?
"- No, why?"
"She killed her stepfather, Lucas."
"Her trial starts in two days, for murder."
"Lucas was always a bad joe, but she seemed to be able to put up with him."
Who ever knows what anyone's able to put up with?
"Well, that's true."
Sure took me a long time to know about myself and understand Peyton Place.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
I'm gonna go back and try and work things out with my mother.
Maybe we'll both be happier.
"If not, well, at least I've made the effort, you know?"
I always wondered why you enlisted.
"In the paratroopers, I mean."
I guess I wanted to get knocked off or something.
But as soon as I got away from my mother I realized how wonderful life really was.
Then I fought like a tiger to stay alive.
I was running away from my problems.
You know what I mean.
"Yeah, I know."
"Something's bothering you, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Can I help?
"No, you can't."
- Okay.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
All right.
"Hey, have you had dinner?"
"Would you like dinner, with me?"
- Okay.
- Okay?
"And this, a photo he had on him."
It's from 1940.
1940.
Everything's leading us to the same year.
Alright.
"Have Amelia and her team visit him in the hospital, immediately."
"Time travel with a shrimp allergy, now that is risky."
I don't know what you're talking about.
About this.
"We're pressed for time, so you can confess everything now."
"Relax, Alonso."
Tell us how you arrived here from 1940.
"I'm sick, not crazy."
Time travel can't be done.
"Yes, yes it can."
"We do it, as a matter of fact."
So I'm sure that you aren't crazy.
"But if you don't work with us, we can lock you up in an asylum for life."
Are you sure this will work?
I've synchronized the frequency with my phone.
We'll hear everything that Himmler says from his room.
I don't hear anything.
They haven't gotten back from the bull fight.
Here they are.
(HIMMLER) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
What did he say?
"-""What a disgusting spectacle""."
"""Gallito is a fucking murderer""."
Whereas they have Auschwitz... now that's a show for the whole family.
Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
- Ha ha ha!
"What, did he hop the gate?"
You came!
- I said I'd come.
"- I know, but you came!"
How could I miss it?
"Manny, the first member of my family"
- to ever graduate from high school.
- Wait a minute.
Don't you have a brother in Colombia
- who's a doctor?
- Yes.
"He just does orthopedic surgery, no brain or heart."
"Think of it... tomorrow,"
"I will watch you stride across the stage with a sash, like a rebel's bandolier telling the world ""No absents, no tardies."""
"Manny and I were gonna grill some steaks and drink some, um, beers."
"Thank you, Jay, but if it's all right with you,"
I would like to take Manny out for a special father-son celebration.
- Is that okay?
"- Ah, sure."
"I mean, he... made the effort to come."
Didn't have time to button his shirt all the way up.
But... go ahead.
Perfect!
The night begins.
But first... here.
(spritzing)
Walk through this.
(chuckles)
"I know that smells terrible, but I've never seen that man get a mosquito bite."
(singsong voice) There he is... the graduate.
"I have one word for you, Luke... plastics."
- So the Starling sisters lied?
What difference does it really make?
"For God's sake, of course it makes a difference."
It's not the truth.
"The truth is, they stole a boat from a man who terrified them and set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war."
- They never got there.
- Because their engine failed.
"Now, there's a truth we won't be telling."
"Morale-sapping, apparently."
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?
We're saying this is based on a true story.
Then don't.
"Oh, Christ above, man, you're supposed to be the propagandist!"
700 ships went to Dunkirk.
"338,000 men came back."
Don't say it's based on a true story.
Say it's based on 100 true stories.
- A thousand.
"- 338,000."
"Dunkirk, the biggest retreat in military history, or the miracle that put the fire back in all our bellies?"
"Very well, carry on as you were."
I have a car waiting.
You won't regret it.
"Thank you, Mr. Swain."
Buckley!
Buckley!
Sit.
Sit.
I don't care that you lied.
I care that you lied to us.
There wasn't enough money.
Your husband?
Why?
He did not know about the work or the boys.
Boys?
There were others.
"For the last time, where is the money?"
"There is 2,000 in the almirah, take it and leave!"
Next time you come my husband will be waiting for you!
I haven't come for a handout!
I want money that is rightfully mine!
So go and ask the one who has taken it.
Ask whom?
Your husband?
He earns more in a day than you have managed in all these months!
Go and ask your friend!
The scoundrel even looked like a thief.
Don't lie.
Why do you lie?
Did you learn anything from me in all these months?
Apart from sex!
"Our work can start again, leave now..."
Think of your sisters.
I am never sinking back into your filth again!
I want my money and I want it now!
"Sarika, open the door."
Did you foresee this while you were planning your break in?
Sarika!
Open the door!
I know there is someone inside!
Open up!
Open up or I will cal in the neighbors!
Today the whole world will see your true colors... I will rub your face in dirt.
- Isn't that true?
"- Yes, it's-- it's correct, but I-"
- I'm deeply...ashamed.
"So you get angry, and you take revenge."
That's what you do.
"You did it to a woman that you loved, and now you're doing it to the company that fired you."
- That's not a question.
- No.
Here's the question.
"Yes or no, the model on the blueprints that you were just talking about, did any of them have the Borns Tech name or any identifying markings on them?"
"Not that I know of, no."
They could have been made by anybody.
"I mean, for all we know, they could be Ryan Larson's design."
"I mean, yes, but that-- that wouldn't be feasible."
Yes.
I suppose so.
Nothing further.
[street noises]
[footsteps]
Hi.
I went by your office.
"I saw your stuff was still there, so I figured you might have come up here."
Clever of me.
Here.
It's liberating to do the wrong thing sometimes.
Most of the time.
What generation of feminism are we up to now?
Fifth wave?
Or sixth?
I don't-
- I've lost count.
I do know that it is still... really hard.
I don't see why.
Huh!
"What, you -- spend money?"
"Granville, I am t--talking about advertising."
You keep on about s--spending money.
I wish you'd w--watch your language!
"I may be old--fashioned, but I hate to hear young people t--talking loosely."
I haven't brought you up to be promiscuous over m--money.
-
"- True, I'll give you that."
-
- You've lacked for nothing.
That's right.
That's one thing I haven't lacked -- nothing!
I've had plenty of that!
You've always had good food and healthy exercise.
I know.
But what about boring?
It's often been boring.
"Well, I should hope so."
But look what it's d--done for your complexion!
-
"- You've got wonderful skin, our Granville."
-
"- I haven't done a lot with it, though."
Skin like that is entirely due to good old--fashioned English b--boredom.
"We used to be famous for it, a while back, all over Europe."
"""There go the English,"" they used to say. ""Aren't they boring?"""
"Mind you, we were always r--respected for it."
"Yes, but the world's changed."
And d--don't they know it.
Look what they get now abroad.
"That equipment will bring back anyone for a while, but long term..."
It was my fault.
"I am responsible for what happened to Clara, she was in my care!"
What is the point of blaming yourself?
None.
Because she's going to live.
Hello.
"They all think I'm going to die, don't they?"
And I know you're going to live.
How?
I never know how.
I just know who.
The green lady... she said you were the saver of worlds once.
Are you going to save this one?
"If I do, will you come away with me?"
Yes.
Well then.
Merry Christmas.
I have in my hand a piece of the Ice Lady.
Everything you need to know about how to make ice people.
Is that what you want?
See you at the office.
"So then, Doctor, saving the world again?"
Might I ask why?
Are you making a bargain with the universe?
You'll save the world to let her live?
Yes!
"And don't you think, after all this time and everything I've ever done, I'm owed this one?"
I don't think the universe makes bargains.
It was my fault.
Well then.
Better save the world.
I knew you could do it!
Mr. Fuzzles!
"Thank you, Francis."
You can go now.
What?
What is it?
We've got something for you.
Dewey and I finally came up with something good enough for that insane voice in your head.
"-Here, put this on first."
-Roman candles?
"Well, that's how they started off."
We decided to give 'em a little more... oomph.
Do you care if you keep your eyebrows?
"-Hell, no!"
"Okay, the fuse is timed for 20 seconds."
"You're gonna light it, and then get up on the board and jump."
The rockets should kick in around there.
"They won't give you any momentum, but they will ignite that."
"Hopefully, you will land in that kiddie pool."
We think that's got a 50-50 shot of putting you out.
If the roof doesn't collapse.
Or ignite.
And it's all gonna be caught on that video camera.
This is more than anything I could have ever asked for.
Nobody deserves it more than you.
Should I get the hose?
Not yet.
He would've wanted us to wait.
Good boy.
You finished all your peas!
"Hey, slugger."
Guess what.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.
I'm not alone anymore.
That isn't a problem now.
I hope my question didn't annoy you.
"No, no, not at all."
- Was her father here?
- Yes.
- He asked me if I was a faggot.
- You're kidding!
"Well, he used the American expression, it's more subtle."
- What was my orientation?
- What did you say?
- That I'm into men.
- Really?
"No, silly, I lied to him."
How dare he ask me if I like men or women?
- Who cares?
"- Well, I'm glad to know."
Did he ask the head nurse if she's a dyke?
Did he ask you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
"No, you're right."
You don't ask things like that.
"I may have to travel, so I can't come and see you every week."
"But, in Geneva, they've offered me a creation, a choreography, and that thrills me,"
I've got an old idea for a ballet.
"It's called ""Trenches."""
It's about World War I.
Problem.
"You need lots of male dancers because in the war, sorry, there are lots of soldiers."
But in Geneva everyone dances.
It's wonderful.
He would forget to lock the case to the expensive watches.
Neal...
I resisted twice.
"The third time, this guy's asking to get took."
So I...
I grabbed a couple cases of watches and I hopped on a train to Portland.
The store's got insurance.
"Anyway, I stashed 'em in a locker at the train station."
They're still there.
It's hardly stealing.
So you got away clean.
I didn't get away clean.
"The manager may have been a drunk, but the security cameras are stone sober."
"I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't."
I'm sorry.
Tallahassee's out.
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
"If I get caught, and you're with me,"
- you're in trouble...
- You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that?
You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake I.D.s and passports.
Those cost money.
We have a stolen car.
We make it legit.
We take a V.I.N. number off of another car.
"Emma, I'm not gonna have you in the seat next to me"
- guinea-pig pie.
- Smells good.
You just accept that?
It's pecan.
How cuckoo do you think my country is?
It's come to this...
"""What's cooking"" and ""smells good"""
gets me in trouble?
"Mom, you're already cooking for tomorrow?"
Don't make a big deal.
My baby's graduating.
He won the award for Integrity and Character.
"""No absents, no tardies,"
"""respectful to students and teachers alike."""
"My school had an award like that, but instead of a sash, that kid got a punch in the mouth."
"Proud of you, though."
"Why do all your stories involve a punch in the face, a shifty European, or a broad who's been around the block?"
That reminds me of when I had to rough up this Italian kid because he didn't want me dating his sister.
She was no nun!
"Jay, can you please take care of the steaks?"
Sure.
"On the eve of your big day, we're celebrating with rib eyes, and you and I are gonna have our first scotch."
- Really?
!
- Yeah.
I've been waiting to open a special bottle.
Huh.
Looks like the mice got into it.
"Hello, hello?"
!
Where's my son?
- Dad!
"I know I'm new here, but aren't dinosaurs extincted?"
- This one's about to be.
"- Heatwave, wait!"
"Look, if anyone sees you taking down that dino on your own, there goes your cover and your mission."
It's attracted to the light!
"Chase, take your lights!"
That got us attention.
Now what?
We need to lure him somewhere with no people around.
"Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue!"
He's following but we still gonna need an assist.
I'm comm-link to Chief in.
Rescue headquarters.
Go ahead.
"Dad, OK, first, don't worry I'm with the Rescue Bots!"
What?
Who gave you permission to...
They did it.
I mean...
"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this but the Rescue Bots aren't robots, they're from another planet, they're aliens!"
How long have you known?
"Wait, you know?"
"Cody, where are you?"
"Chief Burns, if I may, we're headed westbound to Lake Street with the dinosaur in pursuit."
"A dinosaur, again?"
"Cody, you're driving, are you?"
No!
Why did we take the old squad car?
That's why.
I'll explain later.
"Cody, you jacked my ride?"
"Listen, the T-rex likes lights."
"The photos are reflections of one another, right?"
"Reflections in lakes, reflections in people's eyes."
Pictures of people taking pictures.
"There were, uh--"
He was taking pictures of people taking pictures?
Yeah.
"I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I actually owe you one, Jack."
Thank you.
"So you'll be getting me those files, then?"
"Oh, I'll get back to you on that one."
[dialing phone]
"Dozer, I think I know why the Chameleon killed Walker."
"So I'm standing in line, which is already annoying enough, and this chick--"
Are you listening to me?
"No, no, baby, I'm sorry."
I just...
I got stuff on my mind.
"So this chick, she takes a step back, and she steps on my foot, right?"
And...
Yeah?
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check my messages.
"So, was I right?"
Give me a second.
Yep.
Chameleon was carrying a camera.
Shoot it to me.
So she was taking pictures of a building?
She was staking out the place.
These pictures could've been taken months ago.
"Well, maybe not."
Marla said that Walker was adding last-minute photos to the exhibit.
So you know...?
So now what?
"The same old story, this time I am the king and you are the queen."
Now I need to decide..
..whether I should kill him to get you...
Or shall I get you and then kill him.
He will die and you will belong to me.
It was me who made the mistake.
Spare his life.
So much concern for him?
I have come back only for you.
- There is a difference.
- What's the difference?
You took a life and he gave his life to come back.
You have to also kill to get love.
I want to change this story.
You want to change it?
How will you change it?
I don't want anyone's blood on my conscience.
Blood...
Why blood?
He can fall from a tall building.
Or..
"..he could get electrocuted, while making toast."
"I promise you, I'll give you a right to choose."
And what if you can have me?
"Then you won't kill him, right?"
Yeah?
The one who had disarmed him is now his armor.
This time he won't die because of me.
"Okay, done!"
We get engaged in three days.
"""Come to the plaza for some"" -- hold on--"
"""zoom, zoom, zoom, and a boom, boom."""
- [ Both laugh ]
"- I don't know what that is, so I brought some sweats and an apple, just in case."
"Okay, I talked to Travis, and I tried to take off my mom goggles."
"Business whiz, or mega nerd?"
It took  everything I could do not to give him a super wedgie.
"Laurie, I'm so sorry"
I encouraged this terrible idea.
"It's okay, honey."
"It just shows how much you care, you know?"
And I get it now.
"Just this morning, I was changing Baby Bobby, and he caught me with a laser of pee right between the eyes, and all I could think was,"
"""That's amazing aim, little guy."""
[ Gasps ] He's so talented!
"Oh, wait."
Do I have grandma goggles?
"You have lots of different goggles, Jules."
But I love you for 'em.
"Kids, you're gonna hit the last note of ""Twinkle, Twinkle,"""
"and then-- kapow-- right into ""Buns."""
Hot-cross your own buns.
My class has a jam to pump.
- You guys with me?
!
All:
- Yeah!
- That guy is wack.
- [ Laughs ]
All:
Tiny Eyes!
Tiny Eyes!
Two gyms and a cheese shop.
And he's going to Turks.
12C?
"Oh, my God, we're 12A and B."
"Oh, we'll be fine."
No.
You'll die.
Would it be awful to change seats?
Not as awful as composting right before you come to the airport.
Ugh!
"Okay, wish me luck."
"Jake, real quick."
The metabolism-- how does she eat like that?
"Pretty, isn't it?"
"Uh, oh."
"Yes, dear."
"It's just lovely, mm-hmm."
"It's lovely how it turned a one-hour drive into three, soaked a brand-new pair of my shoes right down to the toes."
Yeah.
Simply spectacular.
"Well, at least we'll be getting away from it for the holiday."
I'm going to Calgary.
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the unexpected weather conditions, all incoming and outgoing flights are being temporarily delayed."
"Every effort is being made to clear the runways, but until the snow lets up, everyone get comfortable-- could be an hour... could be more."
Ooh.
Excuse me.
"Hey, I said excuse me."
"Yeah, I heard you."
"Is there a problem, sir?"
I don't know.
Is there?
"I heard my wife say ""excuse me"" just now."
What's the difference.
"So, what's this I hear about you and Jordan?"
- l can't believe this.
- You know they had sex.
- Rayanne.
- That's what I heard.
You heard it too?
"God, just shoot me."
- We could probably arrange that.
- You mean you didn't have sex?
"Angela come on, come."
You've got to start thinking of this as a positive thing.
This can help you get to the next level with Jordan.
Did he at least think you were a good kisser?
- l don't know.
- Did you like the way he kissed?
They weren't the kind of kisses you can actually evaluate.
I ntroductory kisses.
You should have had sex with him.
Where were you when the gun went off?
"Mom, it wasn't anywhere near us."
We barely heard it.
We have to worry about our kids being shot in school.
How did it come to this.
This is horrible.
This is a disgrace to all of us--
- That's too much.
- l'm sorry honey.
I'm going to say it in this meeting.
I am. I mean it.
We have to draw the line somewhere.
We just can't keep accepting the total deterioration--
We're going to need ten Jericho men to help us build them.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
You can't just ride into New Bern and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliced it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.
Where's Heather?
"She's dead,Jake."
Jake!
Everybody go!
Jericho is about to be invaded.
We'll do this day and night for as long as it takes.
Most of you have no idea what's coming.
This isn't a fight about land.
This is a fight for our very existence.
"Jerry, I know this has great artistic merit, but I'm taking these shoes off in ten minutes."
"So, if you don't want to have to hide my toes..."
"Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable."
We can't really do this without the best man anyway.
Where is Jake?
I don't see him.
Yeah.
"Grandpa seems to be missing, too."
Take a wild guess where they are.
Right.
"Oh, Beth."
"It's so nice to see you, dear."
Charlie.
It's all over now anyway.
"In a while, bim-bam-boom, I've got this town in the rearview mirror."
"- Hey, take me with you, boss."
- What?
"- Yeah, a little Colorado road trip."
"- No, no, Larry."
Come on.
Let me go.
I'm practically a fugitive.
I can't take you with me.
"Well, Russ, today, yeah,"
"I'm an authorized Yamaha sales associate, but tomorrow I'm just another guy... boxing peanut butter cups at Hershey."
"Come on, Russ."
"I have faith in you, man."
You would just drop everything to come with me?
"Yeah, let the word go forth -"
The Russ Richards freight train is about to leave the station.
"New horizons, new conquests."
- Ready to kick some new ass.
"- Bob Barker, watch out."
Russ Richards is heading west.
Now let's see what's behind door number three.
Whoo-hoo!
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
- Come on.
- This will be no bed of roses
"All right, I'll take the first eight hours."
- Ever driven one of these things?
- Nope.
I consider it a challenge before the human race and i never lose
All right.
The bastards who did this should be shot.
"No, I tried to get away and I lost control."
You did everything you could.
"Don't worry, the cops will get these guys."
- Have you seen Grace?
- She looks good.
- They think she's gonna be okay.
- Really?
We still have to run a few tests.
"Everything looks good, but as soon as I can, I'll bring her down so you can be with her."
"Okay, thanks."
I'm gonna go back and stay with Grace until they're ready to bring her in here.
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Your husband seems like a great guy.
"It's okay, Judy."
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.
"Okay, well, the Venus flytrap is nontoxic, so it's not lethal if ingested."
"However, the larger ones are extremely dangerous, and have been known to devour pets and small children."
"No, no, no, I made that last part up."
Uh...
I'm sorry.
"Ma'am, I..."
You're absolutely right.
This is not a venue for humor.
I...
I understand.
I-I apologize.
"You, too."
Do you need any help with the snakes?
Take it easy.
Drive carefully.
"Alright, um..."
I'm not giving up on us.
You will.
"Just leave them on the, on the table."
Drive carefully everyone!
Thank God.
I thought they'd never leave.
Her grief runs deep.
I think Lindsay might be like a dam waiting to burst.
There is no right way to grieve.
And probably far more than five stages.
And the process itself is as complex as the people who experience it.
Especially if the loss is still a mystery.
Loaded with secrets.
"Um, your Dad's here."
Honestly... ..do I look fat on this?
"No, you, you look..."
Lovely.
As always.
"Thanks, Arlo."
You really have been so good to me.
I don't deserve it.
Of course you do.
"You know, I would do anything for someone going through this."
You know me and Jared used to get all these postcards from Mum at Christmas and birthdays.
"Yeah, I heard that."
We knew they were from Dad.
"'Cause he's got this really bad squiggly handwriting, but we pretended to go along with it just to make him feel better really."
It's kind of sweet.
In his own strange way I guess... ..he does love you.
"Isn't it, Laurie?"
"[ Drowners' ""A Button On Your Blouse"" playing ]"
How long have we been holding hands?
Huh.
Wasn't that fun?
[ Chuckles ]
Why don't you go spend some time with your friends now?
[ Gasps ] These kids are so happy.
They even gave me a nickname--
"""That lady who saved prom."" [ Laughs ]"
I even made a love connection.
"I found a lonely guy and a lonely girl,"
I put 'em together...
and now they're dancing.
It's a weird dance.
It's like they're trying to smother a fire between their crotch.
So what have you been doing since I lost you?
Gettin' crazy?
Yeah.
"No, I mean, I was."
But then I remembered that I left my purse over here so I came to find it.
That's the end of the story.
"Hey, it's early."
Let's go have some fun.
Go without me because I need to catch my breath after all the...
purse excitement.
No way!
We're a team!
"Also, you may have to rescue me in case anyone pulls me into a dance circle."
That is my biggest fear.
"Well, that and... [ Whispers ] clowns."
What about a dance circle made up of clowns?
So gossip girl most likely goes to or went to constance.
Yeah exactly. why else the focus?
"Well,i would also assume that she is our age."
The blasts all started when we were in the ninth grade.
An upperclassman simply wouldn't care.
"So you're saying gossip girl's a senior,like us?"
"Well,if she's a senior"
Then--then that means she's in the room right now.
So who could it be?
Rebecca sherman?
no her head's always in a book.
- She's not paying enough attention.
- Okay.
Not her either.
Then i submit nelly yuki.
Low profile
Good with computers...
Many grudges mostly against me.
No i have been with her way too many times
When gossip girl has sent out a blast.
There's no way it's her. i'm gonna speed this up.
What are you doing?
sending a tip to gossip girl.
"- Chuck,get the room quiet for me. - i'm way ahead of you."
If i could have everyone's attention please.
We'd like to thank you all for being here today.
Jonathan?
what?
Gossip girl is... a guy?
It's him. look.
What just happened?
What's going on?
"He'll never get a job, not even in the fields."
He can't even calculate how much a man would plough during an 8 hour shift.
"If in one hour, 8 men can do..."
He'd only be good at playing football!
- Addie!
- You stay here!
"Hey, you!"
Open it!
Open it or there'll be trouble!
"Don't hurt him, it's his birthday!"
"Yeah, and I have a short temper!"
"Adam, come out!"
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
"Don't do this, my dear son!"
"Open it now, you hear me?"
Addie!
"It's only me, your father isn't here."
You can open it.
Please!
What is it?
You've locked yourself in again?
"The folks from the Council were here yesterday as well, complaining that you must be brewing alcohol here secretly!"
You know what?
They can all go to hell!
What am I supposed to do with the apples?
Let them rot?
They're travelling with their houses!
"Gee, animal sculptures."
They must be art collectors.
"I just changed the number plate, and the colour as well."
"And you just play here, when we're clearly late already!"
We'll never make it to Kamenice like this!
In Benigno's house?
Yes.
Why are you living there?
Benigno is dead.
"One day, you and I should talk."
"Yes, and it will be simpler than you think."
Nothing is simple.
I'm a ballet mistress and nothing is simple.
TALK TO HER
The stage is full of wooden chairs and tables.
"Two women come out, wearing slips."
"Their eyes are closed, like two sleepwalkers."
You're scared they'll bump into everything.
"But suddenly, a man appears, with such a sad face."
The saddest I've ever seen.
And he knocks all the chairs and tables out of their way.
You can't imagine how moving it was!
"There was a man sitting beside me, in his forties, good-looking."
"He cried several times, from emotion."
I can understand why.
It was so beautiful!
I have a surprise for you!
I got Pina Bausch's autograph for you.
I had to buy the photo.
It's in English.
"It means: ""I hope you overcome all your obstacles and start dancing."""
"- Look, she's got her period."
- It's early.
Good evening.
"Benigno, could you stay tonight?"
My sister can't stay with the kids and I've got no one else.
I expect to be able to see the sea.
You can see the sea.
It's over there between the land and the sky.
I need a telescope to see that.
"Well, may I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea?"
Or preferably in it?
Right.
"Now, listen to me."
"I'm not satisfied, but I've decided to stay here."
"However, I shall expect a reduction."
"Why, because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment?"
"Because the room is cold, the bath is too small, the view is invisible, and the radio doesn't work."
"No, the radio works."
You don't.
What?
"I'll see if I can fix it, you scabby old bat."
- I think we got something then.
- What?
I think we got something then!
What are you doing?
Qué?
"Madam, don't think me rude, but may I ask, do you by any chance have a hearing aid?"
A what?
A hearing aid!
"Yes, I do have a hearing aid."
Would you like me to get it mended?
!
Mended?
It's working perfectly all right.
"No, it isn't!"
I haven't got it turned on at the moment.
- Why not?
What's up?
I don't know.
Sounds kind of phony to me.
"Hello, is that you, Sam?"
Thompson.
"Say, uh, Sam, I just had a long-distance from Gargan."
"Yeah, he sounded kind of funny."
Is there anything wrong?
Is there anything wrong?
"Oh, not very much."
Only Gargan put a bullet into one of his monkeys.
What?
Sure.
"And from the dope I get, he's hiding out."
And they're trying to keep it quiet.
"But if the guy dies, you'll never see that deputy again."
Out of the state on business.
A conference with the governor.
Giving me orders.
"Why, that dirty, little crook."
"When I go to the penitentiary, I'll throw peanuts at him."
- What did he do?
- Nothing.
"He just put a bullet in somebody, that's all."
And he has the gall to--
Let me look at those accounts for the last two months.
We're going to make up for lost time.
You ain't on the level about me going back to that hospital again.
"- Yeah, get back there."
- But I've been there 40 times.
Forty more.
"After two weeks, they don't know if the guy will live or not."
What's this noise are you outside?
What are you doing out so late?
- We have run away from there...
We are on our way to Delhi.
Run away!
What do you mean you have run away!
Have you gone mad!
What the hell is going on there?
I'll explain everything once I reach.
I told you to stay on for a few days!
Can't you understand that much?
Are you little children!
"Brother, please don't get angry...the warden."
What did she do?
"Sonu, tell me what happened?"
She got drunk and came in Chhoti's room...
Was trying to slip into her bed.
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
You both take care of yourselves...
Do you have money?
Yes.
"Call me as soon as your reach, I will come and get you."
"Here, gulp it down."
Johnny bhai.
Could you lend me some money?
I will return it soon.
Money?
If I had any money saved do you think I would have been stuck in this city.
I would have gone away to Mauritius long back!
I live off the dead!
I bury one corpse to get one meal!
I am surviving because people die in this city everyday.
"Is there some new event, some change?"
No.
No.
I just thought...
"You've just been drinking to calm your nerves, huh?"
"It is your nerves, isn't it?"
Perhaps you should see a doctor.
No.
"No, I don't need a doctor."
"Would you like to have some wine, sir?"
I'll get you another glass.
Dr. Jekyll's a good man.
"Yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll."
- Is he?
- Yes.
Yes.
And a fine gentleman too.
Different than any man you might know.
Yes.
Yes.
"""A nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir wouldn't be knowing such a person."" No."
"""I ain't such a bad looker, sir, when I'm more myself. "" Yes."
"He's the kind of man you can get down on your knees to, isn't he?"
"A sweet, dear, pure man that you can trust and believe."
"He's a smug, hypocritical coward, that's what he is!"
- You couldn't know him!
- I know him intimately.
And I detest him intimately from his lofty brain to the soles of his virtuous feet!
"And you, you..."
"""I'll do anything you ask, sir."""
"Well, you saw him, didn't you?"
You saw the respectable fool.
"Oh, what a whore she is."
This is despicable.
You are drunk.
My only regret is that I didn't put 20 francs on the mantelpiece the first time.
"I can assure you, monsieur, that Madame Sand will gain no money from you on my account."
Hm?
(JAUNTY MUSIC)
Eugene!
Where's angel fingers?
I've lost him.
- He's taking the Countess d'Agoult home.
- Oh.
"If you plan to invade Poland, you should know that the countess has placed her troops at the border."
What are you talking about?
- I read a love letter she wrote to him.
- What letter?
What did it say?
Marie's jealous of you.
She couldn't stand it if you got a better composer than hers.
I don't know why I dress up.
Nothing here but old men.
You should bring that Mallefille fellow with you.
- He's at Nohant tutoring the children.
- So you took my advice and kept him.
No.
It's all over with us.
- What does he say to that?
- Oh...
He threatens to kill me and himself if I leave him.
He's been reading too many of your books!
- Let's stop here.
"- Mama, it is too cold for you here."
"And to go unnoticed, we created a whole new language."
"Words were numbers, and numbers were words."
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.
- Plus 6.
- Gun.
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.
Plus 12.
Is this chemistry review?
- Plus 14.
- Ring.
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.
Use it in a sentence.
"Man, that sugar's sweet."
"Because I knew the count, I knew which cards were left in the deck."
That's how I knew what to bet.
You're doing great.
"Micky, I just want to let you know that I'm only doing this for medical school, which is $300,000."
"I mean, if I can get anything close to that, then I'm done."
"Well, in the first place, Ben, it's not ""if,"" it's ""when."""
"And second of all, I get it."
I completely understand.
- You do?
- Yeah.
It's a means to an end.
"Look, they've got this new computer software that reads people's faces, so who knows how long this gig's gonna last for any of us?"
What if we get caught?
"Our system keeps us under the radar, you'll see."
"Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal."
"- So, there's no danger in it at all?"
"- Oh, yeah, those are ""plow me"" heels."
Nice.
- Mm-hmm.
The knee bruise is encouraging.
Working our way up to those 20-year-old tatas.
Oh.
"Gravity's cruel grasp hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles."
Now let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face.
- Mmm.
- Hey.
"Her face says, ""Ready to bone."" Am I right?"
"I say again, am I right?"
That's my half sister.
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
No!
"- That's my sister, Ted."
"- Well, look, I didn't know!"
"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you."
Thi-This is just some crazy coincidence.
"There are four million women in the city of New York, Ted... and you sleep with my sister?"
Why would the universe do that to me?
I don't know.
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way... that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
"- My sweet, little, innocent..."
- Pierced.
Really?
Where?
Don't answer that!
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
It wasn't a bronnection.
It was a sisnnection.
Especially her own. (LAUGHS)
"No, this is more of a general grief... about everything."
Love is a farce and everyone dies.
See?
Especially in our family.
Look at Mum?
"I'm sorry, have you lost your mother as well?"
"No, she lives in a house-truck near Stafford."
Denise had a change of heart.
Mum turned lesbian and Dad cried for a year.
Now she's with a man again.
George doesn't need to hear about any of that.
How can we help our esteemed new editor today?
"I'm actually not feeling that esteemed, Monty."
Welcome to my world.
I want to apologise.
"Well, look no worries."
You're welcome.
Job didn't mean that much to me anyway.
I meant to Bill Jr.
"Oh, what for?"
For being the one to tell Lindsay.
That should have been his to do.
You would have done a much better job than he would've.
I'd still like to talk to him anyway.
Do know where I can find him?
Mm-hm.
I can do better than that.
"Siouxsie, cancel my appointments for the day."
You don't have any.
Excellent.
He likes the way the balls roll across the grass.
"Dropped out freshman year, but still shows up to our reunion."
What kind of loser would do that ?
We're going to find out.
"I'm serious, guys."
You're making a mistake.
"No, we're not."
"Get your hands out, Mr. Winslet."
What ?
"You didn't go to the reunion to sell insurance, did you ?"
"Yes, I did."
I told you before.
I got blood smeared.
There was smeared blood on the floor where Patrick was killed.
How much you want to bet that's our victim's blood ?
"Puts you at the scene, Dan."
Do you care to talk about that ?
I should have been part of that class.
It's all his fault.
"Freshman year, locker room."
Dansy the pansy.
Shouldn't have told Coach I blew off practice.
That'll keep you from talking !
Yeah !
Good night !
You want to know how long I was in the hospital ?
How long it took them to get that tape off me ?
Skin grafts.
I can't take off my shirt in front of anyone.
Not that I even have anyone.
- Do you blame Patrick for the life you have ?
- No.
For taking the life I could have had.
Aside from our difference in age.
Hey... of course we are!
And I look young for my age...
I keep being told that I look young for my age.
It's really... difficult to be modest these days.
"As scary as Park Seon Woo can be, don't underestimate us either."
"Because, we're all friends."
That man doesn't have any friends.
I know him well.
"Oh, but Shi Yoon."
- There's something you must do for me.
- What?
Since I have to meet Han Gyul tomorrow...
"Please teach me the most important, or the most basic, element of fighting."
"Hey, Im Soo Bin!"
I heard that your dad was in a chase in our neighborhood yesterday.
Except he wasn't the one chasing.
He was being chased.
- Wasn't your dad a police officer?
"- Shut up, and keep stuffing your face."
Oh!
We should have recorded the chase and put it on the web!
"I would have gotten 10,000 ""likes""!"
Get a horde of fans!
And it would climb up the internet search engine rankings!
Soo Bin!
What's that?
Blood?
"Oh, spicy rice cakes?"
- Did you fight someone?
- Did you kill someone?
I'm asking you if you killed someone!
He was so worried about losing more hair with chemo treatments I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men just to put his mind at ease?
- You did that?
- Yeah!
"- Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy."
- Wait!
You can't say anything.
- Why not?
- Because he'll know I told you.
"Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for nothing."
So because you're getting free parking I gotta pretend this guy had cancer?
Yeah.
"Well, I don't like it."
I don't like it one bit.
And I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Maintain the same disposition.
You can't act any differently.
You have to be nice.
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Because you were being so nice.
- I don't think I could be that nice.
- You be nice!
Gary?
What do you think?
Check it out.
- Is that from my gift certificate?
"- Yeah, buddy."
You came through.
You've been so nice.
"Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage."
Yeah.
"Hey, know what I'm thinking of doing?"
I'm getting rid of all my fillings because that mercury's toxic.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
And you to me.
You are.
Oh.
What?
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
I've -
- I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
I have to go.
"Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier,"
"the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
"What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go..."
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
I'll tell you what -- if the two of you love each other --
You going somewhere?
"Uh, my mom's."
Oh.
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
President Choi Eung Chan!
He planned all this and..
Is this true?
Is it really the President?
The President?
!
Then to take the President down...
You purposely spread bribes around him to make him look corrupt?
Are you afraid?
Just please bring back honor to my dead brother.
Shaking the nation...
Is something that I don't want
I'm just asking to bring back honor to those dead soliders!
And...
"Please let's end it all, General."
General!
Young Joo...
Why did this happen?
Young Joo ssi...
Bad punk.
I told him not to run around the scene by himself so many times..
He never even listens to his director.
Bad punk.
I didn't even know it was about his father's case and blamed him for giving me too much work...
And vented my anger at him.
I'm sorry Prosecutor.
"Prosecutor, I'm so sorry."
"You, dead or alive, you're still like my son."
"What you couldn't finish, I'll do it for you."
The people who made you like this...
I'll catch all the bastards who did this to you and feed them prison rice.
The justice that you always wanted...
"Uh, I-"
You were the one that trained me in the delicate art of giving people useless information.
"I said nice things, for what it's worth."
Thank you.
You have a job for me?
A woman I met.
Evelyn.
She heard I worked security.
She asked me for help.
I guess her ex ran off with their son.
"We ran checks, credit cards, airlines, got nothing."
"Somebody's gonna have to do some legwork... but a job that small, not really our thing."
You thought of me.
"I would consider it a favor if you took the job,and the money's not bad."
- Money's not the pressing issue.
- Why?
What do you need?
- Identity.
- Not for traveling.
"Michael, if you leave Miami-"
I can't help you with that kind of thing.
Seriously.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Fine.
"Get your documents together, I'll have my guys do an I.D. package."
Go see Evelyn first.
Thanks.
I separated from Doug a few months ago.
"I tried to keep it together forJasper's sake, but-That's our son."
But it was hard on him listening to us fight all the time.
He started acting up at school.
"For Claytor, everyday is part of a grand-if solitary-adventure."
He's been away form home for nearly three years and it could be three more before he returns.
"From Africa, he will head east to the four remaining continents between him a home."
Claytor has grown accustomed to being a stranger everywhere he goes
but he is also changed by every place he visits and every person he meets.
"I think there's a part of me that's become a little bit African, because the Africans have a saying which is when you ask them when they'll come back or what time something will be ready they'll smile and look at you"
and say anytime from now.
So when people ask me when I' going to get home sometimes I just can only say anytime from now.
"Look, right there."
A chamber.
Okay.
I see it.
Go on.
Get off my foot.
"Oh, will you--?"
Go on.
Do you see anything?
Spiders.
"Now get moving, MacGyver."
"Get moving, don't dawdle."
All right.
Look.
Huh?
There.
A sigma.
Ah.
"Do you recall your Greek, MacGyver?"
Sigma is the letter...
S. Yes.
As in Solon.
It says
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Turkey, Cuba."
- I'll read them to Alicia at night.
- They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
- Are you going alone?
- Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
- About what?
- Loneliness.
I want to get married.
Married?
Who to?
"To Alicia, of course!"
You're crazy!
We get along better than most married couples.
Why shouldn't a man want to marry the woman he loves?
Because the woman is in a coma!
"Because Alicia can't say with any part of her body: ""I do!"""
Because we don't know if vegetative life is really life!
Get in the car.
- How can you say that?
- Get in the car!
Your relationship with Alicia is a monologue and it's insane.
I'm not saying talking's no use but people talk to plants and they don't marry them!
I can't believe you're saying that.
I thought you were different.
A relative of the Emperor.
He wants to replace me.
I lost the Emperor's favor... because he badmouthed me.
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
Mr. Hwang.
"This is my brother, Prince Daeso."
"(Hwangjagyung, Han Emperor's relative)"
I've heard a lot about you.
The Emperor heard about the alliance and was very impressed.
Long time no see.
Hope you had a nice trip.
What brings you here?
Your request for more provisions has upset the Emperor very much.
He was so upset...
I volunteered to come and offer some help.
I'm here to help you out.
Tell me whenever you need something.
Thanks for the offer but I won't need your help.
I'll organize a small feast for you.
I hope you enjoy your stay.
Very well.
"I'll sail south as you want, but... make me an offer we can't refuse."
What are they doing?
They're racking their brains but I think they're lost.
How can he help Jolbon... when he can't even satisfy me?
I'm off to see Buwiyum.
Will you make an offer?
Yes.
Tell me what you have.
Are you kidding me?
!
I'm not kidding you.
"It pays crap, but the sandwiches are free."
I could work on your boat.
My boat?
"Now see, I get a boat, it's gonna be a thing of beauty."
"They see us coming, they'll roll over and beg."
Why am I telling you all this?
Because... you're hoping I saved you half a sandwich.
Name's Peter.
I'm Nicky.
Wallace.
"Good to see you-- circumstances aside, of course."
"Please, have a seat."
"Pam, uh, wants you to know that if there's anything she can do..."
I appreciate that.
We're... both completely devastated by all this which...
makes it difficult to ask.
Then don't.
I wish I didn't have to.
But I'm under a cloud.
"And you put me there, Jeff."
I think you owe me a little clarity.
Clarity?
That's what you really want?
How many years have I known you and Pam?
Since law school.
That's a half a lifetime.
And the fact that you're not out there leading the charge for my nomination...
I'm waiting for the hearings.
To learn what?
To spare you the humiliation.
To find you a way out.
What are you talking about?
Great.
"But hey, look, with Hank, maybe it'll be different, you know?"
He's a cop.
He's already seen a bunch of crazy stuff.
"With any luck, it'll wear off in a couple, three years."
[Inaudible dialogue]
[Camera shutter clicking]
[Camera shutter clicking]
[Phone rings] Hello.
I found your friend.
Marquesa.
It's time for you to get on a plane to Portland.
Thanks.
You don't look like you slept too well.
I didn't.
What's going on?
"The usual suspects, tossing and turning."
Must have been something I ate.
What did you get from Interpol?
File on Akira Kimura.
"Ah, yeah."
One of the guys responsible for killing your parents.
It's a great way to start your day.
"And get this, they tied him to the beating death of a coin collector in hamburg."
Turns out the victim was the dealer who sold the three gold coins to Sam Bertram here in Portland.
I'm not sad those coins disappeared.
"You know, that's a nasty-looking guy."
The hell is that thing on his face?
It's called the Aegishjalmur.
And it means what?
Helm of awe.
It's a symbol the vikings wore for invincibility.
I rang the doorbell.
"Didn,t you hear?"
I brought your dinner.
Can I help?
No need.
Sit down.
"The gas will be hooked up tomorrow, so you,II be able to cook for yourselves."
Water.
Wine.
"It,s not working."
Excuse me.
There.
"You,re on TV."
- What will we do tomorrow?
"- You,II see."
"Here,s a mattress."
The bedroom will be ready tomorrow.
This afternoon the model couple moved into their happy new home.
"We,II follow this fascinating experiment closely over the next six months."
"Tonight all of France wonders,"
",Who are you, CIaudine and Jean-MicheI?"
","
"We,II try to answer with a few images."
"CIaudine is 25, a keypunch operator at a maiI-order company."
"She,s Parisian."
"Jean-MicheI is 29, from Thonon-Ies-Bains."
"In middle management at a Iarge marketing firm, he earns 3,220 francs a month."
"He,s dynamic, athletic, conscientious, and likable."
"Married two years, they plan to have their first child in the model Apartment, and they,ve received special leaves of absence for the duration."
"We,II let our couple settle in."
"We,II check in again tomorrow, and throughout the experiment."
"Good night, CIaudine and Jean-MicheI, and good luck!"
And we got saved by a girl.
"We might as well cut our nuts off, and turn them in to the dude sheriff, 'cause we don't deserve these badges that we call testicles."
We should just give our balls to that guy.
- Yeah.
"- I mean, he's a man."
He probably has three balls.
He definitely had horrible B.O.
I think that's a sign of giant balls.
- Rank.
- Lucky.
Testosterone stinks.
I smell like flowers.
These hands of mine are so soft.
It's like Chinese silk ribbon.
It's weird.
They've never done anything manly in my whole stupid life.
Not one thing.
I pet a llama once.
That's the manliest thing I've ever done.
"That was cool, though."
We went to that petting zoo.
All those cute ducks.
They were scary.
"Guys, this is what I'm talking about."
We're going to petting zoos when we should be slitting the throats of those animals.
"Yeah, we should slit throats of animals."
"We should be hunting or, like, pulling marlins out of the ocean or, like, doing..."
What do men do?
- We should go camping.
- Yes.
- At the Brianna concert.
- Yes.
"Ms. Ramsey, uh, would you say that you and your niece"
Are close?
"Oh, of course we are."
But she's my sister's only daughter.
"And, uh, now that Stephen is..."
"Well, now that Stephen is dead,"
She's the only family I have left.
How did Stephen and his sister get along?
"Oh, just fine."
They were as close as any brother
And sister I've ever seen.
Why do you ask?
"No particular reason, Ms. Ramsey."
"Uh, we just have to ask a lot of questions"
When we're checking out a possible homicide.
Homicide?
What are you talking about?
I thought it was an accident.
I read it in the newspapers.
"Well, yes, it may appear that way, ma'am."
"But, you see, we have to, uh, check out everything,"
Every possibility.
It must have been an accident.
Run over by a car?
"Uh, that's the way it appears, yes, ma'am."
"Well, if it wasn't, then someone wanted Stephen dead."
"Oh, that's ridiculous."
"I don't believe that boy had, uh, an enemy in the world."
RICHARD:
Seems like everyone we talk
To feels about the same way.
"And then, of course, the next question is, who"
What stark had for breakfast two months ago.
Mm-hmm.
You feel him sweat?
Wife's the key.
Stay on the wife.
"Mr. Jarvis, I want you to meet..."
I'm afraid I mistakenly took your stolen-car report.
"Well, thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen."
"Unless you're going to arrest and charge me,"
I'll be on my way.
"If there's anything further you'd like to discuss,"
Please feel free to contact one of mr.
Stark's attorneys.
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?
I didn't...
exactly.
You didn't think.
"For the love of eve, will somebody tell me what I did,"
Who I cheesed off to have you dumped in my lap?
Why you never catch any actual assignments.
Hey.
You see this man?
"He did exemplary work today, and you ruined it."
"Now, what do you have to say to him?"
"Agent thompson, I apologize."
"Agent carter, sorry doesn't even begin to cover it."
Doesn't even begin to cover it.
Get out of my sight.
Sir.

"Julie will get bored after a day, anyway."
"Want to go to a cardio bar, fashion island..."
Do I get a raise?
"- So, um..."
I appreciate what you're trying to do with the...
"- Okay, I'm reading here."
"- Oh, uh, take your time."
- I just wanted to let you know that you didn't do a bad job.
"- Your work isn't terrible, either."
"A little rushed, maybe."
"So, I've been thinking."
Um...
I owe you an apology.
"Well, several, actually."
You have to actually say the words.
That's kind of how it works.
"I would like to extend... to you a formal acknowledgment that I... may have, um, unintentionally..."
I'm sorry.
"Me, too."
I'm sorry.
- I-I'm sorry about the coffee and the... black eye and the... tampons.
"- Well, you can see why I thought you were intellectually"
I'm just...
I'm really glad that you're not.
"- Your, uh, penmanship, however..."
"- Hey, what's wrong with my penmanship?"
"- Nothing, just..."
"Just, next time, don't hold the pen between your toes."
"Oh, well, um, next time, don't spell ""canceling"" with two L's."
"Yeah, that's wrong."
You want to... you want to fix that?
- I...
Uncle...
Perhaps I have worn it too long...
General...
It looks like the kid is telling the truth.
We just received report that
Kwon Yul's entire army moved out to Soon-chun last night.
The contents of that letter are true?
And there was my father-in-law's report as well.
He paid one thousand heads to Jin Lin for it.
It has to be true.
Yi Soon-shin has left Noryang open?
Is this assign from god?
Send a report to General Shimazu.
We must pass through Noryang tonight at full speed and strike Yi Soon-shin from the rear!
"Yes, sir!"
Yoshihiro!
Aye!
Check the assault team for readiness once again.
They have to be right there on Yi Soon-shin's command ship the moment that we attack his fleet and throws them into confusion.
Is that understood?
Aye!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
My son!
We've decided to let you live.
"If we win the battle, your lives will be spared."
You will be our oarsmen!
Row the oars on the ships that will destroy Yi Soon-shin!
No way!
You want me to dirty my hands and row a Japanese ship?
It's a leopard.
Around here?
He's probably lost and hungry.
Thinks he has supper up that tree.
Over there.
That's Sally he's got treed.
"Ok, fellas, let's get that leopard."
Wait a minute.
This is leopard territory.
A gunshot could bring on 30 or 40 more of them.
Yeah.
Five of us could never handle that many deadly leopards.
But what about Sally?
"As long as she's in the tree, she's ok."
Jack and I will tranquilize the leopard.
Quietly.
"Ok, we'll keep you covered."
"Sergeant, you follow right behind Mr. Makula."
"Captain, I think it might be safer for all of us if you gentlemen stayed under cover."
"Look, we just wanna help."
What difference does it make what we do?
The difference is we're using tranquilizer darts.
You're using real bullets.
I have no desire to be a battle casualty.
Come on.
"Well, now, what have we here?"
Who is that fancy looking chimp?
"Why it must be Sally, the world-famous astro-chimp."
- What are they doing?
"- Sergeant, we're moving in."
Hold it.
"Well, if that's the case, we better keep pretty far away from her."
It's all in there.
I don't know what to say.
"That it, then?"
Yeah.
WALDRON:
So many years I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again.
And then I did.
"In a photo, in a briefing room."
And I was being sent to meet him with a gun.
ARNOTT.
I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background.
I'd like to keep digging.
(Mumbles)
What's he saying?
"This is a young Ronan Murphy, shot by Danny Waldron during Operation Damson."
What'?
They knew each other?
Did you fabricate the improper relations
- between you and DS Arnott'?
- No.
Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you'?
- What is your verdict?
- Not guilty.
It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.
Hari initiated the struggle with that gun and it's only his word for it that it was self-defence.
I owe you an apology for the other night.
Your...dinner invitation.
You're a married man.
This is it.
Danny Waldron purposefully created a trail of evidence.
And now we're on the trail of the other abusers.
There were certain errors in your report of the incident.
Don't tell me the guys in Washington ref used?
Those guys decided to award the Congressional Medal to Drake and the Distinguished Service Cross to the officer with him.
How's that?
The congressional.
Won't you look pretty standing up there?
Maybe he'll even let you sit on his piano.
- With the newsreels grinding.
- ln Technicolor.
What's the gripe?
That's the best they've got.
You shouldn't have done it!
Sometimes you go soft-headed.
I'd like to see a blond do that to me.
- What's the gimmick?
- Basic grammar.
- l'll bet she talks beautif ully now.
- Think so?
You look like the first time you jumped.
"Look, kid, if it's trouble...."
"Yeah, we had some, didn't we?"
"Not like this, though."
Quit living inside there.
If you can't tell me-- l can tell you.
I just don't want any medal.
is that all you don't want?
- Captain Murdock?
- On the hoof.
Camera boys would like shots of you two.
Could you come out?
You only stop here f or 5 minutes.
- The city of brotherly love?
I'll lock it up in my safe.
Give me the pen.
"Now, get out and leave a man to work."
"No, Lucas."
You get out.
- You get out of Peyton Place before dark.
"- Doc, I signed it for you!"
"If you do, I'll keep this in my safe."
"But if you don't, I'll use it against you."
I signed it!
Don't you ever try to come back here.
"Not next week, not next year, not ever."
"If you do, I'll kill you myself."
Why you little... .
Mary.
"Unofficially, this was a miscarriage but officially, for the records, it's an appendectomy."
- That's a lie.
- I removed her appendix.
Understand?
You want to ruin a girl's life for one word?
"- No, but falsifying records... ."
- I'll make them out personally and if you tell anybody this wasn't an appendectomy I'll tell the whole town about you and that drug salesman.
"Doc, that's blackmail."
It sure is.
"Nellie, she's all right now."
She's just fine.
Thank God.
"What a disgrace, disgrace!"
- Disgrace!
- Nellie.
Don't talk that way.
Nobody's ever gonna know but the three of us.
How are you?
I'm okay.
I was gonna call you.
Then I saw you were coming for the parent-teacher conferences.
I want you to know the school is not gonna be bullied by Nick McCullers.
Everybody here loves Emily.
What about Nick McCullers?
"Uh, well, he came in making a big deal about how he thinks Emily's getting special treatment because she's gay."
Everybody knows Emily's the better swimmer.
Except McCullers.
He came here to school and said that?
In front of everyone.
"Students, teachers."
- Was Emily there?
- She was.
Hello?
Hello?
You better put that back.
Put it back or she'll know you were in here.
I'm sorry.
I knocked.
The door was open.
"I heard you, but I couldn't answer the door."
I was on the phone.
My lawyer called.
The DA is dropping the charges against me.
They're not gonna charge you with killing Alison?
I didn't get the details but he said the blood evidence was corrupted.
The district attorney can't go to trial without it.
- They're finished with you?
- Not finished.
They can charge me anytime they find new evidence.
I'll be right there.
I don't want Chris to see this.
"-Well, what's wrong?"
What is it?
-Shh.
You're convinced that it's genuine?
I don't know.
"No, not really, I suppose."
But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.
You would want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
Might be best to have a man with experience.
Maybe someone who's spent time in foreign missions.
"I understand, Your Excellency."
Let's see who's around.
"In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Well, he does know the background."
I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist.
"There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
What about the exorcist?
Have you any ideas?
How about Lankester Merrin?
Merrin?
I had a notion he was in Iraq.
I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh.
"You're right, but he's finished."
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.
"What's he doing there, teaching?"
He's working on another book.
"Don't you think he's too old, Tom?"
This is the center of the collection.
You'll find this in the Main Room.
All the artworks are to be removed and all of them handled with the utmost care.
"You'll enter the property at midnight, on my command."
Is that clear?
"Yes, sir!"
Alright.
Good evening.
"Good evening, everyone!"
"Ok, let's not stand on ceremony, let's jump straight in with"
item number one in your catalogue:
"""A drive around the circuit in Monaco"", beginning bidding at... 50 thousand!"
"Now don't be shy, do we see 50 thousand?"
50!
Do I see 55?
55!
I see 55...
Do I see 60?
Your hand up?
Do we see 60?
"Is that 70, sir, or wonderful hair. 70!"
That's gone to you.
Thank you very well!
Auctions can be pretty torrid affairs.
Yes!
"I believe the last time you and I saw each other, we were bidding on the Malevich."
"You won that one, I guess."
Have you still got that Mondrian:
"""Study In Composition number 2""?"
Red and Blue!
"Yes, of course, that's one of our favorites."
Constantine hung a Rauschenberg next to it and would talk about the unbroken tradition between the two.
Looks like she didn't suffer.
Sometimes...
"For some, death is a kind of deliverance."
"That's it, a gun shot, 12 gauge... almost point blank She died on the spot,"
And... the young black man?
"At first glance, from what the ambulance guy said.."
brain dead... most probably.
"As for the lady... she'II be on the table around 1 1 :00am, so my report should be on your desk around 3:00pm."
"I can send it to montreal, if you prefer."
No big deal.
"We'II take it, to hell with the montreal guys."
It's a change from horse theft and conjugal violence.
"Are you sure, Gary?"
"Yeah, sure."
alright then.
"We'II talk around 3:00, 3:30."
Perfect.
Bye.
What more do we have here?
"There are 3, 4 witnesses inside, there's this."
The neighbors say it belongs to the victim.
There's this.
Three cartridges.
"One was found near the victim, another here, in the grass."
"One is part of those over there, probably shot at martial."
How is he?
Not so good.
Quite a shock.
Anything on what started it?
"Yeah, it's all over there."
It started here alright.
"could be the young black guy, we found his bicycle."
No...
Trevor...
You still got half an hour.
I can fix you some eggs.
I'm tired but thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."
"Watch your work, not your ass."
"Come on guys, keep it moving."
"Yes sir, yes sir, Master Tucker, motherfucker"
"Hey, why is that machine down?"
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill.
"Where am I going to make up that 7 minutes, Miller?"
Your paycheck?
"- Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations."
- What regulations?
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery.
"Ocean, 1989."
Yeah?
Write to your congressman and hurry that up.
"Congratulations, Reznik."
You just made my shitlist.
"She copping his joint, right?"
"And he's tellin' her, you know, baby this, baby that..."
Chatting her up like mother fucking Barry White.
"Talking about what he going to do to her, and how he going to make her coochy feel and all that."
That's right.
"So then, she stopped"
She looked up at him with these big old puppy eyes she's like...
"That sounds good pappy, but me no have no coochy."
"So, my man's like ""Say what?"
"!"""
You never called.
What's wrong with you?
He is in deep shit.
You don't even know him.
His family doesn't accept him.
I can't leave him here.
I don't understand why this should be your business.
He will be saferwith me.
"""German rescues gay lover from radical Islamic family..."""
Perfect!
Have you gone nuts?
"Not only that, I love him."
Why don't you adopt a gay boy from all nations of the third world?
You could build a rainbow community.
I can't abandon a person in need.
Those kids in Afghanistan were going to die anyway.
There was a war going on.
I didn't even speak the language.
I shouldn't have pushed forthose pictures.
You could have stepped on those mines yourself.
I'm the one who lives with this every day.
There're mines everywhere.
I can't keep doing this.
"If he everbreaks your heart, don't call me."
What's up?
She won't stop.
She starts calling at 5am everyday.
I'm really sick of lying for you.
Is it worth it?
What are you hiding?
"Whatever it is, just be brave and come out with it."
They delivered this yesterday.
All right.
Welcome!
Would you like to go inside?
All right.
Bring us a bowl of hot soup and a bottle of rice wine.
You got it!
One bowl of hot soup!
All right!
Rice cakes?
It's a grand opening cake.
I hope you'll visit us often.
You're so nice.
And you're pretty too.
"Oh my, I'm blushing!"
I haven't been complimented on my looks since my teen years.
"I know you're just being nice, but you made my day."
"The papers fell down, your blouse dropped, the captain said to hang it."
- What's the matter with your mouth?
- Personal secret.
Never lets go of it.
"Six-two and even, he swallows it, his senior sorority pin."
"I peeked at your papers, and he rescued them."
You went through my papers?
The war's over.
Where are we going and why?
We don't like secrets.
Thank you. I should have known better than try to hold back f rom men who have operated the way you have behind enemy lines.
I wanted Gen. Steele to see your f aces when you heard.
Cold Steele?
It's his doing that your recommendation passed.
- Johnny's congressional?
- Congressional?
Everybody out in the trenches.
Quick.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Do you want to get killed?
Not particularly.
"Hey, you two."
Outside with you.
- Must you two always be the last?
"-Oh, yeah?"
You try jumping in those trenches first.
Everybody jumps in on top of you.
How do you think I got my hernia?
Ugh.
"Go on, let's go."
Aha.
Aha.
Aha.
So it got to be Christmas Day in Stalag 17.
"You ask me, it was more like the 4th of July with all the fireworks that were to go off and bust the camp wide open."
It sure started off innocently enough with a party going on in every barracks.
"I love you, I love you"
Is all that I can say
"I love you, I love you"
The same old words I'm saying in the same old way
"I love you, I love you"
Three words that are divine
And now my dear I'm waiting to hear
The words that make you mine
"Come on, Animal, let's trip the light fantastic."
Leave me alone.
"Ah, don't cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive."
Snap out of it.
I wasn't sure if you cared about me being here and him not.
- I do not.
- Right.
Because you are a guest.
And this is probably your summer home.
He used to bring other women here so he could cheat on my mother.
"So, no family vacations."
"Only horrible, traumatic ones."
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
(LAWNMOWER)
(ENGINE STOPS)
You never smell cut grass in the city.
I don't find you charming.
"You are just like him, and I hope you learn to take responsibility for yourself before you destroy the lives of people who care about you."
(STRAINS)
This is really nice.
"Thanks, Dad."
"So, how's it been up here?"
It's been good.
I've really enjoyed all the alone time.
I'm sorry about the scheduling problem.
Will you admit that you made a mistake?
I don't think that's necessary.
It was a simple misunderstanding.
Could happen to anyone.
Was anybody speaking to you?
- I thought I was part of the conversation.
"- Well, you weren't supposed to be."
"In fact, you're not even supposed to be here."
I am.
Does that make sense?
You are the scheduling problem I was referring to.
Either your informant is bad or someone's taking the mickey.
Now can you tell me who gave you this shitty tip?
You'd better cross your fingers he's forgotten your face.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Hello?
Now?
I'm coming.
I have to go.
What about the debriefing on the whores?
Start without me.
And be ready.
We're doing it again tonight.
Where are you taking me?
Nowhere.
The road ends here.
You didn't realise it was a trap?
I give you information about the squat and you charge straight in.
"I saw you leaving the hotel, you and your guys."
Someone from your team has enquired several times about this case.
Who the fuck are you protecting?
Don't say anything.
"I've got the dealer, the bullet."
It's easy to follow the story.
Get lost.
We both made a mistake.
There's nothing left to say.
Even in 15 years.
Fuck.
Yes.
This is Arnaud Ledoré.
The judge is going to search the mayor's home tomorrow morning.
"The documents he's looking for are in a safe, and the key is in the left drawer of the desk."
"Inaho insists that she is an imposter, but there's no telling just how much he can see."
Have you eaten?
In a bit.
Let me find a good place to leave off.
You've been this way since we were little.
"When you're into something, everything else fades away."
Here.
"Thanks, Yuki."
"You've heard, right?"
"About Asseylum's, uh..."
Yeah.
That proclamation seemed to prove everything you've been saying.
"It all seems a little too convenient, and if that really were the genuine Princess Asseylum, would she think of a founding a kingdom in Earthspace?"
Slaine Troyard.
That douchebag who shot my dear little brother?
Thanks.
"But watch your language, Yuki."
It doesn't matter if she's real or not anymore.
I don't think anyone would bother to listen to her.
Even if she tried to broker a peace between Earth and Mars again.
"About the attack on Earth, Milord, if there are no problems, I will get preparations underway."
Milord Slaine?
I'm listening.
Proceed as planned.
"Yes, Milord."
Her Highness has yet to-.
She will wake up soon.
I know it.
"I eagerly await that day, Milord."
But... tragedies do happen.
Milord?
It's nothing.
And you to me.
You are.
What?
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
I've -
- I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
I have to go.
"Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier,"
"The more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
"What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go..."
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
If the two of you love each other --
You going somewhere?
"Uh, my mom's."
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while,"
So...
I thought that...
"The only thing left, is forced execution."
"I heard, from Shi Yoon..."
That what you say or what you do...
Not of it is genuine.
And that it's all part of a mission.
"All I want to do is tell you the truth, Mother."
"If you do this, you will be kicked out without compensation."
Don't listen to anything Shi Yoon says.
He said that he will be the shadow who protects this neighborhood.
"But in reality, nothing will change."
"You, as well as Shi Yoon... will lose this fight."
This is... a fight that you can't win.
Do you think so?
"Wow, this guy is really getting on my nerves."
"Why don't you stop, and turn yourselves in?"
Wow...
Here you are...
I learned from you too.
"You can't say you have nothing to do with Park Seon Woo, can you?"
"- Sir, we'll go first."
"- Sir, congratulations!"
"- Oh, sure."
Go ahead!
- Yes.
"Good work, and thank you."
"We will win, no matter what."
That's right.
Let's go.
[Neighborhood Hero]
"If we just catch Park Seon Woo, we can catch the rest of them easily."
Yong Moon Plan.
"You're operating this company, correct?"
Hmm.
This one must be very good-looking for you to go to all this trouble.
I hate lipstick.
I can't stand it.
That's not a good color for you.
Did you try the samples I brought home?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.
What do you want to do for dinner?
I don't care about dinner.
I'm upset.
Can't you see that I'm upset?
How should I know?
You're always so relieved when you cancel your dates.
This is not a date.
We're just agreeing to eat at the same table.
"Then why does it matter how you look, unless you think something might happen with this one?"
"Mother, would you stop calling him ""this one."""
It sounds like you're picking out a lobster.
And nothing's going to happen.
He just likes the way I teach.
- You need more color.
- More color than this?
- Yes.
Would you sit down and let me do it?
- All right.
- Don't make me look like a clown.
- You won't look like a clown.
"Here, you have to blend."
- Where's the hairpiece?
- Here.
Do you want me to make you something before I leave?
"-Yeah, I'm romping in the fields now."
[KNOCKS]
ROBERTS:
Hey.
"This won't take long, Roberts."
"M.E.'s finding was suicide, right?"
He didn't have doubts?
I read the report on the Santini case.
I talked with Sipowicz and Kelly.
I also read her diary.
That's pretty sad reading.
"I never actually gave her any drugs, right?"
What I read in that diary made me sick.
"Lieutenant, let's remember she was a junkie, huh?"
-lt's not like you can take their word.
-You took control of a weak...
"... suffering,dependentperson."
You beat her.
-You made sexual use of her--
-But I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her.
"Which is what I understood this inquiry to be all about, right?"
"I mean, you don't see anything criminal coming out of this, do you?"
-You put in for retirement.
-l need three years for full vesting.
Today!
I don't care what you lose in vesting or in benefits.
I won't have you in this precinct or pass you on.
You fight me...
... I'llturnthepackageover tolad with a recommendation to dismiss.
I'm gone.
Fancy iced me.
Told me he'd smear me if I fought him.
"Instead, you'll go with Jimmy."
You come with me.
Have a good time.
Sit in the sun.
Take a couple days off.
We'll have a good time.
"When you come back, you'll go back to Karen."
"Please, there's no other way."
No divorce.
We're not animali.
No divorce.
She'll never divorce him.
"She'll kill him, but not divorce him."
You going to pay us?
Just give us the fucking money!
I can't.
I swear.
Let's go.
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
Lions?
"I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!"
Just throw him over the moat.
I'll get the money!
"They must really feed each other to the lions down there, 'cause the guy gave the money right up."
I'll get the money.
We got to spend the rest of the weekend at the track.
They mean business.
"Then, I couldn't believe what happened."
"When we got home, we were all over the newspaper."
At first I didn't even know why we got picked up.
Then I found out the guy we roughed up had a sister working as a typist for the FBI.
I couldn't believe it.
Are you saying that my brother is a faggot?
"I'm saying I don't know who sent that postcard, and I don't fucking care!"
None of us cares... about Felix.
We just came for the free booze.
"- Left or right, Paul?"
- Go fuck yourself!
Left or right?
- Left.
- Left it is.
Bastard!
No!
You bastard.
Paul was right.
"We weren't Felix's friends, not properly"
"But I did speak to him on the night of the party and he was gentle, Justin."
"He was vulnerable and lonely, but he had a kind soul."
He wouldn't want this.
You didn't know him at all.
He wouldn't want this cruelty.
I'm sure of it.
Perhaps you're right.
I'll accept part of what you say.
"Felix was flawed... crippled, even."
But we came from the same line.
We were forged in the same fire.
This weakness was not what he was made of.
All this is in his name.
"But if he was watching, he'd be sickened by it."
"We are a proud family, Gemma."
People like you can't understand that.
Shame drove him to do what he did.
And pride demands payment for that slight.
we'll have to leave town.
What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town and closes her station?
"- Without gas, we're done for!"
- What?
Don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?
The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!
"Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago."
"Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?"
"Oh, he can do it."
He's got the horsepower.
"So, what do you want him to do?"
Fix the road!
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!
Order in the court!
Seems like my mind has been changed for me.
- Yeah!
- No!
Nice ruling.
"Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner."
"That's OK, Stickers."
You can take Bessie.
"Man, you get to work with Bessie!"
I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that.
Bessie?
Who's Bessie?
"This here is Bessie, finest road-pavin' machine ever built."
I'm hereby sentencing you to community service.
You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.
What?
This place is crazy!
"I know this may be a bad time right now, but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees."
Ma?
Jesus.
This won't be easy for any of us.
But I want you to know that we're here today because we care about you.
"-What was this, your idea?"
-All we ask is that you listen.
"Adriana, you want to begin?"
"""Christopher, I love you very much."
"""My only dream is that we have a happy life together."
"""The last few months, things have got very bad with us..."
"""because of you using drugs all the time."
"-""You're high all the time and I can't take it."""
"-Be specific, hon."
"""When we first started going out, we made love all the time."
"-""Now, because of the drugs..."""
"-Jesus, is this fucking necessary?"
Go ahead.
"""...you can no longer function as a man."
"""Last week when I came home to learn that you had killed our dog..."
"""that was the final straw."""
You killed the dog?
What'd you do that for?
-It was an accident.
-Was it barking?
He sat on her while he was high.
-Jesus Christ.
-I fell asleep.
She got suffocated or something.
"Are you done, Adriana?"
You killed little Cosette?
"I ought to suffocate you, you little prick!"
"Tony, we're going in order."
"He's our man, Leo."
"OK, so he disliked Dave Stubbs' world view?"
What about the others?
Why not?
Why stop at one?
Especially if you have a supposed philosophical justification for it.
I read his articles.
All that struff about the universe being indifferent to pain and suffering.
"And there being no point in using terms like ""good"" and ""evil""."
You remember the piece I told you about?
This is a guy who sees no objection to people suffering if it is necessary for the production of a great man.
I don't know.
Hello?
Tom?
It's Nikki.
Is this a bad moment?
"Ah, no worse than usual."
You sound like you're in a train station.
"Yeah, there's Lots of people coming and going here."
Listen.
The paper in Dave Stubbs' stomach.
It's an article he wrote for Ethics Today.
"Before he was buried alive, I think he was forced to swallow it."
Who would want to make him eat his own words?
The creep who doesn't need a crutch.
You shouldn't be using that in here.
It's police business.
Tom?
Where are you?
I'll tell you later.
I've gotta go.
sorry.
Welcome to Scabland.
"It was disgusting, but beautifully photographed."
- It was supposed to be disgusting.
- I'm sure it was.
"Mom, all this stuff."
Excuse me.
"All of this equipment, it can't be here."
We won't leave all of this equipment here for everybody to trip over.
We are not cretins.
She's handling it.
"Right, Mom, you are handling it?"
- This lighting sucks.
- Can we do something about the lighting?
"I don't think so, ma'am."
I don't know.
"It's a community college, we'll have to cope."
Think documentary.
"Mom, please."
People will be showing up here soon.
"Lorelai, I'm perfectly capable of handling this."
No one will be inconvenienced.
Okay.
I'm just gonna let everyone deal with all of this... because I need to relax and get a cup of coffee... and maybe hammer a nail into my head.
"You're not needed here, Lorelai."
Go get your coffee.
Relax.
"You're going to redo your makeup later, aren't you?"
Maybe an Irish coffee.
I haven't even heard of half these bands.
I love that about this place.
Lane would want to live here.
Who's Slint?
"Wouldn't be fair to you, or to us either."
Slow us down to a walk and make us carry double provisions.
"Besides, it's more of a risk than I want to see you take."
"Believe me, that's my only reason for making this decision."
"If you don't like my way of doing it, do it yourself."
- You can have my share.
"- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?"
"Well, thank you very much."
You'll not leave this town without me.
We'll leave without you.
You'll wait here and like it.
"All right, come on."
Let's get going.
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.
"If that female iceberg comes out and wants to tag along, smack her down."
Wonder what's happened now.
"Oh, well."
"You know, I know a couple of people used to fool around like that... and they got children now."
"You, uh"
- You still want to go along?
"Not only do I still want to go, I am going."
"All right, come on."
Let's get going.
Come on.!
Mush!
Mush!
Come on.!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on!
Mush!
"- No, no."
You're just a reflection.
The real Myka's in Las Vegas on a mission with Pete.
What?
"No, no, I'm not!"
Artie!
See?
That's exactly what I mean.
You just don't do it.
Turn that thing off.
"Artie, if I'm in Vegas with Pete, then how can I be here?"
Just no!
Just don't turn it off!
"Whatever that thing is, it's never getting out of here."
Lewis Carroll's Alice.
"You're so sweet, so innocent, so not true."
This woman was as mad as a hatter.
"And Charles Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, was not writing books."
He was chronicling this young woman's descent into a sociopathic madness in all of his books.
He didn't write these books.
These are Warehouse fabrications...
Brilliant fabrications...
To hide the truth about that mirror.
Here's a report from Warehouse field agents.
The mirror crossed paths with Alice Liddell.
I bet it crossed paths.
When?
- Before the murders.
- Terrifying.
"Yeah, and there's no mention of where the mirror came from."
"Okay, well, where do any of these things come from?"
"Artie, these agents, they trapped her inside of the mirror."
We'll see you later.
"Come on, Mark."
Go!
"Dad, my pocket money!"
"Money, money, money..."
It's all you think about.
I thought you might like this.
Thanks Dad.
"Thanks I'm good, but thanks."
"Come on, sit down."
Stop it!
Come on!
- Morning!
- What do we got?
Dead woman's bag was found in a hotel room.
"No wallet and no phone, so no ID."
Didn't she check in?
Was checked in under the name of Ben Jackinoff.
So I think it's fair to say that's a pseudonym.
No details yet but I've got something to show you.
- Potential murder weapon?
"- Alright, I'll check that in a bit."
- We got a description of a man?
- Fairly general.
Well how was it paid for?
Didn't the hotel take a credit card swipe?
Cash and there is only CCTV on the outside of the building.
But the manager did offer us something useful.
He recalls the woman going outside to take a mobile phone call.
And it's time coded so we can trace it.
"Yeah but without knowing what network she was on, how long is that gonna take?"
Right now it's all I've got.
Access...
- Confidential?
"No, no, no."
I don't know anything.
"The last time I talked to her it was just, ""The kid this, the kid that."""
"According to our records, you spoke to her on the 15th."
- Three weeks ago?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that makes sense."
I...
She was going to Vegas.
"Oh, is that right?"
Vegas?
She asked me to go along with her.
It was gonna be her treat.
I couldn't go because I had to work.
We were gonna stay at one of those ritzy new places.
"The, um, Bellage..?"
- The Bellagio?
Right.
- Yeah.
- With the contortionist.
- I've never been.
You've been going through my desk.
It never crossed my mind when I was a younger woman... that I'd be this age and not have kids.
"Somehow in my mind, kids."
"Raising them, making them good people."
That's what I wanted.
"Then I met you, and I realized that I'd be... trading my dreams so that we could live yours."
We sacrificed all of that so we could do good.
We have done good.
I was never prouder when you fought to make hate crimes a capital and federal offense.
I'm very disappointed in you cowpokes.
"We're playing our inaugural round of ""Wild West and Witches,"""
and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.
(spits) Patooie.
"We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon."
It looks ridiculous.
"And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
- Yeah.
- Very.
- Incredibly so.
Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
- Yeah.
- Very.
- Incredibly so.
"All right, fine."
Let's just play.
We should go easy on him.
Amy's out with Stuart tonight.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that Sheldon's patented blend of condescension and no sex isn't enough to hold on to a woman?
"Cluck, cluck, cluck."
"What are we, ladies at a quilting bee?"
Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?
Sorry.
Creepy Tepee.
Annie Ogly.
Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me."
I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here.
(spurs jingling  jangling)
- It's you.
- You are.
How dare you tell me to keep it down?
I'm here with my better half here.
Go fuck yourself!
"You can't come into my place where I'm with my friends, drinking, playing pinball, having a fun time, celebrating."
You're not welcome.
Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here!
I'm not kidding you.
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I hate that man.
MAN:
"Hey, sweetheart."
What?
What are you staring at?
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Thought I smelled gasoline.
That's me.
- You look lost.
- I'm not.
Wanna come hang out?
- You want something to drink?
- Sure.
"All right, sit down."
"NARRATOR: 'When she had first spoken to the lowlife at the bar, 'it was the first time in four days Ashley heard her own voice out loud."
"'She became devastatingly aware of her own desperation, loneliness and torment."
'Quickly she could take no more and went home.'
- (DOGS BARKING)
- Nobody here is in pain.
This is a no-kill shelter.
We have plenty of available foster parents who are able to take care of them for as long as necessary to find a home.
- Do you have any cats?
"You see, Trixie, now that this young Tyler has brought more money into the play"
I shall arrange for you to have more to do.
- And you may become a star.
- A real star?
A great star.
Possibly as big as-as a planet.
"Well, where is she?"
Where's Miss Chummy?
"Well, I've called her twice, she's over there with the judge."
"Tell everybody else to go home, I'll attend to her."
Okay.
"Alright, Miss Chummy we'll go through that new number you've been telling me about."
- I brought my own piano player.
"- You wouldn't trust ours, heh?"
"Yes, but he knows all my routines."
"He does, huh?"
Mm-hmm.
[wailing]
"Listen, being that it's a new number today just for the sake of novelty, please try to sing the same notes what he plays."
"- Alright, ahem."
- Music.
[clears throat] [falsetto singing]
What have you got in your mouth?
Firecrackers?
Must you give out with that shrill gargling?
"Well, I'm a dramatic coloratura."
Coloratura?
Music.
[piano music]
* Fluttering chirping birds of spring *
* Come back to your home in the north and sing * [falsetto singing]
What do you think you're doing now?
combat strength.
"Yes, one penis after another."
"General, Guillaume, every month..."
I recieve a limited supply of penicillin from the United States.
And what do you think my priority should be?
To save a sodomite who likes sunflowers... or a wounded American?
- Now please excuse me.
"- General Cork... it's Coronel Eliot, sir."
He says it's urgent.
"Be quick about it, Coronel."
We're at war.
What?
"No, no, that makes no sense."
Let's start over from the beginning.
"Right, first we want a creamy soup."
"But our soup is creamy, like mud."
Tomato soup?
"Yes, I think that's alright."
And don't forget the bleach.
"I don't know, it looks like we'll have to look after her stomach."
Anything else?
"But ""why isn't there any fresh fish in Naples""?"
"Coronel, you don't have to remind me I prohibited fishing."
The Bay of Napoles is mined from here to Sicily.
"But when Mark Cork gives that Renaissance dinner there will be... fish cooked with mayonaise, understand?"
How do you know?
Try the aquarium...
Soldier...
Fish cooked with mayonaise.
My god!
Do you think she'll like that?
- I have no idea.
Because my husband doubts my love for him.
And happy...?
I'm happy because the first time
"In a long time, i'm hopeful."
For us.
( music playing over stereo )
Would you dance with me?
"I just want to hold you,"
"Look into your eyes,"
"Be in love with you,"
And feel you being in love with me.
Would you?
The most beautiful song
For the most beautiful woman.
"- You got this, girl."
This is your special... and you're special.
"Ugh, yuck."
"Well, it'll be great."
- You sure about that?
- What did you say to me?
- I asked if you're sure about your performance.
You don't seem that confident.
"- Well, what do you know?"
- I know a lot.
I'm you.
"I just don't want you to get so nervous that you mess up, like that one time in show choir when you auditioned for a solo and they couldn't hear your voice because you had one of those inside farts."
"You know, like one of those farts that's like--"
"- Yeah, I know."
Why are you bringing this up now?
You don't have to be so rude.
- I'm not being rude.
"Well, he sounds like one."
He can spell haemoglobin.
He has a little trouble with words like dog and cat.
(Laughing)
"Where do you practise, doctor?"
"Indianapolis, Indiana."
Good Samaritan Hospital out there.
What brings you to Marrakech?
"We were attending a medical convention in Paris and I thought, inasmuch as we were in Europe, I'd come and see Morocco again."
Daddy liberated Africa.
I was stationed up in Casablanca at an army field hospital during the war.
"- Do you live in Morocco, Mr Bernard?"
- No.
I suppose you came directly from Paris.
"No, we looked in on Lisbon and Rome."
- (Hank) And Casablanca.
- And Casablanca.
I hope you will have time to truly enjoy Marrakech.
Let's see.
"We'll have, at the most, three days."
"You will, naturally, be stopping at the Hotel Mamounia or Le Menara?"
Why do you ask?
Because they are hotels for tourists of good taste.
0h.
"Do you live in France, Mr Bernard?"
- Sometimes.
- Do you eat snails?
(Laughing) When I'm lucky enough.
"If you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails."
Thank you for the invitation.
That's alright.
We tried everything to get rid of them.
I am not a gutless coward.
"If I leave like this, I will be sinful for the rest of my life."
I won't live peacefully.
And I will be a criminal forever.
I won't leave.
I come to express my support.
You can't lose in this case.
Because your master's name is so important.
"But now, I know that, you are a real brave and quixotic hero."
I believe that you are innocent.
I'll wait for you.
Good speech!
Will you wait for me?
You'll be released at 5 pm tomorrow.
How about the final address?
They can do nothing to me.
"They can't imagine that, you studied law in UK too."
"Tomorrow, you'll take my place."
Hubby...
You'll handle Foon's life.
You sent me to study law in UK... isn't it because you felt boring?
Of course not!
The world is so big!
"I think, it's a good deed... to let you see the world, is that right?"
"Hubby, I didn't study law in UK."
They rejected me.
"So, what did you study in UK?"
Fashion design.
What did you say?
Time's up.
I studied fashion design.
Fashion design.
- if you're desperate.
"- Someone needs your help, Michael."
Bottom line:
Until you figure out who burned you... you're not going anywhere.
"- What do you think of these shoes, Michael?"
Fantastic!
I have just the right dress.
- Are they real?
"- Well, they look real."
Isn't that what counts?
"You're getting a fake identity, Michael.I can't get fake shoes?"
Place is up here somewhere.
"You know, you go ahead."
I'm gonna-
"Oh, that's pretty."
A fake identity is known in the spy trade as a false flag.
Used to be you could make your own documents with a printer and a laminator.
"These days, though, I.D.'s have magnetic strips,holograms and infrared watermarks."
- Hey.
- You need a pro.
-Yes.
What can I do for you?
-I lost my passport and driver's license.
"I heard, uh, I could get some new ones here."
All you gotta do is report 'em stolen.
They'll send you replacements.
Right.
But the thing is...
"I'm going on a trip soon, and I heard you could do it here more quickly... and more quietly."
That might be possible- for a fee.
A fee is not an issue.
Come on back.
And I believe I know what key you will sing in.
F-major...
You have no right to parade your ignorant assumptions...
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.
- Everyone else was.
"- Mrs. Jennings is not ""everyone""."
I like her.
She talks about things.
We never talk about things.
"If you can say nothing appropriate, limit your remarks to the weather."
Surely they have enough reeds for a Moses basket.
You know what they're saying?
"Word is, you've developed a taste for certain company."
And why not?
A man like you in his prime...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.
Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than of you.
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.
Besotted...
An excellent match.
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?
"As long as I've been here, and I came 15 years back."
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.
He loved a ward to the family.
"I have no problem with that, Mr. President, as long as we realize we are working against a clock."
I want all departments present to work up an open versus covert containment strategy and report back to me in 30 minutes.
"In the meantime, I want Health Services to issue guidelines, but only to be distributed internally."
That is all.
I'll be in my office.
David.
"Give us a second, please, Aaron."
"Of course, sir."
Secret Service just received a phone call from the west Los Angeles police department.
Alan Milliken is dead.
What?
He was found 15 minutes ago in his home.
All signs point to a heart attack.
It isn't possible.
"Well, apparently, it is."
You told me Sherry was on her way over there about an hour ago.
She changed her mind.
Made some phone calls from her car.
Came straight back here.
"David, is that what she told you?"
Yeah.
And where is she now?
Resting.
"Aaron, take me to Sherry."
"Yes, sir."
She's right this way.
Hasn't your shift ended?
I stayed on.
"I sense it's a difficult day, and I wanted to be here for you."
- I appreciate that.
"- Right in there, sir."
Sherry.
I'll tell you one thing.
"Whatever he did, you sure ain't copping to it."
Would you?
"Never trust a con, cowboy!"
They ain't get through life being honest.
Where they hiding you these days?
Around.
"Hey, you wanna see something?"
Look at that.
Lost them on a lady.
"Yeah, they took the big toe from the left foot and a pinky from my right."
That is why I walk with a gimp.
"Yeah, I can't shuffle cards like I used to but the ladies sure like it."
"Oh, no."
You look like you have seen a ghost.
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.
- That is why I can't get a raise.
"- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll."
You believe that?
- Why would they lie?
- They're just having a little bit of fun with you.
I'm not laughing.
"Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm."
He could have died.
That ain't my problem.
"You caused the accident, not me."
Where're you going?
"Take a leak, you wanna watch?"
"I'll be right back, don't just bail me now."
Son of a bitch.
- Hello?
My bread!
My bread!
How was it?
"They just think about eating, and don't even see a car coming."
How do parents teach them?
"The reason I asked to see you is that, next month there will be personnel changes."
Were you aware?
Please help me.
I believe you are the only member that can help me.
Am I?
"I thought you had backups, aside from me, since you have control over the 3 billion Won welfare assets."
You seem different.
It's... a little difficult.
"Since civilians are complaining that the children are starving, we'll just have to work harder."
There must be a way.
"Just a bunch of numbers, nothing difficult."
Not like it's never been done before right?
I'll just believe you.
Go on.
"Thank you, Yun Seong."
"Oh, is your injury hurting?"
Wh-what are you doing?
"Really, I'm fine."
Put me down.
"Really, there's nothing wrong."
Put me down.
You can put me down now.
How come it's so high?
"What is this, graffiti?"
My height measurements.
"From when I moved here at 7 years old, until I was 17."
My father measured my height there.
- Istanbul wasn't that long ago.
"You like rooftops overwindows... you like angles with the target on your right-hand side, 'causeyou're left-handed."
That's right.
I knew I liked you.
Put it on.
"[ Scoffs ] Michael... is this whatyou reallywant, huh?"
Helping out civilians with their little problems... trying to get your governmentjob back?
It's pathetic.
- You're better than that.
- [ Clicks ]
Let's go.
We have a big day ahead of us.
I gotta turn you in.
There'll be questions.
It'll be past lunch before we're done.
[ Chuckles ] Turn me in?
"A lot of secrets, a lot of enemies."
"Think it'd be a short stay, don'tyou?"
"Now, don'tyou think we could come to some arrangement?"
- I don't think so.
- Now be honest with me.
If circumstances were different... do you think that we could--
Not in this lifetime.
Perhaps the next one.
- [ Crash ] - [ Woman Screams ]
[ People Screaming]
- Indictments came down yesterday.
- That was quick.
They found the leak in the U.S. Attorney's office... and Evelyn-- wow.
They're gonna be workin' up her file foryears.
"She was a very, very bad girl."
I managed to keep you out of it so far.
Hello again.
"Hamit Milonkovic, you are charged with deprivation of his daughter."
Shit genuine.
Why are you locked?
Now you're crazy.
I have not seen Zana since she disappeared.
You said nothing about it to have arrived.
It was because he wanted her to die there?
That's why you cut the fire rope?
'You had the courage to blow up the bomb?
-No Hear what I said?
Shit genuine !
-You Have evidence for this?
"Zana has been there many times, willingly, but for a long time."
The girl's apartment was treated for minor cuts before disappearing.
The blood test confirms that it is Zana.
Do not answer.
I want to talk to my client.
Okay.
She arrived a few days ago.
Something happened to her.
I was afraid that she would get hurt.
"I would give a time to talk again, but failed."
Zana disappeared and I snapped.
Then you cut the fire rope to protect her?
Do you understand me?
I was afraid that she would get hurt.
She was not afraid of anything.
She could get hurt.
Where were you from 9 at 9:30 am when the bomb went off?
-With Him.
-Discutíamos The visitation agreement.
"- I need more to work with, much more."
- There is no more.
Lucas was drunk and brutal.
"When he tried to beat me, I killed him."
Killing in self-defense is understandable.
"But you hid the body, like a criminal."
- I know.
- She was fighting for her life.
The state is sending a prosecutor for one purpose: to convict Selena.
I've seen him work.
He's thoroughly competent and relentless as law itself.
Tell her to come in.
There must be something you haven't told me.
"- He tried to kill me, I killed him first."
- But you hid the body!
Why?
"Come in, Allison."
Allison.
I was never happier to see anyone in my life.
Are you all right?
"- Hi, Ted."
"- Hi, Allison."
I can testify about Lucas.
I saw him beat her.
"It'll help, believe me."
- We appreciate you coming back.
"- You'll get her off, won't you?"
We're gonna do the best we can.
But the jury decides on the one thing: evidence.
"Now, it adds up to this:"
"We have a murder, and a defense that's too simple to be good."
It's open to attack from many sides.
- Yes we can.
She declared war on gossip girl.You brought this on us.
"That's,that's not fair."
Serena was just trying to help everybody.
What do you know about anything
Besides your label was the only one that was true.
"You mean what she said about the ""insider""?"
Are you crazy?
You're friend with Nate Archibald
You played on the soccer team.You got into Yale
You got the lead role in the school play
"You got published in ""the New Yorker """
You had sex with a teacher.
Plus you dated the most popular girl in school
And ignored the rest of us.
No.
I meant them.
You pretend not to be like us but you are... to the bone.
And you should have known better.
Thank you.
Kudos S. Way to go out with a bang.
Now what did you want to tell me before?
Oh.
It doesn't matter now.
- It just happened.
- Leave me alone.
You're not mad at me because of that.
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.
Stop telling me what I feel.
We're just doing what we always do--finding excuses.
Well...
I won't do it anymore.
"- All right, listen up."
- [chuckles]
"I've decided to make some positive life changes, and I am giving up drugs, selling and using."
Fucking have at it.
- [Ron] Holy shit!
"- [Cassie] Oh, my God."
"- Oh, my God, Edgar."
- Take whatever you want.
"Edgar, there are children here."
What do you have in a nice house hallucinogen?
"I'm glad you asked--I have some acid, mescaline, and oh, my favorite organic hallucinogen of choice, mushrooms."
"Oh, hell yes."
- See you later.
- Yup.
[sighs] [knocks]
Yeah?
"Hey, uh, I need to know something."
What--what is your plan for me here?
We're working the plan.
"You're in the Cellar, honing your craft."
"No, my craft's already honed."
I'm killing it every night in the Cellar.
All right?
I need the Main Stage.
Jesus.
You kids and the Main Stage are like lemmings heading off a cliff.
"Well, how about a straight answer?"
"No chickens, no lemmings, no no struggle, just a straight fucking answer."
You hear Barton coming out of your mouth?
"You think 'cause some guy offers you the moon and the stars, he can actually deliver?"
Barton's offering cash...
- [scoffs] - ...and stage time
It isn't loaded.
- What?
- I took the precaution of removing the pellets.
Which I thought was clever.
I'm more than a little offended...
- at you not keeping your promise.
- You fool!
"I say, handle her with care."
She's most precious.
"- Sit down, Wooster."
- Thank you.
I am dripping with fatigue.
- Won't you sit down?
"- You may as well, Miss Lowman."
You may be here for quite a while yet.
You park on the plush and I'll come and look after you.
- There you are.
- Idiot!
Don't say things like that.
I only did what I did for your own good.
"- If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Miss Lowman."
- Not at all.
Lovers quarrel.
"- Keep quiet, Wooster, and sit down!"
"- Oh, thank you very much."
"Get me a chair, will you?"
I'll get one myself.
Mustn't strain the arm of the law.
"Now, Miss Lowman, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble... if you'll hand over the other half of those plans."
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know that isn't true.
Why don't you give him whatever he wants for my sake?
I feel like I ruined everything.
You didn't ruin anything.
Not a damn thing.
I want you to be happy.
"You didn'tsee it, did you?"
Yes.
Yeah?
She knew.
What?
She was drawing angels.
Two years later.
It was the meanness of the campaigns... the almost complete lack of candor and honesty... that turned the voters off..
I think that these parties are demonizing each other.
They're projecting our own personal fears and anxieties... onto the national stage.
People don't like it.
"People are very, very unsatisfied at the moment."
It makes them complacent because they don't see any possibility of change.
2004...
Is there a dark horse candidate out there for the Democrats?
"Well, I'm hearing a lot about Russ McCallum."
- Governor of Virginia.
"- Yeah, he might do what Carter..."
"Hey, I told her to watch."
Who?
Peter's friend Gwen.
She'll be there tonight.
"Oh, God."
"Look, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make that one tonight."
"Come on, you can't keep blowing this thing off."
I'm not.
I've got an interview with the governor.
I gotta be in Richmond at 8:00 in the morning.
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
It's gonna be awesome.
"Now, turn off the lights and go."
Not all the way!
Hello.
"Yeah, three..."
"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
Guys?
"Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
"Oh, tell her, baby."
Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
They won't be!
"Okay, what is going on with you guys?"
It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction and a beat-up van
I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
"Whoa, what-what happened to your wrist?"
Oh.
It's an allergic reaction.
So take it off.
"Robin, once you have a child, anything that gets you even remotely close to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters."
Better the sores weep than I.
"Hey, hold on."
That slut just got here.
How'd she get beer already?
Do you see a ring on that finger?
Whoa.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
I told you Schnickelfritz.
You made me bet on Equipoise.
I clocked him this morning.
He was running like a doll.
You clocked him!
Why don't I clock you?
Another one of his enterprises was the distillery.
He ran a bar right in our barracks selling schnapps at two cigarettes a shot.
The boys called it the ﬂamethrower but it wasn't really that bad.
"We brewed the stuff out of old potato peels and once in a while, a couple of strings off the red cross parcels just to give it a little ﬂavor."
"It ain't fair, Harry."
"I'm telling you, it ain't fair."
My Betty.
Ain't she beautiful?
She married an orchestra leader.
So what?
There's other women.
Not for me.
Betty.
- Betty.
"-Forget Betty, Animal."
I'll get you a date with some of those Russian women.
You'll get me a date?
Sure.
I'll get you into the Russian compound.
How?
Pinky Miller from Barracks 8 tried getting over there and they shot him in the leg.
"It takes a gimmick, Animal."
I figured us a little gimmick.
- You did?
-Sharp.
Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
You're welcome.
Sorry.
- Are you well?
"- Fine, thanks."
Sorry to disturb you.
"You're welcome, it's my route."
I'll take you.
I often see you on this road.
- You're not a local?
- No.
You seem to have problems.
One problem!
"In any case, every affair has its own problems."
Anything over a hundred years old is considered an antique.
What are you talking about?
You don't work underground?
"Because of this bone, you think we're looking for treasure or antiques?"
I don't think that.
I'm almost sure of it.
You haven't come for the ceremony?
The cat's out of the bag!
Our crew was joking with the kid.
They said that we've come for treasure.
We didn't want people to know why we're really here.
His family lives in the village.
It's a small village too.
That's why he believed it.
"Later, we told him the secret."
"When I was little, I felt the same."
"Whenever someone told me a secret, I always wanted to tell others."
"And in the end, I would."
I think I enjoyed telling it more than I enjoyed keeping it.
"Oh, yeah?"
Since when?
"Well, since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia."
All those things they taught me at Harvard.
"Mrs. MacNeil, since the day I joined the Jesuits I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism."
Not one.
"Yeah, well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed."
And needs an exorcist.
"Father Karras, it's my little girl."
Then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why?
I don't understand.
"-To begin with, it could make things worse."
"-Oh, how?"
"Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted."
That takes time.
"-Yeah, but--"
"-Meanwhile, your daughter--"
-You could do it yourself.
-No.
I'd need Church approval...
-...and that's rarely given.
-But-- Uh....
-Could you see her?
"-Yes, I could."
"I could see her as a psychiatrist, but I--"
"Oh, not a psychiatrist."
She needs a priest.
"She's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world, and they sent me to you."
Now are you gonna send me back to them?
"-Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?"
-You don't understand--
Just say it.
Unless you tear that notebook up.
If it's really so important to you...
Are we going to meet tomorrow?
I don't mind...
If I ever catch you...
"Is that you, Bernau?"
Just wait!
We know it was you who made a hole in Karel's boat!
You bastard!
Me?
"It wasn't me, I swear!"
Stop that!
How dare you lie about that as well?
"It's not enough that he scares the fish away, but..."
Just leave him.
"Look there, sheep!"
"That's right, this kind is from the hillsides."
There were some especially good areas for keeping sheep in Australia and Wallachia during the second half of the 20th century.
Those aren't sheep.
I think they're cows.
Weren't the sheep kind of woolly?
- What's a sheep?
- Perhaps we should get back to our mission.
We aren't here on a school trip.
"We must adjust the program, I think."
"Watch out, a bus!"
People who live like nomads.
Mostly they came from the poor parts of the countryside.
Working under the Sun.
"So I told him, ""You'll know if she starts talking!"""
- But she needed no introduction.
I mean literally I could just kill her.
Okay.
You know how I'd do it?
Rip out her tongue and I'd wrap her own tongue around her freaking neck until she was dead.
Do you know what?
That would be funny.
That would be funny.
You know why?
Because then she couldn't shoot her flipping mouth off and she'd be dead.
And I would win because she's dead!
I added echo for effect.
I like sound.
Now look at the timecode.
"It's the time of the murder, damn!"
This is the first time that someone saying they want to kill someone was their alibi.
Grrr!
Shaye.
"You know,"
"I do what I do, check one two."
Check one two.
"Well, this is the big day."
I'll be witness for the prosecution.
Somebody's ears are going to be burning
"Because I'll be talking about you, testifying about you."
Some say I'll even be lying about you.
"What's that, Larry?"
You want me to tell the truth no matter what?
Then everyone'll know our personal business.
They'll never understand.
What?
I...
I suppose I could do it just for us.
"Hey, you know that guy we met at the exhibition?"
Joe Sandilands?
The Attorney General.
He didn't like the painting either.
(Both laugh)
"Yeah, well he wants me to run."
State parliament.
Oh.
Dutch Patterson's old seat.
It's safe Labor.
"If I get preselection, I'm a certainty."
And is that something you want?
Yeah.
I never thought I had a chance.
I joined Young Labor when I was 16.
Went to God knows how many meetings.
And here all you needed to do was get shot.
You think that's the only reason they've asked me?
I didn't say that.
"No, but you're implying it."
"Well, they did only notice you after the tabloids called you 'hero'."
"OK, fine."
I'll stay at the bar.
If you're going to be negative about it.
What's it got to do with me?
Why is my opinion so significant?
"Well, I care what you do."
You can do what you want.
"All I'm saying is from my experience, politicians tend to be..."
"Let me guess - arrogant, self-indulgent, trough-sniffing arseholes."
"I was going to say sad, mostly."
And how many politicians do you know?
"When I saw you there, I just lost control."
Who are you?
!
I saw the magazine.
I'm really not that kind of person!
Just five minutes.
Let me talk to you?
"I can understand why you are worried because perverts might call you or write you letters,"
but I'm not like that.
So warm.
Just leave me alone.
I'm not that kind of woman.
I'm not a porn model and never have been.
I'm not like that.
I'm not that kind of woman.
I'm not!
Excuse me?
I have to lock the toilets shortly.
What do you think you are doing in my room?
I'm a manager of this apartment.
I can come in.
Can you please leave now?
There's been a lot of female underwear stolen from around here lately.
And?
"And what's more, the daughter of Mr Yamashita who lives across the road, says you often peek into her room."
Have you got any evidence?
I have a proper girlfriend.
Why would I be interested in that school girl?
Look at that.
You've made a stain on the wall.
Are you cleaning the room properly?
That was there when I moved in.
I'll reimburse you at first opportunity
"--Check it, it works --Lucy"
"Yeah, I'm a fool and a simple nurse and no match for your son."
But we'll manage to live without your charity
"Lucy, wait!"
"I'm just saying, if you are standing on principle, then you should return everything"
The bag?
We bought it with our own money.
The bag is ours!
"""It is a good omen, ice is melting in the heart..."""
"--Vasin speaking --Comrade Vasin, this is Kuziatin."
There's a person threatening me with a rifle here
--Where?
"--Here, building # 7"
I'll be right there
These are my mother's earrings.
My most precious possession.
"She lost the second one on purpose, so as to hit where it hurts most"
"Don't worry, Pavel Ivanovich, everything will get resolved"
--You're gathering evidence on me?
--What evidence?
Don't.
"Don't, Galkina."
I can see right through all of you
"--Raya --Yes, Pavel Ivanovich"
--May I get Kostya for 15 minutes?
"--No, his carburator is not working --Got it"
"Zinaida, why are you wasting time in here?"
"Go, start digging!"
"--Dig where, Pavel Ivanovich?"
--Dig dirt on me.
Maybe you'll find some.
I am...
"I am a crystal clear well, please dri..."
I am a crystal clear well...
"-That's beauty, isn't it?"
"-Yes, but we would..."
Mother Nature will outlive us all.
-It's beautiful.
-But we are looking for...
"Yes, yes, a rest."
We have wonderful things here.
"Yes, but we are looking for..."
"It's something, isn't it?"
"Wow, it's like at our home."
"According to the dynamic plan of the landscape development, there should be a hundred years of untouched nature here later."
-Let's continue.
"-Yes, but..."
-Who are you actually looking for?
-A colleague.
"He got lost, We're worried about him."
In our forest nobody can get lost.
"Oh, yeah, in the past horrible things happened here."
"Rabbits ate grass, foxes ate rabbits and bears ate whatever crossed their mind."
But now thank God there is order here.
Look.
"I know a crystal clear well, where the forest is the deepest."
"Dark bracken grows there and in the surroundings, red heather."
"Thank you for your visit, sirs."
We are closing.
"Please, wait."
We've lost our friend here.
"But no one can get lost here, sirs."
-It belongs to the ministry of culture.
"I'm not sure that is how conversation happens, Marcus."
"No, I think that is how conversation happens."
That's right.
"My God, we've got 60 years of conversational experience between us I'm sure we can come up with something."
"Okay, then."
"- So, Fiona."
- You first.
"Will, why did your wife chuck you?"
Marcus!
"No, it's okay."
It's fine.
Good question.
"I'm quite comfortable talking about it, actually."
She chucked me because she was basically going through this whole:
"""I want to find out who I am"", malarkey and thing."
"Which is selfish, considering she had a kid and all that."
And did she find out who she was?
She was a figment of my twisted imagination.
That's who she was.
"Not really, no."
"I'm not sure anyone really does, do they?"
"We know who we are, don't we?"
That's right.
You're a depressive hippie and her weirdo son.
- What are we?
- We're us.
- And what are we not?
- Sheep!
And what does a sheep go?
This was going really well.
I wondered if we'd move into Will's place or someplace new.
What type of car is yours?
How's your gin?
- How was he?
He has a quality that can only be described as... chrome.
- And?
- He seems to wanna help me.
How can he help you?
He didn't say.
He's got great stories.
I'd love to hang out with him again.
Do we have plans?
- Do we have plans when?
- Whenever.
"Yes, Philip, I'd say sometime in the indeterminate future, we may have plans."
Good shoot today?
Can you just leave me alone?
I have to do this.
You're fucking with other people's money here.
"Money, money, money."
What about my integrity?
"You know, I can think of a few other important writers who also took a firm no-press position."
I just wanna know that you've thought it through thoroughly.
I haven't.
"It's a very impulsive decision, and I'm very pleased with myself for that."
"Philip, this is Josh Fawn."
"Josh, this is Philip, who's being a baby and an asshole."
Ciao.
"Yes, we've met before."
We've done some panels together.
Er...
I remember one of them.
"Phil, Josh is going on a promotional tour for his new book."
That's what responsible authors do.

The pies have come.

"Our mate Michael, the best-dressed Bolshevik in Newcastle."
We're all grateful to him for standing up for our right not to have our rubbish collected.
"It used to be I was talking rubbish, or he was talking rubbish, now the whole of Newcastle's talking rubbish"
~ because we can't get it collected.
"~ Hear, hear!"
~ Scott.
"~ Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"All right, seriously."
I love Peter Magath.
Just like I love Michael.
Lifelong friends.
I love that Peter's an original.
"I love that he had a vision of what he could be and he pursued it, even when we laughed."
I love that he has faith in others.
Maybe even in me.
God knows the world needs people like that.

That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.
Why don't they just come right out and tell us what's on their minds?
You're more advanced than a cockroach.
Have you ever tried explaining yourself to one of them?
How many people have seen it?
Ten.
"Twenty, maybe."
Listen to me.
Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant.
Don't go back.
Stay away.
I can't talk about this anymore.
Mr. Leek.
There is a reason... that I ended up in Point Pleasant.
Something brought me there.
Whatever brought you there... brought you there to die.
You're just in time.
They're just about to light this Christmas tree.
They have been for the last two hours.
Isn't that Denise?
Is she okay?
She left Gordon.
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.
Where is he?
Who knows?
Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
He wasn't exactly fond of his mother.
"What's the opposite of an oedipus complex, do you think?"
Sir?
"He was reading Freud, who said the aim of all life is death--matricide."
Could he really have killed his mother?
"These, um..."
Background notes on Spencer:
"Well-connected-- journalism, treasurer for the friends of national Spain."
No criminal convictions?
No.
None that I could find.
What do you make of him?
I'm not sure.
"I'd say a man has to be quite brave to hold the opinions he does, especially at a time like this."
You admire him?
I don't think he's a fool.
"I mean, you read the medical report of..."
"Isaac wolf, the man who got beaten up?"
"I don't think you can blame Spencer for that, sir."
He knew nothing about it.
How do you know?
He told me...
And I believe him.
Margaret Ellis' will-- he had the most to gain from it.
"I still think that Spencer was the likely target, sir."
All right.
[Clock ticking]
Sam:
Arthur Ellis-- who'd want to kill him?
Foyle:
"I don't know, but you probably do."
"My guess is, he probably saw something."
And how was your breakfast this morning?
It went really well.
I can tell that's 100% not true.
"Okay, are you two, like, legit fighting?"
"No, it's fine."
It's just...
"Audrey has some unflattering opinions about my dad, that's all."
"No, they're memories, not opinions."
"And, sometimes, maybe people are going through big things that have absolutely nothing to do with you, Emma."
Big shocker!
"At the most, it's identity theft."
"And, even then, what's the real harm?"
"I'm sorry, Mag."
I-I didn't mean to sound dismissive.
It's just... you've seen the reports of all the hijinks since your unfortunate run-in with Ms. Shaw.
That's a pretty damning understatement.
"- Look, we all grew up here."
- And you left.
You both left.
My family left because of that whole Brandon James mess.
"Miguel, with our particular history,"
I think you should investigate.
(SIGHS)
You know what?
You're right.
Just to be safe.
I know a guy in the bureau back in Phoenix.
He can try to trace the activity.
Take a while.
"But, for now, do not tell Emma."
Okay?
We don't need the whole student body talking.
"No, sorry."
"I was looking for, what are the ovaries?"
"Oh, the o..."
"Yeah, I always mix those two up."
Try not to.
Your future will be brighter.
Can you tell us anything about ovulation or how pregnancy occurs?
"Well, the man's got the sperm, and the woman's got the egg."
"Now, once a month, an egg slides down the Philippine tube towards the uterus."
"The first sperm to reach the egg wins, it gets a medal, it's born, you name him Cory, you push him out the door, and nothing makes sense for the rest of his life."
Congratulations.
You seem to have a thorough understanding of the life cycle.
"- Hey, I live it."
- Any questions?
Yes?
How do you get a girl to say hi?
Michael and Lisa Marie?
- Looks like it.
- Since when?
- Just now.
That was it.
"- What, that?"
- Yeah.
You saw it happen.
- I can't believe it.
"I saw it happen, and I still don't know how it happens."
"Stop obsessing, man."
You're gonna pop a lobe.
You're right.
"I should relax, 'cause this coupling thing, it's just a phase."

"Look, they're here."
Let's just hope that they won't harm the ones who've stayed.
"Padre Miguel, that's the guerrilleros, isn't it?"
- How could we forget about you?
- Help me.
- They mustn't find out who you are.
- We should take off his uniform.
Up here.
We've got injured people out there.
"We need beds, a nurse, and most of all antibiotics."
"I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't here."
He was scared.
He fled.
- And we've only got two vacant beds.
- I need three beds.
Jaime!
- You can't do this.
- This man is injured.
Show some sympathy.
- He's in the militia.
- How cruel!
- Get him out.
I do not take orders from lady straw bosses.
Hey hey.
Was that Miss Krail?
Is she back in her office?
Pining for you.
Pining for you!
- Miss Krail?
- Yes.
"Everything's here all ready for you, Mr. Sandover."
- These are the letters for you to carry.
- Thank you.
- Lita?
- Yes?
"I'm all packed, all ready to go."
All right.
Goodbye.
"Well, I-"
- I just wanted to make sure that you hadn't changed your plans.
About what?
"Oh, well, Sandy, there's so many things that I ought to be doing this weekend."
"But you fly down there quite often, you said."
And you said you might even leave early tomorrow to be in Phoenix around noon.
"And what if I do, Sandy?"
Do you have something to tell me you don't want anybody to know you're telling me?
"Well, yes, as a matter of fact I do."
I-
- I have several more tidbits about people in the office.
- But that's not what I meant.
- It's not?
You promised you'd be there.
"Lita, remember the money I mentioned I was coming into?"
"Well, you're the only one who can advise me."
That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.

Shit.

Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
"He's Mr. Yokomoto, the truant officer."
He's trying to make us go back to school.
Let's go.
That's our hideout.
When do the ghosts get here?
Don't say things like that.
This place could really scare ya.
Come on.
This is where we're gonna live when we run away from home.
"Yeah, you can't be tough if you take orders from your mom or older sister."
That's why we quit school.
"You can't be tough and educated, too."
- Tony!
- Where?
I had a contact with him.
You...
You calling on the spirits?
- She's weird.
- She's creepy.
I...
I ain't too sure I wanna meet this Tony.
"Tony, where are you?"
He's coming in again.
I can only see a light.
That's all.
Now it's... going black.
Now it's... completely gone.
He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes as he struggles to regain consciousness.
"His output is so great, that my machines aren't even capable of measuring it."
But he's dangerous.
"Once I have control of his brain, Letha, he will only be dangerous to others."
You got any ideas?
"If you know any prayers, don't say 'em now."
They won't do you any good.
"Come on, I got some unfinished business to take care of with the warden."
Write a note.
Tell 'em we'll release you and Lang if they let us out alive.
Release 'em?
"Write 'em, we'll knock you both off in 10 minutes if they don't quit firing."
"My orders in case of riot are to keep firing, regardless of the safety of any official or guard."
Those orders will stand.
[GUNFIRE]
"Stay on the floor, and you won't get hurt."
Maybe.
[GUNFIRE]
Take that undershirt off.
We'll show 'em a white flag.
Here's a chance for you to be a hero.
Take this note over to the twine mill.
"And if you lose it, tell 'em to stop firing."
We give up.
I ain't going.
I don't wanna get killed.
"What do you wanna do, live forever?"
"Here, give it to me."
"Come on, Dale."
Open that door.
[GUNSHOTS]
[GUNFIRE]
[GUNFIRE]
Looks like they don't wanna play.
How bad are you hit?
"Oh, it's just a nick."
We'll go there.
Hold on.
Hold on.
"How do I know once I give it to you, you won't just kill me?"
Why should I trust you?
Ohhh.
"Mr. Sodor, if you help me,"
"I promise you, I'll repay the favor."
I'm a man of my word.
"But, uh..."
I lack patience.
"And suddenly, I'm overwhelmed with trust."
Could you stop...
loading your gun for a second?
Stop loading.
Just stop loading.
Just want to make sure that I heard you correctly.
You're sending that psychopath here?
!
"Yeah, that's the whole idea."
"Mike goes in, steers him to the house."
"Jabbar comes here, attacks the place."
We call the cops on him.
W-why am I hearing about this part of the plan just now?
T-the part where my last remaining possession gets chopped up by machine-gun fire and then turned into a crime scene?
!
Because we knew you'd get all whiny on us.
Whiny?
!
"Listen -- the good news is, you don't have to part of the fireworks this time, okay?"
Fi's gonna take you up the road to a nice little motel.
You sit tight there.
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Not watching porn or playing one of your computer games, Calum?"
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah.
"Me, neither."
"When we was in the car, my breathing went all funny."
Couldn't get air into my lungs.
That's panic.
Know the best way of controlling that?
Singing.
"If you sing to yourself, it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff."
Sing what?
Dunno.
"Not sure the lyrics make much difference overall, Calum."
"You're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe."
"That's an underrated song, John."
Much darker than you think.
"Like, he freely admits he was high."
And once the beautiful angel he was after spotted that... ..the curtains closed for them.
"Got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty."
Everybody knows that.
"That, or La Bamba."
"Remember what you need to dance the Bamba, Calum."
Feet.
Do you want a bacon sandwich?
"Yeah, all right."
"I'll stick the grill on, you nip down the shop and get the bacon."
What?
That's fair.
"And if them hoodies on the corner start getting fierce, just dance La Bamba in front of them."
There is one thing that is totally and utterly certain in this life.
Contesse d' Borchere.
Still nothing from the Maquets?
They already paid once.
And they shall pay again.
Put another note under their door.
I'm in no mood for tenderness.
You will stand behind the hedge and you will wait for my signal.
"Yes ,Madame."
"When I raise my hand, you will begin."
How much longer?
"Two hours, Madame."
"You do not have two hours, you have one!"
Stupid girl!
Go and find out at what time the King is expected to make his entry.
"Yes, Madame."
I had forgotten.
What?
How exquisite you are.
Don't ever go away again.
Monseur and Madame Maquet.
Did you hear the latest news about the Count De Valletta?
No.
A very sad affair.
"Despite several reminders from his creditors, he refused to pay his debt."
"The King was informed, sentenced him to 10 years in prison."
I thought you should know.
If it isn't France's favorite couple!
"On the right, the Duke d'Orleans, sporting a delicious spring outfit and on the left, looking in fine fettle..."
My wife is pregnant.
The King!
"Look at me, each and every one of you."
You all have a choice to make.
"Hey, you guys aren't gonna fight in here, are you?"
And why not?
I pay half the rent.
We lose our cleaning deposit if any half gets messed up.
"Oh, the cleaning deposit."
What was I thinking?
"Of course, you're right."
- Now what?
- How about the roof?
"Good call, Arthur."
There's a place good always fights evil.
"Well, works for me."
"Frankly, that's why I was so glad to find this great apartment."
You'd be surprised how hard it is to get a place in the city.
"Never mind that most folks are hesitant to rent to a slime-based organism, much less one with intentions of taking over the world."
And human brains too!
Don't forget the brains!
"It is good, this roof."
I am pleased.
- [Squelching]
- Come on.
"Let's get this over with, nose jelly."
"Tick, wait."
"- Hey, no whispering."
"- Tick, keep them busy."
I think I know how to get Thrakkorzog back to his own dimension.
"When I give you the ""high"" sign, try to throw the Mucus Tick into Thrakkorzog."
"A ""high"" sign?"
Are you a great sidekick or what?
Let's get to it.
Break!
Coward.
"Jim, how does Gordon handle these so-called contracts for murder?"
Picks up the phone and the job gets done.
But he never does it himself.
Even if the job's here in town?
"No, he has an assistant, a man named Connie."
Always uses one of these delightful things.
The bodies are disposed of in the incinerator at Gordon's lumberyard.
Why don't we just keep an eye on Connie until he tries it again?
All we'd get is Connie.
We want Gordon.
"- How about the sweater, Barney?"
"- Right here, Jim."
- Heavy.
- It has eight layers of laminated nylon.
Backed by fine chain mail.
- The blood?
- It's in the ribbing.
"Rollin, were you able to work out the mask?"
Yes.
I have it right here.
Disintegrates two minutes after being exposed to the air.
And did Mr. Gordon accept the Harpers' invitation to dinner?
His R.S.V.P. was in this morning's mail.
"Well, in that case..."
"Mrs. Harper, I think we'd better get headed for home."
"How are you, Burt?"
"Haven't lost your touch, huh?"
"What have you got, Lew?"
Anything I should know about any of these?
The third name.
"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."
What about him?
"Yeah, felt all of it."
I got my head turned inside out.
JIM:
Jesus.
"Them Indians down Texas way they may rob you, but they ain't gonna take your topknot."
JIM:
When was it?
"Goddamn it, will you quit that noise now, will you?"
Quit it.
FITZGERALD:
I'mfallingfurtherback fromHenryandthe boys onaccountof tendingtoyou.
"Got to get up the damn mountain, but winter keeps chasing us down."
If you ready to take the sacrament I can do that for you.
"What you holding to, Glass?"
You know it would be better if you were to take that last breath of yours now... for all of us.
Now you hung tough.
And that's something.
I'm begging you.
Them Ree are so close I can smell 'em.
"You can smell 'em, too."
You got to think of your boy.
All right?
'Cause you're gonna kill him.
You'll kill us all.
(MUTTERING)
I can muzzle you if you like.
Take away this suffering quick and easy.
No one ever has to know that you give up.
All you have to do is blink if you want me to do that.
(GRUNTING SOFTLY)
Save your boy and blink.
You just have to blink.
You're going to leave us here?
I could make my life a lot easier and return you to Jacob Moore.
If you would prefer.
"Soon as we clear the rocks, move the main sail!"
Give her everything she can carry!
This ship's mine now.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Get him!
"Take the wheel, boy!"
This one's for me.
You fight like a man with a lot to lose.
"Well, I have nothing to lose."
Which makes me far more dangerous.
"First blood, I think."
"So, the evil island spirit."
"You going to attack me with a stick, are you?"
"I have a very, very unfair advantage."
Oh?
"Well, we'll just see about that."
Die!
"Hold the wheel steady, boy!"
While I finish him off.
You see?
I have been living the outdoor life.
"Fresh air, plenty of exercise and nutritious food."
You...
"You have been cooped up at sea, eating nothing but broth and dry biscuits."
"Aye, but I still have the beating of a savage in me."
Especially one that cost me so much.
I do not think so.
You can't defeat us all.
Last blood to me as well.
Aren't all newspapermen?
That's a myth.
We're the most sentimental slobs in the world.
- The softest touches there are.
- Prove it.
All right.
When do I start?
All I want is a chance to show what I can do.
"Write something up this week, I'll run it Friday."
"Thank you, Mr. Bushwell."
I'll start right away.
- I'll dig up a story you'll never forget.
- I don't doubt it.
"Just remember, there's no such thing as a cheap lawsuit."
Hold on.
We haven't discussed pay.
You don't have to.
I'll do it for experience.
The first thing experience teaches us is to get paid.
Five dollars a column to start.
More later.
That's more... .
I wouldn't want these stories to fall into the wrong hands.
"Thanks, Seth."
"There's no question, the tests confirm that you're pregnant, Selena."
I'd say about three months.
- Who's the father?
- I won't tell you.
"Now, what kind of rot is that?"
You're not the first girl in the world who had to get married.
"Or in this town, for that matter."
Who's the father?
You can stay as long as you like.
Based on true stories
"The police are searching for Robert Zeuthen's nine-year-old daughter, Emilie who disappeared earlier this evening from her home."
What are you doing to find her?
- Sarah Lund
- Who is this?
- The girl's all fight.
I'm collecting on a debt.
I have a suggestion - a life for a life.
"I'll get Zeuthen, you'll get the girl."
Emilie!
No!
The perpetrator listened to you.
You made him think twice.
- I saw him shoot her.
- Did you?
"Sarah Lund, Juncker and Borch have gone to Jutland."
The perpetrator may have spared Emilie.
He won't finish until he knows what happened back then.
- We don't know what happened.
- He shot her and threw her in the water.
- I can't feel it.
- And the investigation in Jutland?
We haven't found anything to show that your daughter is alive.
You could say that mourning is love without a home.
Don't!
"Let me out, damn it!"
I've decided to resign as Prime Minister.
The assistant public prosecutor had another meeting that day.
- I won't argue over Emilie's grave.
- They say she may still be alive.
"There is a place called Congo Square and this was the only place in the South where black people could actually have drums, 'cause that was outlawed."
"Sunday at Congo Square, these cats played that music to commune with their ancestral spirits."
That caused Europeans to start coming out on Sundays to check what was going on.
"This famous pianist,"
"I think his last name was Gottschalk, he wrote this thing called the ""Bamboula."""
His music was based on what he heard being played at Congo Square.
That was part of our natural evolution.
"What you doing tomorrow, Dave?"
- What's that?
- What you doing tomorrow?
Singing.
Nothing.
Feel like coming by my aunt's house and jamming?
- Yeah!
Absolutely.
- Cool.
- Could I?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
Okay.
"- Sure, yeah!"
"She'll cook for us, too."
"That's the way we used to do it back in the day, with Jessie Hill, Professor Longhair, Dr. John."
- Go by her house...
"- Oh, my God, I would love to."
That'd be so fun.
The importance of the music to the people is what really blew me away.
How you doing?
"- How you making out, man?"
- All right.
"- This is my aunt, man."
- Hello.
-I probably would have.
-Yeah.
[Door beeps]
ARCHER:
Come in.
"-I didn't mean to wake you, sir."
"-It's all right, I was getting up anyway."
-How are you feeling?
-I've been better.
You sure you had that pistol set to stun?
Captain.
I hope you understand if there'd been any other way....
"You were protecting our mission, Trip."
I would have done the same thing.
"Still, I never thought I'd find myself pointing a weapon at you... no matter what the circumstances."
"Let's put this behind us, okay?"
"Yes, sir."
What's our status?
We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
The hatchlings?
Phlox says there's 19 of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
It's time we got back on the road.
I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard.
I'll be on the Bridge.
Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
ARCHER:
I've had plenty.
"I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent."
Okay.
I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands.
"I'm not wasting your time, am I?"
I lost my job.
I screwed up and word got out to the whole industry.
No one wants to hire me.
So I'm free everyday.
"I should say that's great, right?"
So you can rest.
Okay?
No more black circles around your eyes.
I retouched under my eyes for you.
I will erase the rash for you too doc.
Actually our occupations have a lot in common.
I don't know if you still want to die.
"But you are not allowed to, got it?"
You must get better.
Okay?
"""The way you look at someone says more than words."
"And feelings sometimes cannot be explained."""
Shit!
How did he come up with that?
So warm and romantic.
My work at the center of Shibuya #IloveAdidas #MomIdidit
Jerd you make Thai people proud.
Wow you've come a long way my friend.
Congratulations bro.
It looks like a funeral in black and white.
My boyfriend wants it more dreamy.
What do you mean dreamy?
You know dreamy.
The fact you took these at the park is lame.
Don't tell me you want pink grass too.
Just do it to make him happy.
"But that's slow, Freddy, fighting your way through traffic."
The goal is perpetual motion.
You want greens.
But how do you ensure the greens?
You can't.
"As in life, in traffic."
So what you do is you leave yourself an out.
"At every corner, you leave yourself an alternative."
You move diagonal.
You turn the wheel when you hit a red light.
You don't drive down Broadway to get to Broadway.
If you move diagonal... you're gonna get perpetual motion.
That's what you want.
But how does this apply to what you were saying in there?
"It applies, Freddy!"
It's just as easy to tail a man walking in front of him.
"You butt heads with these friends of ours, you're gonna come at them head-on?"
- Okay.
"- They got lives, Freddy."
Families.
No.
You move diagonal.
You jag.
Christ!
Where the fuck are you guys?
We're on our way- in 20.
I'm down.
"But Joey, he's tryin' to hold on... but this big bastard, he cut me up."
I need help!
- He's a fucking monster!
"- I need your location, Tom!"
- I need an assist.
"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was.
Once.
- I got donuts.
They got jelly.
- (CHUCKLES)
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix at this high-end jewelry place.
"The manager was a drunk, and he would forget to lock the case with the expensive watches."
Neal...
I resisted.
Twice.
"Third time, this guy's just asking to get took."
"So, I grabbed a couple of cases of watches, and I hopped on a train to Portland."
The store's got insurance.
"Anyway, I stashed them in a locker at the train station."
"They're still there, so that's hardly stealing."
"Well, so you got away clean?"
I didn't get away clean.
"The manager may have been a drunk, but the security cameras were stone sober."
"I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't."
I'm sorry.
Tallahassee's out.
- You don't have to do this.
- Please.
- Please.
It will be safer if you stay quiet.
BROYLES:
Her name's Christine Hollis.
"Twenty-seven years old, in the master's program for fine arts at BU."
"Far as we can tell, she's no one special."
"Parents deceased, no siblings, no arrests."
Twenty-seven hundred dollars in her bank account.
- Nothing unusual at all.
- Do we have a home address?
We're working on it now.
Assuming she's still alive.
We have no reason yet to think otherwise.
"Well, that's just it, isn't it?"
We don't know what to think.
I'm lost.
"Twenty-four years ago, one of them saved Walter and Peter."
Walter doesn't know why.
Can't remember.
"But beyond that, everything we know about these guys the little that there is, suggests that they just watch."
They don't get involved.
But now...
Figure out why he took this girl.
What makes her the exception?
"Do that, and I think you'll find him."
PETER:
"Hey, I think we may have a lead on the Observer."
"Walter, look at this."
In his book.
I think that might be blood.
Why are you standing?
How does one start this engine?
I have cursed you.
You won't forget your fears until you disappear.
I cursed you.
Solomon?
What are you doing?
Whom are you sacrificing our children for?
You betrayed God.
"Pestilence, diseases and troubles are happening because of you."
Your betrayal will bring blood and sufferings to our people.
"You betrayed, you betrayed..."
"I don't know what to do, Garik."
I thought that I had one person who could help me.
But it turned out that he is dead.
"I'm alive, thank God."
Stop that!
I know that I'm ill.
You and many other people don't exist.
You're looking for reality in an unreal world.
It's like looking for God for He is the only reality.
Do you get it?
The rest is the illusion of the Creator.
"Garik, shut up!"
You're dead.
May be you died?
Maybe you were devoured by your mega-centre.
I look at your paying for your wealth.
I think I made a right decision.
"I built my own real world, my family and my life."
But I'm grateful to you.
I won't be happy without you.
"With that planning to kill wife, throwing bombs on police, and escaping to Malaysia on fake passports."
Go and tell her.
What's this man?
Game.
Is it good?
"He's not a patient, he has no memory loss."
He has memory loss.
"Being a doctor, I say this."
"No, he has no memory loss."
He has memory loss.
"No, he doesn't have memory loss."
Trust me.
"He told me what had happened 2 years back, and also told me that he doesn't remember that."
"He told me what had happened 2 years back, and also told me that he doesn't remember that...?"
"Actually, he told me that I am a doctor."
Aren't you a doctor?
It's okay you knew it.
But don't tell him.
He will beat me to pulp.
Hey you patient...
Where were you?
Did you find anything about him?
I found everything about him.
What?
Does he remember his past?
I saw my future.
Don't play with him.
He will cover your face and beat you up.
Stop talking nonsense.
Are you playing games with me?
Everyone thinks they have started the game.
"But actually, we are all players in his game."
"I don't know, but maybe we should start running."
I always thought your idea of having a combat base was crazy.
"Vila, I won't run."
We have to find out what it is they're doing.
Why the old colonies are being conquered so easily.
Then perhaps we can do something about it.
The five of us?
"Oh, and Trooper Orac here."
We need to know how they are doing it.
"It's possible that the Federation have some new weapon, something we don't know about."
- All the more reason to start running now.
"- Oh, drop it, Vila."
Avon's right.
"If it is something new, how are we going to find out about it?"
There's only one way.
AVON:
We have to go to Helotrix.
(Rustling)
"Our duty target's nice and steady now, sir."
Hasn't moved for an hour.
Then presumably Igin's got back to base.
"All right, prepare for neutron strike."
"All launchers mobile, sir."
Ready launchers 3 and 17.
Fifty-metre bracket pattern.
"- 3 and 17 locked on, now."
- Primary relay open.
Safety lock clear.
Fire.
Countdown.
"Four, three, two."
They must have had some kind of marker on him.
"Unlike Mr. Everett, Mr. Carrington is a professional singer, and sober."
"Mm-hmm, that's what I say."
?
If the thundercloud... ?
?
Passes rain... ?
?
So let it rain... ?
?
Rain down on here. ?
"The morning after, an inquest is held into the previous night's excesses."
"Your charges have been very respectful, I thought."
"the cross-dressing thing, then they sort of..."
"They settled down, yes."
"They settled down for an early night, which I thought was rather demure."
"A night to be remembered, though, sir."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, it was."
"Yeah, another one."
I fell asleep on the billiard table... and then I fell asleep underneath the billiard table.
Despite Mr. Everett's attempts it is the departing Mr. Carrington
I can see Carrington being a really good mate.
"You know, one of those guys..."
I really think he's lovely.
"He's got everybody summed up in here in one day... everybody to a ""T."""
He's a very switched-on guy.
Hmm.
"Very, very switched-on guy."
And I hope he...
I do hope he comes back because I think he brings a really good dynamic to the group.
"Oh, I think he's fantastic."
Shall we run for it?
Keep going!
Krishna.
"Hey smarty, what if it has your name on it?"
If you write your name of this colony..
..then will this colony belong to you?
"Look mister, you dont.."
- Move on!
"Yobbo, quickly get out of here.."
..or I shall break your bones.
Hey but that trunk belongs to me.
"Look mister, this trunk is mine.."
..please give it back to me.
It contains a very precious thing which belongs to me.
I beg of you.
- Look I have gone crazy..
"But mister, listen to me.."
"Mister, give me my trunk back."
"Look, give me my trunk back."
"Hey ruffian, get the trunk."
"Come on let me see, pick up the trunk."
"I swear on God, dont worry, brother."
You have landed in the right hands.
"Hey boss, what are you doing!"
Do you wish to kill this person by hitting him so hard?
"And brother, even you should leave this place."
This fellow is a very crazy man.
But he took my trunk..
- Let the trunk go to hell.
And you get lost from here.
"Brother, this blood is more expensive than yourtrunk."
Go.
"Look mister, I have requested you a Iot."
I have even begged to you.
"What are these, bitch cuffs?"
"My hand, man!"
No!
- Better get him out of here.
- Have fun.
What the hell are you doing?
I want to talk to you about the e-mail Coach Nelson sent you.
What?
The day he was murdered.
"Hey, Todd, wake up."
I know you got Nelson's e-mail and I know you were on his roof.
It's crazy.
This is our fault.
Was there someone else involved?
It wasn't supposed...
You talking about Vince Nelson's murder?
- Can I go or what?
- Todd!
Your coach was murdered!
Now tell me what do I gotta do to get your attention here!
Get down on the floor now!
I need an ambulance in here!
Get me an ambulance!
Preliminary cause of death is hypoxia which presented in cardiac arrest.
Did he have a history of brain seizures?
Medical records are on the way.
He was a wrestler.
He might've had a previous head injury.
"There were also several bruises on his arm, fractured ribs."
"Well, that could've happened while Flack was performing CPR."
What about this abrasion?
"Based on the lack of subdermal bruising, it occurred moments before death."
"–Well, what do you wanna do about it?"
I went through Tio's place.
I found his business ledger detailing payments made to a landlord.
I wanna check them against Vic's cash deposits in his bank accounts.
I need your authorization.
"Claudette, Vic's one of us."
I got a dead drug dealer.
I got a suspect who's probably skipped town... and the only person who can shed some light on it... is an uncooperative cop with a bad rep.
"You want me to let this case just slip away, son?"
I.A.D on Danny's shooting.
Draw up the authorization form.
I'll take a look at it.
Everything looking good for my officer?
–Getting all the cooperation you need?
–Pardon?
"'Cause if anybody's giving you any interference, I can help."
Ah.
Thanks.
"Claudette, witness brought in a freshly amputated arm."
"I'm thinking sadomasochist, probably keeping her alive."
–I've got a suspect named Jordan Arnold.
–Let me help you with that.
Thanks.
I can use a sounding board.
Know who lives there?
Cocksucker who cost me my job.
–Fleetwood.
–Yeah.
City paid off the lawsuit: 1.2 mil.
He moved back just a couple months ago.
–Son of a bitch.
–Hey.
We would put them in reservations or ship them to...
Madagascar.
"In fact, we encouraged mass emigration."
Eichmann's assignment during the '30s was to find places to move them to.
But... few countries would take more than a handful.
Someone even proposed... a mass sterilization plan.
An ugly necessity.
"In every society, there are pent up hatreds."
"For example, in the United States it's against the blacks;"
"in Russia, the successful."
A politician must mobilize these hatreds.
Reason must be trained to think in historical dimensions.
Get out!
Get out!
You'll get nothing from me!
No mercy!
Tell them Hitler has ice in his veins!
Ice!
I'm the greatest actor in Europe.
I am... the greatest actor in Europe.

On to surpass even Lord Grimm.
"They made me ""Man of the Year."""
They made you what?
"Time Magazine, they made me ""Man of the Year."""
I was on the cover for six issues.
"I conquered Poland, Norway, Denmark, France."
Americans love a winner.
"Of course, it doesn't mean a thing."
They made Roosevelt
"""Man of the Year"" three times!"

Lavoisier?
"I think it's there, yeah."
Araucarians.
Lavoisier.
It is Lavoisier.
"Well done, Helen."
"Antoine Lavoisier, correct."
Well!
"I don't know about you, that was absolutely nailbiting!"
"Araucarians, you were breathing hot on the heels of you, Lutrophiles."
"Lutrophiles, you have won with 23."
"Araucarians, a valiant effort with 21, very well done."
"That means Lutrophiles, you're the winners, you go through to the semifinal, congratulations."
"Araucarians, bad luck, but valiantly played, my goodness me."
Join us for more brilliance and bewilderment - and excitement!
- in Hive Minds next time.
"But before we go, here's one for you just at home."
"Find a US city that, if you subtract four letters, becomes a type of curry."
Bye-bye.
"Welcome to Hive Minds, the quiz where simply knowing the answers isn't enough."
You've got to find them as well.
Let's meet this week's hive minds.
"Lutrophiles, introduce yourselves, please."
"I'm Ned, a professional gambler on football from Northamptonshire."
"I'm Oliver, I'm a designer from Surrey."
"I'm Marianne, I'm a quantitative analyst from London."
"Pascallywags, over to you."
"Hello, I'm Rob and I'm from Torquay."
Do you know why I gave them?
So that he could photocopy them.
"And, do you know why I gave them to Kaan?"
Because I trust him.
If you ever ask me how I know that... because the animal didn't even look at questions once.
Come in!
Give them to me.
Go to your seat.
Did you ever check the questions?
Don't talk nonsense!
Of course I didn't.
Are you crazy?
And he says he didn't check them with no shame at all.
"Don't tell me, ""Don't you feel ashamed?"""
- What happened to you?
"- I am answering, (e) gone crazy"
You drove me crazy.
"It's enough, enough."
Did you get that?
It's enough!
Don't shout.
She's studying.
Did your daughter's success just occur to you now?
I'll get her married to a man and it will be over.
Do you understand that?
"You'll get her married, huh?"
Whose daughter are you forcing to marry?
My daughter will finish her studies.
Then she'll marry the man she loves.
"So, she'll marry the man she loves and live a miserable life like I do?"
I am going to divorce you!
Divorce me!
It was just so unoriginal.
Made me feel sorry for him.
My second husband was a pinch more creative.
Cheated on me with my sister but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious.
"So at least some mind games, some intrigue."
"But my last husband, he was a gem."
He was a veritable master at covering his tracks.
"I mean, I pored over his phone records, I intercepted his credit-card bills I had him followed on numerous occasions and never found a single shred of evidence."
It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress.
"But the real master, I have to say, is me."
"Three husbands, countless boyfriends, I haven't been caught yet."
ANNA:
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"- Oh, my God, oh, my God."
I can't...
- Shh.
BEN:
It's over there.
ANNA:
"Oh, my God."
He liked the demo.
I can't believe it.
It's unbelievable.
Did you hear when he said that it was hauntingly beautiful?
"Yeah, I was there."
I was...
"I was there, baby."
Thank you.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"Dana, I'm working."
I'm still going over some offering statements.
No!
I can't do this.
You disappear for five years and now you want to move into my flat?
- Yes...
- No.
No.
"(light, melancholic music)"
"You can't work on something, look forward to something,   invest all your energy in something like I did,   then put it on hold because an old lover blames you for never calling."
"On the other hand, this was the perfect test."
"If Mr Mouthwatering could live in my flat for three months   without giving in to Miss Man-eater,   then maybe I could trust him again."
But his odds were low.
(artsy guitar music)
"Ah, Anna!"
Welcome to Paris.
And welcome to my theatre.
Did you have a pleasant flight?
Paris was just what I needed.
"A new beginning, a change of scene."
I made friends with one of the actresses:
Sophie.
"Sophie was strong, self-assured and single by choice."
Exactly the person I needed to be around.
(accordion waltz)
(music becomes melancholic)
Did I miss life back in Copenhagen?
Why would I?
Can you please take off your sweater?
Thanks.
And raise your arm.
(knocking on the door)
You have to do me now.
The director needs me all day.
You think someone like me is afraid of being shot?
Back off!
Meredith.
This is between you and I.
"The rest of these guys, they don't matter."
This is just you and me.
And a choice.
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.
You're letting your emotions get the better of the situation.
The adrenaline is really kicking in.
"But what I know, the reason that I'm not shaking is because this is a choice not dictated by emotion."
This is logic.
"Pure, simple."
My boy over there is rated 4th in the world on the Glock 30.
You know what that means?
What's it mean?
-lt means I could shoot you from Texas.
-(CHUCKLES)
"Now, that's, of course, an exaggeration but the point stands."
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.
And you're you.
You've already dropped the gun.
Because this is a choice within a very strict set of parameters.
Right now you're in control.
What you don't wanna do is put him in control.
Don't give him the choice.
That way is death.
That way is the unconditional end to future choice.
That's it.
Good girl.
"Sheila, I did it."
I was selfish.
I was self-involved.
I practically invited that woman into my house.
"You can""t abandon them."
"They don""t have any money."
"I did this and I""m gonna do something about it because I have a list."
"Clara, please."
"If you quit, where were they going to go?"
"L""m gonna win my husband back."
"- Hi, Miss..."
- Not now.
"- Clara, what are you doing?"
"- Old lady""s clothing."
Boring!
You wanna go shopping?
"Isn""t this great?"
"You know, this doesn""t look very comfortable."
They are.
"It""s like you""re wearing nothing."
Only thing worse than being lied to and cheated on... is what you're reduced to.
What makes you sick to your stomach is your own demoralizing behavior.
"The paranoia, the obsessing, the dirtiness of it all... is enough to make you crazy."
It will make you damn crazy.
The liposuction will only remove 4 to 5 pounds... but the difference will seem much more dramatic.
What about my breasts?
Can you make them look fuller?
Sure.
"L""ve been thinking... you know, about you and Daddy."
"You know, you guys love each other so much."
"Amy, not now, okay?"
"Daddy""s going to be home any minute."
"Amaar,"
"I would love to help, but this is the kind of thing that takes a 125% of your energy and faith, and I just can't commit to something"
I don't believe anymore.
OK.
"Wow, I knew you were having a crisis of faith, but I didn't realize it was that bad."
Why is it bad?
Maybe it's good!
Maybe this is the best decision I've ever made!
"OK, Sarah."
"Well, I'm always here if you need to talk."
Uh-huh!
OK.
"Well, that's one Muslim down."
Let's hope the rest of them convert before you build
"That mosque of yours, eh?"
[ laughing ] [ choking ]
What a waste of perfectly good goat curry!
I could still eat that if you want.
Hey!
How do you want to pay for that today?
Uh... with my credit card.
- OK...
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Would it be more suspicious if I use cash to pay for the fertilizer?
- No.
"- Um, I disagree."
I think cash would be much more suspicious.
"And yes, to answer the question your face is asking,"
I am a Muslim.
OK...
Does that mean you get like a discount or something?
I should get a discount!
- No.
"Not a problem if you are, just be harder to join in some of the banter."
"Any part of car mechanics you're interested in, as it goes?"
"To be honest, none of it... as it goes."
"- More interested in bikes, is it?"
"- No, the media."
Or law.
"Look, no offence, but I'm never going to work in a place like this."
- Place like this?
"- You know, a place like this."
"Manual, dirty."
"Not stupid exactly, but not academic by a long chalk!"
"It's not that I'm better than this, it's just that I am much cleverer than you need to be to work here."
Steve here's got a BTEC.
Exactly.
"I suspect the mix-up'll be sorted today, I'll be gone tomorrow."
I see.
You don't mind helping out today then?
"No, course not."
"Just the once, eh?"
"Right, Cholmondley-Warner."
We need some stuff picking up from the suppliers.
Fine.
I'll just get a pen and paper.
Great.
"OK, we need two tins of tartan paint."
Tartan paint times two.
- Spirit level bubbles.
- Bubbles for spirit level.
"- D'you need anything, Wolfie?"
"- Yeah, ask him for a reach around."
- A reach around.
Well then I'll go now
Ok
Why does Lin call you Big Sis?
Maybe because I'm his BL teacher
I've been a fan of anal since elementary school
"And thanks about the ""Sex Slave"" thing"
"Yeah, no problem"
He's such a fake
"I think you just wanna say ""Fake"""
Look at this
A picture of your Big Sis and an old man
What's this?
They're in Tokyo.
Your Big Sis and my big brother
What's that?
How dare they?
The world's gonna wanna punish them for that
"You forgot the initial ""These two are fucking idiots"""
You know my boobless Big Sis's earlobes are virgins too?
How would I know that?
"Anyways, who's that chubby old man?"
"Apparently he's helping with the ""Sex Slave"" rescue mission"
"Oh, the ""Sex Slave"" thing..."
"What's ""Sex Slave's"" real name?"
It's Miyu
"She's a pretty cute girl, right?"
Yeah
"Then why is she a ""Sex Slave""?"
Not a very nice nickname
They became really good friends in high school and the three of us played together a lot
We named our local shopping mall the save point
That's so Otaku
She wrote a script.
She wants me to buy a purple tank top.
- She is bananas!
- Hey.
Honey.
Mama's sorry.
"I know all this affects you, and I don't want to drive you crazy like my mom did with me."
- So...
- Were you saying something?
Oh.
Yeah.
Did you not hear me?
"Well, I just thought you were doing all this lining-up business because you heard Mommy getting crazy about Grandma's stuff."
"No, Mama."
Don't worry about it.
I've got my own crap.
You spend all day being the perfect boss.
And the perfect mom.
And the perfect wife.
"But sometimes... sometimes, you just gotta be a little bad."
"Oh, shoot."
"Guys, I gotta go finish some reports for work."
"You need something sweet and salty, just like you."
"Honey, are you eating something?"
"No, I'm doing work reports."
- Mommy?
- Mommy's busy!
Your little midnight snack is nobody's business.

-lt is for my mother
-For your mother?
-What is her age?
-70 -70?
"She wanted to do at a very young age, but couldn't do it"
- Now we want to do it
-You want to fulfill your mom's desire..
..even when she is 70 years old
You are not an ordinary son Great son of a mother
Son who doesn't disobey mother Son who has saved the mother
"- Just a minute, let me also dance my part"
-Be quick
Come before the auspicious time is over
"Yes, yes, come quick"
-What is this?
-She is my mother
For whom did you ask to do nose boring?
- For my mother only
- Did you bring me to do for a corpse?
- Are you calling my mother a corpse?
- What else can I say?
Are you calling it a corpse?
Come do it
Leader
-Arul has come out on bail
-Even before my brother's rites are over..

-What are you saying?

What is written in doctor certificate?
"It takes grit, resolve."
"When I look at you, Lucy, I see how smart you are and how hard you work."
I see how much you want it.
But you don't have it.
"You don't even begin to have it, and you never, ever will."
[feet shuffling]
He sent me to tell you you're fired.
"Well, not fired."
"If anyone asks, we'll say you left of your own accord."
We wish you well.
Why do you hate me so much?
"I don't hate you, Lucy."
"After tonight, I won't even remember you were here."
[sobbing]
"Uh, there were two big booms."
"Um, that's the second one."
- You can see the fire.
- Mm-hmm.
All the burning plastic coming down.
"Uh, then came the wave."
The wave that sank your boat.
Yeah.
"Now, after the first time we spoke, what happened?"
"This guy came to us-- uh, Karl Stoltz-- and he said that there was a shipment--"
- Objection.
Hearsay.
- Sustained.
The jury will disregard.
"Why are you dressed like that, Gabriel?"
"Uh, after we first talked to you about the boat, this guy Stoltz showed up to set us up on a drug deal."
- Your Honor.
- He framed us.
Rose is back.
"Hello, Number 9."
Oh my!
Are you...?
Wow!
- I always figure you're...
- You always figure out as what?
Imaginary.
Or a boy.
Do you know what I've been doing today?
I've been watching you and your partner.
Did you hear somethin'?
That partner of yours is clean out of her mind
And she's gonna put us all in a real bad spot.
We can't let that happen.
I can't let that happen.
I won't let that happen.
Do you even know what grief her little sloth is gonna cost us?
"Well, I'll tell you."
"Two of the idiots that she ventilated, were engaged."
Do you know who'll they're gonna marry?
The Police Chief's stepdaughters.
And you can bet the house once they sort out all these rubbish.
"Boss is gonna be held accountable, next to that, a garden of variety gang war would be a sunday stroll."
- There was a dead guy at the bottom of the steps.
- He saw me!
"Can I ask you a question, Ma'am?"
Do you always work by yourself?
Yes.
Is it lonely?
What's that to you?
Just wondering.
"Yes, that's a fine poem."
"So the ""glass"" remained intact?"
"Yes, it remained intact."
He'll be saved.
"- Doctor, do you mind if I smoke?"
"- No, you should mind."
- What?
- You should mind.
Not me. lt's no concern of mine if you smoke.
The air is so pure here.
It'll take more than your cigarette to pollute it.
I only measure my strength with my lungs.
"If you're in good health, carry on."
"Doctor, what's your speciality?"
I don't have one.
"That way, I look after the whole body."
"If I specialised, I'd be limited."
You must have a lot of patients then.
Almost no one.
"I have to ride around, looking at nature's beauty, calling on people, doing the odd circumcision, giving jabs, piercing ears, etc."
"If I'm no use to others, at least I make the most of life."
I observe nature.
Observing nature is better than playing backgammon.
Or doing nothing.
"This is the place, doctor."
ldleness leads to corruption.
"Well, well, it's our invalid!"
She's my friend.
She's as old as Methuselah.
"Hello, are you well?"
It's been a while!
I have things to do.
- l am feeling hungry today.
I know.
"When you feel hungry, you come to my door."
"Otherwise, why would you come to me?"
What would you like to eat?
Shall I serve you the breast?
- No!
- The heart...the ears..
- No!
"- The eyes, then?"
No!
I feel like eating the brain today.
The brain?
The police has eaten away my brain.
Where from shall I serve you?
I am not talking of your brain.
I am talking of a goat's brain!
Where does the goat have brain?
"Yes, I did find a goat with a brain."
"When I was about to slaughter it, the goat pleaded not to slay him since he was appearing for S.S.C. exams."
I advised the goat against it since he had to die some day.
He didn't pay heed.
"Today, he is making rounds at the college."
How ridiculous!
What's the connection between a goat and the college?
The boys who attend college are like goats.
Sometimes they are at the mercy of a job sometimes at the mercy of a girl.
"All right, then."
"Treat me to an omlette, at least."
You will have to slog hard for that!
- Slog hard?
- Yes.
"In fact, there are loads of cool changes you could make now you're in charge, Rambo."
"We could have - I dunno, comfy chairs, working toilets, non-squeak doors..."
"What do you mean, 'in charge'?"
"If you lower the price of grain, people will buy more."
"Whoa, steady on, Professor."
I don't get any of that business-y shit.
I said I'd leave all that to Flavia.
He's just a dickless intern!
Flavia is out of touch.
"She just sits in her office getting her nails done, while the staff get bad backs and blocked-up bogs."
"Sorry, Prof. I promised my dad I wouldn't rock the boat."
I did that at the shipping company and three people drowned.
I should just keep my head down.
Sorry...
Do you own the company?
Big time.
"Right, well, in that case, I will keep my jug still."
Sorry for calling you dickless.
"Yes, congratulations, boss!"
Great throw!
From downtown for five points...
Interception!
Turnover.
Interception?
Since when?
Just now.
He shoots...
He scores!
That's eight-all.
"New ball, please, Prof. Uh-huh, coming up."
We should make it doubles!
Then we'd have someone to pass to and high-five!
Lose half.
- Which half?
- The half you don't need.
- All right.
All right.
I'd miss you.
I'd miss you more than I can say.
Help me take this.
None on that side.
Keep going.
Let's go around this way.
Mrs. Cole?
"Watch yourself, girl."
- Mrs. Cole?
- Hmm?
- I thought you was under it.
- I was in the office.
Hmm.
"Okay, coming in from the left."
I might have to borrow clothes.
"Talk to the costumes mistress, but don't be surprised if she's tetchy."

It's got a bit of a wobble.
Might have to lash it to the gantry.
"There'll be tears before bedtime, mark my words."
"No, you've got a bit of a wobble."
- Chick.
"Could we save that lamp till we roll, please?"
"Sorry, Mr. Hilliard."
"Come on, Trevor, wake up."
Preston set that up.
"Crime waves hit, property value drops."
Then Preston moves in and buys it all up for cheap.
Shut up!
"Trevor, listen to me."
He doesn't give a damn about black or white.
The only color that son of a bitch cares about is green.
"Come on, kid, you gotta believe me."
Drop the gun.
"You let her go, we can work it out."
He told me you would try to turn me.
There are no traitors!

That's ludicrous.

He always has been.

"Well, since we're on the topic of regrets-- you not pursuing your music-- I'll share mine."
Years ago I had the opportunity to participate in Doctors Without Borders.
"It was a six month stint in Mozambique, but I decided not to take it."
Why not?
"Well, you know, dealing with living, breathing patients isn't exactly my strong suit."
That's why I took up a career in forensic pathology.
"Apparently, some people consider me awkward and off-putting."
"No, that's crazy."
"No way, Doc, not you."
Thank you.
"And yourself, any regrets?"
Please.
I'm a two-time felon.
I own four businesses now.
It's the oppa that acted arrogant before.
Did the owner change?
Wasn't this Daniel's shop?
Did Daniel say that he's the owner?
Daniel and I are both owners.
"Then, Daniel..."
I heard he was banned from entering our country.
I don't know that fool.
He is not a man.
He is a woman.
He's all emotion and refinement.
He has very few defences.
You must win him as a man wins a woman.
"If anyone can do it, you can, George."
This is enlightening.
Tell me more.
How does a man pursue a woman?
"He flings himself at her feet, follows her everywhere."
"Wherever she turns, he is there, pouring into her ear only what she most wants to hear."
"His passion frightens her, but a woman will always bend toward a strong man, just as the vine stretches toward the wall."
A woman is always on the point of abandoning herself anyhow.
It only takes one firm push.
You are sublime!
A true friend.
Ah!
Yes.
Those are marvellous.
Yes.
This is from...
George Sand.
Thank you.
"And I want something with a much thinner, narrower line."
"Yes, that is good, I think."
"In fact, you could make this even more..."
"No, I don't want this."
"Take it off, please."
You are so good to escort me tonight.
People shun me unless I am on the arm of someone respectable.

You will find nothing but friends at Eugene's.
"What I mean is if he could stay in the sick bay he'd be out of their hands, you see."

- Your son.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I can hear everything.
My quarters are just opposite.
These punishments...
Is my...
Is Mr. Crawford the only one punished?
"No, but when two or three get beaten, he's always one of them."
It's got to stop.
"On the lower deck, men are beginning to think..."
- Think what?
- What I mean is...
"Mr. Scott-Padget's compliments, sir."
"He begs you for an audience, sir."
"At once, if possible."
"He said it is of the most vital importance, sir."
"- Mr. Crawford, go to sick bay."
"- No, sir, I'm not ill."
Honestly.
"Please, may I take him your answer, sir?"
I'll deliver it myself.
- You asked to see me.
- I didn't expect you to come.
I want to thrash you and clap you in irons but that would suit you very well.
"- I fail to understand, sir."
- Do you?
I won't follow your previous captains onto the beach.
Understood?
"- Now, what do you want?"
- Only to be restored to duty.

I want everyone to make it back safely!
She says...
The communication line just opened on its own.
Did someone let us hear that on purpose?
Who knows.
But I never would've expected Tessa to argue so forcefully with the XO like that.
"She wants everyone to make it back safely, huh?"
"What do you think, guys?"
"That's what I intend to do, of course."
"We can't make our princess sad, now can we?"
To think she'd be so worried about us...
I'm honestly moved!
It's just like her.
She's a good officer.

Distance is the absence of Menschkeit.
Translate that for me.
You don't know what Menschkeit means?
I don't.
Menschkeit.
"You know, something between men."
"It's about honor, character..."
Untranslatable.
There must be some way to stop him.
Things are out of control now.
I'm running out of options.
Wait.
Mace...
You can't be serious.
"- I mean, what would the Illuminati say?"
- If I wasted the gargoyle?
"Lt'll be a black mark, no question of that."
I'll be severely reprimanded.
"But if I allow Goliath to become the first prisoner who ever escaped Hotel Cabal, the flushing sound you hear will be me and my 75-year pension going down the drain."
Notice the one-way mirror.
(thud)
- I can't miss.
"It's checkout time, gargoyle."
"- I don't think so, Mace."
Bluestone!
Whoa.
- Going up?
"- As a matter of fact, I am."
Hold on!
"You played me for a fool, Bluestone!"
You and the gargoyle were in this together!
"What can I say, Mace?"
"(laughs) When you're right, you're right."
"I'll see that you get yours, Bluestone."
Nobody double-crosses Mace Malone!
Nobody!
Poor Mace.
Wonder how long it'll take him to realize he dropped his key.
"(Matt) OK, I admit it."
"To save Goliath's life I had to forfeit my chance to get in good with the Illuminati, bust their organization wide open."
I'm yourJagadish
I'm yours!
Jagadish
I got something to tell you
I have sold my engine design for 2 million dollars
Don't you want to know why I sold it?
For my sake?
I mean... for our sake for the sake of our future
Yes Nitu.
But the future for us lies in India
In India...?
Our house is being auctioned
I'm going back to India
Will you come with me?
"Jai, take care of yourself"
"Nitu, you never wanted to marry... someone who was weak, a man without a backbone"
"All along I knew, you were hinting at me"
But what are you doing now?
Jai is a man of substance
You'd like him to become like me?
"Feeble, spineless...?"
"Look, someone who doesn't value relationships remains a loner"
You want to be lonely all your life?
- Lonely...?
Our next big act is Marcus Brewer singing Roberta Flack's beloved Killing Me Softly.
He'll be accompanied by Simon Cosgrove on the recorder.
"Marcus, I can't do this."
- That lot's going to shit all over us.
- But you said...
I'm sorry.
Here's your £5 back.
Any moment now.
But you will not get 20 lakhs.
You will get 50 thousand or 1 lakh.
I will get it ready in 2 days time.
- You won't do it.
- Why?
"Though people can work hard, you provide rice for Rs. 2 per kg."
And make them lazy fellows.
You give houses for the poor.
You provide employment for the youth.
You provide free electricity and loans to farmers.
"During elections, you waive the loans."
You give everything to everyone.
Why don't you care about children?
What sin have they committed?
Is it because children are not eligible to vote?
How much can we get selling this house?
To the bankers?
This house is on loan.
How much do you have in your account?
Rs. 10 lakhs.
Give me a cheque.
For what?
"I said do it, father."
Rs. 10 lakhs...?
What made you think that I will give you the money?
"Since he married my daughter, I forgave him  made him my PA."
I challenged you that I will make you fall at my feet.
What made you think that I will forgive and give you the money?
Who won?
Me or him?
To make my heart wet...
Came this drizzle of smile...
"No, no, in the crabbing area."
"It's just that you were fishing for bass, so..."
That probably explains why we didn't catch anything.
"You fish in the Apachaway a lot, so I thought that you would know that, but..."
I don't fish a lot.
"- I thought your equipment was pretty sophisticated, but..."
- There's a difference... between wanting to fish and having time to fish.
Tell me about it.
- And he freed the slaves and won the Civil War.
- That's right!
He was probably our greatest president.
- Even greater than George Washington?
- It's a running debate.
- Laine Hanson.
"- Oh, Mr. President."
And you must be one Timothy Hanson.
Timothy Muskie Hanson.
"Well, Timothy Muskie Hanson, how would you like a great big cookie?"
Any kind.
"- No, thank you."
- Any kind at all.
"Oatmeal, white chocolate..."
"Actually, we just had dinner, but thanks."
"In that case, shall we have our picture taken, young man?"
Hmm?
- How do I look?
- Your tie's a little crooked.
"Well, can't take a picture like that."
Will you straighten it for me?
Your mommy tells me you know more about the presidents than most grown-ups.
- I like to study them.
- Mmm!
He's doing what?
Get me satellite surveillance on a 50-mile grid around the exchange point.
Where's Scott?
I had to bring him back Khartoum along with that bloody journalist woman.
- He took a bullet to the spleen.
- (SIGHS)
SINCLAIR: (OVER COMMS) He's lost a lot of blood.
"They're prepping him for surgery, now."
"You've let Stonebridge go off on some suicide rescue mission, with the only lead..."
to Latif...
Please tell me
Crawford gave you the intel beforehand.
- Negative...
- Sinclair.
And I think I'm about to get arrested.
"Walk away now, you don't know me, go."

"JACOUB: (CONTINUOUSLY) Wait, wait, wait..."
There are two wells near here.
The Janjaweed will be close to one.
The nearest is Bir an Natrun...that way.
"And we're trusting him as our guide, why exactly?"
It was Tahir's men who destroyed my village.
And my family.
"And, your friend, Scott, he promised me much money."
"And a new car if I help you, yes?"
You gotta love that mercenary spirit.
"So, what's your reason?"
"This isn't only about Latif, is it?"
Not for you.
Are you hurt?
"Oh, no."
"I tripped earlier on the-- on the cobblestones, and I-I must have cut it and--and not noticed."
"Well, I'm glad you're safe."
You must be Annie!
"Uh, I am."
I forgot to tell you we have dinner guests.
"These are my dear friends Blanca Gonzalez and her boyfriend, Hector Serrano."
It's lovely to finally meet you.
We've heard so much about you.
Yes.
So much.
♪
You found a real catch.
We just love Simon.
Really?
How often do you get to see him?
Every few weeks.
He's doing some business deal with Hector.
That must be frustrating-- always losing your boyfriend to a business meeting.
Tell me about it.
Hopefully I'll have him back to myself soon.
He tells me this deal is basically finished.
"Three mojitos-- the personal vice of your countryman and fellow Cubaphile, Ernest Hemingway."
I wonder what
Hemingway would think if he saw our country after 50 years of the embargo?
I bet he'd still be enchanted with its natural beauty and free-spirited people.
I know I am.
Mm.
We hear that sentiment a lot from tourists.
I find it incredibly condescending.
"Hector, please."
Is she dangerous?
She's a Wraith!
"Although, I have to admit, she does seem a little different."
"Now remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground."
Like this?
A little more.
Now why is distillation an important step?
To remove the toxins from the ferrison root?
Precisely.
"We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock now, would we?"
No father.
Seriously.
Have you ever seen anything like this before?
No I have not.
She's unlike any Wraith I've ever encountered.
What if it's all an act?
"If she were a killer, why would he protect her?"
Maybe the act is for his benefit too.
"No, they live here together, Rodney."
"If she were like other Wraith, he would be her first victim."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Go ahead.
I just got back with Beckett.
Ronon's gonna take him up to the cave.
I'm gonna check in with the villagers.
What are you gonna tell them?
I'm still working on that.
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?
"Oh, here and there."
"Let's start by analysing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Yes, of course."
-So he comes again.
-Brought some pastries.
-Is he taking a nap?
-Yeah.
-Is he driving you to drink?
-I can drive myself.
I needed that.
What's the matter?
Spent a long time in the hospital last night.
The shit that goes on down there.
I wasn't expecting visitors.
How about those Mets?
Don't start with me and those Mets.
"You know, I was thinking about you."
-So you're drunk already.
-No.
I was thinking about the way you are.
"How you always have this little smile, like you got your own private joke."
"You don't talk much, do you?"
I wish I knew your secret.
Lose a leg and start making websites.
"That's the whole purpose for people like me, to inspire people like you."
"-Jesus, no offense."
-That's the trouble with you Americans.
You expect nothing bad ever to happen... when the rest of the world expects only bad to happen.
-They're not disappointed.
-That's a fucking grim outlook.
"You have everything, and still you complain."
You lie on couches and bitch to your psychiatrist.
You got too much time to think about yourselves.
Sounds like me all right.
You're not so bad.
Loads.
- Tell her how much you enjoy the work.
"- Oh, it... it..."
This... this job would...
You were inspired by Florence Nightingale to bring cleanliness to the wards.
"- Oh, God, you know?"
- Don't say God.
She might be religious.
Shit!
- God was better.
- It isn't a complicated job.
"I've done it before, I can do it again."
What more is there to say?
Oh.
I don't think there's...
anything more to say.
Knocked back from wiping up shite.
"Er... well, that was an inside job."
"They'll be forced to advertise for legal reasons, but a cushty number like that?"
"I mean, she'll have a mate lined up."
It'll be fine.
"I'm not quite sure how, exactly, just yet."
"But there is a perfect solution to this, and..."
Oi.
Trust your guardian angel to find it.
They shouldn't let your sort work in a hospital.
Our sort?
Does the FA Cup here make you wear that uniform while he's doing you doggy style?
"You're in enough trouble, young man, without getting pervy."
Trouble?
That's my dad up there.
This is no worse than a baby sucking its mother's tit.
Hmph!
Teenagers.
They think they know everything.
"You give them an inch, they swim all over you."
Do you think I was too hard on her?
Definitely not.
"Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss."
None of this flitting to the surface and other such nonsense.
"No, sir."
I'd keep her under tight control.
"- You're right, Sebastian."
- Of course.
Ariel needs constant supervision.
"Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble."
All the time.
And you are just the crab to do it.
[Sebastian] How do I get myself into these situations?
"I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager."
Hmm?
What is that girl up to?
[Sebastian pants]
[Gasps]
Huh?
"Ariel, are you OK?"
[Ariel] If only I could make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.

How long?
- Month or month and a half
Will you hold this for me?
And turn around
Moron!
Did I bring you up to see this day?
"No, don't drop that"
"Are you all right, Pops?"
"Pops, you're right."
I ought to take care of your business
You've become so old.
- You tell your father that?
"Pops, I've decided against Europe."
I'm joining the offices from tomorrow
"In this house, only your father decides."
You're going to Europe
No.
I've had enough of a goodtime.
My years of youth are over for me
Never say your youth is over.
All my life I've slogged to give you whatever I couldn't do
"When youth came and went, I never got to know"
"But I wasn't sad, because I knew that my son will have my years"
"If you think you've had enough of a goodtime... if you think the years of youth are over for you, well no problem"
Just go and live my years for me
Ajit's letter?
Lajjo!
"Look, what's here Letter!"
From my friend
From Ajit
"Just smell it, lady!"
The fragrance of Punjab!
What?
You turned a block full of headlights on.
This should be easy.
Are you serious?
You said I look for ways to slack off.
This I take seriously.
"You have to challenge that brilliant mind of yours, and someone has to fill in for that Foss guy, right?"
"Well, that someone, my friend, will be me."
Really?
Just- make 'em blink.
Hey.
Is it working?
Not really.
Thinking about Amanda drained all the voltage out of him.
Oh.
"Yeah, I heard."
"""We need to talk. """
Sorry she left you hanging.
Typical woman.
"Um, anyway..."
I need to look for my digital projector.
"You giving that away, too?"
"No, I need it for a lecture I'm giving at U.W."
You're giving a lecture?
I mean... you're giving a lecture.
I've been asked to speak at a symposium tomorrow.
Are you getting paid for this thing?
"Because you're supposed to bring home the bacon, Dad, and I eat a lot of bacon."
"For your information, Josh, I have already had a job offer."
This lecture is about showing my expertise... for free.
"Well, I think your expertise is worth more than that."
"Thank you, Kyle."
"Come along, dear."
I'll tuck you in again.
"He's wicked, isn't he?"
"Was there anything else, Julian?"
"One of these days, Auntie, somebody will cut that iron umbilicus... and maybe your throat in the bargain."
"Go to bed immediately, Merle."
And see that you stay there.
"Hello, Corbett."
Is Merle ready yet?
"Miss Gilbert, won't you come in?"
I'll tell her you're here.
Thank you.
"Well, good morning, Miss Gilbert."
How very nice to see you again.
"Hello, Mr. Langley."
Where are you two young ladies off to this time?
"Lunch, fashion show."
I'll be taking some pictures if sleepyhead doesn't make me late.
Merle had a restless night.
"You know, Mr. Langley, it's always been my one great ambition to be able to sleep in till 11:00 every morning."
"Well, you'll just have to marry a rich man."
"Unfortunately, they've all been spoken for-- especially the handsome, distinguished ones."
Gina--
"Well, it's about time, lazy bones."
"Hello, Mrs. Langley."
"Good morning, Gina."
You're looking very attractive today.
Thank you very much.
I wish I could have clothes like that.
This?
It's only 14.95.
But it's so sophisticated.
And you know why?
Because they're ignorant and they're dumb as shit.
"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is democracy."
- God damn it.
- It's the 12th Amendment.
- I have 20th Amendment.
- Why are there so many amendments?
"Get it right the first time, people."
It's actually both. 12th is superseded by the 20th.
They give the House until January 20th to elect the president.
Each state gets one vote.
First candidate to 26 is the new president and the Senate chooses the VP.
It's a close election with a ton of House races too close to call.
What happens if it's a tie in the House?
Right.
- Is it a dance-off?
"Well, vice president-elect becomes president."
Whoever the Senate has picked for VP will be president.
"- Wait, that means..."
- That Tom...
- What?
- Could be the president.
"Well, I..."
I had literally no idea.
It's good to be prepared.
"So, wait."
So you mean that I...
I might lose this election to my fucking vice president?
"At least it'd be somebody from our team, ma'am."
"I mean, that's good, right?"
I didn't mean to make her cry.
"There, there."
- Asshole!
"So I don't care about a neurotical, I mean... he got me to stop eating sushi for about 20 min."
But then I said... seize the damn!
I'm not gonna be sway
"I mean... it's not that I'm dying to tear it out but... honestly, what's the worst thing that can happen?"
"I get a tapeworm and I eat what I like, and still..."
lose 20 pouds?
"I'd rather be like Karen Carpenter... on the top of the world, looking down on creation."
Wouldn't that be dreaming?
"But enough about ""moi""."
What did you say your name was again?
- Jocelyn.
- And you work at...
- Skirt Magazine.
"- Roxanne Rochet, I love her like a sister!"
- What do you do there?
- You know... this and that.
"Details, darling!"
"Are you a writer, a stylist?"
"- I'm a ""head plan""."
- Excuse me?
- The resident xerox core.
- And what is this?
I'm an intern.

Only your gargoyles can save us now.
Are you out of your mind?
You almost killed us.
"I won't give up until I get the truth, Elisa."
The truth about you and the gargoyles.
I know you're out there!
"Oh, I know all about you."
Now show yourselves!
(door shuts)
I know.
I know.
This is where you shake your head and tell me I'm wasting my time.
They... they don't follow me everywhere I go.
Come on.
This time I'll drive.
This sounds like a stall.
What do you mean we have to wait?
We didn't get back in time.
You can't see them now.
Meet me back here ten minutes before sunset.
You won't be disappointed.
I promise.
"The rest of the day wasn't a total loss, not a by a long shot."
I have a meeting with the gargoyles tonight.
Your information was accurate.
So much for our good faith.
- Now we come to yours.
- Just tell me what I have to do.
Bring us a gargoyle.
"A few hours later, Elisa and I rendezvoused in the clock tower."
"She took me outside, but I still didn't know what to expect."

Let me ask Tolya to drive you home
"--you have a cold, and the city is..."
"--Galkina, this is so primitive!"
Take me home and put you in my place?
Only you sign me off too soon.
The night is young.
I'll knock down those guarages and stop that wedding!
And your extortionist won't get the apartment either
--He will get it --He won't.
I'll speak out against.
"I will speak for it, and everyone will support me."
Then there will be no room for both of us under this roof
"In that case, it will be me who will stay"
At last!
I tore off your mask.
"Pavel Ivanovich, Sorokin just came"
Coming!
"Galkina, I thougt you were my friend."
I even wanted to marry you.
--When?
--This morning.
--What about your wife and kids?
--That does not concern you.
"I never cheated on my wife, and I never intend to!"
Holding on to your power chair?
!
Trying to please everyone?
!
You double-checker!
"Raya, instantly connect Sorokin with the 5th SMU, and say they must return the machines NOW!"
Not your kid?
He's nearly as white as you are.
That don't prove nothing.
You're calling me a whore?
Dale...
"I was a virgin when we met, and you know it."
(BIRD SINGING)
Hear the whippoorwill?
Remember what you told me about when you hear a whippoorwill?
It means somebody's going to die.
How come we got to sit here in the dark like this?
Because I don't want to be a sitting duck if they show up out there.
I told you they won't be here until they call.
Where you going?
To get my cigarettes.
They're in my purse.
You can have one of mine.
"I smoke menthol, baby."
You know that.
I'll get them.
"I forgot that thing was even in there, baby."
Ray gave me that for protection.
I don't even know how it works.
You pull the damn trigger.
"Dale, what are you looking at me like this for?"
"What, did you think I was going to shoot you or something?"
That's crazy.
"Now can I have my cigarettes, please?"
"Can I have a light, baby?"
(WHIPPOORWILL SINGS)
So...
Does that wife of yours treat you right?
- Isabel.
- Isabel.
"- Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter I wish to discuss with you."
"Um, Nurse Oaks?"
"- Yes, Madam?"
- My apologies.
"Nurse Oaks, please show them the garden."
Yes?
- It would be my pleasure.
"Please, come this way."
"Yes, Dr. Jacobs, there is the private matter that I would..."
"- Right this way, please."
You'll find this is a lovely spot to come read a book or just enjoy the view of the woods.
"The gardens are lovely, don't you think?"
- Roderick.
"- They're quite nice, I must admit."
"- Yes, indeed."
- What order shall be taken
- with the prisoners?
- Shoot them in the head.
I suspect witchcraft in the beast.

"- Lucy, this is not a good time."
- Like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers... which will no longer taint my breath in the Garden of Eden.
- Is that Hawthorne?
- What do you mean?
"- You were quoting one of Mr. Hawthorne's Twice-Told T ales, were you not?"
- I do not know what you speak of.
Did he send you?
Is this a test?
"- There you are, Lucy."
"My apologies, Nurse Oaks."
From my days in Monte Carlo.
"You been to Monte Carlo, Sam?"
No.
Have you ever been to Pahrump?
[Both Chuckle] Exactly how long have you been planning this?
"Ages, gumdrop."
"Now let's run along, shall we?"
"You know, I'd thought you had your work cut out since Mr. Wu's departure."
"It's so unfortunate, this haunting."
I had no idea when I had that newspaper delivered to him that it would upset him so much.
"[Chuckles] So, you had the newspaper delivered."
"- Oh, I'll get that."
- I'll have those then.
Hmm.
Knipex.
"If I held on to these, would you die a slow and painful death?"
"Well, if I did, you wouldn't be able to say you were Vegas's top host."
"Yes, but it suddenly doesn't seem so important, compared to your certain suffering and demise."
You'd rather kill me than compete against me?
"That's pathetic, really."
Honestly thought you were better than this.
I am better than this.

[Phone Beeps]
Hello.
"Hey, Mike."
Yeah.
"Sorry to disappoint you, but it's not a ghost."
It's just a dislodged cable.
"Uh, must be the wind."
"- Yeah, right."
MAN:
Careful!
It looks like there are four of these shrine covers before we get to the sarcophagus.
We still can't really work out how they ever got them in.
Getting them out without damage is proving to be the devil's own job.
Excuse me one moment.
"- So, can we repair this thing?"
"- Well, I'd like to see what Lucas thinks."
What's this?
Oh...
We found those yesterday in the treasury.
Mace thinks they're almost full-term.
The one on the left is a little girl.
You can still make out some of the hair on her scalp.
I think they're the saddest things I've ever found.
HOWARD:
I'm sorry.
(Operatic music playing)
- Mr Adamson.
- Mr Carter.
- You like Verdi?
"- Not particularly, sir."
But I find he's more effective than any guard dog.
The locals like him even less.
A lot of men would be nervous about sleeping overnight in a tomb.
"Yeah, the dead are dead."
I don't bother them and they don't bother me.
"Going well, sir?"
"To be honest, I'm a little disappointed."
"Oh, yes, sir?"
I thought I'd found him.
(Exhales deeply)
- Lauren.
"- Oh, my God."
Don't get me started on that girl.
How could you be so cold and frigid?
- She's like a freaking speculum.
- She's here.
"Hi, Kenzi."
Hey.
"You know, as your doctor I should recommend against excessive intoxication."
Who's drunk?
"Well, we don't know the effects of cocktails on your abilities."
"Well, I am not a guy, so I can promise you booze does not affect my ability to perform."
"I wouldn't wanna be on the receiving end of a drunken Succubus booty call, so take it easy."
- No promises.
Keep an eye on her.
"Okay, I don't know if it's from the buckthorn hallucinations but that was some serious sparkage."
- I think she likes you.
"- No, it doesn't matter."
"It doesn't matter, because Lauren is human."
"I sleep with her, and she dies."
This guy-
"- This guy on the other hand, he has sexual chi to burn."
He's right behind you.
A woman as lovely as yourself shouldn't be alone.
"Well, I'm not."
There's two of you.
I'm Samir.
- Bo.
- I know.
Everybody knows.
"The one who won't choose a side, neither light nor dark."
Exciting.
Isabel.
"Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter"
I wish to discuss with you.
"Um, nurse oaks?"
"- Yes, madame?"
- My apologies.
"Nurse oaks, please show them the garden."
Yes?
It would be my pleasure.
"Please, come this way."
"Yes, Dr. Jacobs, there is the private matter that I would..."
"Right this way, please."
You'll find this is a lovely spot to come read a book or just enjoy the view of the woods.

What do you mean?
"You were quoting one of Mr. hawthorne's twice-toldtales, were you not?"
I do not know what you speak of.
Did he send you?
Is this a test?
"There you are, Lucy."
"My apologies, nurse oaks."
It won't happen again.
"If it wasn't on a boat, I don't want it."

"The first thing we gotta do is find a reliable, non-asthmatic person... to cash in this ticket A.S.A.P., or we're dead."
Funny you should mention that.

"- Oh, yeah?"
Who?

I think he still works there too.
A real sweet guy.
"Bought me a really expensive parrot, too, from Brazil or something."

"You hated that fucking bird, didn't you, sweetie?"
"The racetrack, eh."
"Well, actually, he's an unofficial employee."
He injects horses with some shit that makes them run faster.
Forget it.
Cross him offthe list.
Forget him.
Who else?
"There is Scatter, the guy who installed my carpet."
- I went to high school with him.
- The man's name is Scatter?
"Yeah, well, he's a total coke freak, which could work in our favor because he usually needs money."
"No, junkies are problematic."
Let's keep thinking.
Mm-hmm.
- Wanna have sex?
"- Oh, yeah."
So...radio stations in here?
"Little kday, little old-school rap for me."
"Definitely the first person to check out the radio on the backstretch, which is the fastest part of the course."
"Oh, my God."
There it is.
[ Tires screech ]
A happy tire is a squealing tire.
"That's right, making stig proud."
Good speed on the backstretch.
"All right, coming through the last turn here."
"Nice and smooth, and across the line."
[ Cheers and applause ]
"Lake, come on up."
So lovely.
How are you?
"Have a seat, please."
"It's nice, right?"
How'd it go in the suzuki?
"It's fun to say the word ""suzuki,"" you know?"
[ Laughter ]
"- So, that's, like, good news."
- Right.
"But otherwise, in terms of fastness and times, all that..."
I hope I didn't let you down.
"Oh, come on."
"No, you didn't."
"Let's just get comfortable with being in the lower Echelon, and then I'll be more comfortable with it."
Do I look comfortable?
"Everybody's gonna be comfortable because you are a beautiful woman that loves cars, so they already love you."
I love cars.
I love cars.
How'd you get into cars?
How are you?
- Good.
And you?
How are you feeling?
"- Thank god, fine."
You're still here?
- I have no complaints.
"Lights and electricity, nothing has changed."
How's your daughter?
Thank god.
She went to talk to Alex.
"Good, good."
It's good seeing you.
"- Yes, you too."
"Hello, everyone."
I'd like us to read the first act that I translated with the help of my daughter Goni who's sitting right here.
And that's my brother-in-law.
"I chose the cast with Alex, or rather at his recommendation, since I don't know any of you."
But...
The recommendations were very strong.
Yes.
"Hello, everyone."
Don't mind me.
"In any case, Alex suggested we read ""The Enchanted Nose"""
with the junior company.
I thought...
"Excuse me, dear actors,"
"I see you're taking the text out of the envelopes, is this the first time you've seen it?"
"I'm sorry, they only informed us yesterday, we're rehearsing all the time, you expect too much of us."
A serious actor is supposed to prepare at home.
"Yitzhak, don't be so hard on them."
"In the past, I would've got up and left."
"Yes, Inspector."
This way.
"We are too late, Inspector."
"Search the entire hotel, they must not be far."
Let's go!
Wait!
"Listen, Inspector, it's Adriana's beacon, we have a lead,come!"
"Based on the distance and heading, they are driving towards Guayaquil."
"To Guayaquil, are you sure?"
"That is what I believe, Inspector."
"Hold all flights, no one must leave."
"Advise the patrol boats, we will comb the entire Guayaquil."
"Is she ready, does she have petrol?"
"Yes sir, shall I accompany you?"
I would not recommend it.
"Quickly, push off the boat."
Call the pilots and advise them to be ready.
Yes.
Ms. Bristol.
"HQ to flies, HQ to flies, HQ to flies"
"Flies to HQ, go ahead."
"This is an emergency, have plane 336 ready to carry out plan two."
We will carry out plan two.
Have them send a plane to cover us if needed.
"Send a plane to protect us if necessary, on the river."
"Understood, we will be ready."
"Captain, radar registers a light craft that is closing in fast to our stern."
Its Dinamo.
Prepare arms!
Battlestations!
"Attention, light helicopters,patrol entire sector."
"Attention, Yacht club, attention, Yacht club."
You have to use some kind of protection or you are going to be--
"Mom, I am not having sex, all right?"
Really!
I am not even close to an embarrassing degree.
Okay.
"I am sorry, honey."
I want you to be prepared when the time comes.
- Whenever the time comes.
"- lt will never come, not with Jordan."
- ls that what is bothering you?
"- No, nothing is bothering me."
- Something is bothering you.
"- Mom, you couldn't possibly..."
"understand or help. I don't mean to hurt your feelings so just, please?"
I am here if you need me.
You know that.
- That is good to know about.
- Yeah.
My uncle choked on a chicken bone.
"That's when the change happened, J ust like that,"
"Somewhere ln those few seconds, I knew my life would never be the same,"
- Did he survive?
- Yeah.
"I knew then that the rumor was right, Not ln actuality, but ln my heart,"
"Because at that moment I would have done anything, I wanted him so much,"
"Look, I didn't say anything about, you know."
- l know.
- l just wanted you to know that.
Thank you.
Because I'm not like that.
I don't do that.
No.
I'd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
"Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?"
I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.
Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.
Really?
In front of your sister?
We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.
Excuse me.
I'm going to go wander the streets alone.
"Invisible, unwanted and unloved;"
a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.
I forgot my windbreaker.
It's chilly.
I don't understand.
Is this a way to break in new shoes?
No.
"Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off."
"Pretty, pretty, pretty."
Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
The what?
Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard.
Message received.
"Commence operation ""Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."""
Hey.
Seriously?
Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
I wish.
A clique requires friends.
- I didn't have any.
- None?
No.
You said he'd missed his tram.
No.
"You did, Mr Kirkby."
We had a whole conversation about it.
I might have been hallucinating.
Hallucinating?
From shellshock.
Do you suffer from shellshock?
Occasionally.
I can't let you back in.
I know.
She's stuck in there with that idiot.
I want to rescue her.
I want to run away with her.
Does SHE know that?
Probably not.
"The whole thing's been a series of half-cocked blunders, of which me shoving him in the chest and failing to give him a cactus is the last in a long line."
"Well, she's only on the first floor."
Doesn't matter what floor she's on if you can't let me back in.
"Of course, if you were to rush past me, grab a decorator's ladder and put it up against her window, there wouldn't be much I could do about it."
Wouldn't there?
I'm not very quick on my pins.
I don't have the full complement.
Caught a packet in the first lot.
Sniper.
Vimy Ridge.
"Go on, chump."
Oh...
"Can you hold the door, love?"
"On your signal, Lionel."
Have you seen a gentleman?
- Giant oysters are the best.
- Some of them were humongous.
- Big oysters.
""" 15,000 kroner for legal assistance."" Okay."
- For what?
- That matter with the mouth painter.
- Fine.
You want the money up front?
- No.
We talked about it the locker room.
I thoroughly explained your options according to the law.
I'm afraid you're going to have to tell me again.
I didn't hear it.
- Weren't you listening?
- I didn't hear a word.
"Bloody hell, Frank."
"Casper, you were there."
I remember you standing there...
I couldn't quite concentrate because you weren't wearing any trousers.
- So...
- You're making me feel ill at ease.
There I was explaining things and you just stared at my crotch.
- You were very close to me.
- We're all guys in the locker room.
"Mads told me how to deal with the mouth painter, in the locker room."
I had his pecker in my face so I didn't hear a word.
"Oh, come on."
I quietly told you what to do...
"Save it for the locker room, please."
I'm going to take this and leave.
Nice to see you.
"- Give me the bill, Mads."
"I mean, we both do."
"Ryan, that's enough."
[Sighs]
"Hello, Peter, it's Geoffrey Barkway."
I wonder if you are available.
I'd like you to speak at my conference on human justice.
"Tell me honestly, does my bum look big in this?"
I prefer the pinstripe.
"Now, ties."
What about classic green or this rather happening yellow number?
What do we think?
If you don't get a move on you'll miss the conference.
All right!
OK.
"You have yourself a very, very well-deserved holiday."
"Thank you, I will."
I hope the speech goes well.
Thanks.
"Lyle, don't forget the good name of Kingdom  Kingdom lies in your hands."
And in Scott's.
You may need to be quite firm.
"Don't worry, cometh the hour, cometh the man, and I ameth the man."
"Ahoy, shipmates!"
"- Bon voyage, Mr Snell."
- Wait for me!
- What are you doing?
"- I wouldn't want to miss the party, would I?"
"It's a conference, Simon, a serious conference."
(Starts car)
I'd like to begin by welcoming you to this keynote presentation on the essentially universal subject of human justice.
Given by a small-town solicitor from Market Shipborough.
That's all right.
"It's just that I've broken down just down the road and, well, wouldn't you know it, the bloody mobile."
Would you mind if I borrowed your phone to call the AA?
Erm...you'll have to tell me where I am.
Of course.
Come inside.
Thank you.
You're an absolute angel.
Last number to call the house and last number dialled.
How was she?
What's that mean?
Did she seem suspicious or anything?
?
A bit trusting.
"I wouldn't let anybody into my house, whatever their sob story."
That's cos you're a hardfaced bitch.
Sorry.
While you steal credit cards from lonely and vulnerable women.
Just a moment of madness?
"No, that was just a cheap whore in a bar."
"Well, don't be too hard on yourself."
"It had been a while, hadn't it?"
Which showed.
"Sorry, guys."
"I'd advise you two to get a room, but it seems you already have."
"Shut up, Calum."
Now sit nice and try not to lick the windows.
Hello?
Is that the Long Bay Hotel?
"Can you put me through to Iain Risdale, please?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that's him."
"Have a seat, Mrs erm?"
- Er...
Compton!
- We'll see what we can do for you.
Maybe we could set up a trust fund so they're provided for.
- What?
- A trust fund.
So that they are provided for.
Of course they are!
"Every morning, regular."
Minnie has her milk warmed but Sandrine doesn't.
Fresh from the fridge or she turns her nose up at it.
"The boys have their Crackles in the morning and the ladies in the afternoon, and that is important, and you should write this down, young man."
Use your mouse.
"Mrs Compton, I understand."
Leave it with me.
(Knocks on door)
Hi.
"Tell me something, Peter, when did this Mary Goodyear die, exactly?"
- Three weeks ago.
- The same time Barkway invited you to speak at his conference.
"Thank you, and good morning."
And welcome all to our conference on human justice.
Bunking off class?
That isn't like you.
- Going to a rave or something?
"- No, the library."
"- Miss Cramer, please..."
- Let me get this straight.
Barkway has seen that intimidating me personally doesn't work.
So now he's sent his poodle to do the job instead.
"Really, Miss Cramer, I am nobody's poodle."
"Police are questioning the victims' acquaintances, and are expanding their investigation."
"Jung Ki-ho, reporting from Nam Mountain."
Sure you didn't do it?
I didn't.
- Then who?
- I don't know.
Are you sure?
"- You did it, didn't you?"
- Don't!
Why would I kill them?
I asked if you took my cellphone.
We will see a lunar eclipse within the next weeks.
The weather bureau reported that this will be the biggest...
This is my food.
Where have you been?
You scared me.
Have something on your mind lately?
I understand that kids your age want to hold on to a secret.
"Your father understands, okay?"
Thanks.
All I want to give you is one advice.
"Whatever you've eaten until now, whether it be raw or boiled, if you want to eat something from now on, you can't lick your chops, I mean, you can't eat it."
- Understand?
- Don't wake me up.
Can you breathe in there?
Where can I hide it this time?
You've worked too hard.
Who's there?
Surprise!
Happy birthday!
"I knew it was your birthday, so I wanted to surprise you."
Was it too surprising?
I'm out of it.
- I can get us past the lock.
- So can I.
After me.
Whoa!
- Bluestone!
- Help!
(crash)
(groans)
Now that's what I call an entrance.
Who's there?
What is this?
I want answers!
"So do we, gargoyle."
So do we.
(banging)
- Why didn't you use the key I gave you?
- I lost it on the way down!
Why didn't you warn me about that blasted chute?
Any advance hesitation on your part might have made the gargoyle suspicious.
But you played your part well.
Now the fun begins.
(Malone) Welcome to the Hotel Cabal.
(Matt) That brings us to where we left off.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
I'm sure you've noticed by now this is no ordinary hotel.
The Cabal is designed to decimate one's grip on reality.
"Once your defenses are down, we step in and strip your mind of its most precious memories and darkest secrets."
"By the time a guest leaves here, he's little more than a mindless cretin."
Funny how the least little thing sets him off.
I know what you're thinking - open window.
Too good to be true.
"What you did was righteous, but the magistrate will disagree."
Stay away from Ahsan for a while.
But...
"Wherever you go, whatever you do, don't lose the spirit and courage you showed today."
"And someday, you will restore your grandfather's good name and revive this clan."
You will be able to change the world as you so desire.
Father...!
Are we doing the right thing?
Let him go.
Heaven has made him with a purpose I'm sure...
"Forgive me, sir..."
Yi Soon-shin?
That bastard is out to destroy me!
"Yi Soon-shin, that bastard!"
Soon-shin!
Chun-su!
Where are you going alone?
"You're not running away without me, are you?"
Chun-su...
I'm coming with you.
I'm sick of this place.
What am I going to do here in Ahsan without you and without my father?
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
Let's stop and rest for a while?
"No, we have to be out of Chun-an before dawn."
But I can't take another step!
We have to go.
I can't!
Let me get a drink of water at least.
"Chun-su, let's get going!"
Hold your horses?
See you later.
[phone rings]
All right.
So?
How'd you get on?
"What, totally empty?"
I tried.
I'll drive myself.
I've got a nice new car there.
See you in a bit.
"Make it look good, eh?"
"I already have, Jimmy."
I already have.

What do you know about a drug called Knipex?
Knipex.
"Ah, it's a dopamine agonist used to treat neurological disorders."
"Stops tremors, that sort of thing."
Wow.
Even I feel bad trying to win a bet against a guy who's sick.
But not that bad.
All right.
"Thanks, Mike."
"Hi, honey."
[Sighs]
I knew I'd find you here.
But you left so quickly last night.
"Well, I was trying to call that health inspector."
Do you know how much money we're losing every day we're closed?
"Well, listen, overseeing Wolfgang Puck's new place, plus Opus,"
"Mystique, all the beverage and food operations..."
"You know, maybe it's just, you know, a little too much."
Is that it?
What?
It's overwhelming.
You're letting things slide.
Slide?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
That stuff happens.
Happens all the time.
"But the question is, how... how can we fix this?"
I cannot believe you have so little faith in me.
That inspector's just trying to get revenge on me for refusing to go out on a date with him.
"Come on, honey."
That report's a fake.
He made it all up.
"Michelangelo, can I?"
Can I ask you something?
"Do you think that something is, like, there, whether you look at it or not?"
"And... and do you think everything or every, every, every, every, everybody exists that ever was or ever will be?"
"Because, then, logically you don't have to do anything at all."
You can just sit and wait and wait for it all to happen but...
"But I don't want to wait, you know?"
Cos what if that's not true?
"I mean, free will must have something to do with it, otherwise what's the point of being alive?"
Have you got?
Have you got?
"Have you got, like, some place I could stay?"
I mean...
"I mean, would your mum?"
"Would your mum mind, if I?"
I...
I just really want to get away from... from all this.
"You know, like doing, like..."
like doing the show.
Doing the show again and...
And I thought...
And I...
But Rho...
"I mean, Rho..."
Rhoda said...
But I...
I thought...
I thought... maybe...
W... what... what do you think?
Michelangelo I would like you to record something for posterity.
And you keep it safe.

Luxury liners have long had a tendency to sink...
"So that's how it all ended, but it seems that old witch was a spy for some country that dealt in slave trade."
And who were those men chasing after me?
Secret police...?
!
You should have told me!
It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.
"Someone else forgot his cell phone before, remember?"
I see...
"Because of you, I had to be tailed by these blokes."
These blokes...?
I'll forgive you this time.
It was sorta fun.
So long...

Trees are fascinating.
They don't have to touch to propagate.
You would find that fascinating.
- How many do I need?
"- One, two, three, four..."
Why didn't I see that?
Thank you very much.
I owe you one.
Sometimes you don't see what's right in front of your face.
Six and a five.
I got you.
The pretzel!
You can have mine.
You sounded excited on the phone.
I'm going to take my theory of love as a man-made cultural creation and expand it to include the biological effect on the individual.
Greg.
You need a hobby.
"I can't believe you've dated for three months, and you haven't kissed!"
- How do you say hello?
"- Well, we nod."
It works.
You mean you haven't even touched?
"I fell down once, and he picked me up."
- We talk a lot.
That's what we do.
- About what?
"And I don't worry about what I say, what I wear, what I eat..."
It's a relief to eat with a man and not worry that he'll be frightened.
"Boss, I'm sorry, I..."
None of your business
Give him the cheque
"Ah Cheung, what a plan to give him drugged tonic"
You're good
"Damn, you set me up"
Did you betray me?
What if I did?
You've lost anyway
Si Sun...
What happened to you?
I fell from the stairs
"My son's gone, my baby is gone!"
Lost...
"Ah Kwai, help me"
My son's gone...
"You only think about your son, and not about me"
"That's not true, but I've spent so much money in the hope that I could have a son"
A son...
You should have the ability
Am I not?
I'll give you anything you want
Did you say I'm not capable?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
"You bastard lf you are that capable, marry a Miss Hong Kong"
"If it were not for me you'll still be a whore in that place, you bitch"
I didn't come to Hong Kong to bear you a son
What's a woman for if not for bearing children?
This son is not yours
"Not mine, you're saying I'm impotent?"
"Alright, let me show you"
You think she's gonna be psyched?
"Totes, dude."
Why wouldn't she be?
So how does this work?
We just--we show up in Amsterdam and we start calling hotels... and ask if they have a Maria staying there?
- I don't even know her last name.
"- Dude, it's totally cool."
We're definitely gonna find her.
Amsterdam is a very small place.
It's not gonna be--
"Sir, I need you to step aside, please."
Let me search you.
- Did I beep?
"- No, you didn't beep."
Just a random security check.
"If you could just step aside, please?"
Just over here.
"- Random, huh?"
- Yeah.
So this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?
"Kumar, just do what the guy says."
"Sir, it's our job as airport security... to search for all possible weapons or illegal drugs."
"So just because of the colour of my skin, you assume that I have drugs on me?"
"- No, he's--"
"- What are you, a racist?"
Racist?
"Dude, I'm black."
He's black.
He's not a racist.
"Please, dude, you're barely even brown."
"No, he didn't mean that."
"Compared to me, you look like Matthew Perry."
"Alvin, please think about what you're doing."
May I remind you that you are addressing the president of the United States?
"Mr. President, I don't wanna write off any Americans yet."
"Trust me, sir, we'll get your house back for you."
"Mission'sa go,colonel."
"Thank you, sir."
You heard the president.
Six minutes.
"So, what's it like being president?"
It's not like anything.
"Once you get into office, it's all about reelection.."
and what the other side can use against you.
Politics.
You don't start out a politician..
but you become one.
"Just once, though, I wanna do something that's presidential."
"Something along the lines of Lincoln, Washington and Jefferson."
You wanna make history.
No.
Not history.
I wanna make a difference.

- He's wrong.
"- No, that'd be fine."
Thank you very much.

Wait.
Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear.
and he tells you you got a headache...
"Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news."
I wish I was sick.
Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
You should not say that.
"What should I say, Denise?"
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.

"I had everything, on paper."
Came from a good family.
Met my wife.
Had a family of my own.
It wasn't enough.
I felt... ordinary.
But with Richard and Emma...
"well, I'm special."
Not that special.
There were six others before you.
Out of billions.
I matter here.

"But one day, all this... will kill you."
"Well, better a short life filled with pleasure than a long one searching forjoy."

"Incidentally, how's Judy doing?"
"Dad, Judy's pulling a Rip Van Winkle act."
She keeps sleeping continually.
"Ah, she's probably just all worn out, honey."
Or she might have picked up a virus infection or something so the rest can do her good.
Have you heard from Jack and Mike?
Not a peep out of them.
I can't even reach 'em

- Neither can I.
"Well, maybe they got a lead on Sally."
I hope so.

"Aye, sir."
This is a nuclear mission order.
The major's right.
We don't have any troops to spare if we're gonna hold this position.
Screw this position !
We can take those hills.
Use guerilla tactics.
That's I've been talking about.
"No, that is not the mission."
We have our orders.
Thank you.
"Howard, Homicide."
"Hey, Beth."
Lunch tomorrow?
"Sure, what time?"
Fire inspector?
"She knows the bar, says it won't be a problem but she can't get here till next week."
Building inspector?
A slight snag.
He's sick.
He's scheduled to do the tour 8:00am Thursday if his rabies clears up.
Health inspector?
I'm meeting him tomorrow at 10:00am.
He's nice.
I dated his sister once.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
All of these bureaucrats have to sign off before we can buy the bar?
That's how it works.
Why can't they just have one guy come down and check out everything?
I'm no expert but I'm starting to believe in less government.
"There's too much regulation, there's too many shackles and business should be free of these kinds of restraints."
"Anyway, what do I know?"
I'm just a silent partner.
Does he seem silent to you?
- Coffee?
"- Yeah, thanks."
"Sometimes after these marathon shifts, I get these coffee headaches, and the only way to get rid of them is to drink more coffee."
How about I buy?
Buy?
"It's the squad's coffee, it's free."
"I'd still like to buy, huh?"
"Therefore, as a senior council member,"
I declare we can no longer entrust the affairs of our nation to him.
President Choi Eung Chan... will be impeached!
Mr. President...
Congress has agreed on your impeachment.
I couldn't protect you...
I'm Sorry.
It's okay...
"Actually, I feel free."
It should've been sooner.
It had to turn out like this.
What is this?
These people were asked to pass the Private School Reform Bill... and accepted bribes.
Stand them up.
Bring them in.
It has been revealed that these Congressman accepted bribes in exchange for passing the Private School Reform Bill.
Evidence has been found and an investigation is underway.
It looks like he's going to be impeached.
Those punks...
"Well, since they betrayed the citizens..."
"Where are you going, Yoon Sung?"
I'm going to Father.
"Kim Na Na, you're on duty tomorrow, aren't you?"
"Since we're in an emergency situation right now, be prepared for when a decision comes forth."
"Chief, I'm not on duty tomorrow."
You are on duty.
Did you get something wrong?
I'm not.
I wrote on my schedule...
Mr. President's seven-day guarding schedule.
Mr. President...
Hello?
What?
Please don't do that stuff!
Don't do that!
"In the year 1701, in a royal hallway of Edo castle,"
"Lord Akou assaulted Kira, a nobleman, with his sword!"
"Lord Akou was made to commit hara-kiri as his vassals scattered as ronin, disguised as merchants and doctors..."
Our story begins one year later in a poor neighborhood in Edo
"By this winter morning, swordfighting has blown out of fashion with the wind"
For Rent
Wake up!
Morning time...
Wake up!
"Quick, wash your face and get down to the fish market"
"Let me sleep a little longer, Onobu..."
You took the day off yesterday
The sun's already up!
Hurry up!
I'll leave you behind
All this noise every damned morning
Please let me escape this dump
Is master Soza up and about?
What's your business with him?
I'm sure you're up to no good
Do you have to put it like that?
"He needs my advice, that's all"
"Hurry, Pa, or they'll close the fish market"
I'm taking the day off
You took the day off yesterday
What are you still doing in bed?
"Good morning, Osae san"
Already off?
Totally green.
Zero carbon footprint after manufacture.
It looks like a handbag.
Bet it really pulls the birds.
I'm going out.
You stay here and do absolutely nothing.

- Just a minute.
Hello.
Millington Tech Support.
"- Make yourself comfortable, my boy."
"- Oh, yes!"
There we are.
Ho-ho!
"It's driving like a dream, Mr Matthews."
"Like most people of genius, Mary had a grand theory."
So...
Thank you.
"Mary spent 20 years trying to model plankton population, so that we could work towards re-seeding the deserted areas of the ocean."
You're talking about fish food.
"Plankton can also absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, Mr Kingdom."
Re-seed even a fraction of the Pacific and you could stop global warming in its tracks.
- Reverse it.
- Gosh!
Gosh!
That is why Barkway wants to get his hooks into it.
"But, Miss Cramer..."
"Oh, please call me Janet, since you are buying me cakes and everything."
"Janet, all Professor Barkway intends is to publish Mary's research."
Isn't that exactly what she would have wanted?
Don't you think I'm a better judge of that than anyone else?
"So, you're going to publish it yourself?"
Commissioner ... has failed to ensure peace cows.
"It is necessary to provide the size, I   ever."

She burns the sharks than in other times have rejoiced to roast his wife.
"A hero, Commissioner, suffering ..."

The horses are waiting for me at the gate.
"Accompagnatemi not, I will go alone."
Give me a drink.
- Now where you go?
- In town.
- This is Nina Nicolaevna?
- Yes
"Last Thursday, my uncle was not good and we have telegraphed to come."
Why you say that you kissed the land on which he walked?
You should kill me instead.
"Rest, I must rest!"
I am a seagull!
I said to you:
"lies, pain ..."
Do not you want more.
I am an actress!
I am an actress!
"He did not believe the theater, we always joke with my dreams, and I have come to an end to believe it too."
I have lost the courage!
"The torments of love, jealousy ..."
The continuing fear for my child.
"They become petty, insignificant, read like a slut,"
"I did not know what to do with my hands, no longer controlling my voice."
You do not know this.
Sentire to recite so abominable.
"He hit me with rod, non-stop hitting..."
He hit from the left and then from the right...
He wanted to use a pair of swords to kill me.
I haven't seen these evidence before.
They are our new discoveries.
"To kill a person, why should he bring along so many weapons?"
That strongly proved that he was well-planned to kill Chun.
He even wanted to kill innocent citizen.
"Even though, he didn't mind to die with all."
Bull shit!
You creeper!
"You are framing me, you will die a dog's death!"
Bastard!
You will go to hell!
"Your Honour, I request to charge Foon with some more charges... threatening judiciary officer, contempt of court, bodily injury, and throw rubbish in public place."

Don't lose your mind.
Why did you throw my shoe away?
Give me back my shoe.
Take this first.
Super swords!
Capital Chopper!
I smell something weird.
What's this?
Cat's stool.
Why are you that hungry?
It may be very important clues.
"Brother Lone, what made you think so?"
Because of my name.
I made many clues.
How about that shoe?
- Next week.
- That's what I thought.
- I thought you were on later.
- I heard what happened.
- I thought we might need help.
"- Actually, we only got the one."
Three went straight to the morgue.
- Sorry I didn't come by last night.
- It's okay.
Maggie and I played Scrabble.
I got a 75-point word.
- Really?
"- ""Cyanotic."" She challenged it."
...found brutally murdered early this morning inside of this establishment.
Doc Magoo's a diner frequented by staff and visitors of County General Hospital.
The crime was committed prior to opening as the staff was preparing for a day of serving the usual sandwiches and sodas.
What got served instead was a cold-blooded robbery-homicide in which four people were murdered execution-style.
- One of them's still alive.
- Police are trying to identify suspects.
- More on the story later.
- Any word on Eric?
I don't expect any.
It's like a bear hibernating.
He won't come out till spring.
"Hey, what do you say we go out tonight?"
Sushi.
Just you and me.
- Maggie can fend for herself.
- Told her I'd drive her to the bus station.
- She's leaving?
- Yep.
- Is that a good thing?
When is a man safe from such wit.
if infirmity does not protect him?
If he is infirm.
then I am at death's door.
- He complained of rheumatism.
"- ""A slight ache"" was his phrase."
Edward said he would bring it himself.
"""It gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its owner."""
"""Business prevents my delivering it, which will hurt me more than you."""
"""Memories of your kindness must sustain me."
And I remain -
"- Your devoted servant, E.C. Ferrars."""
- Why hasn't he come?
"- He says he's busy, dear."
- He said he'd come.
Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.
I fear Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.
- You must miss him.
Elinor.
"- We are not engaged, Mamma."
"- But he loves you, dearest."
- I am by no means assured of that.
"And had he such a preference, there would certainly be obstacles -"
- To his marrying a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar.
- But your heart must tell you...
- It is better to use one's head.
- It can't be good for me.
- It is.
Stop complaining.
- Dunnett.
- Major Dunnett.
It means going a hundred miles into occupied French territory.
"Care to come along, Sharpe?"
- But...
- Good.
"Tomorrow, I go on ahead."
Alone.
"It attracts less attention and gives me a chance to contact my Spanish agents who are searching, too."
"A small special force of Rifles attached to Dunnett's force will travel a day behind, in case I need help."
"That's where you come in, Richard."
Want you to command the sharp shooters
Sir Arthur.
The men you will be commanding must know nothing of this mission in case of capture.
"That is a secret shared between you and your superior officers,"
Major Dunnett and Captain Murray
"Whatever happens, one of you must get through to Casa Antigua."
You'll find them camped about three miles north of here.
They like to live rough.
They expect you at dawn tomorrow.
Give this to Captain Murray.
"Major Dunnett is an officer of the old school, Sharpe."
He may not erm...
He may not approve of my raising an officer from the ranks
"Yes, sir."
He may not erm... mind his manners.
So you must mind yours.
Sir.
"Good luck, Mr Sharpe."
Er Richard
The shilling.
"Will he do, Hogan?"
Looking quite dazed.
And what happened to the skinny little boy?
When I looked around... he was gone.
I wonder how a skinny little boy could have carried Suzukichi all the way back here?
Because it was the water imp.
Water imp?
"Later on, the village people and my father talked about that."
But then they all came to the conclusion that it was the water imp.
"Those skinny, cucumber-like arms and legs."
"And his green face, like a leaf."
It couldn't possibly have been anything else but the water imp.
Grandma is pretty good at telling all those make-believe stories.
"Maybe it's our fault, listening to her so seriously."
"It's not make-believe, it's her dotage."
"After all, consider her age."
What happened?
The water imp was peeking in the window!
Stop talking nonsense!
Shinjiro!
"Why, you..."
Wait up!
"""Suzujiro confirmed the names of his brothers."
"""Please come to a definite decision to come to Hawaii."
"Tadao. """
"What'll you do, Grandma?"
I'll go.
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death is coming pretty soon.
I will go after I hold a memorial service for him.
All right?
What?
Grandma decided to go?
Yes.
Why say that he kissed the earth on which I walked?
"Kill me, you needed."
I am so tired.
"Rest, rest!"
I am a seagull.
I am a seagull.
I am a seagull.
"No, it's not true."
"I am an actress, you ..."
"Even he is here, si ..."
"But it does nothing,"
"Did not believe him at the theater, is a mockery of my dreams, and I finished to cease to believe it too."
"I have lost the courage, the torments of love, jealousy ... the constant fear for my child."
"I became a petty, insignificant, read like a slut,"
"I did not know that what to do with my hands, nor as being in the scene."
No longer controlling my voice!
Do not know what means this situation.
It's good for me.
Learn to bring your cross.
It preserves your faith.
I have faith ...
- And the suffering.
- This is ridiculous.
A girl so ...
And when I think of my vocation ...
- It is said: the whores ...
- You should ...
Life does not make me more afraid.
Perhaps to die?
"Here is still alive my last Venini, the untouchable, not the only one who has ever touched me!"
The only burning ...
Chiasso nothing particularly ...
Let's give it another 15 seconds.
"Doyou want to sit down... together sometime, like with coffee or something?"
Yeah.
"Well, if you everfeel too old to drive, just call that number."
I can't hear you!
- Is she of color?
- And do you love me?
No.
But she's a woman.
Even though I am sometimes irritating?
And a little bit selfish!
"Oh, her."
Even when I forget to ask you how your day was?
"Yeah, okay."
Didn't we already show a local person this year?
I don't think she's ready.
Let's go to slides.
I really do love you-
"All right, what we need to ask ourselves... about each one of these is:"
"Could this have been made in any era, or only now?"
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.
"Okay, what does this tell us about digital culture?"
I don't think this tells us anything about digital culture.
I think you're right.
Let me guess.
This one's about AIDS.
"Yeah, it's not really on the theme, right?"
And we already have photography.
"You know, we have those photos and e-mails."
E-mail wouldn't even exist if it weren't for AIDS.
Fear of contamination.
"Say, you're right!"
"Round up the board of directors, we got to have a meeting."
"Jimmy, my boy!"
Josie.
I knew she'd bring us luck.
"All i could find, boss, was the night shift directors."
Send them in.
"Come in, folks."
"You can leave the pail outside, mrs."
Callahan.
"Sam, will you sit there?"
"Arthur, you sit at the head of the table."
"Mrs. Callahan, would you mind taking that seat?"
"All right, we have a quorum."
"We'll dispense with the reading of the minutes and the roll call, and hear the treasurer's report."
I ain't got no report to make.
But i move that the board of directors authorize this company to issue
$10 million worth of convertible bonds.
I second the motion.
I third it.
"All those in favor will signify by saying ""aye."""
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Contrary-minded?
Nay.
Motion is carried.
Look at this mop.
It's the only one i've got.
I don't think i ought to vote for that 10 million till i get a new one.
"Chairman, i move that we convert these bonds into common stock for public sale."
I second the motion.
Are you calling for the President's daughter?
Oh how come you...?
Just saw her in a ceremony before.
I just saw her go to that side.
It should be okay now.
Let's leave.
Why... do you plan to leave now?
Go where?
I came out because I have a headache.
Let's go inside now.
I really appreciate your help.
If it wasn't for you...
Just thinking about it is scary.
That's right.
"That woman just now, her contact method,"
Maybe that unlucky person will know.
Unlucky person?
"Yesterday, did you or didn't you lose her?"
We lost her.
I heard you were doing well in training.
"If this continues, how can I let you be bodyguards in the US?"
What did I tell you?
I said her character is really different.
Don't tell me you didn't know what that meant!
We will note that.
"For her protection, intervals should be avoided and she should be followed closely."
Maybe you guys think you should not be blamed and I should pity you because you are young.
"But, her father is the president."
=There's a call.=
=There are two messages.=
For you.
"Hey, it's cold."
But what will you do?
Think it over once again Jai
Are you making a mistake?
Grave mistake
Will you go back to India and prove that Om was right and we were wrong?
I'm not going back to India
I came to this city because this is a midway place.
Not fast like Mumbai
"Nor slow, like our Satna."
"As of now, I'm working in Pizza Hut"
"But someday, I'll build myself a fast food chain"
So I got to find myself a job soon.
"Yes, I talked up a computer firm"
They order pizzas from us.
When Can I meet up?
Tonight.
"Actually, they start working from 10 in the night"
G Four
Heard lots about you
Hacking papers from Mumbai University is no mean task
We're entering a bank account.
The one who pulls off the heist... is entitled to 50 percent of the loot
The rest is ours.
G Four's
So... you are professional hackers?
What are you?
Baby hacker?
One thing for Sure
"If we're thieves, you're a thief too"
"Grandma, why have we left our home?"
Why have we come here?
It was too large a house for so few of us
He never told me that.
You see?
"You never know, do you?"
"On the other hand,"
Ward Fowler has an alibi.
He was with Mark during the whole time during the murder.
And that alibi is ain'tight.
Is it as ain'tight as Sid Daley's?
"Oh, I think it's more, sir."
"I mean, a girl that you're gonna marry is much more apt to provide an alibi than a gofer."
What do we conclude from this interrogation?
"Ward Fowler denies having a motive, he won't admit to having means,"
and he can prove that he didn't have opportunity.
So that leaves us with Sid Daley.
"That's a great third act line, isn't it?"
"""That leaves us with Sid Daley."""
"Well, I think this has been very helpful, sir."
Thank you very much.
I certainly appreciate it.
Oh.
"One more thing, sir."
We got something else on the gun.
Did I mention that?
"No, you."
Didn't.
"What, Lieutenant?"
A thread sir.
From the parka?
"No, sir."
"We haven't traced the garment from which the thread came from yet, sir."
"Lieutenant, if I were you, I'd get a search warrant for all four people involved."
"Yes, sir."
All you think of is that dress!
What does she need it for?
Just so she can appear in it?
So she looks pretty.
What's wrong with that?
"Pretty, and for whom?"
She definitely wants to impress someone!
They want to impress each other.
Do you think we only dress up to attract some boy...
During that dance I felt she's longing to dance like that with a boy in a pretty dress.
So what?
She's eighteen.
"is she ready for it psychologically, or only biologically?"
Why do you ask me what I think about it?
"Of course, I'm interested, aren't I?"
Why do you analyse it like that?
Buy her material for that dress!
What do you keep worrying about?
You keep changing the subject.
"When you're meant to buy a dress, you begin philosophising."
"- Excuse me, where does the architect live?"
"- Sorry, who?"
I'm looking for the architect.
- Which one?
There are several here.
- Mr Ravinger.
There are as many Ravingers here as there are Anabaptists
"We're five families living here, you know."
"They have a boy in the ninth form, Marcel."
Then that's mine.
What a coincidence.
Do you know something about Marcel?
"Right, yeah."
That's not an option.
"So maybe get fired and buy a puppy, then."
Really working for me.
"Which style of cuisine would your master most favour today, sir?"
He's still keen on the seafood but he's after something...soft.
"Soft, sir?"
"He's a busy man, he don't want to waste time chewing."
I understand completely.
I would suggest caviar.
"Caviar, what?"
They're fish eggs.
Soft as silk but terrifically tasty.
Fish eggs?
Mm-hm.
Fish eggs?
Mm-hm.
Fish eggs?
"Now that, my friend, is scrummy."
Hello again.
"Just to say, despite what I said earlier, we sadly had a burglary this afternoon, so now have to make a few cutbacks."
Fixing the toilets will have to wait.
Typical!
It is typical.
It's typical of one or two antisocial grain thieves who ruin it for everyone.
It's your fault for moving Big Paulus up here to play their stupid jug game.
Shut up.
It's a great game.
"Either way, we also can't afford new chairs."
"Oh, classic!"
You say you're one of us but you're just another lying exec looking after your mates.
"I, for one, won't stand for it."
Light Yagami.
The Gods of death do not take souls.
Contrary to what humans say.
Once the notebook falls into the human world.
It belongs to the world of humans.
"In other words, it's yours."
I do not want!
"Well, well."
"Still, you should not forward saying relative and all."
You should show the hierarchy respect.
"Whatever is the idea you get, say first to me."
I will forward that after filtering.
It is a risk to you once we take a reverse.
"Even if it is a risk, I should get all the credit."
Promise on Lord Hanuman.
- You locked me so.
Okay boss!
"What is this boss, like calling the adjacent guy in a bar."
"If I call dude to boss instead of boss, it is an insult to you only."
"I see, then boss is fixed."
What is this file in hands like Panchangam in the hands of a priest?
Oh god!
Never finger this file.
This is purely personal.
Sorry Boss
Very good Karthik
- Thank you sir
You have successfully joined into his chamber.
What is your next move?
"To make the next move, I need a dummy fool from your department sir."
What?
- Yes.
How do you know that?
She spoke of them.
Of their games.
A song they'd sing to calm her to sleep.
"Sometimes, I'd hear her sing it softly, to herself."
How lonely.
And haunting.
Yes.
I'm going to tell you something that might enrage you.
"Since mary's arrival, I've had visions of francis's death."
Violent images.
"They vary, but they were always tied to mary."
But they stopped completely when clarissa died.
"I have beckoned them, every way I know how,"
Because I had to be sure.
Sure of what?
That francis might live with mary.
How can that be possible?
"I warned you that francis, your firstborn,"
Would die because of mary...
You were very clear.
...Before either of us knew clarissa was your firstborn.
"The blood that has been spilled,"
"My blood yet,"
Was because of what you foresaw.
"It's not a science, it's a gift."
"Sometimes I hear voices, other times it's a feeling,"
A certainty as solid as stone.
And this new feeling?
It came to me today.
"I saw their life together, and it is happy."
"After dinner, and your usual game of catch with anne,"
I deny that we are intending to supply them with weapons.
These lies are useless.
We know you're helping the subversives.
I want names.
I have none to give you.
He told you already...
we don't know anything about the resistance!
I've heard that many times from many people.
Take him.
"Lieutenant, stop!"
That will not help either of us.
He's right.
Open up!
No!
Break it down!
I see soldiers out there.
Whas happening?
They're everywhere... searching the whole area.
I don't want to cause trouble for you.
I'll go soon asit's dark.
You've always been a troublemaker ever since you could walk.
I've never seen such a willful child.
But thas what I love most about you... your spirit.
"Now, don't worry."
"When they come through here, we'll be gone already."
"Now, your mother will want some of her things."
Ah...a pretty dress to wear.
They're only looking for me.
You don't have to get any more involved than you already are.
"Why, if my precious girl is involved then I'm involved, too."
Do you remember this?
She always used to wear it on special occasions.
"Soon-shin, talk to me!"
What went wrong?
"Why, sir?"
I must know why you made such an unfair decision?
Are you really oblivious as to why you failed?
Ask your father.
How dare you even think to apply for the exam!
There is no place for descendents of traitors in the royal court?
Good hunting today.
"Here, it's your share."
"I was the lead today, isn't that right?"
Then my share is larger than that.
"Why are you sitting out here, wife?"
"Oh, you're back."
"It's been months since the exam, and Shoo-shin is yet to find peace."
I'm concerned.
Will he ever be all right?
One must hit the bottom to bounce back.
He must undergo what he must.
Let's just watch him.
I shouldn't have encouraged him.
I had resented you.
A part of me was angry with you for not allowing the boys to pursue their studies.
And I had hopes.
I believed that someone in this world would give my boy a chance... that their spirit and talent would be recognized...
Innkeeper!
Innkeeper!
Bring me more wine!
More wine!
I'm coming!
Stop this now.
Stop!
"Well, can you blame me?"
No worries.
I am more than happy with the way things worked out.
"Hey, guys."
Enjoy the party.
"Oh, my favorite married couple."
- Rosalie.
- Come on.
I'll show you around.
Why not?
Think of this party like a 1950s housewife...
Proper and reserved on the outside... naughty behind closed doors.
Each room has a different office-related theme for play.
We call this the afternoon delight room.
Everything in here is about your middle of the workday fantasy.
That's one way to get ahead.
Give that man a raise.
Adriana would like to speak to you for a moment.
In your office.
Don't be long.
"I paid for your ass tonight, and I expect to have it to myself."
"Yes, ma'am."
This is a great location for a party.
Promise you'll let me come back.
"If this small talk is just a ploy to seduce me,"
I'm not interested.
I just got a call from Agent Garcia about your case.
Good news: the investigation will be closed on Monday...
Thank God.
When they arrest Victor on fraud and money laundering charges.
They found out?
"They already knew, Neil."
I think on some level he knew what he was doing when he charged those men.
You think he wanted to die?
I think he was suffering.
I think he wanted to be with his wife.
"You know, there's this Buddhist concept called Kalyana-mittata, or spiritual companionship."
And they say that it transcends death or rebirth.
"Well, maybe he got what he wanted."
Clara:
Maybe he did.
"You know, technically, this doesn't disprove the evidence of the yeti."
There could still be undiscovered species out there.
"- Hey, Monty."
"- Yes, sir."
Enough with the yeti.
- Let's go home.
"- Yes, please."

I shall ride ahead and announce His Majesty's arrival.
"No, I shall announce my own arrival."
A little surprise will do them a world of good.
May I ask what this is about?
"Her Majesty did not confide in me, Madame."
You mean you know but you won't tell me.
The Marquise de Montespan.
"Her Majesty has summoned me here for a reason, I imagine."
"Yes, it relates to your debts."
And I was not aware that I had any.
I had to give my undivided attention to the repairing of the wires.
Cutter and MacChesney should have watched out for the enemy... but they were off chasing butterflies or something like that.
"I finally got the detachment to the river, and we dived in and escaped."
"Tommy, you're so marvelous."
"That's all there is to it, I suppose."
On the last roof we almost lost MacChesney.
His great elephant hoof crashed through and stuck.
- How did you get him out?
- We had to saw his leg off at the hip.
"If you don't believe me, just look behind that shrub."
Save some for the elephant.
Destroy the evidence.
"- Stand guard, will you?"
- Yeah.
"Never mind that, Sergeant."
Stand easy.
"- Good evening, Colonel."
"- Evening, Stebbins."
"- Good evening, Major."
- How are you?
No formality.
We just dropped in to wish little Emmy the best of luck.
"That's very nice of you, sir."
I'll bring Emmy to you.
"- Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant."
"- Yes, sir."
"Very jolly, sir."
Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out?
Is that punch?
"Some peoples calls it a punch, sir, but I calls it swill."
Nonsense.
Stebbins is famous for his punch.
You dim little shit.
I hired you out of pity and this is how you repay me.
"Tomorrow, when people find out that your precious president.."
helped a maniac open the nuclear football..
"who do you think they're going to believe, you or me?"
"You, you would be a nobody."
"But me, I'm the president of the United States."
"No, you're not."
"Eli, Eli."
"Quite the politician, huh?"
You did all of this just to keep your buddies in the defence industry happy.
How far did you fall into their pockets?
This is ridiculous.
"Take him into custody, general."
"Yes, sir, Mr. President."
"No, I'm still president."
I am still president.
"Well, just consider this a coup d'état."
Get this trash off my lawn.
You're not fit for office.
You son of a bitch!
You're selling this country out to the Arabs.
This isn't over.
I got friends.
And I'll make sure all of your friends meet you in prison.
Let's get him to the hospital.
You okay?
You look terrible.
Thank you for everything you did today.
Thank you for trusting me.
Special Agent Cale!
I'm not going anywhere without my protection.
That's a complete lie.
I can't believe that you are willing to destroy
My relationship with my father because you're too scared
That yours won't love you for who you really are.
You were right.
We need to make these decisions together.
"But the truth is, consulting with someone else"
Doesn't come easily to me.
I get it.
"Vanessa, I totally support you going."
"Thank you, but I'm not taking the internship."
I'd rather lose the job than lose you.
You're not gonna lose me if you go to Haiti.
We're-we're-we're gonna find a way to make this work.
All right?
But you gotta go.
"I don't want to, and we both know"
It's better for our relationship if I stayed.
"I mean, three months is too long, and..."
I just wanna be with you.
Are you sure?
You're-you're making this decision for you?
Not me?
Not-not-not even us?
Uh...
Okay.
"Let's find a way to celebrate tonight, then-a fun way."
"We could, uh..."
Let's see.
You want to sneak 40s
"Into the midnight showing of ""the lost weekend"""
At film forum?
Get up there.
- Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
- Get off!
Get the fuck off me!
I don't know how they got in.
"I mean, how can they have gotten the door code?"
It changes every shift.
Unless someone...
They knew the code and I told Mere...
I told Meredith to lock herself inside the broadcast room to broadcast over the emergency channel.
Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
They've cut into all our other secure lines of communication.
I don't know how.
"I mean, who could know that much?"
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
Wait.
What did he just say?
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
They cut into the operator line?
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.
Yes.
"I swear to God, if you were pretending to talk to someone..."
"Katherine, I gave him the code."
He verified the code.
"Yeah, but did you verify him?"
"""Cardiff, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Belfast, Liverpool, Slough."""
Operator.
That wasn't the right code.
What?
What I just called in.
"Well, too bad."
"We need data to fight ""Exceptions,"""
so quit complaining!
"""Exceptions""?"
What's that?
Remember it's the general term for all enemies from space?
Whatever...
"They're just a bunch of space robot monsters, right?"
"Oh, you..."
Who cares?
What I wanna know is why I'm out here alone!
?
Where's Kuya?
What's he doing?
Flail and Burst are currently getting a tune-up.
"It wouldn't have killed them to come up with a more creative new weapon, you know."
Tell that to the Development Department.
Who?
I've never been there nor met anyone from there!
Neither have I. It's a highly confidential department.
I hear only the Commander and Vice Commander have come in direct contact with them.
"If they can't trust us, who can they trust?"
All clear.
This just in from Slain.
It's currently flying 200 km off the waters of Futagami Island.
"Visibility is poor, but nothing is being picked up on the sensor."
"Eyeball sensors No. 12 to 29, no movement detected."
"Sorry, I'm late."
Be careful now.
Yes.
Just as I thought...
There are too many factors that cannot be analyzed.
I think Roman is pulling some kind of stunt.
What're you talking about?
"Well, he just tore out of here in his car and he took all his stuff with him."
"Ryan, you know he's not allowed to leave the state."
"Alright, I'm coming back."
They both suffered total cardiac arrest.
Paramedics revived them on their way in but there were no signs of cognitive response from either one.
- We're assessing...
- Which one is my husband?
Can he hear me?
It's possible.
We really can't tell at this stage.
"""Casey"""
Do you want a chair?
"No, I'm not gonna stay long."
Not sure if he'd want me to.
I'm sure he appreciates it.
"Anything happens, you'll let me know?"
Either way.
Of course.
You're sweet.
Just like he said.
Mrs. Bryson?
Can we speak for a moment?
We can keep your husband on the machine so long as there is lower brain function.
And we will keep monitoring but...
It's been three weeks now.
What are you saying?
The chances of him waking are very small.
Like what?
There's no way of telling.
It could be months.
Baker persuaded someone that Buckley was more use to the war than the typewriter.
It won't last.
"He'll end up in a uniform, like every mother's son."
That is if he ever had a mother.
"More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub spawning spontaneously in saw dust."
No.
"A lot of men are scared we won't go into our boxes, when this is all over."
Makes them belligerent.
Something's changed.
I tidied it.
What happened at the meeting?
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.
What's this?
Lunch.
"Girls compile the boat at home, right?"
"They compile it, the bloody boat... they can lead the damn fleet for all I care!"
But Johnnie.
Freeze the propeller.
You're late!
I took the liberty of ordering.
It's alright.
"We've guests, eh?"
Friends from Poland.
Things are very bad in Europe.
It's not exactly a picnic here.
If you haven't noticed.
You can't find a decent waiter in service since they joined the war.
"They all got rounded up in so called ""Enemy of the State""."
Apart from Jepetto over there.
Rumor is that he is a spy.
Ceres.
- All began on the same day.
- Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
"From Latvia to Lithuania, from Estonia to Slovakia,"
"from Russia, from Poland to the Ukraine-- wherever we found them."
"250,000 blonde-haired, blue-eyed nuggets... harvested for the Third Reich."
"Nordic nuggets, to lighten up the dark Bavarians."
They took children from their parents?
They were misplaced Germans.
We brought them home.
( rhythmical resounding sound )
Eva:
"Look at you, posing for my camera, as if you didn't know I was there."
Hitler:
Do I look more mysterious in a hat?
( Eva giggles )
Eva:
Why did you never wear an official army
- SA or SS uniform?
- Better to remain undefined.
Suggestive indefiniteness.
There are so few public pictures of you smiling.
There were none before I was chancellor-- nor any with children or small animals.
The holiday in Iceland was a joyous time for my sisters and me.
You should have come with us.
You were always inspired by the Viking sagas.
The only flaw in the trip was a delay before we departed from Hamburg.
I had no time for holiday trips.
The police came just before we were to leave.
A family was removed from the ship.
- l'll never forget the cries--
He's not like any Mokra I've ever met.
I can't believe he'll really help us.
"If there's any chance for a diplomatic solution, we have to pursue it."
"In the meantime, I want continuous scans of the surface."
Standard search pattern.
I advise caution.
There's a control circuit there.
I can see it.
"If only we knew that Neelix made it back to the ship with the tellerium, then at least this would be worth it."
I regret I have no such reassurance to offer you.
We don't even know what happened to the Captain.
She might have been killed out there on the street.
That is possible.
It is also possible that she has safely returned to Voyager.
We have insufficient evidence to dismiss either conclusion.
I guess thas the Vulcan way of telling me to hope for the best.
Look who's awake.
Just rest.
You must be thirsty.
Maybe hungry?
For a little something?
"Oh, what shall I make?"
"What, what can I make?"
"What, what?"
Oh...
Where am I?
"Oh, it hasn't been that long."
I wish I had some...
There.
This will do.
T
- To drink.
Right.
What were you doing there in the first place?
"She had called the office looking for me, so I was just following up."
I see.
So you didn't actually speak with her?
No.
No.
Bad timing.
I assume she had something to tell me about the trial or her testimony.
- So it's not a total loss.
"Not to be insensitive, but it is lucky you found her body when you did."
"I'm looking into the possibility of a mistrial or better yet, if the police find anything suspicious,"
I'll argue for the charges to be dropped altogether.
"So good work, Danny."
That's not why I brought you in here.
Rodriguez bank robbery case?
- It's yours.
I thought Burke was handling it.
- He was.
Now you are.
- Burke was first chair.
"Danny, you've earned it."
Plain and simple.
Now get out of my office before I change my mind.
"Yes, sir."
Thank you.
I will not let you down.
I bet you won't.
"But that is a big case, so you better get to work."
I'll have Burke bring the case files to your office.
"Thank you, sir."
"Danny, that's wonderful."
-Excellent.
"A theorist named Zena sent us an old French map that has a bunch of locations that correspond to the island,"
-that are known.
-Okay.
And one of them that's unknown is a hatch.
"Themapis avery rudimentary sketch, if you will, of the island."
"You know, I mean, are we hoping that it's a trap door?"
- Absolutely.
But perhaps you have an explanation of it.
"And, really, the only way to do it is to set eyes on it, so..."
Yeah.
Why don't...
why don't we take a look.
Couldtheso-calledhatch reallybeevidence of an underground tunnel onOakIsland?
Perhapsonethatleads directly to the Money Pit?
"It'dbeincredibly intriguing if he says,"
"""Youguysreallyare  onto something here."
"""It's a possibility that it's a shaft, a tunnel, aman-madeopeningtothearea below Oak Island."""
"Idon'tknowwhathe's gonna say, but perhaps he can give us some insight."
Just a hole in the ground.
It's odd.
"Has it collapsed in, did you say?"
- Some.
- Here's the thing.
"This is all flat, then sometime later,"
-all this earth goes somewhere.
-Yeah.
That's what puzzles us.
It's just not a natural phenomena.
-Yeah.
-I don't believe it.
-Definitely.
"- No, no."
- There are consequences for disobedience!
- Tonight's the night.
"Together, my Mary we shall put on the performance of a lifetime."
Let the trial begin.
"Mary Bradbury, you stand accused of crimes most heinous."
"Witchcraft, devilry, sins against the Lord."
"Admit what you have done and repent, or you will be sentenced to murder by hanging."
- I didn't do anything.
I didn't hurt anyone.
- Yours is not the only soul on trial this day.
"You must also decide the fate of Susanna Sheldon, the young lady you brought down with your unholy ways."
- Mary... please save me.
- I didn't make her do anything.
- You lie.
"Susanna, tell the judges the truth."
- Mary Bradbury kidnapped me and forced me to commit sins against the Lord.
But...
"- What is it, Susanna?"
- Truthfully I enjoyed it.
- Do you see what your lies have wrought?
They've turned the purity of an innocent girl into the devil's plaything.
- I didn't.
I...
- You lie!
Confess!
"- No, you are a liar, Dr. Cairn."
You lied to me.
You took my faith away from me.
You are a monster.
"- As chief magistrate, I demand you go back to your position."
You're still under trial.
Lori and Josh shouldn't be punished.
They were just helping.
Exactly.
What if Foss-
"If anyone important calls, I'll have it with me."
Do I get one last call?
No.
But you do get to go to your rooms.
Now.
Grounding Kyle.
Who would have expected it?
And he was the ringleader.
When did that start happening?
Be honest.
"You're kinda glad they did it, aren't you?"
Well?
Aren't you?
Some rules are meant to be broken.
About that.
"I think we should break some rules, too."
"Stephen, I don't want us to sail into a complacent, suburban existence without fighting the good fight."
I want you to pursue that opport U.W.
"Nicole, that's not an option."
"Well, then we need to make it one."
You can't get the chance to pursue an old dream and just pass on it.
We have mouths to feed.
We'll keep them fed.
We'll make it work.
We always do.
Spring cleaning isn't just about sorting through things and getting rid of clutter.
It's about taking stock of who you are and how others see you.
"It's a chance to redefine yourself, to change expectations."
Sort of.
"Because as your lawyer, I wouldn't..."
"You know what, it's your life."
You do what you want.
What?
It's the Veriscene case.
The judgment's in.
We find out tomorrow.
That's good.
I don't know.
I've got a bad feeling about this one.
How's everyone this morning?
"Well, Your Honor."
We seem to have a designated hitter here today.
"Yes, Your Honor."
"My partner, Will Gardner, couldn't be in court..."
"Oh, you don't have to cover for him."
I know Will's suspended.
- How's he doing?
"- Very well, thank you for asking."
Like a kid with five days until Christmas.
"Well, tell him he's missed."
Shall we get started?
"Plaintiff alleges that Veriscene, a drug administered for the cure of acne, caused Mr. Goode irreversible sterility."
"Accordingly, I am entering judgment for the plaintiff, in the amount of $25 million in compensatory."
"I acknowledge that this amount is in excess of the $18 million requested by the plaintiff, but I find the actions here particularly heinous."
- Your Honor...
"- Yes, Mr. Canning?"
You want to appeal?
"- Oh, I do."
Uh vehemently.
- As is your right.
Is the article ready?
I want to take off for 10 days.
Leave for 10 days?
You people are hopeless!
If you think of going to the police...
You are inviting trouble for yourself!
I'm hungry.
Please help me.
Sorry.
Don't run!
Catch him!
Stop there.
"Yesterday night, on the Kanyakumari- Nagercoil highway... a man was found dead after being hit by an unidentified vehicle."
His age is presumed to be about 50.
As we had asked Inspector Arivazhagan of Kanyakumari...
A man who was walking on the highway was hit by a vehicle and died on the spot.
The man had no identity card or phone on him.
So we were unable to get his details.
Investigation is going on now.
Those who know any detail about him can approach the Kanyakumari police station.
I'm going to Kanyakumari for an urgent work.
I'll call once I'm done with it.
Inform dad.
Stop!
Why are you going?
A man was found dead in the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway.
"Either we run away from the city,"
Or the whole family...
Why are you so worried after coming to Kanyakumari?
Any problem?
You said wanted to visit police station as well?
Nothing.
Wise guy!
"- Hey, wait!"
- You talkin' to me?
Hold on a minute.
What's your big hurry?
- What do you want?
- Nuthin'.
Just got a question.
"Now, then... where are you going?"
To work.
Work's hard to find these days.
I know some work for a guy with your muscles.
I don't use muscle anymore.
I use... my kisser!
"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen."
Come closer.
Why do rich men on the west side wear ties but workers don't?
"Step right up, folks."
"You too, young lady with your husband, and you minors too."
Why don't workers wear ties?
Because they can't tie 'em!
"So he buys a tie holder but it's poor quality, and he can't tie his tie!"
That's cheating the customer!
That's a swindle!
That makes people resentful and pushes Germany even deeper into misery than it already is!
"Come closer, folks."
You storm troopers are kindly invited to join the festivities too.
Step in closer so I can save my voice.
I didn't insure it.
I couldn't make the first payment.
Buy my handy little ready-made gadget here.
You'll save time and money.
If I'm going to be somebody's plaything why not work at a dancing house and earn a bit more money to send home
"Congratulations, sir"
You have the look of a rich man
You'll be rich in 2 years' time lf this doesn't come true you can come and challenge me
"Miss, your id please"
"Duke, do you have an id card?"
Give me back my id card
Thank you
"Miss, please come over"
"My dear, where have you been?"
Go back to your sleep
"Go, it's late"
"Duke, show me your id card"
My wife
"Honey, wait for me, don't go so fast idiot"
I must thank you for what you just did
You've saved me once
You have no id card?
Did you swim here?
Jumped the train?
I swam here
How long have you been here?
Not too long
What's your plan?
What plan can I have?
Staying with your relatives?
Washing clothes?
Yes
Did you come from the mainland?
Have you got any relatives here in Hong Kong?
Virtually none
Please don't mind my saying lt's not a good idea to stay with that gang
Stay here!
I'll be right back.
Are you not feeling well?
- I'm just waiting for someone.
Thanks a lot.
- Excuse me please...
Did you get her rid of her so soon?
Who am I supposed to have gotten rid of?
I've been sleeping here!
This caring is touching!
Did you not see Hassenreuter's costumes down below?
"I figured that I'd stay guard here, so that nothing is stolen."
And then you open up a chest without any authorization and take its contents out?
Should I sleep on the mattress?
"No, Bruno, that you shouldn't do!"
You need a soft pillow for your conscience to let you sleep.
Do you also sleep in your nightdress?
You piece of crap!
"If it weren't for your sister,"
I'd break every bone in your body!
You're not worthy of her blind adoration...
Here!
You can return the rags of those dames with whom you've been sinning!
"If you would at least admit to it, but no..."
You're a coward and you lie...
Lie...
"Whoever lies, steals and whoever steals..."
"No, I'll mess up the baptism..."
You hang yourself alone.
Old fool!
Now then...
Father of the child?
But it's not like I enjoy it!
My guess is that his bitching is just for show
Don't say that.
I'm pretty scared
"Oh, you're scared?"
Yeah...
It's like I feel this overwhelming power
"Yeah, that makes sense"
So then the two of you are normal
"Yes, other than the fact that I want a penis I think I'm super normal"
What does that mean?
I just wanna be a top
With Lin bottoming?
I used to want that but not too much recently
He was really cute back in middle school
You two have been together for so long
We aren't dating
That's not what...
I'm not interested in dating right now
"I don't mean Lin only, but men in general"
I'm just not interested
What I am interested in now is puttin Lin's hard penis inside Bebi's anal
So kinky
That's so kinky
Stop it Big Sis
Lin is gonna fuck me?
It's Ok.
"Come on Sis, don't!"
"Sorry, I need to go to the bathroom"
He's coming on to you
"Big Sis, you're getting too excited"
"Yep, my sparkly index is at 200%"
Let's get out of here.
We're gonna draw a crowd.
Just don't lie there.
Get 'em!
Wait.
Higgins.
Wait.
Easy.
Better?
A little trick I learned in Shanghai just after the war... from a sturdy little Oriental chap who demonstrated using dogs.
"Actually, it's still pretty bad."
I think I may be out of action for several days.
- No swimming with this.
- Perhaps a little acupuncture.
Let me just get my needles and we'll try some simple muscle testing.
"On the other hand, activity could be good for circulation."
Let's go back to the guesthouse.
"I'll give you hot packs, alternating with cold packs."
No.
Not so fast.
Aren't you forgetting something?
- You mean?
"- Yes, as a matter of fact."
The Hardy Boys out there.
Especially the one with Roger's teeth.
I was just gonna tell you about that.
You were just so busy with beauty and pain that it slipped your mind.
Roger doesn't have any gold teeth.
"Well, these two guys came to see me in Bayonne about six weeks ago."
Looking for Roger.
What story did they give you?
Even at the exercise salon it sounded phony.
"He'd enlisted October 11,1943."
Whatever jam he'd got in must have been just before that.
It might have made the papers.
"There it was, Father."
All over page one.
Only five weeks before Johnny enlisted under the name of Drake.
The rest was what you'd expect.
Nationwide search.
A murder indictment.
Search for Johnny goes limp.
Story dribbling off until it fell out of the paper.
The newspaper gave me answers but there were three things I had to find out.:
How could Johnny be a murderer?
Why come back here where he was hotter than the weather?
And why?
Why not another word from him since that first call?
"Listen, honey."
Haven't you got any radio news programs in this city?
All I get is commercials and a lot of that apple pan dowdy.
Not until 12:00?
"Well, thank you kindly, ma'am."
I thought I'd turned the juice off.
But I'd flipped it to the police call band.
Car 42 reporting in.
Car 42 reporting in.
Broken railing on Tarpon Springs Turnpike was due to auto smash.
A burned sedan.
"Body, charred beyond identification."
Been there two days.
Send morgue wagon.
- Car 42 reporting.
Got it?
"We need a distraction, so you can set the prisoners free."
"The mutineers are all on edge, because they think there are demons on this island."
My good friends here will help supply them.
What about your spirits and laying bones to rest?
"They are happy, crusoe."
I have discussed it with them.
Even spirits need a change of scenery now and again.
But I promised to return them once it is done.
Those mutineers are tough.
They'll not buy this.
The tough ones always fear the most.
Think back when you first came here.
"Alone on the island, when the sun went down."
"No hope, no help."
And no name for the things you feared the most.
Come out!
You are without a doubt the most surprising human being I have ever known.
We can take care of things from here.
"I think we will be quite all right, thank you."
Our orders are to watch you at all times.
"But not while we wash, surely."
Nolan!
Look.
What?
Back to camp.
Now!
Move!
And that is just the beginning.
Come on.
We've got work to do.
Do you understand these people?
Neither do I.
"Your Honor, it would take two years to go through all the discovery they dumped on us,"
"Plus, I'm dealing with this police matter right now."
It is not my concern.
My concern is this case.
You're not getting two years to try this case.
"I'm not asking for that, Your Honor."
"Listen, this case either moves forward, or it stops."
"It's time to either put up or shut up, counsel."
What's it going to be?
"Did you hear me, sir?"
"Yes, sir, I heard you."
Put up or shut up.
The plaintiff chooses put up.
- I beg your pardon?
- [click]
We call ready for trial.
[whisper] What are you doing?
[whispering]
"We're not ready for trial, Your Honor."
Why not?
You've got about a million lawyers working on this.
- [scoff]
- I call ready for trial.
"This is a dangerous game you're playing, Mr. McBride."
You haven't gone through the discoveries.
You haven't deposed their witnesses.
"Well, I have a pretty good idea what they're gonna all say."
Judge:
Do I understand this correctly?
"You're ready to proceed to trial now, today."
"Yes, sir, that's correct."
- Miss Senate?
Our artists have been up all night making their costumes.
It's terribly exciting!
You're not acting in this piece?
I have no stomach for farce.
I am here to cue you.
"When I signal you like so, you must play something which suggests rain."
I expect this will be very amusing.
Yes.
Alfred and George have really outdone themselves this time.
"Do you know, I think they are still in love with each other."
(KNOCKING)
- Clap.
- Good evening.
I am God.
"I have grown disappointed in my master creation, the human race."
I endowed them with everything.
"The riches of the land, sea and air."
And enough intelligence to worship me.
But they have become arrogant and pampered.
I shall destroy them.
All except for one man and his family.
DUCHESS:
Ah!
This is my servant Noah and his wife Noette and their children.
Into their hands do I place the future of mankind.
"Oh, this heat!"
Will it never rain?
Here sits my stupid lout of a husband.
I don't know what God sees in him.
"Ah, who can express the despair of youth married to age?"
My husband is 600 years old while I am but 150!
A dove!
"Eric, we need an address on Julio Pena, and I need you to meet me there right now."
Thank you.
All clear.
All clear.
- H...
- Yeah.
You've got an X-ray machine.
This is a source of the radiation.
"Hazmat didn't register any, so where'd it go ?"
This cable's the pig tail.
Houses an iridium capsule at one end.
Iridium's the source of the radiation.
Capsule's been removed.
This is bigger than we thought Eric.
Why was Julio involved in this ?
Because someone was using him to finance the operation.
So Julio was caught in between the two worlds.
Whoever did this needed to get to him before we did.
Got a serial number.
We need to trace that number.
"Mr. Thomason, last year you purchased ten X-ray machines."
For welding seams.
I'm planning to start a construction company.
Then explain to me how one of them ended up in Julio Pena's workshop.
Don't know who that is.
Mr. Pena sells drugs in order to purchase the machines.
"Once in his possession, he dissembled them."
Dissembled them ?
- Why would anyone do that ?
- Excuse me.
Excuse me... !
This conversation is over.
- And she is?
- Dr Goodyear's partner.
- Research partner?
"- Good Lord, no, she's not got the brains for that."
Her lesbian life partner.
It turns out Janet Cramer's got the bulk of the research squirreled away somewhere and won't give it back.
"Says it's hers, not ours."
"I really can't be dealing with these people, you know."
"What, lesbians?"
Librarians.
Oh.
"Awful, small-minded, orderly, finicketty little nobodies, stuck away in their dusty, desiccated bloody towers."
That research has to be returned to its rightful place.
It's for the good of the college.
Scientists have been waiting two decades for it to be published.
I've tried to reason with her but she won't listen to me.
Thinks I'm some antiquated ogre.
But she might listen to you.
I see...
"Tell me, when exactly does your nomination for Master come up?"
Peter!
SCOTT:
"Being a lawyer's easy, there's nothing to do."
You and I need to have a little chat.
Someone to see you.
- Good morning.
- It's my cats.
They need to be looked after when I'm gone.
- Right.
Come through.
(Phone rings)
"Don't worry, boss, I'll hold your calls."
Her life and half of humanity.
If the Nazis find that door they will come to the present.
and obtain weapons and modern technology.
Do you know what that would mean?
They will win the second World War.
and they will eliminate anyone who doesn't conform to their ideas.
You don't have to tell me.
"I have experience in that area, I assure you."
What are you going to do with me?
We'll figure it out.
Now leave.
May I take the photo?
(ANGUSTIAS) May I come in?
-Like you need permission.
Do we know what will happen to him if he returns to his time?
No.
I'm trying to locate Espínola.
I call him and it cuts off or goes straight to the machine.
-Espínola?
Things must be bad...
Sorry about the wait.
We weren't expecting you so soon.
Typical.
The guy who brought us must have a date later.
He's crazy.
"We call him ""Offroader""."
"So, how's 2015?"
Good...
"I hope it's better than now, when there's nothing to eat."
"We're headed that way, don't doubt it."
And then they say that humanity is evolving.
Evolving my ass. (SCRAPING)
- (farmers):
Ready!
I say we shoot whatever it is and ask the questions after!
- (farmers cheering)
- You pull a stunt like that and it'd be murder.
"I'll personally see to it that you all bloody hang for it, no matter who pulls the trigger."
She killed a man and won't get away with it as long as I'm standing.
"Night will fall soon, that's when she's likely to move."
Ready the torches!
"You'll not be readying anything until I say so, got it?"
Right then.
Each of you will pair up with a constable.
"Crabtree, you talk to that farmer."
"You, stick with me!"
♪♪♪ (indistinct chatter)
- Keep your eyes open!
- Yes.
Do you see that trail?
"Ah, George, there you are!"
- Sir.
- I need you to come with me.
"The girl, Fen, she's likely to flee from the light of the torches."
"But then, sir, how will we see?"
- With these.
- Good gracious!
"Now, George, if you were trying to get away, which direction would you be likely to go in?"
"- Sir, I would follow the river."
- Exactly.
(door closing)
So you have something?
Not yet.
I need more information on Roland.
No..
Who is he?
Tell me
Who is he?
Will you torture her when asked to act like her husband as she got a doubt?
She is my wife and my everything.
Will you put your hands on her?
I will shoot you
Stop it.
"Vasu, that is.."
She is..
- No need!
You have cheated me for all these years.
Do not try any further.
Tomorrow is Rahul's marriage.
"Once that is over, you just not need to resign for all your designations in the company, but also withdraw your Legislative Council nomination."
"Else, I will have to open up."
Mind it!
Thanks bro!
Nothing more and nothing less.
All have smashed it up.
"Subramanyam sir, you were awesome."
Medal is guaranteed for you.
Thank you..
Hello..
He is unconscious as he was tortured for many days.
What is the condition sir?
Doctor said he will be alright within 2 - 3 days.
We had known about Marthand from the person who hacked IB server and arrested him.
Your under arrest..
Marthand changing as the approver has said it all in detail about the Grand Palace Killings.

STEVE:
You got anything?
Nothing.
Keep looking.
There's got to be something here that's gonna tell us who hired this guy.
Guys?
I think I got something.
What?
"Okay, so it looks like"
Kroll was hired over the Tor Network.
What is that?
It's kind of like a shadow Internet.
"Some people call it ""the Dark-net."""
"It was originally created by the Navy, but nowadays it's utilized mostly by criminals because it allows them to be completely anonymous."
So tracing an I.P.?
"Is not gonna happen, but... here comes the good news."
"According to these e-mails,"
Kroll wouldn't take the Cutler job unless the client revealed himself.
And did they?
Not at first.
But they came around.
Here-- looks like they sent their last message outside of the network.
And that I.P. we can trace.
ABBY:
But I liked John.
Why would I kill him?
"Well, maybe you liked him more than you let on."
"You wanted John to take you away from your secret little escort life, but he had no intentions of ending his marriage."
"A woman scorned, Abby."
It's the oldest motive there is.
CATHERINE:
These e-mails?
They're supposed to surrender?
How can they waste their time on such nonsense?
- Carrasco will never surrender.
- I read it.
Why did you lie?
Because I'm convinced that it isn't true.
I'm not sure if I should believe it or not.
I no longer know what he's capable of.
- What makes you think he didn't do it?
"- It's too terrible, too incomprehensible."
I don't believe that he is a man who would cause such a catastrophe by mistake.
- Are you implying that?
- Yes.
Silveira.
Not even a bastard like Silveira is capable of something like this.
Why would they make Carrasco a martyr by killing him?
"No, Mariá."
This is just what they needed.
A stab right into the people's heart.
Very good.
"In a few days, you won't feel any more pain."
It barely hurts now.
Thanks.
- A total triumph.
- You didn't manage to arrest him.
How can you call it a triumph?
It makes me sick to look at this burnt plane.
- It could have been me.
- So you know you've been lucky this time.
- One more impertinence...
- You've been lucky.
Who knows how many more times you will be?
Stealing glances at these papers?
"Yeah, that made me suspicious."
Can't we just forget all this?
"You're walking out that door, and you're never seeing her again."
Who sent you?
I can't tell you that.
Jack Stillman.
The Fixer.
"The I.R.S. says he made $16 million last year working for media companies, politicians--"
And the occasional crime figure.
I understand that I'm a person of interest to you.
Who told you that?
"I know everything that happens in this city, Special Agent."
"You interfere with this investigation again, whether it be paying people to lie or encouraging them to withhold evidence,"
"I'll bring you down, Stillman."
"Well, you're welcome to try."
But I should warn you that better people than you have failed.

"Oh, see, now, this is good art."
It tells a story.
Good art has to tell a story?
"Can't it inspire a feeling, set a mood?"
It's funny.
When Dana and I went to the museum last weekend--
"Man, that's the fourth Dana reference today."
[laughing] That's not--
That's not true.
Really?
Four?
Four.
And that already includes two about the museum.
We have been fighting side by side forthree years.
Should I feel pityfor some criminal scum?
"-To make a long story short, do you have such people?"
- Surely.
-How many?
- 11 people.
Eleven.
I take all ofthem.
"- No, there is no wayto take all 11."
"- Captain, I hate repeating my requests."
"Sergei Pavlovich, you do not have the slightest idea who they are."
"Two deserters, three military criminals... who started a drunk fight and gave a beating to the duty officer."
There is one rapist and a maraudeer.
These two have capital punishment sentences.
So go and tell them that their Motherland gives them their last chance... to wash their shane offwith their blood.
That's all.
Filfil this order.
-May I ask you a question?
- Come on.
is lieutenant Malyutin guilty of anything?
Why should he be?
Otherwise you wouldn't be sending him out on such a mission.
I do not have any information on that man.
It is very good that you do not.
And do you have any information on me?
Answer quickly!
"You have gone huts, accountant..."
Get outa here!
You'll rememberthis day!
"That's how it is, brother."
-Do you understand the assignment?
"-Yes, sir."
And they collectively almost so restful.
"After some days Tót family it was learned, that it is possible to doze off at the chandler while he measures the soda out."
During watering in Cipriáni family's shady-cool garden.
While the boiling soup does not get cold.
While the coffee does not boil over.
Or during review in the fire engine house
If the engineer of the aggregator does not wake up the man.
- Lajos.
Lajos.
Lajos!
- What is it?
Is there fire?
- No.
- What do you want?
"Arrange it Lajos, how I shall be allowed to speak the with major lord."
"You know, from my younger brother's thing."
Who because of anti-state rummaging in front of a military court claim?
They accused it of it.
Respectable major lord.
- Where did he serve?
-At car artillerymen.
- 629/12 please.
- His rating?
Corporal.
"You know him, Tót?"
I know him.
Good Hungarian man?
Good Hungarian man.
Why he bring out and why fluttered at the time of a command annunciation the red flag?
Because...he was have a cold.
I report...he was have a cold.
"He wanted to take out his handkerchief, they accused it of it subsequently."
"Who alibied out, by the way..."
The last two knives went missing.
"Well, Lanie discovered there are two different murderers operating on either coast using identical weapons."
All we have to do...
"Oh, whoa, whoa."
"No, no, no."
"T-there is no ""we."" You two are done."
"And if I catch either of you working this case,"
I'll have you both arrested for obstruction.
"No, no, no, no."
Mm.
"Hey, maybe a little single malt scotch will smooth things over?"
Go home.
Excuse me.
"T-this just came for you, Mr. Castle."
Oh.
Um... thanks.
Looks like Menendez isn't the only one unhappy about last night.
Mason wants to see Kendall and me right away.
Good luck.
What's that?
This is payback.
Thanks for coming in.
Where is everyone else?
Their enthusiasm for both of you waned after the way you conducted yourselves last night.
"It was messy, boarish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member."
- It was her fault.
- It was his fault.
"No, it was my fault, thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip's shoes."
"Mr. Wood, please."
Give me another chance.
"No, give me another chance."
I'll be right back.
John.
It's disarmed.
Thank God you're all right.
Where's the president?
"He didn't make it, sir."
I need to address the nation.
"General, get on with the Joint Chiefs."
We need to move our troops into the Middle East to stabilize the region.
You wanna move troops in?
When they find out that we almost launched a nuclear attack..
there's gonna be chaos.
We have to contain it.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
Yeah.
When did you and Walker cook this whole thing up?
Excuse me?
How'd it go?
You gave Walker the launch codes and he made you president?
You can prove this?
"Well, Walker had to get the launch codes from somewhere.."
and you were the only person with those codes.
And I found this pager in Walker's pocket.
I only know one other person that uses one of these.
That doesn't prove anything.
Two old guys use old technology.
So what?
"Why don't you call the return number on that, Carol?"
Would have been better if the evidence had been destroyed..
in the air strike that you ordered.
"You're a goddamn traitor, sir."
I trusted you with mary's life.
"Not just her survival,"
"Though I hear you threatened that, too."
"I gave up every moment of being a mother to my own child,"
Based on your word
That you would raise her to be francis's wife.
"What did you think, when you traded a child"
For the protection of France?
That we would put her welfare above ours?
Lord knows you didn't.
You gave her away to secure your rule.
"I had an infant,"
"A girl, not even a week old when my husband died,"
And she was crowned queen.
I met unexpected horrors and tragedy
And I faced them with courage.
You...
One charlatan scared you by whispering in your ear
About your son's death...
A future no one could know...
And you changed the course of nations.
Nostradamus's accuracy is an inarguable feat.
Here's a feat:
"Women like you and me, surviving in this age."
"I have sold my soul, and my child,"
To protect myself and my nation.
Mary may be scotland's queen
But I am its king.
Has scotland noticed that its king
Has rather overexposed breasts?
It is beginning to.
Ah.
"Well, I guess I destroyed the mosque before we even built it."
Most of the people here probably won't even remember this.
"You know, that's... sad that that's as reassuring as it is."
"Amaar, sorry, I'm late."
What did I miss?
"You're so pretty, Rayyan."
{ Advertisement }
Can't let this get you down.
- How would you suggest I...
- Motivate it?
"Look, if we don't raise the money, we are not getting the mosque."
"And if last night is any indication, we are not raising the money."
- Do you need a bottle?
- A bottle?
"Yeah, 'cause you're acting like a baby."
"So, last night tanked, suck it up!"
You wanted a sign?
You were given one that told you to build a mosque!
You might have to do some of the heavy lifting yourself.
"- I'm sorry, was that too harsh?"
- No.
You're right.
You're absolutely right!
I can do this.
Positive attitude makes all the difference.
What if the chicken wasn't a sign?
What if I missed the real sign while I was hanging out...
- With a chicken?
- You want another sign?
Really?
That's kind of creepy.
[ amused exclamation ]
How much longer?
"30 minutes, 45 tops."
I have the money.
"All right, but if you're not at the 7th street train station in 45 minutes, I'm contacting bin-khalid's men."
"No, Ben, listen..."
What's that?
"The subroutine search we were running, using Mullins' override to find the leak."
There's a hit on whoever accessed
The army rangers' identities.
They used the CTU director's code.
Keith?
Yours.
How is that possible?
Can you see where the file was accessed from?
Yeah.
A computer in your husband's campaign headquarters.
"Uh, the IP address is scrambled, but let me see if I can..."
Got it.
"The computer the rangers' identities were accessed from belongs to Mizrani, first name Nilaa."
My husband's campaign manager.
We were pulled offline.
I can't get back on the server.
They know.
They cut our out-feed.
I'm not looping the evidence room feed anymore.
"Carter, we're shut down."
You need to get out of there now.
"Keith, we're running an operation."
If you shut us...
You're not running anything.
Nothing happens till I confirm what the hell is going on.
- Lock them in interrogation now.
Away!
Away with that audacious lady!
"Antigonus, I charged thee that she should not come about me."
Canst not rule her?
"Good my liege, I me from your good queen."
- Good queen!
"- The good queen, for she is good"
Hath brought you forth a daughter.
- Here 'tis.
- A mankind witch.
"Hen with her out o' door, give her the bastard, thou dotardl"
"Take't up, I say, give't to thy crone."
"He dreads his wife, this brat is none of mine."
"It is yours and so like you, 'tis the worse."
I'll ha' thee burnt!
I care not!
"Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this."
My child?
Away with ill
"Go, take it to the fire."
Beseech your highness
On our knees we beg that you do change this purpose
"Which being so horrible, so bloody, must lead on to some foul issue."
Be it.
Let it live.
What will you adventure to save this brat's life?
- Anything. my lord.
- Mark you perform it.
We enjoin thee that thou carry
This female bastard hen and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions and that there thou leave it to its own protection.
Amy Solwey.
- John.
- Thought you were still in prison.
- I got out three months ago.
- How?
Compassionate release.
"I had the transplant, but rejected the kidney."
Guess the state didn't want to pay my hospital bill.
- How did you find me?
- NTCC list says you're next in line.
"- For once, the sicker I am, the better."
- How sick?
End stage renal failure.
"And now, heart damage."
So any day now.
As soon as some perfectly healthy person with my blood type is murdered or has a terrible accident.
Kind of hard to pray for.
Waiting's got to be rough.
Better than the alternative.
You ever think of going on the black mart?
You gonna bust me if I say yes?
People say it's wrong to sell a kidney.
"But then, how come they pay everyone else?"
The transplant team.
The NTCC.
The hospitals.
The people who make the rules aren't dying.
Why did you come here?
"Because you have type-A blood, and we find a guy who died after selling his kidney on the black market."
Also type-A.
I don't need his kidney.
I'm at the top of the transplant list.
- Are you trying to shut down my performance?
"- You may have your event, if after the performance, you give up the girl."
- That's ridiculous.
- You've grown too attached.
The society has decided that they will do with Isabel as they see fit.
It's time for her to be placed.
- I refuse.
- I thought all these characters...
I thought it was part of my therapy.
"But then I started having all these dreams, and some of them turned out to be real, like..."
like... like hurting you and and Roderick.
I don't know what happened to Roderick.
He did this to me.
They need to be punished.
But how?
- Gunther.
"- You should go back to your room, Mary."
- You fill the goblets for the society rituals?
"Please, help us, Gunther."
- Thank you.
"- There's something you should know, ma'am, about one of the men who's judging you tonight."
"Look for the one that says ""wolf's bane."""
- This?
- Yes.
"- Hide, hide, hide."
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.
End this.
- Why are you in here?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Is the disgusting... repulsive little urchin sampling my wares?

Look at the size of the diamond he's holding.
This same old scene takes place in every story.
One dude makes a last minute entry and the engagement goes for a six...
You and your intense look.
Don't worry.
This won't happen to you.
Do you know why?
"Because women don't fall for the man, but the mansion."
Right?
You ditcher...
I left for a week and you left me.
Only if you had been a little more crazy... you would never have left me.
You remember what I had told you?
"You can give her a ring, but I'll be the one taking her home."
Remember that.
Stay for dinner.
I was only playing with destiny.
"Anyway, he will die as destined."
Go find him.
What's the angle?
Why have you come here?
"Hey, sharing is a virtue"
This is a world of efficiency
"Only those fast enough can live, stupid!"
Y es!
"Come, take some soup!"
Your leftover!
We've tasted every bone!
Now you can have the most original taste!
"Brother Jin, you must be hungry"
T ake this first
I don't feel like eating
"I'm sorry, I did want to bring you some food"
"But all those nasty brothers, they were so fast in clearing up all dishes, leaving you only this"
This one is untouched!
I really don't feel like eating
You're deeply hurt and haven't eaten for days
Your stomach will hurt.
"Come, for my sake"
"T ake this bowl of rice, come!"
I'll get you some tea
Your brothers fight for food?
They say this is a world of efficiency
Only those fast enough can live!
You must be the slow one!
"I'm the junior, they always bully me"
"Every meal I only have rice with soup, no food"
It's better than what I have now!
So original!
"Y es, that's called the original taste"
Rice has it's own taste!
Isn't it?
My Master said... your Kung Fu technique is stunning

I wish I could get out of my brain and... experience a real...

That's what Tequila's for.
You really feel that way?
I do.
I would love to feel God's presence.
"Ah, so you admit the possibility that God exists."
"Well, it can't be proved, but it can't be disproved, either."
"So, therefore, I..."
I think God may exist.
"This is the last of the cinnamon, by the way."
I'll pick you up some tomorrow.
Thank you.
"See, this... this may be proof that God exists."
Must have cinnamon with with Will's special hot chocolate.
"Not work, I hope."
"No, it's Esme."
I gave her a jacket today to impress a boy.
"""Jacket worked."
We hung out after school.
"Miles is awesome."""
I'd forgotten how macabre this office is.
"Well, under the circumstances, the decor seems appropriate."
"Well, you know, I'm just one of those guys."
I'm not...
I am simply not afraid of death.
I don't know why.
"I see it as either a beautiful release or a start of a great, unknown adventure."
That's easy for you to say.
Excellent.
"You look relieved, Father."
That was the toughest yet.
Thanks for the steer.
"Anything for a peaceful life, eh?"
Partners in crime.
Who'd have thought it?
"You know what, when those two get together, they really are a deadly combination."
Of course the real reason we won is because I knew exactly which blooms Father Brown favoured.
What rot!
"If I hadn't been to finishing school, the whole thing would have been an unmitigated disaster!"
"Excuse me, we're looking for the deli counter."
Certainly.
Turn left at Lighting and it's just past Ladies Wear.
"Nice one, ta."
We should leave.
People are giving us some pretty dirty looks.
"No, we fit right in, man!"
"Sure, we might not be cash rich, but it's obvious we're classy guys."
"Here we go, the taster counter."
"Get stuck in, it's free."
"Yep, really classy."
"If you load up, you can taste a full meal."
"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
"We're just browsing, thanks."
And eating.
I'm browsing with my mouth.
Just having a little taste - try before you buy.
And are you planning to buy that chicken leg?
"Probably not now, to be honest."
We're sorry about this.
Go.
"We could be spotted if we move together, so let's say our goodbyes here."
Be careful.
You must be out of the city before dawn.
Brothers...
Be careful.
This is it.
This is my last good turn as a friend.
I'm alone from now on.
I have no friends of any kind.
We will go our separate ways.
So don't resent me...
I will gladly accept any punishment if you withdraw your order to abolish the navy!
I will end my life here if you so desire!
You are continue your attempt to break me?
Must I take your life with my own hands before you submit?
Very well.
Consider your wish granted.
"No, Your Majesty!"
You cannot punish a subject by death for being forthright!
Do not interfere!
Please withdraw your sword!
Step aside!
Strike me instead!
This man has spent every waking moment of the day for a year protecting the southern front!
"If you forsake this faithful man, I, too, cannot observe your wishes!"
"Your Majesty, I beg you to strike me instead!"
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty!
Father nearly killed Yi Soon-shin and Minister Yu Sung-ryong?
"Yes, Your Highness."
"He was stripped, cleansed, glabrous and smooth."
Xerxes was reborn a god.
Artemisia trusted no one.
So in the cover of night the palace was cleansed of all Xerxes' allies.
All those he trusted
mall those who had raised him
mall those he had once looked to for counse were quickly introduced to her wrath.
And as the god-king stood before his people
Artemisia watched her ﬂawless manipulation take shape.
- For glory's sake

War is coming to Greece in the visage of a monster army over a million strong.
It should be little more than a formality for Themistokles the hero of Marathon to finish what he began.
Please!
We must appeal to Xerxes' reason!
Coward!
Athens is a city of cowards!

Shut your own!

It's Themistokles.
The Persian attack will come from both the north and the south.
The city-states should negotiate a truce.
"Yes, yes, we must negotiate."
- Walking through the woods to meet my love this day in Marymount.
- Good.
"And what do you see, Lady Edith?"
Focus.
You must see through her eyes.
- I see...
I see fawns and nymphs.
They're transformed into brutes.
They dance around the maypole where we shall be married.
They are the devils in ruined souls that people the black wilderness.
- Good.
"Now, Lady Edith, what is your family's relation to evil?"
- We are well acquainted with evil.
"These darks and monsters are my brethren, maddened by their troubles into a gay despair like evil spirits in the presence of a dread magician."
- Good.
Now you will awaken... as Lucy.
"Now tell me, Lucy, is the night's ritual a dream... or a reality?"
- I...
I don't...
- Ugh!
- A dream?
- Are you trying to fail?
Are you doing this on purpose?
Are you trying to spite me?
- The men and women have seemed very pleased with my performance.
- They've been pleased.
They've been pleased with your performance?
This isn't a performance.
I don't want you to act.
I want you to become!
"And if you can't do that, you're worthless to me."
This session's over.
"What do you want,ron?"
I want to keep you up-To-Date on the case as a courtesy.
We're gonna argue self-Defense.
So?
We're thinking of calling you as a character witness.
To say what?
"In a self-Defense case, character for peacefulness,"
"For non-Violence, is admissible."
Did you know that?
Since you two are friends--
"Whoa,whoa,whoa."
We're not friends.
I took her to some basketball games.
We never even-- Fought?
Is that what you were gonna say?
You didn't get into any fights.
Good.
"It won't help us that much, but it's admissible"
To prove she had a peaceful character.
"Though i have to say,"
Testifying won't be so pleasant for you.
"The tabloids are all over this case,"
And the d.A. Will cross you pretty hard.
"As for how your wife handles it,i can't say."
"You do have a prenup, right?"
Or?
Sorry?
"You're the lawyer,ron."
Great lawyers always give you an alternative.
"Look,if you've got a business trip coming up"
"Or plans with your wife,"
I don't want a trial to mess that up.
I asked Temu to bring me here
"Mouna, I asked Temu to teach him"
"Even so, you cannot trespass into our Mehebu hunting ground"
This used to be our Toda hunting ground when my uncle was alive
You Mehebu clansmen robbed it from us
Rob it back if you can
Enough!
"Mouna, can you do me this favor?"
Favor?
"Kojima... if you lived in Mehebu now,"
I'd do you this favor
But you live in Tnbarah Clan
Take these red-foot pheasants and get out of my hunting ground
I don't care if it's your hunting ground or theirs because everything here belongs to us Japanese now
"Temu, you just wait and see"
Some day I'll destroy your Tnbarah Clan
Go on and do it if you dare
Let's see who's killed first
I don't care if you're Mouna Rudo
"Wow, well done"
Can a girl carry such a heavy load?
Go!
Go!
Good girl!
"The men in your clan are all out hunting, aren't they?"
Wanna make some extra bucks?
- Come with me to my boardinghouse!
- No!
- I'll give you two dollars
- No!
What the hell?
Bastard!
House computer.
You require?
"You've allowed access to my private lift, to whom?"
A visitor.
Top priority.
What are you...
No sign of him?
"In the first days of the occupation, this was always our meeting point, but maybe he stopped coming."
Don't you have any other way of contacting him?
"I mean, you just turn up here at this time of day?"
It seems a bit haphazard.
We didn't have time to get organised.
"What, so you've no contact with other resistance units?"
None.
Maybe mine's the only column still fighting.
There's Leitz now.
These are friends.
"Dayna, Tarrant."
They're from Earth.
Enemies of the Federation.
- Have you any news of the other columns?
- Nothing good.
Two has been practically wiped out.
One and Three have suffered heavy casualties and pulled back into the White Mountains to regroup.
So mine is the only unit still functioning.
And you can expect to come under heavy attack in the next few days.
The General is getting impatient.
"Yes, well, we beat off their last attack."
Shot down two gunships.
I heard.
- How did you get into the city?
- I swam in under the reactors.
Got it?
Balloon jump?
"Look it up, Taffy."
What does it say?
"Oh, balloons."
The preliminary reports on the use of balloons for initial jumps are generally favourable.
"Due to the lack of the impact of the slipstream on the body, the tendency of the pupil to twist and somersault is almost eliminated."
That's nice.
The jumper has to fall a far longer distance before his parachute becomes fully opened.
This delayed opening produces an additional thrill.
You lucky people.
The phenomena known as a Roman Candle in which the parachute leaves the bag but fails to open in time...
"Lay off, will you?"
Canada?
Yeah?
"What's a ""Roman Candle""?"
A chute that doesn't open.
Did you ever see one?
"Yeah, I saw one."
What happened to the bloke?
"Got to sleep, will you?"
I'm bushed.
Miss?
"May I have another, please?"
What's wrong with this one?
"It's ex-tac, different from the others."
You're lucky.
It's what the pilots and instructors usually have.
"Change it, will you?"
"Hurry up, you."
"Well, the customer is always right."
"Though we do happen to pack about 50 parachutes a day, at least."
I understand.
Perhaps you could make your operative aware of our concerns.
Blackmire has a very sophisticated counter-surveillance program.
George Browne is an ex-CIA agent.
"If you have an operative in there, they will be exposed."
You don't have anything to be concerned about.
I don't have an operator in any kind of direct exposure.
Good to hear.
"If you could call me tomorrow, after you've spoken to your superiors,"
I'd appreciate it.
You can reach me any time.
Thank you.
I'll be giving you a call in the morning.
- Good night.
- A pleasure.
Likewise.
Call Julianna immediately and tell her she's not going on her trip with George Browne.
Anything I can do?
Call the FBI and start screaming.
They've been sharing our intel with the CIA.
It's Inspector Spalding.
I've had a visit from the CIA regarding our Blackmire operation requesting we drop it.
Please advise me what course to take.
She's not answering.
Is there wire on Julianna still up?
Is Julianna at her place?
She's just leaving with Browne.
- There they go.
- You got everything?
And that's it.
"All right, gentlemen."
Here's your financial statement.
I'm calling the police!
"Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!
I'm calling the police!
"Woman's voice belongs to our murder victim, leslie stoltz,"
"And we think the male voice belongs to coop daly,"
Enright's security.
"I'm still working a timbre comparison,"
But I'm fairly certain it's a lock.
"Well, it's compelling evidence."
Puts daly in the room.
"Unfortunately, you can't use it in a court of law."
Can we float it to potential jurors?
"The takeaway will be, cardoza's still a dirty cop."
"Wait a minute, what?"
"Murder case in l.A. , evidence didn't fit his theory,"
He made it disappear.
"Rebecca, accusations"
Were made- nothing was ever proven.
"Okay, but the cloud around it drove him here to miami,"
And so here we are again with cardoza's dirty evidence.
"My advice, horatio:"
Fire him.
Out of the question.
Suit yourself.
"But not only will I reject this evidence,"
I will reject all evidence
That cardoza has anything to do with.
He is compromising your lab.
"Well, then I have no choice but to clear his name."
"Like, for being too silly."
No!
Wayne.
We never hit our kids.
You shouldn't hit kids.
"Well, you know what, don't you remember how scared you were of your principal when you were growing up?"
It's 'cause he'd smack you if you were being too silly.
Like your parents wanted you to have a principal who would smack you.
They took comfort in the fact that they were sending you to a place every day where someone would smack you for them if you were being too silly.
"And sometimes I see kids these days, I kind of think, like..."
"Like, wish you could still do that."
"That sort of discipline is long outdated, Wayne, and frowned upon."
We sit the child down...
- That's another problem.
- What is?
- In my opinion.
- Sitting?
"Well, no wonder kids are failing' school, just sittin' around all day."
"Stand up, you're not doing nothin'."
You think sitting is a problem?
- Yeah.
- Why?
'Cause it makes you soft.
- Literally or figuratively?
"- Well, both, I suppose."
- Both?
- Yeah.
In my opinion.
My phone's buzzing.
"Well, so you like cookies and cream ice cream, hey?"
"Well, I think it's pretty good, too."
"Hi, Michelle."
"Beseech you, tenderly apply to her some remedies for life."
"The queen, the sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead."
- Oh!
- O thou tyrant
Belake thee to nothing but despair.
"Go on, go on, I have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest."
Prithee bring me to the bodies of my queen and son - one grave shall be for both.
Upon them shall the uses of their deaths appear unto our shame perpetual.
Good Antigonus
Sin fate hath made thy person for the thrower-out of my poor babe
Places remote enough are in Bohemia
There weep and leave it crying
"And, for the babe is counted lost forever"
"Perdita, I prithee call it."
"Blossom, speed ye well"
"There lie, and there thy character."
"Farewell, for the day frowns more and more"
Thou'rt like to have a lullaby too rough.
Oh!
Oh!
- Why...?
- I am gone for ever!
What have we here?
"Mercy on's, a barne"
I'll talus it up for pity
Yet I'll tarry till my son me.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I have seen two such sights by sea and land!
"Why, boy, how is it?"
Now bless thyself thou mettest with things dying
I with things newborn.
Talking snow.
I love new things.
You are not of this world.
Takes one to SNOW one!
"Right, let's see."
"Multi-nucleate, crystalline organism with the ability to mimic and mirror what it finds."
Looks like snow.
Isn't snow.
You must leave here now!
"Shut up, I'm making deductions, it's very exciting."
"Now, what are you, eh?"
A flock of space crystals?
A swarm?
"The snowmen are foot soldiers, mindless predators."
But you - you're the clever one.
You're Moriarty.
"So you turn up on a planet, you generate a telepathic field to learn what you can, and when you've learnt enough, what do you do?"
You can't conquer the world using snowmen.
Snowmen are rubbish in July.
You'll have to be better than that.
You'll have to evolve.
"Sir, it appears to be stuck!"
What have you done?
Have you locked the doors?
"You need to translate yourself into something more, well, human."
Kick it down!
To do that you'd need a perfect duplicate of human DNA in ice form - where do you find that?
Get in here!
Quickly!
"I've got a master key somewhere, sir."
Let's see.
Most opened file...
People are so used to them it would be difficult to scare them.
I bet silence would scare them more.
It'd leave them with their own noises.
Exactly.
Like what happened to me.
What about the play?
Good.
After this long time there's nothing much to do but asking questions.
And Clara?
Did you have any children?
One daughter.
We're separated.
But you were the perfect couple!
"Well, at least to me!"
You're exaggerating.
- It was a crazy love!
I'm telling you!
"Even once, the cops stopped you in the middle of the street!"
Because we were making out.
At that time kissing in the street at daylight...
You tell me.
It was only because we were young.
You still are.
Not long ago I read your article in a magazine.
I can't remember which one.
"You basically said the real protest emerges spontaneously, apart from the political parties."
It wasn't exactly like that.
Something like that.
"As you know, I don't care about politics at all."
I can't do nothing about it.
It must be because of my pessimism.
"But every time I think about those issues, I get useless conclusions."
"The response to the polio outbreak in India,"
"He moved on to Somalia,"
Where he served as a field coordinator in huddur.
"While there, he oversaw everything"
From shrapnel wounds to cancer to chronic illness.
Rufus.
"I'm surprised to see you here, of all places."
"Holland, if you'll excuse me."
I'll catch up with you later.
I need to talk to Lily.
"Rufus, what are you doing here?"
I'm sorry about today.
I don't want will to come between us.
I don't give a damn who lives where.
I just want to be with you.
...Improving access to primary health care
To remote villages.
He has done all of this
While continuing to build his reputation
As a leader in the progressive treatments of cancer.
"Lily looks amazing, doesn't she?"
"I mean, being sick hasn't slowed her down at all."
"Yeah, she is the picture of health."
...Invaluable member of our team.
"Ladies and gentlemen,"
Dr. William van Der Woodsen.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Dean."
Thank you.
"I had another speech prepared for you this evening,"
"But then my beautiful daughter Serena came to me,"
"And she was so honest and brave,"
Aka more aliases than they would care to mention.
They are small-time thieves who have inexplicably hit the big-time.
- I smell artifact.
- I smell a loser.
Come on.
"Let's let Artie get through this so we can just not be here any longer than necessary, all right?"
- Thank you very much.
Much appreciated.
- You're welcome.
- So what is this... this artifact?
- It's unconfirmed.
"But if there's one, it's given these two an unbelievable amount of luck."
That defies all the laws of probability.
"They've had winning streaks in Miami, Detroit and Atlantic City..."
Not one single gaming commission alarm bell has been tripped.
"Well, how?"
"Well, they go into a gaming room as high rollers."
Anybody?
"Okay, fine."
And they're really good.
"And they win just enough money to stay under the radar, right?"
And then they get...
Fine.
They move on and don't get caught.
So they're taking a little back from the house.
"OMG, what's the BFD?"
What?
Iniquitous hands with the means to exploit fate.
"- ""Iniquitous"" means ""bad."""
"- Thanks, Roget."
So where are they now?
"3 hours ago, they checked into room 1510 at the Maximus hotel in Las Vegas."
Indeed.
"The treasure remains, and amongst it is the compass."
Now it will guide us to your land.
"Cora has the means to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes, but she can't find your land without the compass."
"Once we get it, steal the ashes from her, and we're on our way."
How do we know you're not just using us to get the compass for Cora?
Because you four are far safer company.
All I need is a ride back.
I'll swear allegiance to whomever gets me there first.
Then we'd better start climbing.
Right.
So...
(Chuckles)
I failed to mention that the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders.
"All right, so how do we get up there?"
"I've got a counter spell from Cora, if you'd be so kind."
"Thank you, milady."
(Whooshing tinkle) I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
So... which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?
Hmm?
Go on.
Fight it out.
"Don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it."
"(Horns blare in distance, indistinct conversations)"
(Horn honks)
(Door squeaks)
(Clanks)
(Engine starts)
(Engine revving)
(Shifts gears)
Impressive.
But too tempting to pass up.
Argh!
I'll bet that smarts.
"But you know what they say - no pain, no gain."
"Bravo, Goliath."
You've earned a breather.
"Trouble is, nothing's what it seems at the Hotel Cabal."

This is a true warrior.
Breaking him may take a bit longer than usual.
"Uh, speaking of which, suppose I'd gone down the wrong chute?"

"Bad news, my boy."
A warm body is all it takes to activate the automated mechanisms in any one of these rooms.
"Without one of these to deactivate the rooms, anyone caught in there would be bouncing off the walls forever."
Mace!
Check out the screen.
Where's Goliath?
Not to worry.
He must be in one of the adjoining rooms.
- This... this makes no sense.
- (alarm sounds)
- Now what?
- It's the security alarm.
Impossible.
No one could navigate his way around the rooms like that.
Unless...
The key you dropped!
Somehow the gargoyle must have found it.
It's allowing him to pass unharmed from room to room.
"At this rate, he'll be out in minutes."
"Oh, man!"
Shall we get going?
- Give me a quick briefing.
- The nursery had 70100 employees.
"Now it's threatened with closure, and has debts of several million."
Thank you.
- Is anything wrong?
"- No, no."
- Lebech has withdrawn from Ussing.
- Has Ussing commented on that?
He's probably about to.
I don't comment on rumours.
Would you like to hear our job creation policies?
- It's a storm in a teacup.
"- Yes, but as I said..."
The organisers are asking us to answer a few extra questions.
What do you say?
As long as we talk job creation reform and government abusing the benefit law.
- You can borrow mine.
- Thank you.
I'll just run through it with my advisor.
It's a crude game you're playing.
"If you think you can sneak a win, with rumours from an unreliable witness, you must be really desperate."
- There's more than just a witness.
"- I'll explain myself, don't worry."
You prepare yourself for a libel suit.
- It's all right by us.
- Good.
Anders was called back to Christiansborg to help the police.
"- Unfortunately, it couldn't wait."
- What a shame.
No comment.
Now he wants them to solve an old case.
You will repent for all these.
"Sir, I am waiting for you."
Who are you?
- I'm Varun.

A guy was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway recently...
I want some details regarding that case.
Why do you want to know?
I'm working on a program about unsolved death cases caused by road accidents.
Did anyone come in search of this man?
"In some cases, people come searching immediately."
"At other times, they come a bit late."
But no one has come in search of this man so far.
What about his body?
We are done with postmortem and other formalities.
Won't you wait till someone comes to identify the person?
There is neither a mortuary big enough nor the Government funds large enough to do that.
"If no one comes in search of the dead person, we proceed with the formalities."
"If anyone comes after that, we will verify with a photo."
"If we have any of their belongings, we return them."
"But,uh, won't the police say--"
"Hey,the rat's the one destroying evidence,not me."
We're not sure that it is evidence.
It may not be the knife she used.
"If it is the knife, we are going with self-Defense."
So we are not going to deny that she killed him with it.
"Of course,the cops could still charge us with evidence tampering."
"Well,that's no problem."
We'll just defend ourselves.
"We're tntg,right?"
"""We don't lose."""
"They really didn't go over this part in law school,mr."
Graves.
It's okay.
The defense lawyers
Have as much right to gather evidence as prosecutors.
Most defense lawyers are just too lazy or scared to do it.
"Plus,if we waited for the cops to find evidence,"
We'd never win our cases.
Come on.
Let's just hope it was self-Defense.
"'Cause if it wasn't, we just found the evidence"
That's gonna convict our client.
Good work.
Come on.
100% innocent.

A recent one for a person with reduced mobility and another six months ago in which the applicant is normal.
Are you the same person?
They're both mine.
I did the one as a healthy person... because I wanted my application to be considered like all the others.
"It's important to see in a ""normal"" person's eyes something otherthan pity."
- That's quite honorable.
- Thank you.
But if this compromises my transfer...
"It's a simple but necessary check, because often people make false statements to get a position in milan."
It happens very often.
It's shameful.

Thank God I'm graduating and it's the last time I cram like this.
My pursuit of higher education has led me... to an interesting discovery about myself.
You wanna hear it?
- Sure.
- I despise academics.
"Learning, knowledge, it's all worthless."
I have no idea what you see in it.
Learning is fun.
"Plus, for me, there's that I'm a minor, so it's mandatory thing."
That's what kills me.
This is self-inflicted.
I'm a masochist.
I might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it.
That diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile.
I guess.
Unless I turn into John Nash and start drooling on people.
- You're graduating.
- I know.
"No, you're graduating."
There's gonna be a ceremony.
I don't know.
It's a community college.

There's a reason If you'd like to know why
I'm in love
I'm feelin' high
Even the biggest production numbers needed stars.
So Eleanor Powell became MGM's first big dancing star.
In Broadway Melody of 1938 and almost all of her films Eleanor becomes a huge sensation by the last reel.
Follow in my footsteps
Follow them
Your Broadway And my Broadway
Got that rhythm
Inside me Everybody dance
You are my lucky star
Hear the rhythm of the music And the music of the rhythm
Got a pair of new shoes Got a pair of new shoes
Gotta dance
"Tap your feet Light, long and sweet"
And dance
Dance Now Broadway dance
A Broadway dance and go singing
Can we ask you a question?
How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations?
We must have made a mistake somewhere.
"Look, just between us,"
-what do you think of them?
-So I should give my opinion?
"No, don't worry."
"I'm telling you ""just between us""."
I'm supposed to give my opinion between us?
-I will not give it.
-And why not?
"I will give my opinion, and you will broadcast it, and who will have problems?"
Me.
Do I want problems?
No.
If you want problems then give your opinion.
"What, me?"
!
I'm only an ordinary substrate.
"Excuse me, how would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?"
Now I don't know what I would say.
"I'm thinking about something else, I don't perceive you."
"Well, I don't know."
Everyone whould be wondering and would be curious how it would work out.
For sure they would be wondering too.
"It's an interesting question, but I don't know."
That question has been put strangely.
Depending on whether they have the antennae or they speak with a dictaphone.
-Do they seem normal to you?
-Normal?
-Definitely not.
-Really?
we've to reexamine all evidence.

that question is who wants to kill aisha
My guards will take you south of here
"To a ship set for the southern coast of Spain,"
"And from there, you should keep going."
You needed to vanish
Because you would have been a displaced king.
But I'm just a bastard.
"In time,"
"A very short time, if you'd accepted my presence,"
"The nobles would, too, and I'd be safe."
If you were so inclined.
I'm not so inclined.
"Well, there it is..."
The truth between us at last.
"Make sure what's between us, brother, is distance."
If you want to survive.
Marie:
"So, we'll do another ceremony for you"
"At notre dame, so that all of France"
Can celebrate your marriage.
And what of queen catherine?
She's been pardoned for her adultery?
Yes.
It was all to legitimize bash.
"Now henry looks benevolent, forgiving."
Your father gave me these.
Make some heirs quick as you can.
"It's a queen's sons that give her power after all,"
Though we've handled
"The misfortune of your sex, haven't we?"
Brave girls are we.
Greer said you were upset.
"I came to your room last night to cheer you with hot cocoa,"
"Mr. Moreau, what should I do with the Atomium?"
Ludovic!
Wallonia declared its independence!
Belgium fell apart!
"Their declaration reads, ""We are fed up."""
With what?
The Flemish are arrogant.
They humiliate the Walloons and don't understand them.
They are fed up.
We have to go back immediately.
It'll take us 90 minutes to get to the airport.
Hello!
"Please, come again."
"No, His Majesty wants to talk to the Prime Minister of Wallonia."
- Ludovic?
- There is no signal.
What about the speech?
I will take care of it before we arrive in Brussels.
"No, Ludovic."
I will write it myself.
"But we have to discuss all the political and diplomatic aspects with the chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, and there is no signal."
"With federal ministers as well,"
I don't remember who exactly.
"Sire, we have to be very careful about every word and every move."
Prudence is key.
"At the coronation, the king swore to preserve the integrity of his kingdom at all times."
And I am the king.
Unity means strength.
Unity secures power.
I'll add that.
"Some people have foresight, some have a dream."
"Sire, what is your intuition tells you?"
Are you in love with someone?
If you do silly talking
I will demand fare more than the meter reading
I am loving a guy
"Hey bell, if someone gets you biriyani, you will go with him"
-Are you in love?
"-Start, it's getting late"
These days it's hard to distinguish good and bad
Can't find who drinks alcohol and uses drugs
Can't find who is a terrorist
"Don't get trapped, tell me who he is?"
I will find out whether he is good or bad
-He is from which area?
-Ukkadam
-Where in Ukkadam?
-Sannathi street
-That's our street!
Is it that corner house Pandi or neighbor Kannan?
Or is it that fat ugly fellow with french beard?
"-No, it's the opposite house"
-Opposite house?
-That's our house!
Oh that must be Thankam
Has he trapped you by showing silver anklet?
It's neither gold nor brass
Who will love that black man?
"Then, I am there in the opposite house"
-ls that me?
-Yes
I love you I won't come behind if buy me a biriyani
Make me an ornamental belt I will come after you
You have fallen in love!
I can't get a restart.
Hit the backup system.
It's no-go on backup.
Temperature increasing in the furnace.
Get that coolant flowing.
- Furnace control.
- Control?
"You don't really think you're controlling anything, do you?"
Who is this?
"This is Dr. Victor Gannon,"
And I have just shut down your cooling system.
"OK, you've shut it down."
Get it back on again!
Tell him how expensive it is to put it back on.
"In exactly one hour, we shall be serving grilled plutonium, medium rare, to the atmosphere unless the following conditions are met."
What conditions?
Five million dollars in cash.
A jet waiting at the airport.
"A safe escort, of course."
"And most important of all,"
You will announce that Dr. Victor Gannon has achieved molecular control and mind control.
And this is the first of a series of worldwide demonstrations of his power.
How long does it take to count five million dollars?
We'll have to pay them.
Evacuate the immediate area.
Put Los Angeles on alert.
There's the big round ball.
- Is that it?
"- No, it was bigger than that."
Get outta here.
Leave me alone.
At least I tried.
Say..no... bast...
"Forgive me, I tought it was one more of your tricks."
"Oh, the message."
"Get in, quick, tonite, we shall dance at the Crazy Horse."
Ah!
Dinamo?
zero zero one hundred
"So, it was you."
"I have something very important to inform you, but now it is much to dangerous, I am being followed."
"I will contact you,"
Careful!
"Excuse me, miss, did I harm you?"
"No, not that much."
"Now you will tell me that you had another fight, and someone tried to kill you, right?"
"Of course, look..."
We have been waiting three minutes for you.
Excuse me .
Ms. Bristol but...
There is no time for explanations!
We will begin our business.
"Our best weapon has been and always will be, terrorism."
It has given us great results in countries that are already under our control.
But... but what has happened in the countries where you work?
nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Only some skirmishes and nothing conclusive.
This is why we are meeting here.
Report to me your activities.
"I will advise you of new systems, and new weapons."
Where is that red head?
"She went out a few minutes ago, Madame."
The red head was here with us.
If I'd tell you some details you surely remember me.
We'd spend the entire day talking and arguing.
About everything.
Theology and ethics...
Everything.
And suddenly I'm remembering all those conversations.
And I'd like to clarify some misunderstandings that happened back in the days.
"Father Urlieta, are you there?"
"No, It's not about any religious doubt."
"In fact, what I'd like to talk with you is about those conversations."
You were very efficient and convincing when arguing.
It was some kind of dialectics full of sophisms.
An authentic brainwashing.
I'm not trying to offend you.
"In fact, my intentions are pure."
Absolutely pure.
I just wanted to see you and talk with you.
I'm sorry but I'd like to see you.
"Yes, yes."
Any other day.
I'll call you.
"Well, thank you Father Urlieta."
Bye.
Man!
You look good with that beard!
What have you done?
You'd be surprised by the enormous amount of sounds around us.
And we don't listen to them at all.
Do you use that for your compositions?
We'll see...
I'm not sure.
You could compose some kind of horror symphony with those noises.
"Tea, coffee...?"
"Ms Tanya, you wanted to buy my house."
"Of course, I remember"
I have still preserved this cheque
How many more zeros will you add?
Sorry
"I must sell my house, else my family will break up"
Are you still interested in buying my house?
Had you not sold it already I'd love to buy it out
Had I not sold it...?
I don't understand
"Mr Batra, your house is no longer your property"
You've sold it already
To whom...?
To my fiance
"If you're interested, you can see the papers"
Take a look...
"your signatures, aren't they?"
Yes... these are receipts I wrote out when I borrowed money from Shekhar
Yes.
"But you mortgaged your house when you took the loan, didn't you?"
How did these papers reach you?
Shekhar is my fiance.
And your house is my wedding gift
Don't tell me you want to make a singer out of Tanya
She can't sing.
All she knows is how to make money
"Shekhar, you deceived me...?"
What deception...?
I never imagined!
For the money you were grabbing my house
"As long as I was giving, I was a god?"
- This is ridiculous.
"If he says he's ready for trial, the court takes him at his word."
Callie:
This is a stunt.
Leonard:
"Your Honor, he is alleging negligence, which necessitates more discovery with respect to duty of care."
This will take time.
"Okay, let's forget negligence."
We'll just go with wrongful act and fraud.
Excuse me?
You're willing to waive the claims of negligence against Borns Tech?
That's correct.
That's your strongest cause of action.
You open yourself up to malpractice.
"Well, instead of going with an innocent mistake, we're going to go with a conspiracy."
You're willing to waive the negligence claim?
I just did waive it.
They say he killed himself.
We say he didn't.
We say Borns Tech had him working on an illegal weapon that blew him up.
It's very simple.
"Your Honor, could I have a moment to, uh--"
- Please.
- ...speak with my... people?
"Okay, thoughts?"
"Nope, I don't like it."
What are you talking about?
There is no evidence of any intentional acts or of a cover-up.
"If he's willing to go with wrongful acts and fraud, we win."
Mm-mm.
- Ahem.
- Counsel?
Assassination of who?
- This guy?
- No.
He was delivering the gun to an assassin who is likely sitting out there right now.
"Well, then they should just shut down the terminal and question everybody."
And let it happen again somewhere else?
No dice.
"We got a locked room full of suspects out there, Inspector Poirot."
"Yeah, and if the target's out there, too, he'd probably be dead already."
It's got to be someone on an incoming flight.
"McGee's running manifests right now, but..."
Oh.
There he is.
"Well, that was fast, McGenius."
Hey.
Manifests are on their way.
"In the meantime,"
Gibbs wants to keep an extra set of eyes on you.
But security at the airport won't let us access their surveillance.
Yeah.
They're very touchy about their cameras around here.
"Yeah, so much for interagency cooperation."
"Well, uh, look, if a camera's what's needed, maybe, uh... maybe this'll do."
On three.
"One, two..."
"Rest there, Mr. Beers."
We'll get back to you shortly.
Bishop's photos from the airport.
"Yeah, let's take a look at this imposter."
Whoa.
Is that me?
Most likely the storm wreaking havoc with the power grid.
"I'm taking a piss, asshole!"
- Yeah.
- Yo!
I'm not joining the mile-high club with you.
What about the really high club?
- Are you retarded?
- No.
You brought weed on the fucking airplane?
- Yep.
- What the fuck?
Wait a second.
You were giving that security guard shit.
Yeah.
How else was I supposed to get past him?
By not bringing drugs on an airplane?
- Look--What are you doing?
What is this?
- You'll see.
"Harold Lee, I would like to introduce you to an invention of mine."
Meet the smokeless bong.
- You made this?
"- You know, I did."
When you were slaving away at work...
I was actually being a productive member of society.
"- Yeah, that's really productive."
- Let me show you how it works.
"So you take a little weed... put it in the bowl right here and light it just like a normal bong, OK?"
Now here's the truly genius part.
"Inside this mechanism, I have actually made a little tiny, tiny fan... and some disinfectant powder, OK, it works sort of like a deodorizer... so that anything it expunges smells like Lysol."
- Put it away.
"- No, dude."
Can you not wait till we get to Amsterdam?
"- No, no, no."
"Go ahead and take him, and I'll do my best to be there, okay?"
Just come back safely.
I will.
Bye.
"Everybody, meet agent Prentiss."
The other day.
I've been filling her in on protocol.
- Derek Morgan.
- Emily Prentiss.
We can make nice later.
What do we know?
"The DEA raided what they thought was a hardened meth lab right here, in Northern Virginia, but they found this instead."
That could be a dispersal device for a chemical weapon.
- Sophisticated.
- Homeland security's thinking Al Qaeda.
"They've developed devices that span the spectrum of sophistication, some as simple as soda bottles and paint cans."
They're called al ikhteraa.
"Literally ""the invention""."
They are.
Do we know what the biological or chemical agent is yet?
"No, not yet."
The cell members bailed out through a tunnel.
The DEA recovered a nextel 2-way and managed to intercept a message.
- That's not the transcript.
It's...
"- No, it's in arabic."
Our friends surprised us and eloped.
We can no longer wait for the wedding as planned.
We can deliver our gift at the next crescent.
I lived in several middle-eastern countries
- growing up.
Christopher!
"Cause of death appears to be blunt force trauma to the head, neck, chest."
It's consistent with an impact of over 100 miles an hour.
"Oh, it's like he never slowed down."
And the only silver lining is the death is likely instantaneous.
He didn't suffer.
PRIDE:
Possible he had a medical condition?
Heart attack?
Stroke?
He's awfully young.
"But I'll know more after the autopsy, and I'll do a tox screen for drugs and alcohol."
SEBASTIAN:
"Hey, boss."
"Oh, wait, nobody calls you ""boss,"""
do they?
It's too informal.
"I get it, it's no way to start a relationship."
"Sebastian, we're not starting a relationship, okay?"
We've known each other for years.
"Yeah, but not as employer and employee."
"That's a whole different dynamic, sir."
"""Sir"" doesn't sound right, either."
You sure about making this guy an agent?
"I find that hurtful, you know, right here."
"The case, Sebastian."
Right.
"Yeah, well, uh, it's really simple, I guess, at least on the surface."
"Car was going too fast, couldn't make the turn."
Don't really need fancy forensics to figure that part out.
Any signs of sabotage?
Not yet.
"It'll be over in no time, just like your five years in college"
"Thanks to your foolishness, we've lost two chances"
Last chance!
Please give sensible suggestions
Remember!
I'm doing all this only for you.
"No one must know, okay?"
Shekhar needs cash.
Immediately.
- I'll sign up tomorrow
"What do you mean, you'll sign up?"
Aren't we going back?
But Om borrowed the money for my education
Out there you can earn lots more.
Just mail the money home
No American company will give me a loan.
"And Om wants cash, immediately"
This urgency was never the point.
The decision to borrow was his own
You knew nothing about it
And you're forgetting something.
Only a few weeks to go... before your work permit expires.
And you got to return before that
Is everything all right?
What was that about the work permit?
"It's nothing, Ma."
You haven't gone to bed yet?
Go to sleep
He must return to America before his work permit expires
"Jai, will you step outside for a minute?"
"Whatever you got to say, say it in front of Nitu"
Have you informed Om about this?
"And if it happens, I will say that it has been by love to ltalia."
"You stop, Moroni."
"By the way, one does not take advantage during the visits to touch to me..."
It does not say that.
"Itself I sound with you, with caressing the Alps to him..."
"With seeing that wonderful Sicily, Calabria and Campania..."
With putting my head on those rich and prosperous Romans.
"And then, by the breach of Pia Porthole, to penetrate triumphally in Rome."
"Bravo, Moroni, honour degree in Geography."
What has been believed?
The university is not a gymnasium for its erotic exercises.
Shame on you!
"And you learn to respect the nurses, those celestial beings who sacrifice all their life by the patients."
They do not have to be used like vulgar prostitutes.!
Get out!
"-pardons, Professor..."
-Outside!
-Italia.
Italy.
Land of poets...
-Professor.
"-Of saints, navigators."
-What does?
Now?
-You already know that here you excites more to me.
-If we are in the operating room.
"Indeed, wanted."
"As I announced to you, today you will see the recording of a apencicectomía realised by Prof. Ciotti the past times."
I will be in charge personally of comentároslaa measured that...
Moroni!
"Good morning, Professor."
"Please, you continue."
T urned away and ran.
I followed him
"He kept on running, and I kept on chasing"
T o where?
I was after him for more than a mile
Then he got on a horse and went east
And you lost him?
"Y es, it's all true"
Every word is so true!
Boss!
The one you met at the pharmacy is Fan San
He's one of the Three Devils.
Very bad tempered
Very skillful with his duel blades
His way of sword is mean and nasty!
"The second one is Zhou Sanzhao, a womanizer"
Very good with dart and secret weapons
Never misses a target!
The leader of the three is Y an Qingwang
"Ruthless and insidious, most skillful of the three"
"His Leopard boxing is marvelous, his plait can kill"
They're the parasites of the martial arts field
One of these days...
I'll use their heads as footballs
"Brother Jin, you mentioned that 3 years ago"
You've broken my Master's rib bones
Is it true?
You can ask him yourself
According to my Master's way of boxing
There're 3 stances that can protect the chest
How did you break his rib bones?
Which three stances?
What do you mean?
The instrument for your ship's destruction has already been placed aboard her: : :
And by a member of your own crew:
[Laughs]
"Discover him in time, and you will have won all:"
Reardon:
"The man we picked up here was a fake, wasn't he?"
And Wilma... the real Wilma...
took him on board the Searcher:
And it was he who was able to tell this creature how to duplicate our ship:
[Laughs] You are indeed worthy of admittance to my masters' planet!
Such intuition is a rare thing:
"We are sick and tired of playing your stupid game, old man:"
"I want some answers from you, and I want them now!"
How is Reardon going to destroy the ship?
How's he gonna do it?
"Oh, perhaps not so intelligent after all:"
Anger and violence do not provide solutions:
"Tell me, old man:"
I overestimated you:
[Clicking Tongue]
What a pity:
[Explosion]
Gone like the others:
We gotta get back to the ship:
"Searcher, this is Captain Rogers:"
Do you read me?
Over:
"Yes, Buck:"
What have you found?
"We're returning to the ship, Admiral:"
You've got a saboteur on board:
"Oh, then you approve?"
"Yes, but... you can do better than that."
There's still not enough sport in killing me with a sword.
I know.
That will be dull.
We'll have to have something more fanciful.
"Let me see... a hunt, a royal hunt-- predator against predator."
"Now, you may go hide in the forest-- anywhere you like-- and I shall seek."
"How does that strike you, Captain?"
"It strikes me... very well... but you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane."
Why not up the stakes?
The stakes?
Yes.
"While we're playing our game, free my ship."
Let it continue on its way.
"In return,"
I'll give you a contest you'll remember.
Always back to your ship.
"Oh, well... if it will add spice to the pursuit..."
"I accept your terms, Captain."
"[ Trelane ] Remember, you must try not to let me find you too quickly."
Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go.
At your convenience.
Enterprise...
"Enterprise, this is Kirk."
Can you hear me?
[ Static ]
Get the ship away as fast as you can.
I'll try and give you the time you need.
Can you hear me?
Aha!
Enterprise...
No.
Just not to eat beef.
"If my behaviour was improper, I should be sensible of it."
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?
"If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove impropriety, we are all offending."
"Good morning, Colonel."
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Marianne.
I come to issue an invitation.
A picnic on my estate at Delaford.
If you would care to join us on Thursday next.
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband are travelling up especially.
"We should be delighted, Colonel."
"I will, of course, be including Mr. Willoughby in the party."
I should be delighted to join you.
"Good morning, Miss Dashwood."
"Good morning, Colonel."
The colonel has invited us to Delaford.
- I hear you have a fine pianoforte.
- A Broadwood Grand.
- Then I shall play for you all.
- We shall look forward to it.
- Your sister seems very happy.
- She does not hide her emotions.
Her romantic prejudices tend to set propriety at naught.
- She is wholly unspoilt.
- Rather too unspoilt.
"The sooner she is acquainted with the ways of the world, the better."
I knew a lady with the same sweetness of temper -
- Who was forced into a better acquaintance with the world.
The result was only ruination and despair.
- Of course.
"If it were easy or... aesthetically pleasing, then everyone would do it."
You and I are aligned in our ambitions.
My life's work is transformation.
"I can give you the freedom you desire, but you will need to trust my methods, unorthodox though they may seem."
Everything that happens at Rosewood... is done of one's own free will.
If you're brave and you're willing I can help you become the person that you wish to be.
"Are you brave, Miss Isabel Porter?"
- I want to be.
Yes.
- Good.
Come in.
"Miss Oaks, Dr. Lemelle."
- We're going to be moving you into new quarters.
- May I ask why?
- Dr. Cairn believes that the first step in your rehabilitation is to cast aside old vanities.
"- You're ashamed, yes?"
- Uh...
"- Oh, dear, that is precisely the point."
- Shame is a fallacy imposed upon us by society.
It needs to be excised from the mind like any malignant disease.
- Indeed.
It's time that you demonstrated some responsibility for your own treatment.
- I will do whatever it takes.
- Will you?
- Of course.
- Good.
Doctor.
"- Ah, thank you, Gunther."
- Miss Porter.
- What is this?
- This is your new concoction.
Clear the path!
We're in pursuit of enemy vessels!
Who ordered the pursuit?
They are enemy vessels!
They must be captured!
Turn your men around!
It is Commander Yu Jong's order!
Now!
What?
They will be expecting it.
Arrest them!
They are certain to be Japanese spies!
Sir!
What is the meaning of this!
How dare you intercept a missive to the King!
You will be hung for this!
"They were sneaking away in darkness, so I thought they were Japanese spies."
What has happened?
"Perhaps you could ask the emissary, sir."
"Admiral, I demand that you punish this man immediately!"
"Your Majesty, Supreme Naval Commander Yi Soon-shin takes your royal command lightly and refuses to obey Commander Yu Jong."
"Also, relying on his military power and large following, he looks upon the King and the royal court with contempt and moves his troops without restraint."
Hence it is advised that Yi and his men be charged with treason.
How dare you!
You will be charged with treason as well!
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him!
Yes.
Treason?
Did you say treason?
Very well.
Then I will slay you first and march to the capital!

JEANNE:
Peace.
"Long ago, before The Founders established this great city of ours, that word was all but meaningless."

Oye‎!
Why do not you go to work‎?
"Driving lorries‎, polish boots ‎.‎.‎."
I do not care‎.
Just stay away from my Helkath‎.

Someone told me you used to drive one of those tanks‎.

"My group was not tank‎, tank destroyer was‎."
I was commander of one of those Helkath for two years‎.
Then you have good stories to tell‎.
A good ‎.‎.‎.

What case?
"Don't you understand that your police are trying to take away my business, my property - everything that I have!"
Your police are blackmailing me!
Who?
Who is blackmailing you?
Who?
What are you involving the police officers into your business for?
"Do you understand that you couldn't have been detained without any official documents, a warrant or something like that?"
It's nonsense!
Nonsense!
There was one doctor in my cell.
May be you can identify that prison by finding him?
What is that doctor's surname?
Petrovskiy...
Viktor Apolinaryevitch.
The tailor has come and is waiting.
Petrovskiy.
Viktor Apolinaryevitch.
What was he accused of?
I don't know exactly.
Something connected with illegal drugs.
He is a doctor and he quarrelled with his boss...
- His age?
- About sixty.
Check it through all the channels.
Tell the tailor to come in.
All right.
You may write a statement to initiate the criminal proceedings.
You may turn to the district police department or to the district prosecutor's office.
Well...
Viktor Apolinaryevitch Petrovskiy has never been detained or accused of criminal activities.
No man under such name has been to any prison in our region.
That is why I am asking you to marry me
But you don't listen at all

"It's still furnished to the taste of your predecessor, but that's easily changed."
- Who are you?
"- My name is Leitz, General."
"Commissioner Sleer sent me to act as His Excellency, President-elect Practor's liaison officer."
Good.
"Remarkable person, Sleer."
Thinks of everything.
They think highly of Sleer at Federation headquarters.
So they should.
So they should.
"If it wasn't for Commissioner Sleer's pacification programme, my task force would still be bogged down five star systems back."
"Adaptation programme, General."
Tell me about it.
How is it done?
"- Some new wonder drug, isn't it, Leitz?"
"- Yes, sir."
The Commissioner controls its manufacture.
"It's injected by medical laser, acts immediately and has no side effects."
"- It changes the personality, I believe?"
"- Not to any great extent, Excellency."
It simply blocks the production of adrenalin.
The result is that adapted natives no longer resist us.
- They continue to work normally?
- Completely.
"- In fact, the work ethic is often reinforced."
- Really?
Industrial production on Tarsius has risen 19% since the natives were adapted.
That's very impressive.
How many Helots have been adapted so far?
"Do sit down, General."
"The majority, I should think."
Commissioner Sleer doesn't waste time.
He never hesitates
While passing by Horse Square I was told told that İbrahim Paşa has icons at her palace
I didn't believe at first
But Isaw them with my eyes
He ha 3 icons
He brought them from Buda
2 Abrahams came to world
One of them destroyed the icons
The other one raise the icons
Hey folks
Prophet Abraham destroyed the icons and our Paşa Abraham raise them back
Figani say it again
2 İbrahims came to this world
One of them destroyed the icons
The other one raise them
Prophet Abraham destroyed the icons and Our Paşa İbrahim raises them back
"Girl, don't take that one"
"Your sould is already black, that would just get you darker"

Who sent these?
Mahidevran Sultana sent them
"She lavishes gifts on harem, thanks to her"
Mayshe have the Midas touch.
She also said that she'll have fouintains and baths built.
Look for a place for them
Did she ask it from you?
Exactly to me in person.
In person!
She told me to analyse the neighborhoods and find places
"My Sultanas are very pleased of my services, mashallah"
"Oh gosh Mashallah, Inshallah"
Amen.
"Mr Aouny, the stairs should only be washed at night... when there are very few people going up and down"
"OK, are you going to chat with me?"
- Dry up a spot for us to walk on
"- At your service, Pasha"
Out of the way
"Did you finish high school, Taha?"
- Yes
- What college will you apply to?
"Thank God, my average can get me into a respectable college but I applied to the police academy"
"You want to become a police officer, Taha?"
Put the mat back in front of the door after you're done
"- Good night, Buthaina"
"- You, too, uncle Hamed"
- Don't leave the TV on
- Don't worry
"What is it, man?"
I've already gone to sleep
"You can get up, woman"
"I will pray to God, God the greatest..."
"No, I've done it before"
"- What is it, Khamees?"
- This is not the place to talk
Isn't it late enough?
Or are you waiting for the loved one?
- Don't you have work early?
- I quit
- When?
- Today
Why did you quit?
- I want to watch the movie now
- What damned movie?
Am I destined to live in anguish day and night?

I'm willing to bet every creature on this ship is exactly the same way:

I suggest you two stay here:
Which supplies water for eight states
In the heart of america's breadbasket.
Or in california.
"After four years of drought,"
"And heavy aquifer depletion,"
The state imposed its first ever mandatory water restrictions.
"And last year, more than 400,000 acres of farmland went unplanted."
"We have a very dramatically dangerous situation right now,"
"A new dimension which is creeping into the water equation,"
"And that is the fact that if you have finite resources,"
"And there's competition about these resources,"
There is also a risk that water scarcity
Could be a threat to peace and security.
(people shouting)
"History's full of stories where you fight about resources,"
But fighting about water is fighting about our survival.
If we don't deal
With this problem
"With responsibility,"
"At this stage, this problem will grow"
Into a disastrous situation later on.
I think it's time for us to wake up.

Monsanto gave us a tour of their labs
To show us how they plan to feed the world.
Gary barton:
"So this laboratory here,"
We're looking at over 12 million pieces of dna
To try to find plants that have
The best combination of dna.
Yeung:
But what made monsanto famous
Was when they genetically modified their seeds.
Their scientists use bacteria to deliver genetic abilities
Never before seen in any crops.
One trait allows the crop to produce a protein
"So that when a bug eats that plant it dies,"
But their most profitable breakthrough was to modify their crops
"To be tolerant to pesticides,"
But not just any pesticide-- their pesticide.
Announcer:
Roundup kills weeds
Where others can't.
Roundup.
Yeung:
Monsanto crops are now genetically engineered
"To be resistant to roundup, or glyphosate."
This means that you can spray monsanto's pesticide
Directly onto monsanto's crops.
"And while the weeds around it are poisoned,"
The plant itself survives.
"Since roundup-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996,"
Roundup has grown to be the most widely used weed-killer ever.
A lot of people do say that this is just an ingenious way
For monsanto to sell more roundup.
Like what normal people talk about.
"- Not really my strong suit, Katherine."
- I'll start.
How do you know I dropped out of college?
"Oh, that was just a lucky guess."
Grabbed my file or something?
- You fit a profile.
- Of what?
"Civilian broadcasters have a certain, you know, personality trait."
Keep working.
"Well, I can't work in silence, so you might as well just entertain me."
Okay.
A troubled childhood with an emphasis on extreme emotional loss or fatigue.
Death of a parent.
Sometimes sexual abuse.
Lack of a strong authority figure in adolescence.
Low self-esteem resulting in few permanent relationships.
Defensive.
Rebellious.
Highly intelligent.
"Susceptible to being stuck in one position, environment or occupation for long periods of time."
"Yeah, you're terrible at this."
How about your profile?
Indifferent and emotionally detached from reality.
Inability to communicate with any other human being on the face of this Earth.
Willing to sit silently in one place for hours at a time.
Make sure that you have a plan to kill every person that you ever meet.
No.
Close.
"No, I had a stable childhood but with an underlying desire to break free from control or authority."

It's Reardon:
"He's an impostor, a fake:"
We were tricked into taking him on board the Searcher so he could destroy it:
You've got to find him and stop him:
Where is he?
"He should be in sick bay, unless he's taking another one of his little walks:"
"Sick bay, this is Colonel Deering on the bridge:"
Is Mr:
Reardon there?
"[Man] He should be, Colonel:"
Just a minute:
That's funny:
"He was here a minute ago, but now he's gone:"
I'd better get down there:
Let's organize search teams to scour the ship:
Good:
"Buck, Reardon's disappeared:"
We're starting a search now:
How long before you're back?
"We're on final approach now, Admiral:"
"Buck, we have teams out searching the entire ship, but still no sign of Reardon:"
The fusion reactor room:
It's the most sensitive part of the ship:
No sign of Reardon anywhere:
We think he's in the reactor room:
Come on:
"Well, we know someone's inside:"
The green light's on:
- Captain Rogers:
- Lieutenant Parsons:
"Good to have you back, sir:"
"I've checked the reactor room for any sign of Reardon, as Colonel Deering ordered:"

Anyway we have got 6 acres within the city

If you grab all the portfolios then where do we go?
That's why we have given various honorifics

Keep those honorifics with you and give us positions
Throw your brother from district secretary's post
Else people will talk about our party as one run by money lenders and sundry arbitrators...

The wedding chain was there until the pooja time
Thereafter it was missing
It must have been taken by some relatives
We don't want to create a scene by checking them
We can go ahead with the marriage using the tamarind coated thread
But missing of the chain would be considered a bad omen
The chain was made by sir

"877 01:11:55,400 --&amp;gt; 01:11:59,400 He can gain the possibility for a 100% scholarship 878 01:11:59,700 --&amp;gt; 01:12:03,000 This is it!"
This is it!
This is it man!
"879 01:12:03,010 --&amp;gt; 01:12:06,749 But if he isn't involved in trouble again... 880 01:12:07,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:08,800 What do you say?"
"881 01:12:08,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:13,800 What can he say?"
He says God!
Oh I thank you my gracious God!
"882 01:12:13,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:15,300 Yaman."
"883 01:12:15,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:19,508 What can I say, of course it's great, but only if it's 100% scholarship, 884 01:12:19,508 --&amp;gt; 01:12:20,971 if I succeed in exam 885 01:12:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:12:23,758 You will succeed dot com dot tr (.com.tr)."
That's all!
"886 01:12:23,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:27,500 As school is close to here you can continue staying here now 887 01:12:27,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:30,400 No, I will come and go."
"888 01:12:31,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:35,400 Here is the possibility for you."
Work and win!
Ok?
"889 01:12:35,500 --&amp;gt; 01:12:37,200 Okay..?"
-Okay.
"890 01:12:37,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:42,100 My God, what kindness did I do for you that you brought these people in front of my son?"
"891 01:12:42,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:45,500 Ah thanks God!"
Thanks God!
"892 01:12:46,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:49,600 God bless you..."
"893 01:13:11,000 --&amp;gt; 01:13:15,100 Everything is ok, right?"
There is nothing to be taken or given.
"894 01:13:15,300 --&amp;gt; 01:13:18,400 This time you beat the rap Mr. Faruk 895 01:13:18,422 --&amp;gt; 01:13:23,704 but we won't be so tolerant with you next time."
"896 01:13:25,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:28,200 There won't be a next time."
"897 01:13:40,200 --&amp;gt; 01:13:43,485 Wow, did you dress?"
I will get prepared right away.

Didn't you prepare the table yet?
"1042 01:27:41,505 --&amp;gt; 01:27:43,470 Right away dear dad, just let me wash my hands 1043 01:27:43,483 --&amp;gt; 01:27:46,809 Wait, may you be save from the bad things, 1044 01:27:46,900 --&amp;gt; 01:27:51,300 may God make your final the best!"
What can I say?
"1045 01:28:13,838 --&amp;gt; 01:28:16,398 Don't, I am feeling dizzy, leave me please 1046 01:28:16,500 --&amp;gt; 01:28:20,500 Whenever I look at you I feel dizzy"

- Are you in bad terms with Mira?
"1055 01:29:23,100 --&amp;gt; 01:29:26,100 No!"

"1069 01:30:49,000 --&amp;gt; 01:30:53,400 Wow..."
Bravo Eylul!
Bravo!
You were great You were great -Finally!
SO its 2 times 2 minus 3 times 4
SO that's 4 minus 12.
"So its -8i minus, remember we have to swap signs, plus-minus-plus when you are taking the determinant."
"So you ignore the j, so its 4 times 2 = 8 minus 3 times 3 which is -1."
So this would be a -1 here but there is already a negative here so its a +1j.
"And then finally the k, you cross out that column."
4 times 4 is 16.
16 -6 =10.
So plus 10.
Let me be sure I got that correct.
"So the first one, I always have to make sure, so i I got yup, 4-12 = -8 and negative j ... 4 times 2 is 8 minus 9 = -1 but j has a negative so that's right."
"And then k, 4 times 4 is 16."
16 -6 = 10.
So that looks right.
So plus...plus 10k.
So this vector right here is the vector d.
I just figured it out.
"Now if we take the cross product of d with vector a the vector that was....you can kinda view it as lying along this line over here, then we will get a vector that is normal to this plane."
"We can call that vector n, for normal, that is normal to this yellow plane that will actually sit on this white plane."
"So lets figure it out, we will see in a few steps, probably in the next video why is that actually useful."
"So lets take, lets find what is d cross a... this is equal to our normal vector which is = same thing. i..j...k."
"We are gonna take d which is -8, 1, 10 and take the cross of that and vector a which is 2,3,4. and we will get, actually, I will continue this in the next video so that I do not make these videos too long."
- Her Grace is gone.
Find her.
- My lady.
"- You men, with me."
- Sir.
"So, she's definitely left the palace?"
"Yes, sir."
We saw her guards ourselves.
Get me more details.
Sir.
"OK, so they just want to know cost as a function of hours."
So let's see.
It's a linear relationship.
We could treat this just like any other line.
So if we write it as y equals mx plus b.
I didn't even have to do this.
So y is equal to mx plus b.
"So m, or the slope, is equal to change in y over-- or let me write it differently."
Because we want it in terms of-- so we could write c is equal to the slope times the hours plus b.
"Instead of x, we have hours, and instead of y, we have the cost."
So what's the slope?
"Slope is equal to change in the dependent variable, change in cost, divided by change in the independent variable, divided by change in hours."
So let's see.
"If when our hours increased by 3, how much did our change in c go by?"
"When we go from 2 to 5, so if we say 5 minus 2, that's how much we changed in hours."
That's delta h.
Then how much did we change in cost?
Well it's 30 minus 15.
So it equals 15 over 3. which is equal to 5.
So we figured out the slope.
Slope is equal to 5.
Now we just have to figure out the y-intercept.
"So this equation, we could rewrite it as cost is equal to the slope, which is 5, times the hours plus whatever our y-intercept is."
"And then we just have to substitute one of the points in to solve for b, just like we did in the previous video."
"So let's substitute the point when h is equal to 2, c is equal to 15."
So the point 2 comma 15.
"So when h is equal to 2, c is equal to 15. c is equal to 15 when h is equal to 2."
And now we can just solve for b.
So you get 15 is equal to 10 plus b.
"Subtract 10 from both sides, you get b is equal to what?"
5.
"So the equation of this line is cost is equal to 5 times h plus our y-intercept, or plus our c-intercept we could say."
"Come all the way down to n, which is the"
"last line, come back up."
Drop it down.
There.
So now we have to drop some matrices in here or vectors in here with one and 1's with occasional 0's and 0's with occasional 1's okay.
So how do we do that.
"So, let's, let's come here and let's build zero vector, E0 is 0's end by one."
This is a vector of 0's.
Okay what we're going to do is do the following.
First of all let's take the let's make a vector of e2 which is just e1.
So I'm going to copy the one vectors.
"And what I'm gonna to do with e2 is I am going to, to occasionally put in zero."
How often do I put in a zero?
Well every nth point.
"Remember M, M is the small, is the small matrices in there."
"And, by the way, part of your homework three is going to be all about convincing yourself about this stuff."
"Because you're just going to be, your gonna emmese, immerse yourself in building matrices."
"That's all homework three is because you gotta build a derivative matrix and X derivative and Y and then, this."
"So, we're going to do, is for J equals one to M cuz that's how many, M blocks I have, remember, n by n, and I have these n by n blocks and there's m of them."
Now I am going to go down for each block and what I am gonna do is the following.
"For E2,"
Put an occasional zero.
Alright.
"So, Jay is going to one second."
Jay's going to go one.
"So, the first thing he is going to do is say y is five."
"So, he's going to go down to the fifth component."
Put a zero.
"And then Jay is going to be two, it's going to be the tenth component."
Put a zero.
"So, it's a bunch of ones, fifth component, tenth component."
All the way down.
"They're gonna be talking about it, and I'm sure some of them are using it,"
'cause why else would it be on there?
"Now, Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica."
"I've used this since it's come out, so for years and years and years and so has my husband."
"It is, like, our top favorite product."
It is good for men and women.
It is a daily product you can use.
"Hence the name, Daily Microfoliant."
"And, who uses it?"
"Dun dun dun dun, Oprah."
"That's right, Oprah, another queen here."
She uses it and you can see it's a little white rice powder and you mix it with water and--every day.
It's a very very very gentle gentle gentle daily exfoliant.
"So that's the Dermalogica, and, in makeup, what I have--"
I have Glo and I have the La Bella Donna.
"Now, the Glo Pressed Base is Hoda's favorite from The Today Show."
She loves herself Pressed Base.
This is the Honey Dark I have in my hand.
"Glo is great because there's Pressed Base, there's Loose, they have Satin, they have"
"Barely Beige, like a sheer type coverage, so a lot of options in Glo for you."
"La Bella Donna, one of my favorites, of course-- pretty much all these are my favorites-- is Bella Foundation."
"I use it on a daily basis, and they also have compact and loose, and Alicia Silverstone loves La Bella Donna."
"She loves the Brow Kit, which I will tell you about the Brow kit over and over and over because you get four colors in one compact, and this is the one for brunettes, so we pick your--you know your hair color."
Just pick the Brow Kit that matches and you're set.
Your colors are already picked out for you; it's like a no-brainer here.
"So, La Bella Donna, ooh, pretty four colors, I love it."
Love it.
"Now, last but not least, so you're using all of these products and you're like, yeah,"
I use these products.
"I do my skin care regime, I have the Fabulous Make Kit, makeup,"
I use it all.
I'm good.
So let me write 12th down.
She's the 12th tallest and shortest.
"If everyone in the class is a different height, how many students are there in the class?"
And these are the type of questions that I just like to make sure that I'm not miscounting.
So she's the 12th tallest.
So what does that mean?
That means that there are 11 people taller than her.
So let's say from shortest to tallest.
So this is Stacy right here.
"And so, if she is the 12th tallest-- let me put it this way."
"If I said that she was the first tallest, that means there's no one taller than her."
"If she's the second tallest, that means there's one person taller than her."
"If she's the third tallest, that means there's two people taller than her."
"And likewise, if she's the 12th tallest, that means that there are 11 people taller."
"Similarly, if she's the 12th shortest, well, that must mean that there are 11 shorter than her."
So this is really just making sure that you parse the words correctly and count properly.
"So if there's 11 shorter, 11 taller, and then there's"
"Stacy, well, that's 22 plus her."
There's 23 students in the class.
"And this is just to make sure that you don't say, oh, 12 taller, 12 shorter, and say 25 or something like that."
"It's just to confuse you really, I think."
Problem number 11.
Image.
Clear image.
Invert colors.
Problem number 11.
Switch colors.
"The quadratic function g is given by-- this is just the general way people write quadratic functions-- is equal to ax squared plus bx plus c, where a and c are negative constants."
Which of the following could be the graph of g?
So I'm not going to even look at the choices.
"I'll just show you how I would-- if someone didn't even give me any choices, and say, well, if a and c are less than 0, what's this going to look like?"
So let's draw the x and y.
Because this'll have some positive value.
It might have an insignificantly small value.
We could make it 0.000001.
But it's still going to have some positive value.
"So no matter what y we choose, as long as it's greater than 0, 2x minus 3y will be greater than 2x."
"So we could say that as long as if 2x is less than x squared for any x we pick, then 2x minus 3y is definitely going to be less than x squared."
Why is that?
"Because minus 3y is going to subtract from the 2x, because we know that y is greater than 0."
So let me ask you a question.
Is 2x always going to be less than x squared if x is greater than 2?
Sure.
"I mean whatever x is, on the left-hand side it's going to be 2 times--pick a random number--2 times xŁŹit could be 2.5."
"But on the other side, on the right-hand side, you're going to have 2.5 squared."
"So if you think about it, you're going to have 2 times a number."
That's always going to be less than--ŁŹthat number which happens to be larger than 2 squared.
The smallest possible is 2 times 2.0001.
You could make a lot of 0's there.
But I think you get the point.
That's still going to be less than 2.0001 squared.
Because you only have a 2 here instead of a 2.0001.
"So actually, statement 2 alone is sufficient."
Hopefully that made sense.
"You just have to see oh, if y is greater than 0, then the 3y is definitely going to take away from the 2x."
"Then as long as x is greater than 2, 2x is always going to be less than x squared."
"If that makes sense to you, then you should realize that statement 2 alone is sufficient for this."
That was interesting.
"Oh, no sorry."
Either of them alone were sufficient.
"We did that in the first one, right?"
"Statement 1 or statement 2, independently are sufficient to answer that question."
120.
"A report consisting of 2,600 words is divided into 23 paragraphs."
We could write 3 plus 2 is equal to 5.
Term three is minus 5.
And that's because minus 1 times this 5-- let me draw these arrows-- is equal to minus 5.
And then we add again-- I'm going to switch colors just to keep it interesting.
"So term four is going to be minus 5 plus 2, which equals minus 3."
"Then term five is going to be minus 3 times minus 1, which equals 3 again."
Right?
And I think you see how we're getting these patterns.
You just keep switching between adding 2 and multiplying by negative 1.
And then so term six is going to be what?
"It's going to be this plus 2, which is 5."
I think you're seeing the pattern again.
Let me do a bunch more and I'll do it outside of the scope of this chart.
The term seven is going to be what?
"It's going to be minus 1 times that, so minus 5."
And you see the pattern now.
Term eight is going to be minus 3.
Term nine is going to be what?
"Minus 3, minus 3."
So here we added 2 so we multiply it by negative 1.
So it's going to be 3 again.
And you could just experiment with yourself.
"Once you understand how soon. the sequence works, do a bunch of terms until you see a cycle."
And that's the key thing.
"In any SAT problem, when they ask you like what is the 100th term?"
It's going to have a cycle because they don't expect you to sit and write out 100 terms because you would run out of time.
"So if they ask you the 100th term, the pattern probably repeats every three or four or five or, at most, six terms."
And then you can use that to figure out what the 100th term is.
"So here we see that the pattern repeats-- let's see, 3, 5, negative 5, negative 3."
"3, 5, negative 5, negative 3, 3."
"So we see it repeats every fourth term, right?"
"This is kind of one cycle, then 3, 5, negative 3, and this is another cycle."
"All right, number 14."
"In the xy plane, the equation you of line I is-- let me write that down-- number 14."
The equation of line I is y is equal to 2x plus 5.
"If the line m is the reflection of I in the x-axis, what is the equation of line m?"
"So I'm going to draw a graph for you, just so you understand what I'm doing."
But on the real SAT you really don't have to do this because you wouldn't want to run out of time.
"Oh man, I'm going to run out of time if I can't draw a straight line."
I'm being a stickler for this.
"Oh, I still couldn't do it."
I'll move forward.
"So this line, so y equals 2x plus 5."
"So if you remember from our slope and y-intercept modules, the y-intercept's going to be 5, right here."
And then the line's going to have a slope of 2.
Right?
So the line's going to look something like this.
That's line l.
This is line l.
"And then we want to know, they say line m is the reflection of I in the x-axis."
So reflection would kind of be the x-axis-- this is the x-axis.
"So it's like if we were looking at this in a pool of water, the reflection would be like if you took this and flipped it over the x-axis."
So the line m is going to look something like this.
Line m is going to look like this.
So a couple of things.
It's like the mirror image.
"If we flipped it, it's like we flipped it over the axis."
"So if the y-intercept here is 5, the y-intercept here is going to be minus 5."
Right?
Because we just flipped it.
"And similarly, if every one this moves up 2, right, because that's at slope."
2.
For every one we move here to the right we're going to go down 2.
So the slope is going to be the negative of this or negative 2.
3 times 3 is 9.
We did the whole thing.
They're just repeating the same question.
That equals 10.
That's choice B.
Rewind the video and see what I did here.
3 times 3 is 9 times minus 3i plus 3i minus i squared.
"These terms cancel out and you get a minus i squared, which is minus negative 1."
"So you have 9 plus 1, so that equals 10."
So that is choice B.
That's crazy.
They just gave us the same problem twice in a row.
All right.
They're giving us more and more imaginary problems.
"But these are fun, especially if they're going to repeat the same question."
"Problem 30, if i is equal to the square root of negative 1-- well, I'll just keep writing it because they keep writing it."
It's good as a reminder. i is equal to the square root of negative 1 and a and b are non-zero real numbers.
What is 1 over a plus bi?
"Well, once again, if they kind of want us to rewrite this, they probably just want us to get rid of the i's in the denominator."
So we multiply times the conjugate of this complex number.
"So we multiply times a plus bi, the conjugate over the conjugate, a plus bi."
The conjugate isn't this whole thing.
The conjugate is just a plus bi.
"Oh sorry, we should be multiplying times a minus bi. a minus bi over a minus bi."
"The conjugate of a plus bi, just so you get the terminology right, is just the a minus bi."
But I'm doing a minus bi over a minus bi.
So I'm not changing this fraction because this obviously is 1. x over x is the same thing as 1.
So let's see what this is equal to.
"Well, the numerator just becomes a minus bi times 1, which is a minus bi."
"Then you have a times a, which is a squared. a times minus bi, so it's minus abi."
"Then you have bi times a, which is plus abi."
I'll write it down here.
"You decrease it to 0, then that'll-- and you could list them all out, 0 through 10-- and then the median number will shift to 5, so that will change it."
"E, increasing the largest number only."
"I can tell you that's the answer from deductive reasoning, but if we just take this 11 and we make it one billion does that change the fact that they're five numbers"
larger than 6 and five numbers less than 6?
Ignore the 0.
Five numbers less than 6?
No.
I can make it into a trillion.
"I can change it to any number, but the fact remains that I have the same amount of numbers larger than 6 as I do below 6."
So choice E cannot affect the value of the median.
E.
Next problem.
"OK, something for me to draw."
"Let's see, they have a 1/4 circle, so I'll just draw a big circle, and I'll just focus on a 1/4 of it."
Close enough.
That looks like a 1/4 of a circle.
"They say that-- oh, and there's a rectangle there too fascinating."
"So this rectangle in this 1/4 circle, so this rectangle could look like this."
"I know theirs looks taller, but I think this will do."
And then I think I'm almost done.
"I think I'm there, I think I can."
"And then they shade in some stuff, so if they shaded it, I will shade it."
A suitably tasteful color.
"OK, so I have shaded what they have shaded."
"And now, what are they saying?"
"They're saying that this is R, C, T, B, S, A."
And then they tell us that is a 90 degree angle.
"And then they tell us that this distance, from here to here, from all the way to the top-- so it's essentially the radius of the circle-- is 6."
The radius of the circle is 6.
"In the figure above, arc SBT is 1/4 of a circle with center R and radius 6"
Fair enough.
"If the length plus the width of rectangle ABCR is 8-- so the length plus the width, so ABCR."
"We've already gotten used to the world of vegetation and are no longer amazed,but truthfully what does it resemble from a real viewpoint?It's just like if someone would ask you how many cellphones you would like for free,from the new generation phones,how many would you like for free?So you say if it's free give me 300."
I have people to give them out to.
"So he tells you,no problem."
"Buy this phone,which costs 30 Shekels."
"Go to your yard,dig a hole,plant the phone in the ground,cover it,water it and wait till it rusts,before it turns rusty it won't work.But afterwards..."
"You're looking at him shocked but he continues and tells you that after it rusts,you will suddenly see that an antenna will grow from this  phone and many phones will grow at the head of the antenna."
How will this sound?
"Totally strange,right?If you take a person from the North Pole who doesn't know what planting and growing is."
All he ever saw was ice.He never heard or knew of such a thing.
"If you tell him that a seed is planted in the ground,goes through a process and grows a stem which has tens of grains on its head."
How will that sound to him?
Totally strange!
He will say that it's not true!
It's like a phone that grows.
It's not logical.We've already gotten used to it so we are not amazed.
"God tells man,are you surprised that I will resurrect the dead in the future?"
"Look,I do it now in the world of vegetation."
This is the tale of Mister Morton
Mister Morton is who?
"He is the subject of our tale, and the predicate tells what Mister Morton must do."
Mister Morton walked down the street.
Mister Morton walked.
Mister Morton talked to his cat.
Mister Morton talked.
"(""Hello, cat."
"You look good."")"
Mister Morton was lonely.
Mister Morton was...
"Mister Morton is the subject of the sentence, and what the predicate says, he does."
Mister Morton knew just one girl.
Mister Morton knew.
Mister Morton grew flowers for Pearl.
Maybe there's even more magic here than we know about.
"Now, I have continued to discover  that there's little things in, anandamide, for example,  the bliss chemical is present in chocolate."
"The love chemicals,  phenethylamines that are damaged by heat, but entirely present  in raw chocolate."
There's at least seven of them  in raw chocolate.
"And those are the feelings of love, happiness and fulfillment that chocolate gives us."
It's from a chemistry that's in the plant.
This is the book.
"And if you recall the book,"
"I do want to mention that when I got to chapter 16, there was a most amazing citing that occured for me  when I was in Amsterdam many years ago."
(Laughter)
[You] can guess what happens there.
"""Oompa-Loompas!""  everyone said it at once."
"""Oompa-Loompas!"
"Imported direct from Loompaland,"" said Mr Wonka proudly."
"""There's no such place,"" said Mrs Salt."
"""Excuse me, dear lady, but..""  ""Mr Wonka,"" cried Mrs Salt,"
"""I am a teacher of geography."""
"""Then you'll know all about it,"" said Mr Wonka."
"""And oh, what a terrible country it is!"
Nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world -- hornswogglersand snozzwangers  and those terrible wicked whangdoodles.
A whangdoodle would eat  ten Oompa-Loompas for breakfast and come galloping back for a second helping.
"When I went out there, I found the little  Oompa-Loompas living in tree houses."
They had to live in tree houses  to escape from the whangdoodles and the hornswogglers  and the snozzwangers.
They were practically starving to death.
"And they were living on green caterpillars,  and the caterpillars tasted revolting, and the Oompa-Loompas spent every moment  of their days climbing through the treetops"
looking for anything to mix with the caterpillars to make them taste better.
The one food that they longed for  more than any other was the cacao bean.
(Laughter)
But they couldn't get it.
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky  if he found 3 or 4 cacao beans a year.
"But oh, how they craved them."
Listen to this:
NCATS is going to do.
[Applause]
"The last thing, just to illustrate how NCATS is going to do things differently and, may I say, better,"
"I'm going to show you what real music is, and so let's take it away."
"I should say, how did I choose this?"
"Glen and I chose this in a somewhat whimsical way but somewhat with a serious note, and it gets to what I started saying."
"This is an aria from The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart and, as some of you may know, Mozart died at the age of 37 of causes which aren't entirely known, but there was some sort of infectious disease, perhaps a urinary tract infection or tuberculosis."
Just imagine if Mozart had not died at age 37.
What could he have created that our world would have to enjoy?
"That didn't happen, and it doesn't happen for so many patients now, and we can change that."
[Applause]
I want to make little townhouse shapes with toothpicks.
So this would be my first townhouse.
"I've used 3 toothpicks so far-- 4, 5, and 6."
So that is my first townhouse.
"Now, let me make a little table here keeping track of things."
So I'll do that in white.
So here's my table to keep track of things.
"So this is the number of houses, and then this is the toothpicks that I'm using to make that house."
"So this first house here, took me 6 toothpicks-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
Now let's make our second house.
And these are going to be townhouses.
They're going to share common walls.
"So I'm going to add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks for my second house."
"Now, why did I only have to add 5 and not 6?"
"Well, they shared a common wall here so I didn't have to add another toothpick here for this left-hand side wall."
"So starting with the first house,"
I really just had to add 5 toothpicks.
I had to add 5 toothpicks to get to now 11 total toothpicks if I want two houses.
I think you see the trend here.
What about 3 of these?
"Well, this is going to be another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks."
And his Enigma machine is exactly the same as the first one.
So there's something I have to do.
I now need to set these rotors to the correct position.
"So we've got this code over here, Y-T-H-M-Y and whatever."
Let's type that into the machine this time and see what happens.
"OK, so we start with Y. Y becomes N. T becomes U. H becomes M. M, in the code, is a B. Y. I. F. And W, finally, is E. So each rotor has 26 starting places."
"In fact, these rotors come out and swap over."
"In fact, again, they had five rotors to pick from."
They had a box of five rotors.
You would pick three from a box of five.
"And already, we've got thousands of settings."
And each one will produce a different code.
So we're going to work out those combinations.
"So the first thing I said was, we pick three rotors from a box of five."
"In the first slot, you would have five rotors to pick from."
"Once you've picked that, in the second place, you would have four rotors to pick from."
"And in the final place, the third place, you would have three rotors left."
And you multiply those numbers together.
So it's 5 times 4 times 3.
So there are 60 ways that you can put in three rotors from a choice of five.
We have 26 starting positions for each rotor.
"So we have 26 choices for the first one, 26 choices for the second one, and 26 choices for the third one."
"And if you do that, you get 26 cubed, which is 17,576."
"It gets worse, because the military, the Army, Air Force,"
Navy had something extra.
"The commercial machines-- if you were a bank or a business, you could buy an"
Enigma machine to use yourself to send your own secrets.
But the military had an extra bit.
They had this thing at the front of the machine.
"Now, this is called a plugboard."
"And it's like an old-fashioned telephone switchboard, like an old patchboard."
We have 10 of these wires.
This is my card as well.
"If you have any questions, you can come and see me."
"If you did not, print out the email on the sublime list, and you want 10 dollars off tonight, it's only for the table."
I apologize for that.
But it's for the table.
So not everybody at the table get this.
"Or no, you know what, I am wrong, I am totally wrong."
It's for two.
"So if you have a group of four people, you will get two of these."
And thank you guys for listening.
I hope you enjoyed it.
-What's happening guys?
"All right, here's the thing."
"If you're a penguin, feel free to dance around and have a good time, but don't f--k around and jump on a sea lion."
Now I don't know what that penguin was thinking or why that sea lion needed to be so melodramatic about the whole thing.
"-Oh, no he didn't."
-But I do know that that penguin is brave as hell.
"Apparently, Happy Feet plus gigantic balls equals a penguin."
"No but this video got a half million views in two weeks but it just goes to show you that even in the animal kingdom, everyone picks on the fat kid."
-Fatty fatty 2x4.
"Wake up, fatass."
-Oh!
-Now I'm honestly not sure why he didn't snatch that penguin up and eat him with a side of Nutella.
"But no, his lazy ass goes right back to sleep."
-[snores]
"-Look at him there, lazy ass."
"""Just five more minutes Mom."""
"Listen if you're a sea lion and you're way too lazy get up and eat a penguin, that's like a whole other level of lazy."
"All right, if you're a straight male, then you probably don't know much about Liza Minnelli."
"All right so here we got some footage of her in an interview and I don't know much about her,"
"I know that she sings, I know that she acts and I also know that I am like in love with her now"
'cause she did this hour-long interview and someone clipped a two-second soundbite from that interview.
I've missed her a lot.
"We talk on the phone, but of course that's never quite the same as hanging out with your parents in real life."
"It's such a nice togetherness, you know?"
I like it.
I like watching people walk around with their parents because I think it makes people make more sense.
I like seeing freshman run to their parents because they haven't seen them in so long.
That'll be me this year.
We're told to graph this system of equations and identify the number of solutions that it has.
And they have the system of equations here.
So they want us to graph each of these equations and think a
little bit about the solutions.
"So the first equation here-- I'll rewrite it, so I'll graph it in the same color that I write it."
"This first equation's already in slope-intercept form, y is equal to 3x plus 1."
"We see that the slope, or m, is equal to 3, and we see that the y-intercept here is equal to 1."
"So let me be clear, that is also the slope."
I just called it m because a lot of times people say y is equal to mx plus b.
So we can graph it.
"We can look at its y-intercept, the point 0, 1 must be on this graph."
"So that's the point 0, 1 right there."
"This is the y-axis, that is the x-axis."
And the slope is 3.
"That means if we move 1 in the positive x-direction, we're going to move up 3 in the positive y-direction."
"So we move 1 in the x-direction, we move up 3."
"If we moved 2 in the x-direction, we would move up 6."
Just like that.
Because 6 over 2 is still 3.
"Likewise, if we moved down 1, if we went negative 1 in x, we would go negative 3 in y."
"So negative 1, negative 3."
Because negative 3 divided by negative 1 is still 3.
"If we went negative 2 in x, we would go negative 6-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in y."
"So these are all points along the line, and I can connect the dots now."
So N becomes Y. Your code lights up.
Let's write that down.
"Let's do the next letter, U. U becomes T. Let's do M. And"
I've got H this time.
B. And E is W.
"Notice here, we had Y turn up twice."
And they turned up for two different letters.
"So N became Y, and then later on, E became Y. That's unusual."
The other unusual thing you may notice is that the two E's in Numberphile have turned into two different letters.
"So here, E became Y. But the second E became W."
"Now, this is why the Germans thought they had an unbreakable code."
"Old-fashioned code in the past, pen-and-paper codes that they used to use, if you had the same letter, it would become the same letter in the code."
Enigma is different.
"Probably, each time you did it, you would get a completely different code."
"Now, if we can break this code-- and by we, I mean the"
"Polish, the British, and the Americans-- if we can break this code in World War Il, we'll be able to read those German secret messages, which is what we did."
So let me show you how this machine works.
Let me open up the machine.
So we have three things here at the top.
These things are called rotors.
"And inside those rotors, try and imagine lots of wiring."
And it's all crisscrossed wiring as well.
"Now, if I press a letter, have a look what happens."
The rotors move.
"When this rotor does a full turn, it'll kick the next rotor one place."
"And then, the right-hand rotor keeps going."
"Eventually, the middle rotor does a full turn, and it will kick the left-hand rotor one place."
"So a fast rotor, a middle rotor, and a slow rotor."
"Imagine it like it's hands on a clock, like you've got a minute hand and an hour hand and a second hand."
That's the idea.
"Brilliant machine though this is, all it is, really, is just a circuit."
Here is a battery.
"So if you take the dot product with itself, you get 1."
If you take a dot product with some other guy in your set you're going to get 0.
Maybe I can write it this way. vi dot vj for all the members of the set is going to be equal to 0 for i does not equal j.
And then if these guys are the same vector-- I'm dotting with myself-- I'm going to have length 1.
So it would equal length 1 for i is equal to j.
So I've got a special set.
All of these guys have length 1 and they're all orthogonal with each other.
They're normalized and they're all orthogonal.
And we have a special word for this.
This is called an orthonormal set.
So B is an orthonormal set.
Normal for normalized.
Everything is orthogonal.
They're all orthogonal relative to each other.
And everything has been normalized.
Everything has length 1.
"Now, the first interesting thing about an orthonormal set is that it's also going to be a linearly independent set."
"So if B is orthonormal, B is also going to be linearly independent."
And how can I show that to you?
Well let's assume that it isn't linearly independent.
"Let me take vi, let me take vj that are members of my set."
And let's assume that i does not equal j.
"Now, we already know that it's an orthonormal set."
So vi dot vj is going to be equal to 0.
They are orthogonal.
These are two vectors in my set.
"Now, let's assume that they are linearly dependent."
I want to prove that they are linearly independent and the way I'm going to prove that is by assuming they are linearly dependent and then arriving at a contradiction.
So let's assume that vi and vj are linearly dependent.
Well then that means that I can represent one of these guys as a scalar multiple the other.
And I can pick either way.
"So let's just say, for the sake of argument, that I can represent vi-- let's say that vi is equal to sum scalar c times vj."
Let's say I've got me a set of vectors.
So let me call my set B.
"And let's say I have the vectors v1, v2, all the way through vk."
Now let's say this isn't just any set of vectors.
There's some interesting things about these vectors.
The first thing is that all of these guys have length of 1.
"So we could say the length of vector vi is equal to 1 for i is equal to-- well we could say between 1 and k or i is equal to 1, 2, all the way to k."
All of these guys have length equal 1.
Or another way to say it is that the square of their
lengths are 1.
The square of a vi whose length is equal to 1.
Or vi dot vi is equal to 1 for i is any of these guys.
"Any i can be 1, 2, 3, all the way to k."
So that's the first interesting thing about it.
Let me write it in regular words.
All the vectors in B have length 1.
Or another way to say is that they've all been normalized.
That's another way to say that is that they have all been normalized.
Or they're all unit vectors.
Normalized vectors are vectors that you've made their lengths 1.
You're turned them into unit vectors.
They have all been normalized.
"So that's the first interesting thing about my set, B."
And then the next interesting thing about my set B is that all of the vectors are orthogonal to each other.
"So if you dot it with itself, if you dot a vector with itself, you get length 1."
But if you take a vector and dot it with any other vector-- if you take vi and you were to dot it with vj.
"So if you took v2 and dotted it with v1, it's going to be equal to 0 for i does not equal j."
All of these guys are orthogonal.
Let me write that down.
All of the vectors are orthogonal to each other.
And of course they're not orthogonal to themselves because they all have length 1.
"Ocean."""
And he points out there.
(Laughter)
"But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the lower 48."
It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.
"But he looked at me, and he said, ""Son"" -- he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that -- he says, ""Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat."
My responsibility is not to get you home alive.
"My responsibility is to get you home rich."""
(Laughter)
"You want to get home alive, that's on you."
"And for the rest of that day, safety first."
I was like --
"So, the idea that we create this false -- this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own, and vice versa."
"Anyhow, a whole lot of things."
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.
"But, what it all comes down to is this."
"I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds."
"It goes like this -- we've declared war on work, as a society, all of us."
It's a civil war.
"It's a cold war, really."
"We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way, but we've done it."
"And we've waged this war on at least four fronts, certainly in Hollywood."
The way we portray working people on TV -- it's laughable.
"If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds and he's got a giant butt crack."
Admit it.
You see him all the time.
"That's what plumbers look like, right?"
"We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines."
That's what TV does.
"We try hard on ""Dirty Jobs"" not to do that, which is why I do the work and I don't cheat."
"But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue."
"I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message, what's really being said?"
More ginger people.
That's why they couldn't send Prince Harry.
"They couldn't afford the resources required to start developing factor 60,000 sun block."
"It's not always the friendliest place in the world, Scotland."
I once saw an English guy in Glasgow trying to order a pint of lager and lime.
"The barman went, ""We don't do cocktails."""
"We can't just be dour, negative bastards up there."
John Logie Baird invented the TV
And when people came up to him congratulate him.
"He went, ""Ay, but there's f* all on."""
Are you looking forward to the Olympics in London?
"I'll take that as a ""no""."
They say the Olympics is going to rekindle English national pride.
"Come on, for 9.2bn you could have written ""Fuck off Germany on to the moon""."
The Spice Girls are getting back together.
The only way we're going to see Geri Halliwell draped in a Union Jack again is if she dies in battle.
I tell you what I think they should do in Big Brother.
"You know on eviction night when someone gets sent out, the people inside, instead of hearing screaming or booing or whatever, they should just hear complete silence and then a single gunshot."
"When I was at school, I could just never work out how to get girls bras undone."
"Then eventually I realised, these girls were wearing a different type of bra from my Gran."
"If you don't like that, you'll hate this next one."
The oldest woman ever to give birth gave birth this year.
She was sixty-three.
"You could imagine at sixty three, the baby didn't have to force its way out."
It spent the last three months bungy jumping.
"Everytime she went for a s*, it had to brace itself."
Like the end of the Italian Job.
"Apparently, scientists have come up with a condom for premature ejaculation."
"Basically, it's got an anaesthetic in the lining."
It makes you numb so you can lost for longer.
Or you can wear it inside out and you don't have to wake anybody up.
"Thanks, because that one can go either way."
"Okay, I'm gonna note the time here:"
7:47 is when I turned it on.
Doesn't look like it's quite ready for the egg; what I'm looking for to know when it's time to put the egg on is for the oil to sort of spread out on its own.
The induction cooktop doesn't use a lot less electricity than the radiant element; it's just that it uses it for a much shorter time.
And this is probably the best illustration of it.
"If I were using the induction cooktop, my egg would be well along its way by now."
And I'm going to put this in here and I bet it's gonna be a little cool.
"Yeah, it's a little cool for the egg right now."
"As you can see it's being . . . that's a little cooler than I would want to put an egg in, but I'm sort of out of the habit of using the radiant eye, so I forget how to judge that."
"And Amanda likes a little pepper on hers, so actually she likes a LOT of pepper on hers"
[Amanda chuckles]
And now I'm gonna wait for a second because it's got some cooking to do before we're ready to turn it.
I put the egg in too soon.
Should have waited even longer to put it in.
If I'm a real man I'll figure out how to do one of those
"""time passes"" things (Note:"
I'm no real man . . .)
"Okay it's 7:48 now, I guess, so it's been in there for . . ."
Well we'll figure that out.
We'll probably flash it on the screen how long it's been in at this point.
Note: call it 2 minutes 50 seconds so far . . .
"Whatever you do then, Honey, don't let it stop."
Just let it keep rolling.
"I'll let it cook a little bit longer before I try to turn it, because I want to see that middle area there harden up."
You're probably a little close for focus.
(Note:
She was fine . . .)
[Spatula scraping on pan]
Probably turned it sooner than I should have.
[Amanda: looks good.]
Looks good?
Okay.
"It's much richer and much more demanding, particularly when you get to fourth grade."
That's when it starts.
I'm not surprised in Sarah Lee's case that things began to unravel at third and fourth grade.
"If Sarah Lee is a bright child, she was probably able to fake her way through first and second grade."
You can fake your way through if you listen to your friends talk about the story they've read and then you use those answers when the teacher asks you the questions.
But around third or fourth grade is when you begin to deal with expressive language problems.
"In other words, the"
language is there.
I don't know it.
But it's almost locked away.
The language is inside the brain.
They have an inner language.
They know what they want to say.
And they just can't express it.
They can't get the words out.
We're going to make a paragraph that matches the picture.
"Like, sometimes when I'm in a class and my teacher, she asks us, like, what's the answer?"
And I'll raise my hand and I'll know the answer.
"But then when I say it, it won't come out the way I was thinking of it."
What about the way Homer used the gun in that episode?
What do you think that they were trying to say?
Sarah Lee.
He used it in-- he used instead-- he used the gun to-- he used the gun to shoot place instead of shooting people.
"When you think about it, you're thinking in your head, I didn't want to say that."
Did he use it for what it was really intended for?
"Sometimes it's a little embarrassing because people, they'll laugh and mumble under their breath, that's the wrong answer."
That's embarrassing.
Sara Lee masters the language of TV shows and commercials and the playground.
But she locks up when confronted by the more fully dimensional language encountered in books and in the classroom.
Experts say she has expressive
language deficiency.
She understands well but she has trouble explaining what she knows.
So this is in meters.
"0.5 meters, so that alone doesn't help us."
We have to be able to figure out the circumference of this tub in order to really be able to figure out the surface area because the circumference times this height will be the surface area.
Point two: they say the height of the tub is one meter.
So they're telling us that this is one meter.
Well that doesn't help us.
That still doesn't tell us how far around the tub goes.
If they had given us the diameter or the radius or the circumference then we could've used our basic geometry to figure out the circumference.
But they didn't.
So either way-- it's a one meter height-- both of these combined still do not allow us to figure out the surface area of this green band.
E again.
Problem 40.
What is the value of integer n?
And n as an integer.
So statement number one: they tell us that n times n plus 1 is equal to 6.
"Now we should already be able to figure this out because n is an integer, n plus 1 is an integer."
So what are the factorizations of 6?
You could have 1 times 6.
"But that doesn't fit n and n plus 1, right?"
This is n and n plus 5.
"You have 2 times 3, which work, right."
"If 2 is n, n plus 1 is 3 and they equal 6."
So let me circle that.
And then what other factorizations?
You don't have any other-- these are all of the factors 6.
"So just looking at the first statement, you know that n has to be equal to 2."
This is the only integer where this is true.
"Actually, let me take a step back."
"No, what if n is negative?"
"Because I was assuming it's a positive integer but they didn't say it's a positive integer, so let me think about that."
"If I did minus 3 times minus 2, that also equals 6 and these are both integers."
"Huh, OK, so this isn't enough."
Or I'll push them away.
It's... it's not something that right now I want to feel in my life.
"For me, it's gotta be my family."
"When you realise the reality of love not lasting, with my parents breaking up."
For me that totally shook everything I knew.
Umm.
"You know, they're the ones who are always meant to be together, that are always meant to love each other."
"It's the most painfull thing that I've ever felt, and it wasn't even me involved in the love."

"God's unconditional love, I struggle with."
"I mean, I know it's real... but I struggle to feel it."
"I guess when I've had such a mixed up view of love, that is so painful, when I know that there is an unconditional love, I just don't... it doesn't connect to me."
But I guess to me it's... it doesn't mean that it's not real at all.
I struggle to feel His love.
"I struggle to, to know."
Knowing that there's love.
Out there.
Even though I don't feel it.
Knowing that someone else does.
Knowing that it actually exists.
"Just because I fall, doesn't mean I should crawl for the rest of my life,"
I should get back up.
"And I know that one day, I'll learn to love."
And I'll learn to be loved.
"'Cause I guess for me, where there's another day, there's still hope for it to happen."
"When people have diabetes, their bodies aren't able to keep their blood sugar in balance."
So sometimes they need to take regular doses of a medicine that helps restore that balance.
People with depression have the same  kind of problem with their brain chemicals.
But regular doses of antidepressants can keep these chemicals in balance.
"As a first year intern you have very little free time, so when you finally have a night off, it's important that you do something constructive with it."
Hey man how's it goin?
Hey wait a second.
- Who are they to be judge and jury?
- No comment.
- No comment.
I'm afraid for myself.
I'm afraid for my kids.
I'm afraid to walk down the street.
"- I can't believe your saying that, that's crazy!"
- When did you turn into such a sissy?
- I think they just get off on killing people.
"- Well, I have no comment."
"I have nothing to say, thanks."
All this hubla with the media.
"You guys are making it worse, right now."
Your giving them power.
By sticking that microphone in my face your giving The Saints more power.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I really don't wanna talk about that.
You walk into some kids bedroom and they're gonna be there.
"You've got Batman, Superman and these Saints."
"Are you loosing any sleep honey, 'cause you know what, I'm certainly not."
- No comment.
- They're damn good!
"For the owner of a call option with a $50 strike price, then the payoff at expiration ... we're talking about the value of that position."
"If the stock is below $50 we wouldn't exercise it, because we can buy it for cheaper than the option that the call option is giving us."
If the stock goes above $50 we would exercise our option to buy at $50.
"Say the stock is at $60 the underline stock is at $60 on that date at the expiration date, then we would exercise our option to buy at $50 and sell at $60 and make $10."
We would essentially get this upside above $50 on the stock.
"If we think about ... this is the actual value of the position, if we want to factor in how much we paid for the option, we would shift this down by $10."
As the holder we would pay $10 for that.
It would look this this.
We would essentially ... if we don't exercise the option we loose the amount of money that was a loss that we have to pay for the option.
"Then above that we break even at $60 dollars, and then we make money above that."

"The workflow for building a metaSL shader tree in 3ds Max is a little  like building one in Mental Mill, only easier."
Here you will be creating a metaSL shader tree to apply  to this human head.
"The model is low-poly based, but will look like it has more detail  with proper mapping and metaSL shaders."
Open the Slate Material Editor.
"Ensure that 3ds Max is set up to use the Mental Ray renderer,  otherwise you won't have access to metaSL shaders."
Expand the metaSL rollout under Maps.
There you will find about  a dozen shaders ready for use.
"You typically start with an illumination Phong shader, which provides  the basis for the metaSL tree."
"To start populating the tree, you drag in other metaSL shaders  and wire them to the proper channels."
The Texture Lookup 2d shader is useful for defining bitmaps as textures.
Start by defining a Diffuse texture; use the Head-diffuse.jpg bitmap  and wire it to the Diffuse Color channel.
Use a Normals Bumpmap shader in the Normal channel.
Use the image file:
Head-normal.jpg.
Add another Texture Lookup 2d shader and use the file Head-specular.jpg  and wire it to the Specular Color channel.
"At this time, notice that if you tried to apply the Phong illumination  node to the object in the scene, it doesn't work."
"You first need to convert the Phong illumination node into  a single-output ""material""."
"Luckily, you can use the Map to Material Conversion node to that end."
Now you can apply the shader tree to the object in the scene.
"Now, let me first give you a"
little bit of a metaphor and then come back to how this really works in space-time.
Supposing you're just looking at an xy-coordinate system and you have two points in a two-dimensional space.
"So, here's a point and here's a point."
"Now, if you arrange for some kind of coordinate system--here's a coordinate system."
"This is x, this is y--and you ask how far apart these points are."
"Well, you can do that--let's see."
"They're separated in x by this amount here, which we'll call delta [Δ] x."
"And they're separated in y by this amount here, and that's Δ y."
"But of course, those quantities depend on the orientation of your coordinate system."
"If I now take this coordinate system and I shift it like this, now it's going to be totally different."
"Now I'm going to have x look like this and I'm going to have y, Δ y look like that."
So Δ y has gotten a whole lot smaller.
Δ x has gotten a whole lot bigger.
And all I did was twist the coordinate system.
Yeah?
Student:
[Inaudible.]
Professor Charles Bailyn:
"You still get the same distance, thank you very much, that's exactly right."
The distance is the invariant.
"The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate, those vary with the coordinate system, but the distance is the same."
That's exactly the point.
"And so, the quantity--let me summarize this."
"For points on a 2-D space, Δ x varies."
Δ y varies.
"But there is a quantity that is invariant and that is--well, let's call it (Δ x^(2)) + (Δ y^(2)), which is the distance squared, (Δ D^(2))."
And this is invariant.
"It doesn't matter which way you twist things around, that will--that quantity will remain the same."
"So, now, imagine that you've got events in space-time."
So an event in space-time has three spatial coordinates and one time coordinate.
"So, it's basically a point in a four-dimensional space."
It is then put on the book.

Pictorial Webster's.
Have you ever taken a low-floor bus ?
"Some people will say, ""Yes,"" but other people will say."
"""No."" A few months ago, my grandmother and I took a low-floor bus to go to the library."
Riding a low-floor bus was the first time for me.
My grandmother usually takes a low-floor bus because she has problems with her knees.
It is difficult for her to get on a bus with steps.
"When I was on the low-floor bus, some old people came onto the bus."
"There were no steps on the bus, so they could get on the bus easily."
I thought that the low-floor bus was designed very well for old people.
"Two weeks later, in class, we had a chance to think about life in our city."
"Our teacher said to us, ""In our city, there are many good projects."
These projects make our life better.
"Now I want you to talk about some of the projects."" Then we started talking about them in groups."
"In my group, we talked about the low-floor bus."
"I said, ""The low-floor bus is designed well for old people."""
Everyone in my group looked interested in the low-floor bus.
"One student said, ""I didn't notice that the low-floor bus was so useful for old people."
There are many old people in our city.
"We should have more low-floor buses for them."" Then another student said, ""I don't think the low-floor bus was designed only for old people."
We should get more information about the low-floor bus.
"Lets go to City Hall after school. """
"At City Hall, we talked to a man there and asked him questions about the low-floor bus."
"He said to us, ""The low-floor bus is not only for old people."
"And of course it's heating up as all of this is happening, so my egg, my scrambled egg's gonna cook a lot faster than Amanda's is."
"Since we're using this anyway, I'm going to go ahead and set the warming zone (which we don't have with the induction cooktop)."
"You need to back up 'cause it won't, yeah,"
"What I just did is to set the warming zone, which is this little thing right here, which will keep Amanda's egg warm while I cook mine."
That's one of those conveniences we're about to give up.
Okay.
"Now Amanda's egg is done, and here's mine already mixed up."
[sound of sizzling oil in pan]
That's more like the temperature you'd want to have.
You can hear it bubbling and sizzling.
Note:
4 minutes 46 seconds so far . . .
This one's gonna cook nice and fast.
It's had time to warm up now.
Now it won't be long before I'll be able to turn this off.
So we'll figure that out.
"Probably after I flip it one time, we'll be able to turn the radiant element off, knowing that the rest of it will cook by itself okay."
"Yeah, I think I feel safe now to go ahead and turn it back off."
Note:
Power off at 6 minutes 16 seconds.
"So whatever time I just turned it off, that's the time elapsed for that radiant element."
Then we'll just let that sit in the pan and finish cooking.
And then the next time we do this we'll use the induction cooktop.
"A equals 1, b equals 5 and c equals 6."
Since we should have ax squared plus bx plus c.
"Equals 0, of course."
"Do you remember that pink dress I bought, with green flowers?"
"Well, last week I wore it at work and everyone went"
"""Alex, it's gorgeous, you look beautiful in it!"" and all"
"Brigitte was green with envy, you see."
"The day after, she comes to work with the same dress!"
That bitch!
Ever since I was little
It looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
"Now, mostly we're looking for correct code."
"If you wrote some more tests, you may start to have some more confidence in the code that we have."
We're also considering efficiency to some degree.
It seems like there's a big problem with the efficiency of the program we have so far.
Let me show you one of the issues.
"Now we represented states as a (here, there, t) triplet."
"The problem with this is there can be two states that have identical here and there's but differ in the t, and they're going to be considered different states."
Why is that a problem?
Consider this problem.
"We have two people--one who takes 1 unit to cross the bridge, and one who takes 1000."
It seems pretty clear there is an easy solution.
The two of them go across together.
"It takes 1000, but look how we're going to explore this space."
"We're going to start out in the initial state that took time 0, and then we're going to start adding things to the frontier."
"Out of all the ways we could cross, the one that adds the least is for the 1 to go across by himself."
Now he's on the other side with the 1 on the other side and the 1000 on the original side.
That only took 1 step.
Now what's the fastest thing we can do after that?
We could take 1 more step and go back to the original state.
Here we had 1 and we'll call K for the 1000 on the left-hand side.
Here K was left behind and 1 went over to the right.
"Here we took one more time unit, and we had 1, K on this side."
"If we continue taking the fastest step we can, we'll get to another distinct state where K is on this side and 1 is on the other side."
The flashlight is always going with the 1.
"It's part of your job to convince yourself that you feel comfortable with it, and."
The blue dots are the only things you save.
"Now, let's take a look at this when we scale it."
"Cuz, nobody's going to solve this thing on a for, fiv, four by four domain."
"Right, I mean, you're going to need a lot more points."
"You might say, I'm going to chop up my X domain into a 100 points."
"And then you spy that thing and, boom, this things huge, 10,000 by 10,000 matrix."
Okay so this is kinda what we're looking at.
We're going to be working with that matrix.
Now you see how white that is?
That's cuz there's all zeros there.
You don't want to save all that.
You know how many components you'd have to save?
"10,000 by 10,000."
"I'll let you do the math, in your head."
"Right, this is huge."
"Ten to the five squared if you want to save this in memory, you gotta eat up all that memory to save a bunch of zeros."
Spdiags changes your game.
Bring you up a level because now you can do this thing with sparse extinct.
"Now, one last thing I want to do."
"Let's go back down to five, and we're not on these five, we're going to say, hey, what's the determinant of that matrix?"
"Huh, that's not zero."
Ten to the seventeen.
If you see a number like this.
That's bad okay.
So the condition number is the measure you want to look for cuz that determiner actually said oh by the time I was three that's not done yet that's pretty far away from zero all things considered.
The problem really comes if you look at the condition number.
"Anything you're like when you start gaining ten of five, ten of six you're kind of like ooo that's looking singular."
Ten of seventeen says dude I am totally singular.
"To you,"
That's the interpretation of that.
"Okay, If I, wrote mat lab, I would have a"
"I say, good luck to you, if that's the route you decide to go on."
"But, honestly folks, at the end of the day, just having the God-given talent, a pen and a piece of paper to draw on is really all you need to become an artist."
"Develop your skills early, be passionate and diligent in your work and you, at that point, will be well on your way to becoming an artist."
It doesn't matter what type of artist at that point.
"You, my friend are definitely an artist."
So no one told you life was going to be this way.
"Your job's a joke, you're broke, you're love life's DOA."
"It's like you're always stuck in second gear,"
"Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year."
"But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
I'll be there for you cause you're there for me too.
"You're still in bed at ten, the work began at eight."
"You've burned your breakfast, so far, things are going great."
"Your mother warned you there'd be days like these,"
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought down to your knees.
"That, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
"I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too."
"No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me."
Seems like you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me.
"Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with,"
"Someone I'll always laugh with even at my worst, I'm best with you."
"It's like you're always stuck in second gear,"
"Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year."
"But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
"I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too."
Subtitled by- Asli Babat
- He used to memorize 2-4 pages a day..
"- but in the last portion of the Quran, he started memorizing.."
- .. 8pages a day!
-Masha'Allah
- and obviously he doesn't leave this institute?  - yes ofcourse.
"MashAllah Tabarak AlRahaman, Who encouraged him to memorize the Quran?"
"- No one encouraged him, he had personal desire to memorize the Quran."
"-MashAllah, as we know the one who memorizes the Quran must always be reviewing what he has memorized."
- How many pages does he review a day?
- He reviews 4 Chapters a day!
-MashAllah!
I ask Allah to bless him.
Chechnya
I have a small request..
Now that you have planned to memorize the Quran and started working on it...
Make sure you Do not Despair!
I know with this great Quran journey.. you will be facing many hardship and obstacles..
These obstacles should never let you stop what you are doing
"It should not let you say ""that's it.."
"Im going to stop memorizing the Quran"""
I have honestly met many people who have memorized upto 3 chapters and as soon as they faced a small obstacle.. they decided to stop memorizing the Quran!
Trust me when I say:
This is indeed from the Shaytaan.
"the honey, we know its sweet but we also know it was produced by the sharp needle on the bee! and just like the Quran, it is so great!"
Believe me..
"I have met many disabled people, they face so much hardship while memorizing the Quran but.."
They knew the great blessings behind memorizing the Quran.. so they did complete Memorizing the Quran with all these hardships and obstacles that you don't even face or will face [Since you are in good health] and if you have sincerely focused on this..Allah will ease every step you take because you want to memorize the book of Allah
Allah says:
"""And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways."""
Allah will make it easy way for you but make sure you do not despair!
The Old Grozny Institute - Chechnya
We had an ultimate visit to one the special institute here in Russia
On my left hand I had an old tape recorder.
"In it, Jimmy hendrix played his e-guitar against the Vietnam war."
Then she wanted me to imrpovise with my voice.
She wanted me to see pictures from wars with my inner eye.
She wanted me to apologise for mankind.
It goes like this.
In my hand I was holding a gong and I hit it during singing.
In the end a long broad red cloth came down.
"When Ahmed brought the myrrh to Germany, the next steps are the following."
These lumps are of no use in this way.
In a plant in Hamburg these are destilled to take out the essence from it.
"We can easily imitate that, because we don't need it super-clean."
"I put some of the myrrh into this fountain, turn it on, and the essence is generated."
This product is made in Taiwan.
"And it reminds me of my homeland, because the rocks in our landscapes look similar."
"And the sound from the water is really convenient, because in the hot summer, you only want to flee to the mountains to cool down."
The most beautiful in Taiwan is the east coast at the Pacific.
"When you have time, go there, make a biking tour."
"It is very nice, noone around, you hear the waves."
Myrrh gets credited with the power to balance body and soul.
I wanted to try and answer some questions with this project.
The first was: what are the difficulties with the product myrrh?
"I did my last performance together with a japaneese DJ, Hito, and a composer from Hongkong, Kimho."
It was about things that only we understand.
My second question was:
"When a person grows up away from his homeland, and later goes back there, how is this?"
"Hito dee-yays with her orange kimono, Berlin-style minimal."
Forth question:
"When I work with Somalis as a German, what should I know?"
"I danced a taiwaneese dance hit, that everybody dances there."
"Primary school children, housewives, workers at the chinese new year party,"
Even the gods with their big masks dance it at festivals on the streets.
-Get out of the dryer.
[laughter continues]
"-You know, when I wash my bitches, I make sure to dry them on medium heat."
"And I always make sure to throw in a dryer sheet,"
"'cause, you know, you don't want your bitches to get too clingy."
Why was that chick in the dryer anyway?
Was this a dare of some sort?
"Either way, this got about 100,000 views in over a month."
"If you notice when they pull her out, it looks like the dryer is giving birth to Snooki."
"And props to the guy who uploaded this footage, because you know, when your friend gets stuck in the dryer, your immediate reaction should be to be to pull out your cell phone and film it,"
'cause that's what friends are for.
I also noticed that one dude took full advantage of the situation and was like touching her ass.
"Now, I'm not condoning that, I'm just saying it happened."
"You know, I'd say this video deserves more than 100,000 views."
As long as you aren't watching it like...
"""Oh, s--t."
"That looks like a good idea."""
"Yeah, stay out of the dryer guys."
"Your dirty ass will leave all kinds of s--t in the lint trays. all right, this last video, I didn't want to cover it, 'cause it's kind of dumb, but admittedly, it's got over 8,000,000 views in four days."
Geezus.
"And I don't know why, but maybe you'll think it's funny."
"So there's this Chicago news show, and they're trying to get the destruction of this bridge live on film for their show."
"So they're live and they wait and they wait and they wait and they wait but the bridge doesn't blow up, so they cut away for a second."
-When we did the live remote of the guy dressed as a taco parachuting out of a plane into the plastic pool of salsa.
"-While we're stalling, go ahead and show the picture, but today, as we get going..."
-Are you kidding me?
Who did that?
-Wow!
-Are you kidding?
"-Yeah, they missed it."
"Yeah, fayul."
"See that's my new thing, it's not my new thing."
"Next, position yourself behind her."
It's not the time yet.
(Queen Mother) It's not time yet.
It's not the time yet.
It's not the time yet.
You can get a son only by finish together.
It's not the time yet.
You can get a son only by finish together.
(Queen Mother) You can get a son only by finish together.
You can get a son only by finish together.
You can get a son only by finish together.
"It is time to head to the bed chamber, now."
"You Majesty, if the Queen Mother finds out about this ..."
What has happened?
I couldn't even ask because of the leery mood in the royal kitchen.
I don't know why but every one's avoiding me.
"No matter what, we need to find the head chef."
Your Highness.
Do you know something?
Tell me.
It's just ... if she isn't dead...
I once heard when eunuchs were talking of a place ...
"From the basement corridor of the main building, past the  workers area, there is a passage to a lower floor entrance"
The place has no daylight and dust snows down all day ...
"There are people who study psychology,whoever studies  Pirkei Avot in depth understands the depths of a person's soul on an amazing level."
There is a lecture series on the Hidabroot website about Pirkei Avot and people tell me how much  it benefits them when they study the wisdom of Chazal in  Pirkei Avot.
In general you know that Torah study enhances your knowledge.
"If a person goes to a lecture for a few months,he feels a change."
"In fact it says abut our Torah that if you ""turn it and turn it you'll find everything in it"" Just like a box that has all kinds of objects in it,if you turn it you'll find everything in it."
Same for the Torah.Whatever you  want you can find.
"For example,when a person learns  Pirkei Avot it's as if he took a course in psychology.He learns""He who is rich is happy with his lot"""
"""He who is mighty,conquers his evil inclination"""
We have a lot of crowding issues.
"That's kind of the major issue, right?"
"Because you can see that our titin, which is in green, is really not allowing any space."
"Or there is no space, really."
"And so, these ends, remember these are our z-discs right here."
This is Z and this is Z over here.
Our z-discs are right up against our myosin.
"In fact, there's almost no space in here."
This is all crowded on both sides.
There's no space for the myosins to actually pull the z-disc any closer.
"So because there's no space for them to work, they really can't work."
"And really, if you give them ATP and say, go to work."
"They're going to turn around and say, well, we've got no work to do, because the z-disc is already here."
"So in terms of force of contraction for this scenario one, I would say, you're going to get almost no contraction."
"So when the length is very low, so let's say this is low."
Maybe low is not a good word for length.
"Let's say this is, I'll use the word short."
The sarcomere is short.
And here the sarcomere is long.
"So when it's short, meaning this distance is actually very short, then we would say the amount of tension is going to be actually zero."
Because you really can't get any tension started unless you have a little bit of space between the z-disc and the myosin.
"So now in scenario two, let's say this is scenario two."
And this is my one circle over here.
"In scenario two, what happens?"
"Well, here you have a little bit more space, right?"
So let's draw that.
Let's draw a little bit more space.
Let's say you've got something like that.
"And I'm going to draw the other actin on this side, kind of equally long, of course."
I didn't draw that correctly.
"Because if it's sliding out, you're going to have an extra bit of actin, right?"
Something like that.
"First, he promoted people based on merit, rather than family position, and, second, he brought lower classes of conquered people into his own tribe, while dispossessing the leaders of the conquered clans."
Thus he made peasants love him.
"The rich hated him, but they didn't matter anymore, because they were no longer rich."
"With these two building block policies,"
"Temujin was able to win the loyalty of more and more people and, in 1206, he was declared the Great Khan, the leader of all the Mongols."
How?
"Well, the Mongols chose their rulers in a really cool way."
"A prospective ruler would call a general council, called a kuriltai, and anyone who supported his candidacy for leadership would show up on their horses,"
literally voting with their feet.
Child John:
Mr. Green!
Mr. Green!
But horses don't have feet; they have hooves.
John:
"I hate you, Me From The Past."
"ALSO, NO INTERRUPTlNG THE THOUGHT BUBBLE!"
"After uniting the Mongols, Genghis Khan went on to conquer a lot of territory."
"By the time he died, in his sleep, in 1227, his empire stretched from the Mongol homeland, in Mongolia, all the way to the Caspian Sea."
"Thanks, Thought Bubble."
"So that's a pretty good looking empire and, sure, a lot of it was pasture, or mountains, or desert, but the Mongols did conquer a lot of people, too."
"And, in some ways, with Genghis' death, the empire was just getting started."
"His son, Ögödei Khan, expanded the empire even more, and Genghis' grandson, Möngke, was the Great Khan in 1258 when Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Empire, fell to the Mongols."
"And, another of Genghis' grandsons, Kublai Khan, conquered the Song Dynasty, in China, in 1279."
"And, if the Mamluks hadn't stopped another of Genghis' grandsons, at the battle of Ain Jalut, they probably would have taken all of North Africa."
"Man, Genghis Khan sure had a lot of grandkids."
"Well, it must be time for the open letter."
(gentle electronic harp music playing)
An open letter to Genghis Khan's descendants.
"Oh, but, first, let's check what's in the secret compartment today."
(gentle electronic harp music playing)
"Oh, a noisemaker and champagne poppers."
"Stan, you know I suck at these."
So that's choice D.
"The hard part here, as far as I'm concerned, is just understanding the problem and their diagram."
And then just seeing the pattern that you're just switching the letters.
First you switch the left and the middle letter.
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.
Then you switch the left and the middle letter.
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.
"Until you get back to A, B, C."
Next problem.
White I don't think is colorful enough.
Let me do magenta.

In a set of 11 different numbers-- they're different- which of the following cannot affect the value of the median?
"So it's a set of 11 different numbers, they're different, so let's say it's 1 through 11."
That's 11 different numbers.
"And in this case, what's the median?"
"Well we have 5 on this side, 5-- the median is this, this is the middle number, right?"
6 is the middle number.
"Doubling each number-- well, if you double every number, the median's going to become 12, so that's not right."
"Increasing each number by 10-- once again, if you increase all of these numbers by 10, this number's going to be 16, so you would've changed the median."
Increasing the smallest number only.
"Well, what if you increase the smallest number to,"
"I don't know, 12?"
So then this 12 would go all the way on the other side right?
And then the median would move to 7 because you would have to have 5 below the median and 5 above the median.
So you can increase that smallest number.
"But if you increase it by a large enough amount, it kind of goes into the greater than the median column and then the median would have to shift to the right."
"Try it out, write out the list from 2 to 12, and then the median becomes 7."
"OK, so we know that choice B is not right."
"Choice C, increasing-- oh no, that was choice C-- choice D, decreasing the largest number only-- well, the same argument can apply."
"We could take the 11 and decrease it down to,"
"I don't know, decrease it to 0."
We need to start the education of children now about it.
To prevent the seeds of  bullying from ever being planted.
I realize that this is no easy task.
"But the more effort we make, the  greater our impact will be."
We can do it!
"The next time you see someone put down or picked on, don't remain silent."
Speak up.
Take action.
Help them.
"If we come together, we  can put an end to bullying."
That is my dream.
[applause]
Thank you all so very much.
Have a wonderful evening.
"I'm an ecologist, mostly a coral reef ecologist."
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight.
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years.
"I mean, somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet."
And that was what I did.
"And I ended up in Jamaica, in the West Indies, where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary, structurally, that I ever saw in my life."
"And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things:"
"First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white."
"The other thing it shows you is that, although there's this beautiful forest of coral, there are no fish in that picture."
"Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years."
We were the best and the brightest.
"People came to study our reefs from Australia, which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs."
"And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be, was based on these reefs without any fish."
"Then, in 1980, there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen."
I put half the lab up in my house.
The wind blew very strong.
The waves were 25 to 50 feet high.
"And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed, and we thought, ""Well, we're real smart."
"I'll send him another bucket of Yemeni almonds, he loves Yemeni almonds."
"If you look at all these guys, they're just ordinary people who have good days, bad days, successes, failures, setbacks, everything."
Where they differed is in the fear department.
That's where they differed.
They did not allow the possibility of failure to stop them from trying again and again and again.
We have seen J.K.Rowling.
Twelve times.
That's the key.
"That's the key, right there."
"See, as long as you're still trying, as long as you are still in the game, the game hasn't ended."
You are still working on it.
You haven't failed.
"You fail when you throw in the towel, when you give up."
"And then, you are the one who has announced that failure."
Nobody else has done it.
"You are the one who announced failure, yourself."
"In the mid 1970s, when I was in my 20s,"
"- it's kind of difficult to believe I was ever in my 20s - but, yeah that did happen sometimes in the last century."
I was in Abu Dhabi trying to build my life.
"I had to sleep in the beach, not because I love beaches, but because I was thrown out of my home by the landlord."
"We were 8 guys of us staying in one room, one day, the landlord came  and threw us out."
He found another tenant who paid him more.
So what do I do?
"Well, you do what you have to do."
I went to sleep in the beach.
"In fact, my morning shower was in the mosque nearby, which helped me discover gold, and that's a different story."
It took many years to happen.
"At that time, I was about 21, 22 looking at myself."
I was looking at a failure.
"I mean, how do you actually build your life when you have no roof in an expensive city like Abudhabi at the age of 20-22?"
"Many years later, it occurred to me that what I was looking at is not failure."
"I was looking at the building blocks of character that will make you one day appreciate, strive and if ever you succeed, realize that you succeeded."

"Katrina is not my girlfriend, alright?"
And I doubt she gave you the stinkeye!
That's just the way her face looks.
"You know, that's just her face!"
I don't know if I'm even ready to be a father.
"Hey, you big puffy version of junebug!"
Where have you been?
What's up?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level.
You need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever!
The best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are!
Your parents are probably wondering where you are.
No...I mean I'm already pregnant.
So what other kind of shenanigans can I get into?
"The answer is reject, and you can see it easily from the data shown here."
79.74 is the mean.
This is the 95% confidence interval--less than a kilogram.
"The reason why it's so small is because we have so many data samples, really interesting."
"As a result, we don't even come close to 73."
"So, if all the guesses that you guys voiced online were actual measurements using the actual scale of Sebastian, and this is what I told you and the question really was H0."
Is Sebastian telling the truth or is he lying?
"The, using statistical techniques, you should conclude he's lying."
This is somewhat contrived.
"This is the only data point, and everything else is just guesses."
But I hope you had fun using actual data that you students derived in answering this question.
The pupil asked:
"""To dissolve in Being or to dissolve in Non-Being - isn't this the same?"""
And the teacher said:
"""I DON'T KNOW!"""
To the pupil's birthday party some guests have come the guests were his classmates: two girls and three boys
"The food was: three pieces of bisсuit cake and 7 bottles of ""BAlKAL"" mineral water"
"One girl eat two pieces of the biscuit cake and drank 1.5 bottle of w.ww.... ater ""BAlKAL"" and... biloowwwssss...... and drank 1.5 bottles of BAlKAL water and on of the three boys drank, on bet, all the rest of the water and told that HE COULD HAVE DRUNK EVEN MORE!"
I've seen Nathan's self confidence grow in the last four or five months.
And so
I feel like even the mistakes that we've made have somehow turned toward building his character.
And he's learned a lot.
I'd say just don't worry about what other people think.
"And if you feel bad about yourself, just try to make yourself feel important and do something."
And be proud of it no matter what.
But Nathan's parents know better than to invest too much hope just yet.
They know that kids like Nathan often have good starts in new environments.
Later this spring they'll know more about whether they have finally found an answer for their boy.
Now back to Adam Dunning's story.
He's out of the psychiatric ward.
But now Adam's parents have come to this courthouse.
Their son is on trial for breaking and entering.
He's been given a court appointed lawyer.
"His parents are told that if he's found guilty, their boy will be in the custody of the state until he's an adult."
The prosecution makes its case.
I saw a glimpse of his face and I saw the outline of his face.
"And I said, oh, that's Adam."
Shouldn't he be in school and--
It doesn't take the jury long to render it's verdict.
We find the defendant guilty.
"As they say goodbye to their son, Jane Dunning comes to grips with a harsh new reality."
Adam's birthday is four days from today.
And I didn't expect to have to ask somebody else permission to bring a birthday cake.
"Four days later, it's Adam's 16th birthday, celebrated in jail."
"But as terrible as it is to visit him here, Adam's parents are in for a surprise."
When the sunset looks for the moon--
Their son is finally in an educational environment that seems to suit him.
"The classes are small and because so many of these kids have learning problems, the teachers here have found a way to get through to them."
Mercury has a rock cross made of the same kind of rock found on earth.
Beneath the crust it is thicker mantle layer of the same material.
"The Engie is set up, all right?"
Don't worry about the Engie.
Machine learning for wed developers or
"Machine learning and You or something along those lines so I note everyone is here, ready to go."
"So yeah, I kind of made this talk as more of an introductory kind of thing."
I suspect if you understood everything in the last talk.
This might bore you.
Mostly because we are not going into numpy and scipy. that kind of stuff.
For the demo we are going to do I want to make sure you don't have to have your FORTRAN compiler set and everything.
We are doing just an overview. meant for web developers who have heard about this kind of stuff and read hacker news regularly and don't see how they can apply it to web applications and that kind of stuff.
"You should know python and data structures, that kind of stuff."
If you are in applied math and a PHD you might find this kind of boring.
"Hopefully we can get into some cool applications of machine learnng and we will be building somthing together, kind of fun."
"If you are following along on you laptop, for the material today all you need is"
"I wrote some set up scripts that will create a virtual environment, get you all the packages and stuff."
Let me break out of this real quick and get you started.
"So if you are on a mac and you can do HomeBrew, do brew install. you can do C compile and C sees it ."
The Natural Language ToolKit is in today and it requires that.
"If you are on Ubuntu, you need the development headers."
Clone the repository at mygethub. cd setup.
There are some shell scripts there.
"If you are on windows, I didn't write anything for you, sorry."
NLTK is a little weird with intstallations.
So let me know if there is a problem with that. so boot strap. download some stuff and you should get some fun stuff.
"Oh yes, Absolutely."
You want ... the font.
"Okay, Sorry I am a little mis set."
Where am I going?
Okay.
Can everyone see yet?
Bigger ? yeah.
Yeah the pail chart what did it fail on?
I'll test you on the final to see whether you really understood that.
So now the sound is 4 times larger than when I cover one up.
I'll cover the other one up.
It's down by a factor of 4.
[tone]
I can cover this one up and then you hear nothing of course.
[tone]
"Now I will move this one [tone] to the location [tone] where there is destructive interference, [tone] which should be about half of 15.6 centimeters."
[tone]
Maybe you have good ears but I hear nothing anymore.
"Now I go through it and find the maximum, which is about 15.6 centimeters."
[tone]
Here it is.
[tone]
"And the other side, [tone] here's the maximum at center, so here should be a minimum, there it is, and I go to the other side, there should be a maximum."
[tone]
And there it is.
[tone]
"So what I have shown you today is I've shown you the interference pattern of sound, of water, of red laser light, of radar, and at the very least I hope I've convinced you as"
Young convinced the world in 1801 that light are waves.
And that means that Huygens was right and Newton was wrong.
Now that should perhaps not surprise you because Huygens was Dutch.
"But now, just to show you how complicated these learning problems can be, here's a story that is the flip side of Lauren's."
"Across the country in New York City there is a young girl whose social success has been masking a painful learning problem, a problem that because it exists in the inner city, might have been written off as something other than the neurological disconnect that it really is."
11-year-old Sara Lee Harris has always had lots of friends.
"Some of my friends are Amber, Roshida, Shana, Akima, Kimmy."
Sarah Lee is the youngest of four children.
"Her mom has one simple goal for her children, a good solid education."
My oldest daughter when she graduated from high school she went to Queensborough
College.
My son graduated from high school.
The twins graduate this year.
And now I can't get -- I can't shake the metaphor.
"OK, I'm still in ""Poetics,"" in Aristotle, and I'm thinking -- out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head that I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there."
And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.
"Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis."
"It's what our network does; it's what ""Dirty Jobs"" is."
And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.
Great.
"The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know --"
"Euripides and Sophocles -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother."
OK.
That's peripety or peripeteia.
And this metaphor in my head --
I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.
(Laughter)
"I got to tell you, it's such a great device though."
"When you start to look for peripetia, you find it everywhere."
"I mean, Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense,"" right?"
"Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people, and then, boom -- ""Oh, I'm dead"" -- peripetia."
You know?
It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.
"Neo in ""The Matrix,"" you know?"
"""Oh, I'm living in a computer program"" -- that's weird."
"These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations; and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time, but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for."
"And, as I stood there,"
looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled -- but it looked OK.
"Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?"
"Because, look, I'm not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is."
And I talk to him.
(Laughter)
"And he says, ""Hey Mike."
"Standard adult size is going to be a 22 gauge, 1 to 1 and a 1/2 inch length, 22-23 gauge for intramuscular."
It's going to be a smaller gauge and a shorter length for small children.
You might have a 3/8 inch for an infant perhaps instead of 1/2 inch.
"I have a very small set of 1 inch or 1 and a 1/2, its going to be very short; 1/2 inch, 3/8, something like that."
Ok so select the appropriate size needle and syringe.
[ Pause ]
I'm going to clean the top of my medication bottle.
"I've done my 5 rights, I've done my 3 label checks to make sure I have the right medication."
[ Pause ]
I'm going to put the amount of air that I need to pull back the same amount of volume of medication to displace my volume and my... [ Pause ]
...ampule; my vial.
Get rid of the bubbles.
[ Pause ]
Drop your medication.
"Again, this is sterile."
I'm going to need to carefully recap it.
Alright so now I go into my patient's room and I position my patient in the appropriate spot so that I can administer the injection.
"For this particular medication, I want to use the ventrogluteal muscle."
Remember that's the most recommended in the literature to use for your injections.
So our anatomical landmarks with the heel of your hand.
I'm using my opposite hand to the patient's hip so this is their right hip and my left hand.
"I find the head of the femur and then with my index finger,"
I find the anterior superior spine.
I move my middle finger along the crest to open it.
Open my hand.
Alright.
This is the pelvis here and this is bone.
"This is a little tight as I walk my finger down, I can see that it has a lot of give there and this would be the sweet spot of the muscle; the give of the muscle."
I'm going to use my new alcohol.
Make a nice big circular cleaning out.
Ok.
Now I have to keep my hand on the anatomical landmarks because it's a very small injection site so I can't take my hand away.
"So we shipped our 0.7, and I think it was when we got to 0.8 with Firefox which it would have been on May or June of 2004, that we finally understood we had a chance."
Like a real chance.
Because 0.8 of Firefox was far enough along that people started noticing it.
And the number of people using Firefox started to grow.
Pretty soon there were more people using Firefox 8 than had ever used the Mozilla suite.
"Something like a million, or two or three million."
And the other way that I knew that we were on the right track was Tim O'Reilly called us up.
I mean I know Tim forever because I've been in the open source world for a number of years but this time he called up to say
"""Hey, we're hearing a lot about Firefox."
"Can we come down and talk to you?"""
"Tim O'Reilly's greater skill is he has a phenomenal nose for what's new, what's coming and what technology is gonna be interesting."
So there were a lot of clues.
"Then, the summer of 2004 was a long summer."
"Because in between 0.9 and 1.0 was five or six months, that's when the extension system was built and I think I've been the most nervous I've ever been in that phase."
I remember speaking and I could not...
"I was on a panel but I walked across the stage constantly,"
"I was sick to my stomach because we knew this was our big bet, we could see the stuff was happening but there was that pressure that you have to ship the product."
"So the final phases of Firefox, getting the first version out, were the start page and we..."
Before Firefox the start page had been a typical open source project:
"""Hi!"
Wanna help?
Here is Bugzilla.
Don't like Bugzilla?
Here's Despot.
You don't like that?
"Here's the link for Tinderbox."""
So when we made the commitment to ship a consumer product we realised that doesn't help most people.
[Question]
"Unlike Bugzilla, which is smooth and lovely..."
"That shows you our standards, right?"
"So this was again an immense emotional intense, like knocked-down drag-out fight."
What to do?
And so there's a couple of ways we can think about it.
"If this leg is supporting 35 Newtons and we have a total weight here of 120 Newtons, our total weight, the weight at the top of the table plus the bookshelf, that's 120 Newtons."
So the balance of this must be supported by something or someone.
So the balance of this is going to be supported by this leg.
So it's 120 minus 35 is what?
[PHONE RlNGS]
"Oh, my phone is ringing."
120 minus 35 is what?
120 minus 30 is 90.
And then 90 minus 5 is 85 Newtons.
It's so disconcerting when my phone rings.
I have trouble focusing.
"Anyway, it's probably because my phone sounds"
like a freight train.
"Anyway, so there you go."
"This type of problem is actually key to, as you can imagine, bridge builders, or furniture manufacturers, or civil engineers who are bridge builders, or architects, because you actually have to figure out, well, if I design something a certain way, I have to figure out how much weight each of the supporting structures will have to support."
"And as you can imagine, why is this one supporting more weight?"
Why is this leg supporting more weight than that leg?
"Well, because this book, which is 100 Newtons, which is a significant amount of the total weight, is much closer to this leg than it is to this leg."
"If we put it to the center, they would balance, and then if we push it further to the right, then this leg would start bearing more of the weight."
"Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting, and hopefully, I didn't confuse you."
And I will see you in future videos.
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously.
"The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri."
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
"To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree."
"Just then, with a loud bang, the heavens opened."
(Claps)
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
"Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri."
Ah-hah.
"Nadim: "" I want my dreams to come true, and I want to express what's inside of me without any fear """
Cherbel You are also one the biggest Lady Gaga fan ?
"In her new album Born This Way she said, Even if you were Lebanese, accept yourself """
Cherbel:
"""No, definitely not, She said accept yourself from where ever you were from """

How did you get this message ?
"Nijad: "" That Lady Gaga doesn't care about Lebanon, and she's too arrogant """
"Nijad: "" And for me, she's not even a Lady, She's a cheap copy from Lady Madonna """
"Monsters, Do you accept this ?"
"Little Monsters: "" definitely not ! """
"Who else understood this message ? "" That Lebanon has a lower level than her, that's I what I understood """
About all of the things she said about being Lebanese..

"Rachael: "" First of all, she didn'ttake Judas, as the person !"
"It was a symbol of betrayal """
"Rachael: "" She said that Judas is the demon I cling to, but Jesus is my virtue """
"Nadim How you view Gaga's songs, that a lot of people think it's Infringement on the Religions ?"
"Nadim: "" I accept it with open mind, and I'm from the same religion she's talking about """
"Nadim: "" I do my researches, and if there was something wrong, I won't change my thoughts for that """

And this is why chocolate  is associated with longevity.
"If you recall, there was a great book written years ago, which we're gonna look at"
"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."""
"And the Oompa Loompa's had brilliant pearly white strong teeth, because chocolate is great for your teeth."
Chocolate toothpaste is coming.
"This is what the cacao bean looks like  when you break it open, when you break it  into the different pieces."
"And those are called nibs, and these products are available  here in Finland now."
And all over the world.
Raw chocolate products --  in fact this industry is now over a hundred million dollar industry.
And it all came from one moment when I bit into raw cacao bean.
"And for the last 8.5 years,"
I've been proselytizing  about the power of chocolate all over the place.
In fact it never stops.
Some people complain about that.
"Anyway, iconically chocolate is associated with wonder and magic."
"And if you see that giant head back there, that's an Olmec head."
They're the ones who originated the word cacao.
"And you can see the bird in this image as well, indicating that connection between birds  in that realm and chocolate."
"Chocolate, as I discovered when I was studying in Oaxaca Mexico, is added to guacamole, but not process chocolate, raw chocolate."
They take the crushed up nibs  and they put it in their guacamole.
Try it at home.
"I was fortunate I grew up in California with Mexican people, and I was in love with guacamole  from an early time."
What an amazing thing  to have your cuisine expanded.
And that's what we're doing with chocolate.
"I got so into chocolate, I started growing chocolate."
This is my chocolate nursery in Hawaii.
"I have a farm in Canada,  I have a farm in Hawaii."
And the purpose of that farm in Hawaii  is to grow chocolate and explore the mystery and magic  of this great plant.
I grew that chocolate tree from seed.
Such an amazing amount of learning  can come from growing plants.
You can learn more from a garden  many times then you can from a book.
"I was very, very excited to explore."
"We're going to have to draw a lot of things, we're going to have to draw a lot of states."
That's kind of difficult.
And the answer was yes.
That's the point.
"It's these little pieces and these little touches that don't necessarily have a practical purpose that demonstrate to people that hey, if they thought that much about this, then think about how much work they put into the actual search results."
"Now, you have to be careful with this because it's a very, very strong message to send."
You have to make sure that your product backs it up.
So how do we apply this to thinking to products?
"Well, it doesn't have to be the large things."
"The Pac-Man example, the effort to actually make the game was a lot smaller than to produce the search results."
But simply ask yourself this question.
What are the things that I can do that I don't have to?
"So that said, here's a couple pieces of reading that we recommend that you look into to find out more about some of these topics, like affordances and natural mapping, an in Don"
"Norman's book, or the mental models in Alan Cooper's classic, About Face."
"And for typography and layout, one of my favorites is The"
Elements of Typographic Style.
"Tomorrow, there a number of design sessions relating to"
"Android development, so take advantage of those."

"And it was supposed to be on the slide, but tomorrow at 5:30 PM at the W Hotel in the living room, we're going to be having drinks with the Android Design Team."
"So if you guys want to stop by, that should be a lot of fun."
And we're really eager to take your questions.
We've got quite a bit of time.
So go ahead.
AUDlENCE:
"I don't actually have a question, I just want to say that was the best presentation I've had since"
"I've been here, so thank you guys."
ALEX FAABORG:
You're welcome.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"So, instead of, you know, looking for new sources of water, we can look for this source we already have."
"So getting into Greywater, one of the first questions is, is this legal?"
Like can I do this legally?
And the regulations around Greywater have been changing over the last couple of decades.
Greywater used to be viewed as sewage.
"It was part of just the whole water stream going down out of the house, considered sewage, dangerous, you can't reuse it."
And certainly over time it's been shifted to be seen as a resource to be able to be used for non-potable sources.
"So in California, we were the first State to have a code."
It was written in 1992.
"And it was a code, it's a plumbing code designed to allow people to reuse Greywater."
"But the way it was written, it really was more of a disposable code and so people weren't able to do that--to use"
--actually reuse it.
They were kind of asked to dispose of it deep under the ground.
"And so, between 1992 and 2009, pretty much all Greywater Systems were done without a permit, which were--they were technically illegal because the code really wasn't in line with why people want to use it, how it was practical to use."
"And so, there's millions of un-permitted systems."
"And last year, a bit--a lot of--there was drought, there was a lot pressure of reducing water."
"And so, there was a big push to rewrite the code and make it actually fit with Greywater being a resource."
"And so, the Department of Housing and Community Development wrote a new code."
And a lot of people were involved in that to really make it so we could use
Greywater as a resource.
"And so, from last year and onward to the future, Greywater is seen as a resource."
And we're going to show you some simple and legal ways that you can reuse it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Better safe than sorry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's the legal way [INDlSTlNCT] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
We'll get to that in one second.
Yeah.
Good.
It's actually right here.
"So,"
Greywater--who has heard of Greywater?
All of you.
"So, anyone have a Greywater System? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not yet. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:"
Not yet?
[laughter].
A bit of a scam because I wasn't afraid.
Maybe it was because at University I was part of the Psychic Research Society and one of the things we found out was that never ever once in a hundred years of ghost hunting in UK has a ghost ever harmed anybody.
So armed with that information I had my research - so why be afraid?
They can't harm me at all.
And that way I wasn't conditioned through fear.
"But the Thai people, and there's a few"
"Thai people here, [laughter], they have grown up with ghost movies."
"Ever since they were small they saw these ghosts, huge, like heads with entrails following behind, and they would do terrible things to people."
"And because of that, just even the mention of a ghost.."
I remember this story - this poor little novice staying in our monastery in Thailand.
"Because it was a cremation monastery that day was the moon day when we would meditate all night...that poor little novice, we did a funeral that day, and were supposed to meditate all night... in the hall."
"Now usually, little novices, they are only about 11-12 years of age, there is no way they would stay up all night, they would sneak off in the middle of their night back to their house."
"We knew they did this, it was breaking the rules, but they were only small little monks, so we didn't mind."
And we've go to be kind..
Not this day.
"This night, that little novice, he would not leave the hall."
[Laughter].
Because he was just so afraid of the ghost.
See even the [Laughter].
Those dogs must have been reborn in Thailand.
Last night.
[Laughter].
Great special effects.
"Now these, here they go again."
[Laughter].
"Shut up, dogs!"
[Laughter].
"There, they're going now."
"Now these ghosts, or rather this little novice, the poor little novice, stuck in that hall, you know 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, too scared to go out."
When it got to about 2 o'clock in the morning he just couldn't hold his urine any longer.
He had to go to the toilet.
Hi there.
Look on this.
Thank you.
Saying that power plants are the number one cause of global warming is like saying that humans are the number one cause of global warming.
"Power plants don't emit energy, don't create energy for the purposes of just creating energy for the sake of it."
"They create it for industries, and one of the industries that uses the most energy is factory farming."
"In the US, the meat industry uses about one third of all the fossil fuels that we generate."
"Headquarters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, in short PETA."
They have almost 2 million members and are active worldwide.
I love this one as well.
- Oh yes. - This is a very famous one.
We've got this.
I suspect that for Al Gore and for a lot of other people it's just too inconvenient of a truth.
"Gore was a politician and is beholden to a lot of industry people, in many different industries."
Probably in the meat industry too.
"And while he certainly has done admirable work, its disheartening to say the least that he has continued to ignore the fact that the meat he's eating every night for dinner is the number one cause of global warming."
I'm Alicia Silverstone and I'm a vegetarian.
There is nothing in the world that has changed me as much as this.
I feel so much better and have so much more energy.
It's so amazing.
There is a prominent environmental group in the US called Environmental Defence.
"And they recently wrote on their website that if every American replaced chicken with vegetarian foods for just one meal per week, it would be the equivalent in carbon dioxide of taking about 500,000 cars off the US roads."
"Here in the United States, big is beautiful."
That applies to the cars and definitely to the steaks.
The average American eats 124 kilos of meat a year.
44 more kilos than the average Dutchman.
"At night, at the hotel, I watch a classic about American factory farming."

"Here you go, Leo."
"Psst, Leo!"
Who are you?
How did you know my name?
"Now, we can have it into full screen and it will show me what's happening at a 720 pixel."
Look how great that
looks on your TV screen.
This is YouTube.
It's pretty amazing.
All right.
We're going
to go pause this again.
"Now, YouTube has actually launched a new product called YouTube Leanback that's actually defaulted for the Google or for the big screen experience."
"Not specifically for Google TV, but for any large screen that you're viewing YouTube on."
"Now, YouTube Leanback automatically defaults video into full screen."
"It also has very intuitive controls so that you can search, pause, play, rewind all the videos one by one."
"So you see here I can just navigate right, play any video I want to, I can even browse down and search by category."
"And again, it controls, are large and very intuitive."
"So, with Google TV, all of these can become a reality in your television."
But this is not just about video and it's not just about YouTube.
"From here, I can go anywhere on the web."
What about FarmVille?
"Now, did you know that the last I checked, 10% of Americans are playing FarmVille every single day?"
"I don't know what the statistic is for Germans, but that boggles my mind."
Okay.
"So, online games are pretty fun."
What about music?
"Now, there's so many online music streaming sites these days, what if you could play music from your TV?"
"Your TV if often connected to the best speakers in your house, so why shouldn't your music be coming out of those speakers?"
What about photos?
A lot of people these days are uploading their photos to places like
"Picasa, Flickr, Facebook, and a lot of these sites actually have a very interesting feature called slideshow mode."
"Now, again, what's more compelling, a 10-inch digital photo viewer sitting on your coffee table or a 50-inch TV sitting in your living room?"
It's the best and brightest screen in your house.
"This is the screen that you should be displaying all of your photos on, and now you can."
Okay.
"It was accepted, but they, they said, you know, do you have something on cancer?"
[laugh]
"So, naturally, he was younger and needed publications more than I did."
"So I, I sort of fell on my sword."
[laugh].
"Withdrew my paper from the Annals of Epidemiology and, and combined it with his and the New England Journal took it."
"Wow, yeah."
So even I was faced with a salami problem as an author.
"So those our the, the things Yeah, sorting those things out Yes Early can be very helpful."
And what do you think is if you have to point to one thing that number one mistake that scientist make when submitting their paper for publication?
I think it's overconfidence in how important.
And how good there study is.
[laugh].
"You know, you've worked on it really hard."
Yeah.
And done your best to write it up.
And this was an important topic or question that was really important to you.
"And you think, oh gosh, this is really an important finding, but others may not value it so I. [laugh]."
"So if it gets rejected I would do this, some factor like that."
"I would persist, I think it's important to persist and submit it elsewhere."
Fix it and submit it elsewhere.
"Yeah, finding the right journal for it might be the."
"Might be the key, yeah."
Right but you know just because you've devoted a year or two to this project you think its really important don't assume that other people will place it as high priority as you do.
"Yeah, yeah that's a good point and I have to profess you go give some advice to authors about writing style because you've written a number of editorials in American Journal of Epidemiology dealing with writing."
Mm-hm.
Right.
So what advice do you have to the writing?
"Well, I guess clarity and conciseness are what I would put as the highest priority."
Characteristics of writing avoid repetition.
Sometimes people will say something in the introduction and then repeat it in the discussion.
"Avoid that or they'll say something in the method section, which gets repeated in results."
Next question says to his agent: did you explain this to her before?
But can you...
Gracias (thank you)
Walks out
ANTHONY:
I was President of one of the fraternities at Cal State Northridge.
"I used to get calls from Dean Peckham on Saturday and Sunday morning at 8:30, because one or more of the fraternities had had some kind of indiscretion, and I was being called on the carpet to explain our misbehavior."
"Of course, I never told my parents that the Dean was calling me for that."
"They were under the impression that I was a very important person to the management of the college, because a dean would call me almost every weekend and ask me to come down to college to help him."
"So, it worked for me."
I hope I helped the dean get the things done that he wanted to do.
It seems he went from there to a tremendous amount of success with the university.
(Music Plays)
NARRATOR:
Few individuals affiliated with Cal State Northridge are as beloved as Dr. Edmund Peckham.
"The son of two teachers, Ed learned the value of education and mentoring at an early age."
"With a bachelor's from Brown and a master's and Ph.D from Harvard,"
Ed began his service to San Fernando Valley State College in 1967 as Dean of Student Activities and Housing.
Ed was faced with the difficult task of initiating from the ground up a comprehensive program to improve student life on campus.
ANTHONY:
I think Ed's ability to get along with almost everybody was probably his main tremendous strength.
He was able to deal with people in almost any venue and come out looking like everybody's friend.
NARRATOR:
"By 1969, he was named Dean of Students and in 1985 he was named Vice President of Student Affairs."
"Ed was an active administrator, attending Associated Student government meetings, emceeing campus events, and advising many, many student clubs and organizations."
WlLLlAM:
"When we think about campus spirit, we think of Ed Peckham."
He was a colorful person.
He drove a yellow convertible vehicle.
I think it was a Pontiac.
And he'd ride this thing in the Homecoming parades.
He just had a lot of color about him and about his involvement with students.
"The expert's strategy, a full immersion language treatment."
"She needs a lot of practice talking in complete sentences, talking on a more"
"literate level of things, really talking about issues."
What was Clinton's position in the article that you took your notes on?
"We want to build these muscles, these expressive language muscles because one of the best ways to learn to talk, right, is to have plenty of practice."
It's almost like working out for a sport.
And she has to do that.
She needs a verbal work out.
You need to be a risk taker.
You need to try a new word.
You need to make that
leap.
But you have to be comfortable.
You have to be confident.
You have to know you're in a safe place to do it.
And someone's got to be there to help give you the ammunition to take that risk.
"But once you start taking it and once you start succeeding, the ripple effect is wonderful."
"There, it's very positive."
"So the prescription for Sarah Lee is a kind of immersion therapy, almost like"
learning a foreign language.
"There will be flash card drills, practice conversations, lots of reading, and new vocabulary words over and over and over."
"If she keeps it up, the experts believe she can overcome her expressive language deficiency."
What should you do if you find someone's wallet or purse in a store?
You should-- if the person it not too far-- you should run and give it to them or you can--
"One year later, the assessment of Sarah Lee's progress is indeed hopeful. --and let them know that you have their wallet."
I hope if I loose my wallet you're the one who finds it.
This past year has been a year of real growth for her.
She's contributing more to classes now and she's doing more reading.
And she's found ways to help herself.
And that alone is like shooting baskets to prepare for a basketball game.
"The more she does, the better she gets at it."
Sara Lee has improved dramatically.
Those are roosts.
Oh!
OK.
"Again, what it does is, it makes the whole farm infrastructure portable."
"So it could be done in suburbia, it could be done on a rental farm, it could be done on an uncle's farm, you can move all this around."
"And that really changes the entrance opportunity, and the expansion capability, by having the infrastructure all portable."
"Of course, the turkeys, they'll pick up 45% of their diet off the grass, so that's why they get a much bigger area."
It's great.
"Yeah, they got this area today, and they were just there two days before, we move them every two days."
"And, again, we've got the cows ahead, we're shortening the grass with the cows."
Do you need a tractor to move this?
"Yeah, this is a feed buggy up on the front, so it's hooked up to the feed buggy."
"So you just hook up to the feed buggy with a tractor here, you set up your next circle up here, and you just hook up with the tractor and open it up."
And you've been doing this for twenty years?
"I came back to the farm full time September 24, 1982."
It'll be 30 years this September 24th.
"So what type of adoption have you seen across the industry with people accepting these techniques and utilizing them, and raising pastured poultry."
"Well, it's growing, but it's such a tiny subset of the whole industry that it's still not a spit in the ocean."
Still way less than one percent.
"Oh, yeah, but it's growing."
What is the rate at which it is growing?
Is it doubling every year?
Is it 50%?
"I don't, it's hard to tell."
Do you think it might be doubling?
"I don't know, I doubt if it's doubling."
"Doubling every year, that would be astronomical."
But I can imagine now that it's increasing by 10 or 15% every year.
So it's definitely going up.
"So if there were one thousand farms last year, there'll be probably eleven hundred this year, and thirteen hundred next year, and it's definitely on the up swing."
Being fueled partly by the whole local food tsunami.
"The whole local food, integrity food tsunami."
You can get some on the Ave.
"You know? for those of you who are far away from the Ave, I don't know where you can get incense, but we've got lots here."
"Maybe we can ship some to you, 'kay?"
"And then you can meditate upon this, okay?"
"But I'll just tell you that's your matrix A. And then, what we're going to do, is do exactly what we did in class last time."
"Remember this matrix a, it's 500 rows, 5000 columns, so it's, it's a big matrix with highly under determined, okay?"
"Oh by the way, well lets go back to that."
"Now once you get that, then, here you go."
This is exactly what we did in class last time.
"We're going to solve this, highly underdetermined system, in three ways."
We're going to use the pseudo inverse Command.
"We're going to say okay, find the suit [UNKNOWN] over in the first of this matrix a."
Multiply it by your sample signal.
"Get a v-, get the vector x out, okay?"
"We're also going to say, alright, how about just use the backslash."
Backslash solves large and indetermined systems.
"There it is, we'll call that X2 and then, here you go."
"Here's the optimization routine, and I've given you a link that you can download this."
It's a
little add-on in that .
It's just a generic convex optimization solver.
"What you're going to do is, Is the following."
"There's some variable x3 that's going to be our solution, and you want to minimize, so what you want to do, is you want to find the minimum l1 solution of this under determine system, so here it is."
"Minimize the norm x3, within one norm."
"There's the one norm right there, right?"
The l1 norm.
"Subject to x = b, right?"
So there's infinite number of solutions.
"Give me the one that satisfies the solution, but also has the smallest l1 norm."
That's what y ou're saying to do.
"And you know, from what we did last time."
"First thing is probably going to do, is say, hey, you know what?"
"Under the hood, you won't just see a 505-horsepower LS3 engine, but a complete C6 Corvette drive"
"line, including the cradles, which is not only effective at getting the power to the ground, but also robust with parts available in nearly every city in the United States."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"The driveline in this car, as well as all the suspension components, can be bought at your local GM"
"Performance parts dealer, including the transmission, the diff, the engine itself is all available at GM"
Performance parts.
"So it's very easy to-- if something happens or breaks, to get new parts."
"They're not custom, except for the chassis itself."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
It's every bit as exciting as it looks stepping into this thing.
It's visceral to the point of nirvana.
"It's fast, grippy, responsive, and has the best turn-in of any car I've never driven."
"It's wonderful, rewarding you when you get it just right, and kicking you in the ass when you overcook it."
"I stayed out, lap after lap, pushing the car as hard as I could, until I realized I was having so much fun, I'd run out of gas."
"While it's important to remember this car is a prototype, the production cars will be reaching customer hands at the beginning of next year."
And I can't wait to drive one of those.
"Now that we found out how well it grips on the track, let's see what happens when you try and break it loose."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
I got no gas pedal.
It's got no gas pedal here.
"I somehow snapped the throttle cable, and we didn't have time to repair it, [INAUDlBLE]"
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
"Though we came to Indy to test the car, what we got was an experience."
The people at AVI Racing are true professionals who brought us a great race car.
"And because it's Arizona, of course somebody brought a Mac 10."
[GUN SHOT]
MATT FARAH:
This is why like shooting in Arizona-- the crew all brings guns.
And it came up again not long ago too.
ST:
"Yes, we have the ""ideologically similar"" media, although I find the phrase unfortunate."
JL:
I don't want to be there.
"I mean, if there is media which is ideologically similar or different"
I don't want to be on the list of the ideologically similar media outlets.
ST:
"I'd like you to tell me about the best experience you have had since the 15th, and the worst experience."
And here we can move on to these things.
JL:
There have been three best moments.
"One when I was streaming with the telephone and I saw there were thousands of people connected to my streaming with my bloody telephone. and I said ""what's happening?"""
"But especially when I turned off the streaming, or the network collapsed or something, and I put down my mobile and looked not through the screen, because I was really stressed out."
I was knackered.
"But I put down the mobile to rest a moment and I thought ""Blimey, something's happening here"""
"I mean, something big is happening here, that's what I thought at that moment."
"And that's actually the headline I used in my chronicle that night, then I changed it, but the URL is still ""something big is happening here""."
Because that's what I felt.
"I didn't know what is was, but it was big."
That was the first big impression I got.
The second moment was when I started to see the cardboards in the square.
When they put cardboard on the ground so everyone could sleep.
And they started to
"""carpet"" the Puerta del Sol, that was the second time that I thought something big was happening."
"I mean, they were carpeting the ground so they could sleep there!"
"It's an image that's fixed, after that came the blue carps, the distribution of the commissions, the infrastructure, the firefighters helping out... the construction of the Medina de Sol."
But the first moment
I realised they were building a city was when I saw the cardobard on the floor.
"And I saw people were going to stay there, lots of people."
ST:
"I remember an image, let's see if I can describe it."
But it turns out that this is not quite the same expected value as this.
But you don't have to worry about it for now.
So why even talk about the standard deviation?
"Well, one, the units work out a little better."
"If let's say all of our data points were measured in meters, right?"
If we were taking a bunch of measurements of length then the units of the variance would be meter squared. right?
Because we're taking meters minus meters.
This would be a meter.
Then you're squaring.
You're getting meters squared.
And that's kind of a strange concept if you say you know the average dispersion from the center is in meter squares.
"Well first, when you take the square root of it you get this-- you get something that's again in meters."
"So you're kind of saying, oh well the standard deviation is x or y meters."
And then we'll learn a little bit it if you can actually model your data as a bell curve or if you assume that your data has a distribution of a bell curve then this tells you some interesting things about where all of the probability of finding someone within one or two standard deviations of the of the mean.
"But anyway, I don't want to go to technical right now."
Let's just calculate a bunch.
Let's calculate.
"Let's see, if I had numbers 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7."
And let's say that this is a population.
So what would its mean be?
So I have 1 plus 2 plus 3.
So it's 3 plus 3 is 6.
6 plus 8 is 14.
14 plus 7 is 21.
So the mean of this population-- you sum up all the data points.
"You get 21 divided by the total number of data points, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
21 divided by 5 which is equal to what?
4.2.
Fair enough.
Now we want to figure out the variance.
And we're assuming that this is the entire population.
So the variance of this population is going to be equal to the sum of the squared differences of each of these numbers from 4.2.

"But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience."
"By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator?"
"Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand."
Raise your hand.
Did your hand go up?
"Now bring it out, bring it out."
Anybody else?
"I see, I see one way in the back."
"You sir, that's three."
And anybody on this side here?
"OK, over there on the aisle."
"Would the four of you please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage."
Let's give them a nice round of applause.
- I would say definitely and the most important is to throw.
"Beyond that your personal religious beliefs on throwing checked or not or changing or not, are less important, but not swallowing it the really important thing."
"- OK, at least we can agree on that much."
The rest of it is just a quite good practice.
Use formatters.
A lot of people seem to be afraid of these.
I ended up using them all the time.
They're easy to write.
"If you look at the whole API for, was is Java text format, there's a whole lot of stuff there."
"But, with Web Objects, you usually don't care."
"You're formatting one value of an input, and you're...you're parsing one value of an input or you're formatting it into a string."
"You don't need to get too carried with writing fancy, fancy formatters."
It's good because it keeps the views separate from the model and the controller.
"Rather than using a formatter, you can often just do it in a WO component."
The thing is that this is a little bit smaller than a WO component.
It's easier to reuse across a bunch of WO components.
It promotes reuse because of that.
The code's not tied to one specific page.
Yes?
- This is going to get ugly
A lot of the formatters aren't thread‑safe.
I think all the ones I rate are thread‑safe.
"But, I know some of the Java timestamp formatters, and some of the other ones aren't thread safe."
"The best practice is probably to cache them in a session if you're not going to get multiple requests, unless of course, you're using a long response page in which case then you've got a different problem."
"The best practice is, it depends but think about thread safety."
- Yes.
None of the Java formats are as thread‑safe.
- Sorry.
It's actually not that costly to pick a formatter.
Just don't try to share a formatter between threads.
You're asking for trouble.
"There's no doubt, I put the date and time into the session as seen from the slides to hold the time zone in them?"
"After medical care and observation,"
Maxine explores her new freedom at Farm Sanctuary.
I've seen that like a hundred times and I still get goosebumps.
"It's simple, you know."
It is unnecessary.
It doesn't have to be this way.
You change your perception.
You change the story.
"That's all it is, the changing of the story."
"And we cannot wait for other people to do it, we have to do it ourselves."

"So if you are interested in having a presentation at your school, if you're a teacher, at some community event that you might be running, we do everything."
It doesn't matter what it is.
"Birthday parties,"
"Bar Mitzvah, Bat Mitzvah, circumcision."
Maybe not the circumcision.
"Also I do want to say, there is a lot of information out there, we have starter kits, we have ""why vegan?""."
It's a talk about the ethical aspect of veganism.
There is also again more information on the Animal Rights Foundation
This is a card.
"This has a list of all the veg friendly restaurants in South Florida, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, definitely take one of these."
It's all out there on the table.
What's all this for?
"OH, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A BlRTHDAY PARTY!"
YAY!
HAPPY BlRTHDAY TO GENGHlS KHAN'S DESCENDANTS!
"How do I know it's your birthday, Genghis Khan's descendants?"
Because every day is your birthday.
"Because, right now, on the planet Earth, there are 16 million direct descendants of Genghis Khan, meaning that every day is the birthday of 43,000 of them."
"So, good news, Genghis Khan."
"Your empire might be gone, but your progeny lives on, and on, and on, and on."
HAPPY BlRTHDAY!
"Best wishes, John Green."
"Unfortunately for the Mongols, those guys weren't always working together, because Genghis Khan failed to create a single political unit out of his conquests."
"Instead, after Genghis' death, the Mongols were left with 4 really important empires called the Khanates: the Yuan Dynasty in China, the Ilkhanate in Persia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, and the Khanate of the Golden Horde in Russia."
"If you remember all the way back to the Hellenistic period, this is similar to what happened to another good general who wasn't much for administration,"
Alexander the Great.
"Also, neither of them ever conquered India."
"The Mongols succeeded, primarily, because of their military skill."
"Genghis Khan's army, which never numbered more than 130,000, was built on speed and archery, just like this guy."
"Mongol mounted archers were like super-fast tanks, compared to the foot soldiers and knights they were up against."
"""But, wait,"" all the military history nerds are saying,"
"""Once people knew the Mongols were coming,"
"""why didn't they just hole up in castles and forts?"
"""It's not like the Mongols had flying horses."""
EXCEPT THEY DlD.
They didn't?
"Stan, why are you always making history boring?!"
"So the Mongols apparently didn't have flying horses, but they were uncommonly adaptable."
"So even though they'd never seen a castle before they started raiding, they became experts at siege warfare by interrogating prisoners."
"And, they also adopted gunpowder, probably introducing it to Europeans, and they even built ships so they could attack Japan."
"That might have worked, too, except there happened to be a typhoon."
"Also, people were terrified of the Mongols."
"Often, cities would surrender the moment the Mongols arrived, just to escape slaughter."
But what about a kid who wasn't identified early or who wasn't targeted for medication therapy or one on one attention?
"This is the story of a teenager who slipped through the cracks, an object lesson in missed signals."
"On the edges of Boston in this neighborhood known as Hyde Park, many families are scratching to make a living."
"One family, the Dunnings, is raising four kids here."
Adam is their second son.
"He was just a good little kid, very well liked."
"Always, neighbors and teachers, and CCD teachers, and coaches would always tell me, what a well mannered son you have."
His mother realized early on that Adam had a problem.
Adam and I would read together every night.
And he couldn't identify words that he should have been familiar with.
"When he started second grade, I knew that there was a building block that was kind of beginning to crumble."
"The school teachers kept saying he's just lazy, you know."
And his personality carried him through.
"Adams a good kid he's just, you know, we'll worry about him"
later.
"Finally, by the fifth grade, Adam's problems in school were obvious to his teachers."
He was given a battery of tests.
But school officials assured the
Dunnings their son was average and would do just fine.
"I think the problem with the initial testing was that when you do an IQ test, you've got 12 sub tests."
And half of them are language based and half of them or not.
So you end up getting scores that get added together.
And Adam's scores added together come up as average.
"But Adam, struggling with even the most basic reading, writing, and spelling tasks had the feeling he wasn't even average."
"I felt embarrassed at some times, like when I couldn't pronounce words and then other kids would pronounce the word for me."
"Say hurry up, you don't know how to read."
I got comments like that all the time.
By now his parents began to really worry about Adam.
They asked the school for more tests.
And by the end of seventh grade the school had a bombshell for the
Dunnings.
They told us that Adam was reading on a third grade level.
That's all going to be possible in just a few months.
"Now, we have the Sony Bravia over to my right just to simulate the Google TV living room experience."
"And for the sake of all of your eyes, we'll be projecting Google TV back on the screen behind me."
Let's see if we can get it started.
There we go.
"So, everyone clear on everything?"
We're going to get started with the demo.
You notice here I'm watching TV as if I normally would in my living room.
I can change channels;
I can do all the same things I usually would.
"With one button, I can press the search button and bring down this box."
"And for up here, I can type in any URL."
So let's go straight to YouTube.
"In just a few seconds, YouTube.com is going to be loading."
"Now, you notice this transition between TV and web was completely seamless."
"I didn't need to change my input channel, I didn't need to use a different remote; the web just became an extension of my TV."
So I'm here on YouTube and I can do any of the same things I could do in my computer.
So let's search for something to watch.
The Salt's video trailer came out just a couple of months ago; let's see if we can find that here.
"Again, just like on my computer, now"
I can see it and I can go click on the link and watch the video.
"Now, one of the great things about YouTube is that as camera technology has improved, more and more people are uploading high resolution video."
This means that it makes a great experience when you navigate into full screen.
So let's try that now.
"So, the video is rendering and we're actually"
"going to be using hardware acceleration in the Google TV devices to make this rendering happen very, very fast."
Let's see if this actually is rendering.
All right.
"Well, let"
"me show you another example of YouTube, oh, this is what happened; the play button was not started."
Minor details when you're watching a video.
There we go.
"But I think, for obvious reasons, we can just skip that particular punchline and instead, silently ponder why"
Megan made the poor decisions that she made.
"Joking aside, it should now be burnt indelibly into your brains that I am the best man."
"But I hear some of you asking, ""Why would Bayley, somebody so obviously filled with bitter jealousy and feelings of inadequesy, pick somebody as awesome as David to be his best man?"" The truth is, I am as stumped as you."
"Don't get me wrong, I am Bayley's best friend in the whole wide world - closer to a brother, really."
"But Bayley, he is just my ..."
"I don't know... what is closer than a stranger, but still shy of pal...?"
"""Casual work acquaintance""?"
"No, I would need a job for that to be the case... ah well, we'll come back to that."
After all...
I can't ignore his lovely bride!
Heh heh heh...
"Megan, I actually want to use this time to appologize for the way we have treated you."
"To be mocked about your height for so many years by me, my brothers, friends, family, strangers on the street, well, it simply isn't fair to you."
"And to know that you've actually looked up to me all this time, metaphorically speaking, of course..."
"Well, I'm sorry for all of it."
I will try and be more respectful from here on out.
"That's a lovely dress, by the way."
Does it come in an adult size?
"Darn it, I didn't even make it a full 10 seconds into my resolution."
"Here, to make it up to you, I will now improvise a touching poem, just for the two of you."
"Now if you notice that I am still scrolling down my speech, understand that I am simply doing that for continuity."
"Ugh, starting is always the hard part."
"I dunno, uhh... roses."
Roses are... red!
Violets are... violet?
"No, I know there is something better."
"Come on David, you can do this."
"Roses are red, Violets are blue,"
"Today we learn what they already knew, This beautiful couple makes their official debut, Put themselves up for their familiar review,"
"Verdict comes in, it was worth the pursue,"
"Pastor asks, ""Do you and do you?"""
"So in the comments please tell me that you go right now, find fashion designers on Linkedln, on Facebook, and you turn them into your happy clients."
Alright?
"If you think there is still any piece of the puzzle missing, then let me know that one in the comments as well, I will answer."
"Besides that, click on +1, click on ""like"" and then stop the video and go get your assignment."
Alright.
I wish you good light!
[Wes]
"So I'm very happy to be here at Mozilla with Brendan Eich, the CTO of Mozilla, and the designer of JavaScript."
So u could tell us how that language came to be.
[Brendan]
Sure.
So I can say more about how I got ready to make JavaScript.
It was when I wrote Netscape.
"I didn't have much time to do that, and I had to have the skills already."
And I've been just seated writing programming language implementations for my entire carreer.
When I got into Computer Science it was for Physics.
First studying theory of formal languages and automata theory.
"Regular languages, regular expressions."
This was the early 80ties and I loved the cleverness of the theory and rather direct way of implementing theories as algorithms.
"So you can make a parser or a lexer , semi-automatically or automatically."
"It was strange to me, and it was useful too."
I think every practicer in programs should take some time to invent a language at some point.
"There's often a need you have that no typical language is perfect for, or you have some leasure time and you can use that."
It's educational and can often solve your problem in a better way than any other language.
"And so, I encourage that."
"I did that myself and there is something that helped me to get ready to write JavaScript because when I got into Netscape and the heat of the moment was there, with Java looming."
Questions about if we needed two languages: a scripting language versus a big language as Java.
I had to go fast.
I had to have all sort... in my muscles I had to have some practice already on the way.
[Wes]
So in this class we will learn a lot of the things he have just mentioned. in various points.
"Regular Expressions,"
But there are 100's and 1000's of you taking this class currently.
"Your talking to each other is going to be more powerful, a learning tool."
"So say, for example, I make an error, and actually I have made errors in the videos, but I don't try to fix them and, you know, cut out that clip, simply because we all make mistakes."
"I correct them in real time with you, and usually they're small."
And I guarantee you they will be small.
"But is you find something don't say, Oh, you know, Suwarth Gottum made a mistake."
"Well, you make mistakes, I make mistakes."
Your attitude should be sorting out what that mistake is.
Finally.
This class is about ambiguity and learning.
And I would encourage you to take that attitude towards it.
Okay?
"One last thing, which I feel compelled to talk about because I have prepared most of the class, and I want it to share with you."
Why did I say yes to it?
Why did I choose to do something online?
The first reason is I believe education should be accessible to all.
Why do I believe that?
Because I believe education almost is like a right.
It's almost like a right to breathe.
"I do have strong views about it, but I genuinely believe that education makes you become empowered."
The most valuable investment you could ever make is education.
What do I mean by that?
"Remember, if you want electricity, which is good, you're willing to burn coal."
"However burning coal leads to some problems, some costs on society, and on you too."
Education is an investment that
largely gives your benefits.
Why wouldn't you want to do that?
Why wouldn't you to make an investment in yourself.
"My goal, in this investment, is to empower you not to be dependent on a coach like me or any other person."
"But to take this class and say, I can do it too, and that's the beauty of education."
I'll make couple more points and then we'll see each other in about a week.
This has been a real challenge for me as a teacher.
"Now we've sampled, we've interleaved this, we've decided how to sample."
"Now the big thing we got to do is simply construct our matrix a, and then solve a large under-determined system, and by the way"
last time in class.
"We solved the large under number of systems in four ways, okay?"
"And we found out by the way that zero inverse looked like, a lot like the"
"l2 optimization, so really we're going to solve it in three ways today."
"Alright, so"
let's come back to our code.
And we first do this.
"Alright, the first thing I'm going to do, is going to take the discrete cosine transform, of the indentity matrix."
"I'm going to map out for every point that's On in the signal, suppose I have a point."
"I figure out, if I have, if I have this signal of 5000 points and I have one point on, I find okay, what would that correspond to?What, how would I discreet cosign transform that point?"
What if the next point were on?
How would I discreet cosign transform that?
"So in some sense, I build up my basis, my way of transforming, so, so essentially right?"
"What's going to happen here, is i'm building up this."
"So I this big matrix that gets me from the signal space to the Fourier space, okay?"
"Okay, and so if I have, if I think about sampling, if I sample with one, zero, zero, zero, zeroes, zero one, zero, I can start thinking about how, what's the connection between these two?"
Okay.
"Yeah, exactly, 5,000 delta functions, as it were."
And seeing what the response is.
"And then what I would do with this, is say, okay great, I've done that."
"And now what I'm going to do, is I'm going to take the 500 that matter."
"In ot her words, I have said, let's sample at 500 different points."
"Well, how would those 500 different points, essentially generate cosined [UNKNOWN]"
DCT components.
There it is.
And that's my matrix a.
This is equivalent to my times psi [UNKNOWN].
This one will take a little meditation time.
Meditate upon it.
Maybe burn some incense.
Then we released the video showing the slaying of two Reuters journalists and 18 other people in Baghdad.
"And that application was canceled for what judges, two judges involved tell us is for political reasons."
So it really is important to have a diverse funding base that is built around the interests of people and not organizations that are busy in power plays.
"I'm sorry, and your first question was...?"
"If you see your example, you're setting an example that more media put more resources into investigative reporting from war zones."
You mention the example of Sy Hersh and the My Lai Massacre.
"I spoke to Sy Hersh about this last year and, while many people have heard of the My Lai Massacre as the sort of archetypical example of abuse exposed in Viet Nam, what people probably don't know is that Sy Hersh couldn't get that story out, that he wrote, submitted it to the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc. and it was not accepted."
Rachel and Clare Wallmeyer are identical twins.
"They were beautiful, bright, straight A students."
"Then, when they were 14, suddenly their perfect world collapsed."
"Kilo by kilo, the twins began wasting away."
"And for the next 20 years, they'd struggled with a deadly disease."
One that affects thousands of Australian teenagers - Anorexia.
Now the twins are 34 and they are literally just skin and bones.
"They still live together, still share everything including, tragically, a death wish."
"Quite simply, they've given up on life."
"Thank goodness, not everyone has given up on them."
"Identical twins, Clare and Rachel Wallmeyer are running out of time."
Their lives have been ruined by anorexia and now they are literally starving themselves to death.
"""We are living, solely, [for] anorexia."
It's a horror.
"We live to die."""
"""It's been a constant pain to wake up everyday and not being able to get out of bed."
We're so tired.
"Everything's a struggle and there's no point."""
Rachel and Clare run to lose weight.
"This obsessive training is all part of their illness, an illness they've been fighting for 20 years."
Interviewer:
"""Rachel, how much do you weigh?"""
Rachel:
"""About 32 and a half kilos."""
Interviewer:
They used to dream  about cacao beans all night and talk about them all day.
"You had only to mention the word ""cacao""  to an Oompa-Loompa and he would start dribbling  at the mouth."""
Listen closely:
"""The cacao bean,""  Mr Wonka continued,"
"""which grows on the cacao tree, is the thing that all chocolate is made from."""
"Roald Dahl knew,  and it was in the book, the great book  ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."""
Remember the Oompa Loompas.
This is an elf with a cacao pod but the sculpture is 3000 years old.
It is intrinsic to the magic of chocolate.
"In Mexico, this is where the great cuisine was innovated, it was always served as a drink,  but today we have blenders."
It makes it so much easier.
"You can upgrade your smoothie, your protein shake  by adding a dash of raw cacao and bringing forth the magic and wonder, just as they did in Ancient Mexico."
"On the Mexican 100 peso note,  if you look closely, right there next to Xochipilli are actual cacao recipes, iconically represented."
"We've innovated and brought forth now  an entirely new cuisine, brought to the greatest chefs  in the world, revive some of the great additives  of chocolate, creating these wonderful  and delightful recipes."
"The one question that I get more than any other, after all of this is:"
Is it possible to o.d. on chocolate? and the answer is:
Yes.
Thank you so much.
I am David Wolfe.
Have the best day ever.
We continue our Education in America series this morning with one man who is turning the learning process upside down.
"In his series of really simple videos, it's being called revolutionary, as CBS News correspondent"
John Blackstone reports:
It would be music to the ears of any educator what ten-year old Megan Tsern has to say about her favorite teacher.
He makes math really easy in a really kind of conversational way.
He is Salman Khan.
Negative seven dollars?
It's like saying that
I own seven dollars!
"Khan is the voice and the brain behind the Khan Academy, the free educational website that some believe is leading a revolution in teaching!"
"There's no nonsense, no defocusing on the material."
It really is what it is.
"It's just an ounce of prevention, worth a pound of cure."
"Especially when it comes to keeping one of these precious, lovely children alive."
Let's go through the answer together.
"We definitely want to name our procedure t_string, and now the real trick to this is just writing a good regular expression."
"Here I've written a regular expression that starts with a double quote, ends with a double quote, and can have anything that's not a double quote-- remember that super useful carat character--0 or more times."

"Presence of my body, as the breath moves through the body."
"Present moment, smiling."
(Bell)
"Dear Thay, dear friends, dear family, such a happy moment to be up here  and look down."
"Just to know that our togetherness  for the common purpose of education, this brings me a lot of happiness."
I know that so many students  will benefit from this.
"That awareness really fills my body up, my heart, I am filled."
"I think, just that, already  gives me a lot of hope, a lot of trust."
"Thank you for coming here,  freeing time to be with us."
It is very precious.
"Today, we have a few wonderful friends."
We've got together already just to know what they will share.
"I am just grateful that they agree  to come here to share their experiences in the practice,  in bringing mindfulness, bringing the practice into the areas that they are involved with."
I will sit up here just to be a time keeper.
I have the big bell here.
(Laughter)
"It is not threatening,  it is peace."
"But I will, once in a while,  remind our friends here."
Because their stories  are very inspirational.
"And of course,  we live in a ... (inaudible)"
"Our brothers and sisters, and Thay, in the Plum Village community, we took the initiative to bring  mindfulness into education, maybe 3, 4 years ago."
Thay wanted to secularize the practice and bring it into society.
"But keeping who we are,  which is monastics, we are in a spiritual tradition,  Buddhist based, and so on."
Okay.
So you've talked a little bit about the benefit to the students.
Tell me a little bit about the actual scientific research program that you're doing with this grant.
Win Phippen:
Okay.
"As you know, here in illinois, we produce a lot of corn and soybeans during the summer months."
"But the rest of the year, the fields set empty."
"And so, some researchers over at the USDA over in Peoria have come across this crop that allows us to plant in the late fall, after corn comes out."
And it actually grows throughout the winter months.
"It gives us field coverage, so we don't get a lot of erosion in the fields during the winter months."
Beth Seaton:
"So it's good for the field, too?"
Win Phippen:
It's excellent.
So not only is off-season production but it also gives benefits back to the field for growing corn and soybeans.
Beth Seaton:
So when do you harvest this pennycress?
Win Phippen:
"We plant it in late fall, and then, sometime, in late May, typically, by the first of June, is when you would harvest this plant."
"And that allows you to then plant your soybeans right behind it, and there is no impact, then, on the soybeans."
So they can get a full season of soybeans.
"But what they are benefitting is, they have produced all that pennycress."
And why pennycress is being looked at...
"As you can see, it's a fairly oil-seed crop."
It has a lot of oil.
It's about 40 percent oil.
And so the intent of this is simply to help displace a lot of petroleum-based products.
"And that could be fuel, so this simply could be crushed, to get out the oil, to make a bio-diesel product."
"Or you can take this seed and add it to, let's say, plastics, and other, sort of, petroleum-based products. it's not going to alleviate us completely from the dependency on foreign oil, but it is certainly a step in the right direction."
Beth Seaton:
It sounds like an exciting research program for Western.
Win Phippen:
"One day I was recommended a book written by an American (then was not none), named ""the shack"" (the refuge)."
I do not regret not having it published.
"Has been very successful, lots of publicity, and ..."
Q: don't you regret?
A: absolutely not.
"Q: does not earn much money, you don't have an actual team, you're not popular, sell little, why continue?"
"A: because my definition of success is different, our success is guaranteed because in Christ are blessed."
"Many colleagues have started at the same time our and have already given up, because they have earned as they wanted."
"Of course, I want to give the best to my family, but what about the great success, I believe that we have already."
"Because when we see God's hand at work, I am the first to be blessed and happy, I and my whole team."
Q:
So you believe that God will rejoice at what you are doing?
A:
Yes.
"Many times when I lose myself moods,"
"I know that God is happy to me, and therefore makes me feel its presence in continuation."
"Q: isn't always of great comfort, however your economic life, with your wife, but God there is always arguing."
Q:
"If one day you Strait lacked necessary, what would you do?"
"What would you think about the project ""harvest time"""
Rimangeresti you all?
A:
"No, absolutely not."
"Would not ever, because it is always a great joy to know that God is with me."
"We try to remain simpler as possible, we do not use branded clothing and other luxury items, since it would be so far from our reality."
"We don't need these things to have joy, we have the Lord and we are already super pleased."
"Look, I'm not preaching a false moralism, we are truly thankful for what God has given us!"
"And in the little things, like an outing at mcdonald 's, we're more than happy."
"Q: what message do you want to leave it to those who want to sell Christian books with only the intent to earn a lot of money, success and fame?"
A: do you want to earn money?
Go to sell chewing gum!
"Who or what do you aggrapperesti then in moments of crisis, eh?"
Elisabeth:
"Then he's in a bit of a pickle, isn't he?"
Joy:
Let's leave his pickly out of this.
[laughter]
David:
"I've been fortunate enough that the people I've been in relationships with have been respectful and also we talk about it, we communicate if you openly communicate about what's going on then it gives a space to work it out."
That's what's important.
Elisabeth:
Thank you for being as candid as you have been today.
I know a lot of people feel the same way you feel.
"All right, thanks to David Jay."
"If you want to learn more about asexuality,"
David will be seen in an upcoming segment on 20/20.
We'll be right back.
"Well, when we took that break, Brian, you mentioned that you had some special guests once, that you met the..."
We were with the 130 at the time
"We were supporting the Antarctic ... and the astronauts, the navy was the recover for them, like the mercury astronauts, primarily."
"But the Air Force, we train crews and we were all over the world, and I ended up ... in which I'd been to a couple of times."
"We covered between South America and Africa and then we had them in Singapore, we had them in..."
I'd been to Greenland a couple times and I didn't want to go to Antarctica.
"I had a choice of either going with the astronaut recovery or that, so I volunteered, and we..."
"There was another guy, too, who did most of..."
"And then, at the last minute, we'd bring in the guys that would take the other airplanes."
So I was down to... in Florida for probably a month.
And we take the
Air Force paramedics out.
We take a dummy capsule a couple hundred miles out.
We'd go find it and dress these guys - put their scuba gear and stuff on them - and they'd jump out and then I'd sit in the tailgate of the back of the truck of the one-thirty.
With the flotation collar that went around it.
"Too small, little one man or two man rafts"
"There'd be tools, and a medical kit, and food and stuff."
There's an old wood bridge.
"If the guild is truly active again, they'll get their orders there."
My lady.
Did you find out?
The Queen sent her away?
"Yes, and without the King knowing."
Yet something's not right.
"If she's feeling poorly, why have no medicines been sent to her pavilion?"
So she leaves on medical grounds but doesn't tell the King?
"Yungsun, get the whole story."
"Lady Jo, send word to the Viceroy that I want to see him today."

It was released last August 22th!
In this video I'd like to talk about the power of creating and comparing alternatives.
And to do that I'm going to share some research that Steven Dow did as a postdoctoral scholar with me at Stanford University.
"When you're designing, does it make more sense to go for quality and try to come up with the best possible design?"
Or does it make more sense to go for quantity first as a path to try and learn and understand?
"There's a story that Bayles and Orland tell about an art teacher who divides the class in half, and he tells one half of the class,"
"""You're going to be graded exclusively on the quality of the very best thing that you make."""
"He tells the other half of the class,"
"""You're going to be graded on the quantity of things that you make."
"Doesn't matter how good it is; all that matters is how much that you make."""
"And what this teacher found was that while the quantity group was busily churning our piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the quality group sat around theorizing, and at the end of the day they had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and piles of dead clay."
So this gives us some intuition that rapidly producing many alternatives has a lot of value.
"And to explore this further, Steven and I had people create egg drop devices."
"Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi."
"Goodbye, Martin Luther King."
"Hello, gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood."
Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food.

look what they've done.

"Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues."
"A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti, which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change."
"In Venezuela, one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal."
"And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer, 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done."
"And of course, ""The Vagina Monologues"" we know about."
"And there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues."
"So, why is it, that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world, we need a more just world, why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?"
"What I need to say to the planners of the world, the governments, the strategists is, ""You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake."
"It needs to be the yeast."""
"Because, any future planning, if 2048 is when we want to get there, unless the arts are put with the scientists, with the economists, with all those who prepare for the future, badly, we're not going to get there."
"And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen."
"So, what is it that we require?"
What is it that we need?
"We need to break down our vision of what planners are, of what the correct way of a path is."
"And to say all these years of trying to make a better world, and we have failed."
There are more people being raped.
There are more wars.
There are more people dying of simple things.
"So, something has got to give."
And that is what I want.
Can I have my last audio track please?
Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.
(Whistling)
13 gallons.
How many people worldwide have no access to any water within a 15 minute
radius of their homes?
One billion people.
And how many gallons of raw or partially treated
sewage flows into U.S. waterways per year?
"Oh, exactly."
Okay.
And final quiz and then
"we'll get on to some more content. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [INDlSTlNCT] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's everything, yeah."
"That's the whole management system across the country, yeah."
Final quiz.
"Who said, ""Whisky is for drinking and water is for fighting over, fighting for?"
Any guesses?
Mark Twain said that.
Okay.
Back to you Laura.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
"So to start talking about Greywater, there was a really excellent report that came out last year looking at the--can Greywater can really meet our needs and it's a non-potable source of water."
"So if we look at how it can meet our irrigations needs, we can find that it actually matches up really well."
So there's two charts.
If you just look at shower and
"laundry water, these are--have average per capita use in California."
"And then you look at the outdoor use for landscaping, there's a really good match."
"So we can just take all that water instead off sending it to the sewer plant which often, you know, doesn't treat it properly, often it does, but not always."
"We can use that to irrigate outside, things that don't need potable water."
"And another thing to of note is, you know, how much water is this?"
"Like, you know, each household Greywater system like does it really--will it really impact California water?"
And if we look at--this is millions of gallons per day of savings.
"If people take that water and irrigate outside, you can look at just from washing machines, how many millions of gallons you'd save, showers and washers and then all Greywater."
And I wanted to point you to one number that 10% column.
"If just 10% of people--and this is just Southern California--re-use their Greywater to irrigate plants outside, that would off-set the need for a medium sized desalinization plant."
"But that's the same thing as s squared over s squared, plus a squared over s squared."
"So it's s squared plus a squared, over s squared, y is equal to minus e to the minus st, times this whole thing, sine of at, minus 1 over s squared, cosine of at."
"And now, this right here, since we're doing everything with respect to dt, this is just a constant, right?"
So we can say a constant times the antiderivative is equal to this.
This is as good a time as any to evaluate the boundaries.
Right?
"If this had a t here, I would have to somehow get them back on the other side."
"Because the t's are involved in evaluating the boundaries, since we're doing our definite integral or improper integral."
So let's evaluate the boundaries now.
"And we could've kept them along with us the whole time, right?"
And just factored out this term right here.
But anyway.
So let's evaluate this from 0 to infinity.
And this should simplify things.
"So the right-hand side of this equation, when I evaluate it at infinity, what is e to the minus infinity?"
"Well, that is 0."
We've established that multiple times.
"And now it approaches 0 from the negative side, but it's still going to be 0, or it approaches 0."
What's sine of infinity?
"Well, sine just keeps oscillating, between negative 1 and plus 1, and so does cosine."
Right?
So this is bounded.
So this thing is going to overpower these.
"And if you're curious, you can graph it."
This kind of forms an envelope around these oscillations.
"So the limit, as this approaches infinity, is going to be equal to 0."
"And that makes sense, right?"
These are bounded between 0 and negative 1.
And this approaches 0 very quickly.
So it's 0 times something bounded between 1 and negative 1.
"Another way to view it is the largest value this could equal is 1 times whatever coefficient's on it, and then this is going to 0."
So it's like 0 times 1.
Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.
"Now, which would you rather be?"
"A grid, or manifest destiny?"
Manifest destiny.
(Laughter)
It's a big deal.
"It sounds big, it sounds important, it sounds solid."
It sounds American.
"Ballsy, serious, male."
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.
"I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day."
"We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?"
"Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one."
"And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle."
(Laughter)
Why?
Why?
Why do you want to do that?
Why do we all want to do that?
I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.
(Laughter)
"It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are."
So we're going to go straight into this.
Can I have the lights off for a moment?
"I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution."
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.
"One very young, one a little more mature."
"This is the work of a firm called SHoP, and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park."
Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?
"Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it."
"This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building?"
No.
"Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""The River Wild."""
"Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway were in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" together."
"And Anne Hathaway and Julia Roberts were in ""Valentines Day."""
We're going to do this as a little bit of a quiz so I'm going to mark each of these edges as something that you need to visit.
You need to visit all of them.
I strongly suggest that you actually check them off as you go because it's really easy to do one twice or forget one by accident.
"So this is what I want you to do, I want you to go through and start at Meryl Streep and move along the green lines here at the movies and each time you visit a movie, check it off as you go."
So the right answer in this quiz is to have all the edges checked off and none of them checked off twice.
"It's really easy to mess that up, so be very careful."
"And then when you're done, I want you to mark the little bubble corresponding to which actor you end up with at the end of your path."
You can follow any path that you want--you just have to make sure that you visit each of the movies once.
All right!
I'd like you to actually go and do this and check off the actor that you end up with.

These people started a peaceful protest en route to Tahrir Square
The Army APCs appeared and started crushing the protesters 15 people were crushed at the on-ramp of the bridge
"They made 3 passes at the protesters, and fired live ammunition against the people"
"That's what has happened right now, and the army are still hitting people out on the roads"
This is the brain matter of a protester that got crushed by an APC
These are the remains of a friend that an APC ran over
Voice:
And zero ends three.
[sound].
"And now the problem is, we've changed which path is the shortest one."
"We added ten to the top path and only five to the bottom path and as a result, they've reversed."
So now the bottom path ST is actually the shorter one.
"So if you run Dijkstra on this graph, it's going to come with the path ST even though that's not in fact the shortest path in the original network, the one that we actually care about."
"Okay, so that's why you can't just naively reduce shortest path with negative edge lengths to shortest paths with non-negative edge"
lengths.
"Moreover on this very same, super simple thre e node graph, You know, we can try to run, running dikes for shortest path algorithm."
It's perfectly well defined.
It will produce some output.
But it's actually going to be wrong.
"It is not going to compute shortest path distances, correctly in this graph."
So let me show you why.
Unless of course initialization will work as it always does.
So it's gonna start by saying the shortest path distance from S to itself is zero via the empty path.
"And then, what's it going to do next?"
"It's going to say well we need to enlarge the set capital X by one vertex and there are two crossing edges, it's the"
XV edge and the ST edge.
And what's it going to do.
It's going to use the
Dijkstra Greedy score.
"So the score of this upper edge is going to be one, and the score of this bottom edge."
Is going to be negative two.
"'Cause remember, you take the previously computed shortest path [inaudible] of the tail, that's zero in both cases."
And then you add the edge lengths.
"So the edge lengths are one and minus two, so the scores are one and minus two."
Which of these is smaller?
"Well evidently, the ST arc has the smaller score minus two."
So what is Dijkstra's algorithm gonna do?
"It's going to say yes, let's go for this edge ST."
Let's bring T into the set capital X. T is now part of the conquered territory.
The blood of your children is valuable.
It's going to unite us in our path.

"Hi, I'm Robbie Shoepepper, and I am a student assistant here at the Alden Library Learning Commons."
"I provide services such as renting out laptops, renting out peripherals for your computer, and giving you you're key for your study room."
This is also a great place for your technology questions and troubleshooting.
I hope you come to the desk and have a nice day.
So far i have made a number of videos discussing Jehovah's Witnesses and their anti-blood doctrine.
And inevitably whenever i make one of these videos about blood Jehovah's Witness will challenge me and say something along the lines of
"Look Brian, we're just doing what the Bible plainly and clearly teaches."
It plainly says don't take blood.
"And if the Bible says don't take blood, we're not going to take blood."
It's as simple as that.
Now... what i like to do to challenge this overly simplistic reading of the scriptures.
"And i would like to start in Matthew chapter 5, starting in verse 27."
"We're Jesus says ""you have heard it said, do not commit adultery,"
"but i'll tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfuly has already committed adultery with her in his heart."""
"Jesus goes on and say ""if your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and trow it away."""
So do you apply that overly simplistic reading of the scriptures to this verse in Mathew chapter 25?
if you would look at a woman lustfuly would you gauge your eye out and then you throw away? well i'm guessing that you as a Jehovah's Witness wouldn't do that because
i know a lot of Jehovah's Witnesses and i never met a single one who has only one eye.
"Now, it's interestant to me that you properly apply the rules of scripture interpretation"
"to this in Matthew chapter 5, but you offer this overly simplistic view"
Net short term effect on the state's budget?
Zero or worse.
It is not about the budget.
It is really not.
"It is not about the budget in Wisconsin, it is not about the budget in Florida, it's not about the budget in Ohio, it is not about the budget in Michigan."
"But what Michiganders know, and what Michiganders have been trying to get the rest of the country to pay attention to, is that what these Republicans are doing in the states, is not just 'not about the budget'."
It's about something way worse than that.
Stay with me for a moment here.
There is more to this.
This is our house.
Kill the bill.
This is our house.
Kill the bill.
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Why are these people in Michigan so loud?
Why are these people in Michigan so mad?
"Not just because they haven't won yet, like the protesters in Wisconsin have, it's because Michigan Republicans are telling them, that they are about to lose their right to elect local government."
The governor's just going to take care of that from now on.
"See, the governor knows best."
"This whole democracy thing, turns out, it's very inefficient."
And haven't you heard?
There's a crisis.
"Big government conservatism gets really, really, really astonishingly big."
That's next.
"The Michigan House has already passed, and the Michigan Senate is about to pass a bill that sounds like it is out of a dystopian leftist novel from the future."
"If you think that Republican governors around the country are using fiscal crisis as a pretext, to do stuff they wouldn't otherwise want to do, this is something I don't think I every would have believed Republicans even wanted to do."
But this is what they're proposing.
"This hasn't really gotten much national attention, but please just check this out."
"Governor Rick Snyder's budget in Michigan is expected to cut aid to cities and towns, so much, that a lot of cities and towns in Michigan are expected to be in dire financial straights."
"Exactly, so there's just nothing there."
"These guys are grass finishing, they go literally from here..."
In fact 12 of these are going to go to slaughter tomorrow.
"So they go directly from here, right to the abattoir."
What do you do in the winter?
Cause obviously the pasture isn't available in the winter.
At least in most of the continental US.
"Yeah, what happens is, with this grazing management, we're able to stockpile grass, just by not allowing them to graze late in the season, into the winter."
"The average farm in our area feeds hay 120 days a winter, we feed hay only 40 days a winter."
"We've greatly reduce the amount of hay we have to feed, which is less hay we have to make,"
less hay we have to feed.
How do you do that?
"By controlling the grazing with moving the animals everyday to a new paddock, and allowing rest periods to deny access to certain pastures late in the season so that it just stands on the stalk going into the winter."
It's OK to eat that fresh.
"Absolutely, even when it frosts, and it turns brown it's still better than hay."
So that's what we do going into the winter.
"You are able to cut it down to two thirds, the amount of hay that they require?"
"Yes, yes."
And this is something that most typical beef producers could do if they chose to.
Everyone of them.
Relatively easily.
From Florida to...
"What's interesting is, it doesn't have anything to do with latitude, because the average farmer in Florida feeds hay for 120 days a year."
"In illinois, 120 days a year."
"In Saskatchewan, 120 days a year."
It's part of the job description.
Cattle farmer: feed hay 120 days a year.
"If you can manage the grazing so that you can get that hay out, it greatly affects your bottom line because that's all mechanically harvested, stored..."
"When they're in the hay feeding season, whatever the time that is, is it necessary to supplement with grains or anything like that?"
That's what many beef raisers will tell you.
"And vigorously so, and deny that there's any other way that is possible or practical."
I wonder if you could address that?
"What do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the world greatest husband"
"Please, I was there when you were flirting with exgirlfriend, and neglected to tell her you were married."
I was there when you were trying to hook up with that waitress the day before you got engaged.
"And I was definitely there when you were hooking with that nasty ass stripper at ""Boobies, Boobies, Boobies""."
That wasn't me that was you!
"Yeah, I know, but I told her my name was Turk"
"The point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife,'cause you were trying to hang out with me"
"You know, maybe it's time you start acting like a real husband"
Stop acting like some sort of crazy cowboy
A cowboy?
"I don't know, it just came to me"
"You know I'm right, Turk"
When your pride 's at stake* you can't help but have questions
Just tell me how did you know what was bothering her?
"Tell me now, so we don't have to talk anymore, never."
"How is it that no man understands that every woman, whether she's 16 or 60, still has that awkward, insecure, self-conscious teenage girl inside of her?"
"A lot of time, the answer is about sacrifice"
"I was thinking, you'd rather just stay in tonight."
"You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?"
You are trying to smile?
You're so damned cute.
"Sometimes, sacrifice is only wearing a new uni when you are not at work"
"Okay, how about this one,Three blue-jays fly into a bar &amp;amp; they say, ""we just want to wet out beaks*"
"No, sorry Dan, you tell one"
"Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride..."
"JD, could you hand me the wine, please?"
Turk is not talking to me
"But ulitmately, big or small, sacrifices is about doing something you really don't want to do"
"Hey guys, I know we talked about this before , but I'm moving out"
Really
"I mean, you guys need your space"
Thanks man
"Of course, the House of Representatives is very difficult there."
We're going to try to do more briefings and increase the bipartisan support for the program.
We have had some very encouraging republican interest shown recently in response to a lobby day that we did in
"February, and we'll keep working the Senate very aggressively."
"So, Bob thanks very much for those comments, and we'll have to watch closely for that $24 million set-aside for multi-family housing."
We'll watch how that plays out.
We just don't have the details right now.
Bob:
Right.
I'm aware.
Brad:
"So, I think that brings us to the end."
We have not received any further questions or comments.
We've had several people who have inquired about talking points for the member letter for the Senate.
"We'll be reaching out to you in the next several days, and yes we will send talking points out."
"That will be a very quick turn-around, and we do appreciate your help with that."
"We will have the audio portion on the NASCSP website no later than the end of the week, and we will have the slides available as well."
"Many, many thanks to our two guests who joined us today, Steve Capanna from the White House, and"
Elyse Wasch with Senator Jack Reed.
Senator Reed a great champion and she is the Senator's Legislative
"Director, and thanks to my colleague Arley Johnson, Director of Government Relations, and to Mark"
Schmeissing for your excellent presentation on CSBG.
And thanks also to Alice Gaston for her help in putting the webinar together.
"And thank you, our audience, for your patience for staying with us for almost 90 minutes."
We hope this was useful.
"We welcome your comments, and we'll take a survey of everyone who was on the line, and we apologize again for any audio difficulties at the beginning."
"Technology is always a work in progress, and we'll see that the next time around we don't encounter those problems."
Thank you for joining us.
Please let us know what you think of this presentation and enjoy the rest of your day.
Good afternoon.
Welcome back.
"For example, on the sculptures, there are 3 crescents, swastika, latin cross, inverted cross or moon and stars of the Turkish flag"
"When retouching or drawing onto them, it gives you the impression of supernatural things."
I'm not trying to give a message or
I don't have a political stance.
"That swastika is standing there actually for ignoring that, it becomes a figure in the picture or a character in the story."
It's the same with the signature.
For me there are 2 types of signature.
Signutare seems like artist's ownership in the work.
I don't believe that signutare is important.
I think the artist is like a screw.
The actual important thing is the artwork itself.
Artwork is like a gun or a toy.
"As I said before, the big signatures that I make, are like symbols and for ignoring this behaviour."
I use the handwritings in the same way
"For example, if there's an empty part in the picture, the handwriting might come right there, I write my name etc."
"If there's not a catchy sentence or word,"
I can simply wirte my name there.
It can be offensive for someone but at them same time it's pretty.
I will do the thing that I want to do with the painting here in this room.
"I will make copies, put them onto the wall, there will be a small video..."
"There's a video that I made, it will be here etc..."
"I collect images from google and make collages with these images,"
I will put them here as well.
These were going to be big sculptures.
"I actually wanted them to be bigger, but still, they are still a reference."
"When we went to see Derya with the paintings,"
she recommended us to show them to Christina and Nesrin.
One night we went to meet them at Galata with paintings.
"They got surprised actually, because normally people do this representation with pdf files or books."
"It was a nice evening though, we liked eachother and we decided to do the exhibition right on that evening."
"I will attend to an exhibition soon, in Koln."
"It's not ready yet, I'm on process"
So it's an open invitation.
"And, you know, when we—Cuba is accused of harboring terrorists."
"And when we look at the role of the United States and the United States government vis-à-vis Cuba, the United States government and the ClA have encouraged, trained, sent individuals to not only disrupt the Cuban economy by killing tourists, placing bombs in restaurants and hotels, but to assassinate Fidel Castro, and individuals who admitted that they were involved in the downing of a Cuban airliner in 1973."
I'm talking about Posada Carriles.
"Here was a man who made the open admission, trained by the ClA, harbored by the United States."
"When he was found in the United States, did the United States prosecute him for those crimes?"
No.
"They, on a pretext, prosecuted him for lying to the FBl, all right? and acquitted him of that."
AG:
"I wanted to go back to Assata Shakur when she was here, when she was imprisoned."
"This is a clip of a documentary, Eyes On the Rainbow:"
The Assata Shakur Documentary.
"In this, Assata Shakur talks about her experience in prison."
AS:
"*Prisons are big business in the United States,*"
"*and the building, running and supplying of prisons has become the fastest-growing industry in the country.*"
"*Factories are moving into the prisons, and prisoners are forced to work for slave wages.*"
*This super-exploitation of human beings has meant the institutionalization of a new form of slavery.*
"*Those who cannot find work on the streets are forced to work in prison.*"""
AG:
That was Assata Shakur in the film Eyes On the Rainbow:
The Assata Shakur Documentary.
"Lennox Hinds, you went to court to change the prison conditions that Assata Shakur was in after she was arrested."
Describe what happened to her after she was arrested.
"I mean, she was near death."
LH:
She was near death.
She was chained to her hospital bed.
"After she recovered, she was placed in an all-male prison."
She was under 24-hour surveillance by male prison guards who were watching and monitoring her very personal needs during that time period.
"We went into federal court and challenged the conditions of her confinement, where she was kept in solitary confinement for two years."
We won that case.
You're violating copyright.
I also encourage you to look at the other textbooks and don't worry about which edition it is.
The fundamentals are the same.
"So choose a reference for yourself, but please recognize I'm not following any specific textbook, page by page."
"If I were, this class wouldn't be very useful you know."
So I am doing the
"Essence of Finance at an introductory level, but you need to have some references and there are several options."
So make a choice soon.
Finally the material that is kind of come second in importance to the videos is all the assignments and I've talked enough about them.
But I would encourage you again to do the assignments.
Try them even before looking at the video.
"You k now, that's a, that's a kind of a challenge to try to understand what's going on."
Test yourself all the time.
"I'm going to now, talking about this thing, I'm going to move over to how do we evaluate."
Why are we evaluating you?
"Because we will give you a certificate, and the certificate has to have some criteria, right?"
I'm not a big fan of grading.
"In fact, I feel that's the least enjoyable part of my life, and partly because it's kind of boring, but also because who am I, You know."
"I mean you are learning, you should be able to grade yourself, and so on."
But the world is complex so lets talk about evaluation for a second.
"It'll be pass, fail."
So how do I determine pass or fail?
"You'll get a certificate if you pass, you will not get a certificate."
So my grading philosophy is very simple.
"It's not mine, it's borrowed from my reading of grading in particular."
"And basically the notion here is, do you know enough?"
Rather than do you get 100%.
So in each assignment.
You have to get 70%.
"If you don't get 70 percent on any one assignment, you cannot get a certificate."
"Similarly you have to get 70 percent on the final, which is in the last week."
"You don't have an assignment in the last week, but you have a final."
I am doing my best.
Please don't be long.
Your absence makes it even more unbearable.
- I'll be on my way soon.
- When is your flight?
"Okay, dear."
See you tomorrow.
"- I love you, my love."
- Me too.
I love you too.
Your grandma is saying hello.
- Vural?
- I've heard.
Thank you.
They won't rob our truck I hope.
He said the park is open 7/24.
"It not only has audio, video and images, but for the first time, it's a broadcasting medium that can except a whole lot of text."
"So, there's a whole lot of stuff typically going on at once."
Its also a great interruption system.
"It's feeding us messages, alerts, our access notices, tweets, Facebook updates all the time and again that's one of its powers as a medium, but it's also very distracting."
"And finally, and due to many of those, its encouraging a constant multitasking, constant juggling of visual stimuli as well as actual jobs."
So I think it's all those things combined.
PETER NORVlG:
"Now one of things that stuck me, you cite Maryanne Wolfe, whose an expert in this area, and she says 'the web returns us to the time of scritura continua', which is like the Latin script where there are no spaces in between words and supposedly its an additional cognitive task to be able to separate that out into spaces and so deciding not to click on a link is this additional cognitive blow."
"Now ironically, that paragraph had a footnote at the end of it."
And looking up that footnote took me about twenty to thirty times longer than it would've taken if I would've had that book online and really got me out of the flow and I got really distracted.
(Laughter)
"And I also wanted to say that from what I know of the task of word segmentation, it's really not that difficult."
That Chinese and Japanese don't have spaces between words; they have no problem doing that.
I have a little example from my text book where I have a ten line program that does word segmentation with ninety percent accuracy.
So that not really so bad and maybe hyperlinks are so bad either.
"And maybe, its that we have to train ourselves that"
How much commercial relationship do we have?
There's the point of maintaining our values and doing things in a way that represents our values and be where people are.
There's often no easy answer.
In the past we had voted we will go where people are.
That's how we have impact.
We could be an open source project.
We were a very successful open source project in 1999 where we had thousands of people already contributing to Mozilla.
We were irrelevant to the marketplace.
We were irrelevant to consumers' lives and irrelevant to citizen's lives.
And we changed that with Firefox by consciously deciding to go where people are.
"We even did a commercial relationship with Google and Yahoo, which of course turned out after the fact to be what sustains us going forward."
But we did those commercial relationships because we wanted their searchs and we thought that they would be good.
"Now, after the fact, it turns out they generated the money that allows us to grow."
So sustainability is also an important piece.
How do you build those relationships in a way that have Mozilla values in them?
We've done that before and we'll continue to do that.
And now I'm trying to think about...
Do we wanna have questions?
Has everybody asked the questions they have?
I can keep talking or we can go on to questions.
"I do wanna close at the end, but go ahead."
[Question]
So we knew that... so we shipped Firefox 4...
"Firefox 1, in November 2004 and we had a goal of, I don't know, 10 million downloads in 30 days, which we past in 10 days."
So we knew by December that the amount of money we would be getting was beyond our expectations.
We didn't know how far it would go.
"So we had been hoping to be able to generate enough revenue to sustain those 10 people, or 12 people."
"At the time, we didn't even know how to sustain those."
"By January 1st, we knew that we would be able to do that."
The response to Firefox 1 was sort of the stuff of dreams.
"Now, it turns out, those were also stressful times."
What happened?
Thank you.
Thank you.
"My name is Marianne Thieme and I'm a Member of Parliaments for the Party for the Animals in the Netherlands, and our party is the very first in the world to champion the rights of non-humans in a national parliament."
"However, there are other problems in the world aside from animal welfare."
So tonight I am going to tell you some very hard truths about what we are doing to our planet.
And I am so pleased that you are ready to face up to these realities ...
"If you look at the ten hottest years ever measured, they have all occurred in the last fourteen years."
The world is heating up fast and we have ourselves to blame.
Global warming is real and we humans are almost certainly the cause.
"Global warming, that's the world's greatest current concern."
Everyone finds themselves in its grip.
From scientists to politicians to the
Secretary General of the UN and even Leonardo di Caprio.
We face a convergence of crises.
Industrial civilisation has caused irreparable damage.
"By the middle of the century, there may be 150 million environmental refugees."
"Not only is it the 11th hour, it's 11.59."
"But, it's that other film, made by Nobel Prize Winner Al Gore, which has truly succeeded in putting this global problem on the map."
An Inconvenient Truth was a real wake-up call to the world!
This was a great achievement for Al Gore.
"However, he forgot something rather important."
The consequences of global warming are enormous.
The climate researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have estimated that by the year 2100 one to three billion people will be in dire need of fresh water.
Hunger will increase throughout large parts of the globe.
"So, it should come as no surprise that global warming is currently our foremost concern."
Everyone who has seen Al Gore's film knows that our Earth is in bad shape.
Greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced.
This is on the agenda of every world leader.
The causes of global warming must be dealt with now.
And so together we must identify the greatest emitters of greenhouse gasses in our society.
What do you think?
What are the sources of greenhouse gasses?
- And where else can you be found on the Internet?
Twitter? facebook?
"- Well, my Facebook account already died, but"
"I am always on Twitter. @FioreAlvarez, you find me there all the time."
"- Do you have some anecdote in your blogger - twitter experience, that you could highlight?"
"- Well, something really funny always happens to us because to every event we go, we devirtualize with the people."
"And it is really funny, because you are talking for 20-30 min. with a person, and suddenly you say, Hi I am Fiori Alvarez and the person gets surprised - ""really? so nice!"
"I follow you""."
"So, the relationship becomes so personal that you end up being a friend of a lot of people but, real friends, real solid friendships, as in 2.0 as in ????"
- Thank you Fiorela
"Now, given all this I will now draw a number of pie charts."
I want you to select the one that most closely resembles the distribution over here.
"Just for clarity, party A is depicted in red and party B in blue."
Please select exactly one of those pie charts.
"Basically, there are four methods for conducting a risk analysis."
"And, some of them come out of various guidelines."
ISO has this 13335 standard.
I don't know how many of you are you familiar with that one.
"You know, the one you hear a most about is, you know, 17799 which has now evolved into 27001."
"But, 13335 is guidelines for management of IT security."
"And, these four options that I'm going to talk about are, are, are out of that standard."
And the first one is called the baseline approach.
"And, what the baseline approach does is have you apply a set of controls to achieve some baseline level of protection for all systems."
"And, oftentimes, it's called a gap analysis."
"So, and I'll show, actually, I think it's the very next slide."
"I'll, I'll show you."
I was going to draw a picture.
"But I'll,"
I'll just show you the picture on the next slide.
It should look a lot better than the one I would draw.
"And the list of controls, as you would guess, given that"
ISO promulgated the guidelines for management by security is in the ISO 27001.
So we wanted to also widen the track width of this car.
This car's eight inches wider than a C6 Corvette.
So the track width and the turn-in and everything is so much better.
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
"Every bit of this car is designed the way it is for three specific reasons-- to be as fast as possible, as light as possible, and as simple as possible to fix, because you go to the track to drive, not to wrench."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"AVI Racing's mission was to develop a race car that was user-friendly, extremely reliable, and easy to work on."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
"Removing the complete carbon and fiberglass body work takes two men only six minutes, revealing a skeleton that is more NASCAR than Woodward Avenue."
A tube frame chassis with every bit of racing technology you would ever need lurks underneath.
There's an adjustable brake bias with two master cylinders powering 14-inch Brembo brakes.
"There's a 28-gallon fuel cell, beefed-up [INAUDlBLE] suspension, and a triple-disc clutch."
"It has modular front and rear frame components, which means if you crash, you can replace the entire front or rear section for less than five figures in your own garage."
"Thanks to the ease of access, one man can change a clutch or transmission in under an hour."
"There's ducting, cooling, tons of down force, and massive square-stance 305 section slick tires."
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"Most people think of a race car as a Rolex or a World Challenge 253 $100,000 race car."
"We wanted to develop a track day car for $60,000-- a fraction of the money-- that will compete with those."
MATT FARAH:
And Wayne should know-- he benchmarked the GT1 against his LG Motorspots World Challenge car.
"And without the restrictions World Challenge cars face, the"
GT1 is faster-- much faster.
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"We've taken our years of race car experience and developed an extremely fast, reliable, affordable race car that will compete with the top cars out in a track day."
"It's extremely nimble, it tracks really well, corners extremely well."
It's so stiff that it corners like no other car.
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
Sometimes it is cheaper to buy five little packets of something than to buy one that includes five in the bigger one.
"And like I said, you don't think that that is the way it is going to be, but sometimes buying smaller times the number you need is more cost-effective than buying larger."
"And, if you go to looking you will see that they are doing that more and more now."
Okay?
So something to watch out for.
Then your chapter talks a little bit about warranties and you need to make sure and read those.
I'll tell you we don't buy a whole lot of warranties.
"Usually vehicles, products"
last as long as whatever warranty they are going to sell you.
"So, or whatever warranty comes free."
Usually it is going to make it that far.
I have found that computers is one exception.
We have bought warranties on computers.
When you use them you take them in.
"You know you are at college, you don't have your computer for a couple of months, I don't know."
"As cheap as things get, you just have to weigh the cost of buying a warranty and look at what all it is going to cover."
"Now, the next thing it talks about, it talks about researched based buying."
So many times instead of researching something we just go out and buy it.
"We decide, Oh, I would like to have a new TV !"
"Okay, let's go buy one."
"No, you need to do some research based buying."
Now four phases.
First the
Pre-shopping Activity.
There are things you do before you ever get there.
"Secondly, Evaluating The Alternatives Phase."
Then the Selection and Purchase Phase.
And then the Post-purchase Activities.
And there is a great deal of information given on all four of these different steps.
But phase I. If you will look on page 194 as you are gathering information there on the left you see key websites for consumer product information.
These are places you can go to learn about a product.
And these are from organizations that don't sell advertisements.
The same count rate.
"It doesn't sound like a very interesting experiment, but at that time he was working with a person named Geiger, a post-doc named Geiger."
The same Geiger as the Geiger counter.
And Geiger wasn't too happy about the results of these experiments.
"And in addition,"
Geiger had this undergraduate student hanging around the lab.
This undergraduate named Marsden.
And Marsden was really excited about doing science.
He just hung around there.
He really wanted to do something.
"And Geiger was, jeez, what am I going to do with this guy?"
"Geiger goes to Rutherford and says I've got Marsden here, he really wants to do something, what should I do with him?"
"And Rutherford said well, okay, let's have him build a detector that can swing around that gold sample."
"Let's have him build a detector that will rotate around such that the detector can be positioned this way, so that we can look for any alpha particles that might be backscattered, backscattered meaning scattered back in the direction from which they came."
"And Geiger said ah-ha, this will keep this guy busy and not in my hair."
No problem.
"So he goes down to Marsden,"
Marsden is all excited to build this detector.
"He builds the detector and gets Geiger, okay, we're ready to go."
Let's try this.
And so they put the radium bromide there in this arrangement.
"They're sitting there at the detector and they hear tick, tick, tick, etc."
"Hey, particles at the detector."
"And they go, oh, well, that must just be a general background."
"So what they do then is they take this gold foil away, so that presumably all the particles are going in that direction and they listen and they hear nothing."
And they put the gold foil back.
"And they listen and they hear tick, tick, tick, etc., 20 alpha particles per minute."
"And they then pick another foil, platinum foil, basically the same result."
"They go up to Rutherford, they get him down in the laboratory."
"Rutherford's looking over their shoulder, tick, tick, tick, etc."
"Hey, there are some alpha particles coming off."
Not many.
"Come on, you know, representing sets of integers, this is pretty dumb."
Suppose I want to have a set of characters.
How could I do that?
"Well the idea of a hash, in fact, what's called a hash function is to have some way of mapping any kind of data into integers."
"So let's look at the second example, all right, -- I keep doing that -- this piece of code from here to here gives me a way of now creating a hash table of size 256."
Ord as a built in python representation.
There is lots of them around that takes any character and gives you back an integer.
"In fact, just to show that to you, if I go down here and I type ord, sorry, I did that wrong."
Let me try again.
We'll get to exceptions in a second.
I give it some character.
It gives me back an integer representing.
It looks weird.
Why is three come back to some other thing?
That's the internal representation that python uses for this.
"If I give it some other character, yeah, it would help if I could type, give it some other character."
It gives me back a representation.
So now here's the idea.
"I build a list 256 elements long, and I fill it up with those special characters none."
That's what create is going to do right here.
"And then hash character takes in any string or character, single character, gives me back a number."
Notice what I do.
"If I want to create a set or a sequence representing these things, I simply insert into that list."
It goes through and puts ones in the right place.
"And then, if I want to find out if something's there,"
I do the same thing.
"But notice now, hash is converting the input into an integer."
"So, what's the idea?"
"If I know what my hash function does, it maps, in this case characters into a range zero to 256, which is zero to 255,"
"I create a list that long, and I simply mark things."
And my look up is still constant.
Characters are simple.
lignified carbon sequestration fertilization.
And if every farm in America practiced that we would sequester all the carbon that's been emitted since the beginning of the industrial age in fewer than 10 years.
Wow!
That's how efficacious it is.
"So when you eat your grass finished steak, not only is it good for you, it's good for the whole ecology."
"Is there also a movement in the beef raising industry towards this, because of the increasing demand?"
"Yes, and this is probably growing faster than the pastured poultry, the pastured pork."
Beef is probably growing faster.
"I don't know why, except that probably the beef industry has not been vertically integrated"
like the swine and the poultry industry.
There are still a lot of independent operators out there.
"Whereas the swine and the poultry industry have been, you know, Tyson's and Smithfield, they've vertically integrated it."
"So there's a lot more ability to be creative and move in the beef industry, and for sure there's a tremendous increase."
"And to increase the awareness, what should consumers look for?"
Should they look for grass finished?
Or is that term being bastardized too?
"Well, what they should do is go visit the farm and see."
But many people aren't going to do that.
"Well, they should."
"So that's the first step, visit the farm."
"Yes, visit the farm, see if there's any grain around and ask the farmer, ask around."
"But mainly, visit the farm and see if you see any grain."
"Cause most farmers will say, yeah, they're grass finished but we grain them the last 30 days."
It's more common than not.
"If you hear those terms, that is the cue to find a new farmer."
"That's exactly right, that is the cue."
"The question is, have they ever gotten any grain in their lives?"
Period.
"If the answer is yes, then find a new one."
"I mean, you know, not that there might not be a, for example, we buy a lot of calves."
"We don't know, some of these calves probably got a little bit of grain maybe when they were weaned from the cow, for a week of two."
"But that's way, way back, 12 months ago."
(robotic voice) How do you feel?

I do not understand the question
What is it Spock?
I do not understand the question Mother
You are half human.
The computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
Spock...
"The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings."
"But as my son, you have them."
They will surface.
"As you wish, since you deem them of value."
But I cannot wait here to find them.
Where must you go?
To Earth.
To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
"I do this because I was there,"
Spock.
Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?
I would accept that as an axiom.
"Then you stand here alive because of a mistake made by your flawed, feeling, human friends."
They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the one
-you- was more important to them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
"They do, indeed."
"Hey guys, my name is Tim Schmoyer and it's Wednesday, time for some YouTube tips and advice and this week I want to talk about the new YouTube trailer option that we had to add to our new one channel design that had rolled out like a couple of weeks ago."
"I've actually already talked about this on the ReelSEO channel which you can click right here and go watch that, but I want to take it a little bit further this time, because what I said there is some things that I have observed about what makes channel trailers work well and what kind of doesn't, just based on the limited, you know, interaction I seen with them across several channels that have already implemented it."
And now YouTube's coming out with some best practices that they are seeing as well and actually almost everything I said in that original video is also what YouTube is saying so I feel a little bit proud of myself about that.
But let's look at what they say and then I have another tip to add to the end that I think is very vital and crucial that they don't include.
"But first of all, the first thing they say is to have a very clear call to action to subscribe."
We just showed that at least one player can gain by changing strategy holding others constant.
The same would be true if we went the other way around.
"If we held B constant at 25, A could gain by changing his strategy, could go right over there."
This is not a Nash equilibrium.
"Then regardless of what state we go to, if we go to this state, it's still not a Nash Equilibrium."
"If we hold A constant,"
"B could improve by increasing his production; or if we hold B constant, then A can still improve by cheating even more."
None of these are Nash equilibriums.
"From any one of these states, if you hold A constant,"
"B could produce more; or if you hold B constant,"
A could produce more and get some gain.
"Over here, A's going from 130 to 160 and getting some gain."
You can imagine this keeps happening incrementally.
They keep producing more and more and more.
"We kind of go there, then we go there, then maybe we go there, then we go there."
"Then maybe A cheats some more, then B cheats some more, then A cheats a little bit more,"
"B cheats a little bit more, maybe a little bit more past that, then A cheats a little bit more."
"The whole time the whole economic profit pie, which is the sum of A and B, is getting smaller and smaller until finally A finally cheats and they're at zero economic profit."
Now let's think about whether this is a Nash equilibrium.
"Clearly, they won't want to move backwards."
"If you hold A constant,"
B would not want to move down.
Then he would
lose economic profit.
That doesn't work.
He doesn't gain by doing that.
"If you hold B constant, A wouldn't want to move to the right."
A would also lose economic profit.
Now you might say what if they produced beyond 37.5?
Why can't they keep producing and go beyond there?
"Holding A constant, if B were to produce more than 37.5 from this state right over here, then the total pie will get negative and it doesn't matter if B's getting a larger or smaller chunk of that pie."
B's chunk is going to be negative.
And yet what we are doing about?
Our State Department isn't making peaceful contact
So we must.
Our Department of Energy is not funding non-classified projects dealing with these  science and technologies
So we must
And certainly the Pentagon is not disclosing this information and therefore
We must.
So this returns this whole issue to perhaps where it should be
"And that's us, we the people"
And not just the people of America or of Europe
But of Africa and India and China.
"Every man, woman and child on earth has a stake in this."
The Disclosure of this information will enable us to move forward as a People
With all the science and technology that we need to have thousands of years of abundance and peace on this planet.
This is really what this is about and I hope you will help us.
Thank you very much.
"So if 2π radians is one full circle 360°, what do you think will be 1π radian or just π radians."
Can you tell me where in the circle you would wind up if you walk 1π radians?
Select the appropriate check box.
"Fifteen years ago, if anybody would have told me"
"I'd be standing in front of you guys talking about food,"
I would have said they're totally nuts.
"Because I was in Texas, in business school, on a full scholarship."
"I was about to graduate as the top woman in my class, and I was being recruited by Enron, (Laughter) and the oil and gas industry."
I so wasn't a foodie.
"But I was so type A, and I channeled that into academia, and what I decided to do - I wasn't really interested in Enron, thank goodness - and I decided to go into the investment world as an analyst, and I covered the food industry."
"And I was so completely inept at this whole food thing that when Martha Stewart came through our offices bringing her company public, and everybody had her sign the cookbooks,"
I had her sign the financial statements.
(Laughter)
I couldn't cook.
"So when my husband and I decided to move here 12 years ago,"
I traded the briefcase for a diaper bag.
"He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing."
He's looking for those genes as well.
"And I said, ""Well, if you can find those,"
"I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."""
And so he agreed.
And so that's what we're looking into.
"If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it."
"Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand."
"But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing."
"But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand."
"It has the three fingers, the three digits."
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
"We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,"
like the archaeopteryx.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
"And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail."
"But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it."
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
"So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus."
(Laughter)
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
But it's just the very basics.
So that really is what we're doing.
"And people always say, ""Why do that?"
Why make this thing?
"What good is it?"""
"Well, that's a good question."
"Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things."
"And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece."
They targeted Harry Belafonte.
They targeted Eartha Kitt.
"They targeted anyone who supported the struggle for civil rights, that they considered to be dangerous."
It is in that context we need to look at what happened on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973.
"What they call Joanne Chesimard, what we know as Assata Shakur, she was targeted by the FBl, stopped."
And the allegation that she was a cold-blooded killer is not supported by any of the forensic evidence.
"If we look at the trial, we'll find that she was victimized, she was shot."
She was shot in the back.
The bullet exited and broke the clavicle in her shoulder.
She could not raise a gun.
She could not raise her hand to shoot.
And she was shot while her hands were in the air.
"Now, that is the forensic evidence."
There is not one scintilla of evidence placing a gun in her hand.
No arsenic residue was found on her clothing or on her hands.
"So, the allegation by the state police that she took an officer's gun and shot him, executed him in cold blood, is not only false,  but it is designed to inflame."
JUAN GONZÁLEZ:
"But, Mr. Hinds, before we get into more of the details of the case, this whole issue of 40 years later—"
LENNOX HlNDS:
Yeah.
"UAN GONZÁLEZ: —suddenly branding her a terrorist and also insisting that she is a threat to the United States government at this time, could you talk about the significance of that declaration?"
LH:
"Well, I believe that we have to look at it in the context of what has just happened in Boston."
"I think that with the massacre that occurred there, the FBI and the state police are attempting to inflame the public opinion to characterize her as a terrorist, because the acts that she was convicted of has nothing to do with terrorism."
"The acts that she was convicted of, if you look at the evidence, she was convicted of aiding and abetting, and therefore was present during the shootout."
The FBI and the state police's theory was that Sundiata Acoli shot Officer Foerster.
That was their theory during his trial.
JG:
"One of the people in the car with her, that—"
LH:
"One of the people in the car, yeah."
AG:
"I had two speedlights in the background, one just hanging under the ceiling, attached to a ceiling lamp."
The other one standing on the floor.
"Both shooting into the background, exposing the background so that it's white."
The mannequin standing in the middle in front of it.
The main light coming from left and right.
It's exactly the same setup left and right.
It's a white shoot through umbrella at roughly a height of 1.60 meter.
"Both speedlights, left and right, are on 1/4th, and because I don't want to have a harsh contrast, (there should be nothing in the shadows),"
I also have a fill light right above the camera.
"It's also going through an umbrella, filling in whatever shadows there could be."
"The camera is just on standard settings 1/200s, f/11 for nice sharpness, ISO 200 for good quality."
And that's pretty much it.
"The white balance is set to ""flash"" however, don't trust the white balance."
"I mean, if you do catalogue photos you really really need to have an accurate white balance."
"So shoot with a grey card, ideally even shoot with a color calibration target"
like the color checker passport or something.
"But at least you need a neutral gray target like a gray card, or I used this gray cube and that helps for having exactly the correct white balance."
You really need that.
Alright.
What other tips to I have for you?
"Before you put the clothes onto the mannequin, iron them!"
Use a steam iron.
"It is so much easier to iron clothes, iron out the folds in the clothes with a steam iron than it is to iron them out in photoshop later on."
So do it upfront.
Another thing:
"When you are shooting trousers, put the mannequin up onto a stool."
"That way you don't shoot so much ground, the paper that you have on the ground or whatever floor there is, you are shooting the trousers against the white backdrop."
Just like you shoot the jumpers or the sweaters or whatever you have.
That's already it.
I mean it is really simple.
It's that simple.
"So if you haven't done such a shoot, now you don't have any excuse anymore."
A morning conversation with Andrew Feldmar
"In Vancouver, from where I've just arrived, a woman was being beaten and raped on the street a few weeks ago."
"It took place in a public place in broad daylight; and they were surrounded by a lot of people, who were simply watching them."
"Worse yet, those people were taking pictures of the attack; and the pictures were posted online within 15 minutes."
But nobody!
Nobody came to the lady's aid.
"Well, this is the comparison I see:"
"Agi Gereb is in prison, and life goes on as if nothing has happened."
Control
Over Life and Death
Bio-politics is exactly that
In those situations when I feel weakest: at the time of birth and death; when I lose my sanity or turn ill
"Who, besides me, will make decisions about my life in those situations?"
"It is unregulated; it is absolutely out of control at the moment But not only here, it is that way everywhere."
Instant Fashion
"Insurance companies want a kind of psychotherapy, which would heal us in three, four, five hours at most."
"Speed and efficiency are our newest fashions, and they are often tied to things that are good."
"But, then again Is it better to make love fast than doing it slow?"
Space
Time
Control
"The ancient Greeks had two words for time, one was called 'Kronos', which is our 'clock time' and the other is 'Kairos'."
Kairos is the point in time at which apricot ripens.
"The answer to the question 'When will we harvest the apricot?' is not 'Friday at five', but rather 'When it ripens'."
"Kronos was a giant, who ate his own children."
So even the ancient Greeks knew that measuring time with a clock is cruel.
It is absolutely cruel.
"Therefore, it is utterly cruel to speed up the birth process or induce it without waiting for the moment when the 'apricot ripens'."
Love and gentleness can never be effective in such regard.
When my daughter was born - our second child - the doctor was impatient to leave on a sailing trip; and he accused my wife of having a 'lazy uterus'.
He found it much too slow.
"And of course, he gave her Oxytocin and she was made to push the baby out very quickly."
"I really want to communicate a message with everybody, I'd just tell everybody."
I certainly wouldn't pick languages that die off and things that are temporary.
-Thomas Payne made a very good argument that god would never use anything written to communicate a message.
-I happen to agree.
Maybe god knows something that I don't.
Maybe there really is some benefit to vaguely inspiring inviduals to write down those important messages on manuscripts that get lost and destroyed in languages that change and die.
But somehow I've missed the obvious benefit of all that.
-Right.
"If god really wanted to do that, he could have."
"But apparently he was unaware of this technology when he wrote with his finger, according to the bible, on stone tablets, the 10 commandments."
This is in Exodus.
"Instead, he used magic lightweight invisible crumble-stone."
Where do we get that?
"Well, it's magic because he made it."
"It's lightweight because Moses carried, a 90-year-old guy, was carrying them up and down the mountains."
"-But back then, 90 was like 20."
-I guess so.
"And invisible because we don't have any trace of them today and crumble-stone because they all broke, supposedly."
And god seems to have some issues with metal.
He hates these molten calves that they make of images of little calves that people were worshipping.
And he just thinks that's really awful.
And this is one of your favorites.
"In Judges 1:19,"
"'And the lord was with Judah, and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron.'"
Spooky.
Spooky.
"So, mostly likely the mythology surrounding the stone tablets was a coveting of some other stone tablets somewhere else, the Code of Hammurabi, dating to 1772 BCE, that currently exist, for real, unlike the stone tablets of Jewish"
law.
These are housed in the Louvre museum in Paris.
I've seen them.
"-Although to be fair, the 2nd set of stone tablets supposedly still exist, hidden away in the ark which supposedly still exists in a location that only the devout are aware of."
"Nice open format there, god."
"I can go only one way, there's 2 exits, there's one in the lower left corner and there's one in the upper right."
"And as you saw, the maze itself will turn according to where the ball is positioned, so you have a better view of where you are and where you're going to."
You will also notice there are green cubes and there are red cubes.
"The red cubes are those that can't be accessed, and the green cubes can be accessed."
"What I didn't put into this maze but is possible, are one-way cubes: you can go into them one way, but you can't come out of them the same way (you can't go back)."
What I didn't put into them are prison cubes: you can go into them but you can't get out.
"And what I didn't put into the maze are rewards, where I need to hunt through the entire maze, to collect rewards before I am allowed to leave."
That's all possible in the proof of concept.
"And of course, I can go back to the original position of the ball."
"In the mean time, there's a position counter here that says where I am, that shows in which bar and cube I am."
"I'm now in bar 18 cube 1, when I go up I'm in bar 19, still cube 1."
I go back:
I wind up in cube 0.
"I go up: and I wind up in 0.0, which is exactly where I need to be."
That's it.
I hope you enjoyed this.

We begin to pursuit the way to each other
Looking for live together with each other
Each of us always having question and looking for the answer
When we will meet each other?
No matter how long distance from here
Or passing through endless time
The remaining time of my life
I knew and believed that we will be together
Where are you?
And who you are?
Where are you?
I'm waiting for you... you really exist in my faith
We are born this way.... to be each other's soul mate
This is the instruction from above
Bestowed to us and across in someday this life
And then this 1 is right over here.
"So now, I think we are ready to think about what would happen if we wanted to make 50 houses."
So let's try to do that.
Let me do that in orange.
This right over here is our 50th house.
So this is the shared left wall it has.
This is the 50th house right over here.
So how many total toothpicks for 50 houses?
"So if we have 50 houses, well, we can use the pattern that we came up with."
"It's going to be equal to, starting with our 6, the first house requires 6."
"And then we're going to add 5 for each incremental house, so plus 5 for each incremental house."
And how many incremental houses are there going to be?
"Well, there are going to be 50 minus 1 incremental houses."
Why minus 1?
"Well, you already built one of them with the 6."
Then for every extra one-- so there's going to be 49 extra houses-- you're going to add 5 toothpicks apiece.
So this is going to be equal to 6 plus 5 times 49.
And that is 245.
So 6 plus 245 is equal to 251 sticks.
And what's really neat about this pattern we just came up with is you could use it to figure out how many sticks you would need for a million of these little toothpick townhouses.
What is hypothesis testing in the constant expected return models?
So what are the kinds of things that we can test hypotheses about?
"So our model says continuously compounded returns are equal to a constant mean return plus a random, noise component that represents news that enters the market."
"This noise component is assumed to be, independent identically distributed as a normal random variable with mean zero and a constant volatility."
"And we also assume that covariances, contemporary covariances between assets are constant."
As well.
So there are a number of things that we could test in this model.
So here are some examples of. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Possibly interesting hypothesis test.
We can test for specific values.
"For example, we can test hypothesis that the mean return is equal to some particular value."
For example we can say we want to test hypotheses that the mean return on
Microsoft is two percent per month.
Spent the whole day running around the museum.
It was awesome.
I had a wonderful time.
- I went to the Secular Student Alliance Leadership Conference in Columbus where I helped poison the minds of the current and future leaders of the secular movement.
- Good for you.
- All in a day's work.
- Okay.
The devil must be very happy.
- Yes!
"- Today I have yet another installment of my Failures of Chritianity series, and I've"
"- Which we could do forever, by the way."
- That's right.
So we're just scratching the surface.
I'm up to number 8 today.
"The idea here is there's so many failures, how could there possibly be a god behind all this?"
Or maybe there is.
I don't know.
"Previously, I've talked about the failure of christian based abortion policy, the christian genocide of the Jews, the failure of the catholic pedophilia scandal, the failure of prayer, the failure of the 2nd coming, the failure of social engineering, failure of biblical morality, and today I'm going to talk about the failure of"
'christian science'.
Got to put that in quotes.
So what is chrisitan science versus real science?
"Well, christians supposedly worship the creator of the universe, the creator of the earth that created all human beings, all animals, and supposedly the bible is divinely inspired and sort of written by the hand of god indirectly."
"And, supposedly, he talks to christians through prayer, and supposedly he knows everything."
He's omniscient.
"So you would think that there'd be all sorts of interesting facts about the way the world works in the bible and believers would know all these things, and there'd be all sorts of special insights there."
But that's just not the case.
"What qualifies as science in the bible would fit on about 4 pages, comments about he nature of reality."
And what is there is almost complely wrong.
It's pretty abysmal.
"So, christians like to use this word 'science' and grab on the coattails of science and use the word 'creation science' and try to make it science-y and make it all better."
And it's really just marketing.
"So, often there's sort of an attempt to steal the work of other people or steal the credit."
For example:
Negative two fifths X equals ten.
In this lesson you will learn to solve linear equations by using the multiplicative inverse.
Let's review.
The equation is similar to a scale.
Both sides of the scale have to be equal in order for the scale to balance.
The properties of equality say that
"I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide the same number  to each side of an equation and it will be true."
"So, to solve the equation X plus two is equal to five,"
I will subtract two from both sides of the equation.
This will still keep the equation equal.
This leaves me with X is equal to three.
"It looks like three is the solution for this equation, but we won't know if it's really a solution until we try it."
"So, let's replace three for X."
"So, in our equation we have X plus two equals five."
"When we replace three for X, we get three plus two equals five."
"Five is equal to five, so three is the solution."
A common mistake that is made when solving equations is not performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.
The multiplicative inverse of a number is the reciprocal of the number.
"So, if I have a number, seventeen-fifths, its inverse is the reciprocal, which would be five-seventeenths."
"When you multiply these two numbers together, you get one."
"So, the multiplicative inverse of the number, times the number, gives you one."
What is the solution of four-thirds X equals four?
"We're going to solve this equation by multiplying  both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of four thirds, which is three-fourths."
"Now, don't forget that three-fourths time four-thirds doesn't cancel out, but it multiplies out to be one."
"So, I'm left with X is equal to twelve over four, or X is equal to three."
"Now, remember, in order for it to be a solution we have to make sure that we place it back in the original equation and it's true."
"So, to check my answer:"
I have four-thirds X equals four.
I'm going to substitute three in for X.
And I get four is equal to four.
"So, three is the solution for this equation."
So that was 2001 when I was fired.
[Question]
Yes.
The question was:
"""The open web is here today it's easy to see why it's important back then in those days before the open web, how did you know?"
"What makes you willing to risk your job?"""
"We'd been working on a browser for a while, so we could tell that the browser was important."
"It was clear at that time, when Microsoft had maybe 90-95% market share in the browser, in the operating system and in the productivity suites,"
"Office and Excel, which were the only things that people used in those days."
"And so it was clear that in those days,"
Microsoft controlled access to the Internet.
We didn't call it the open web then but it was the Internet and we knew it was great.
"It was very clear that by controlling the browser,"
Microsoft controlled how individual people experienced the Internet.
"That the server side of the Internet in those days was developing, growing and becoming richer and more capable."
"But the client side was deteriorating and through that client,"
Microsoft was able to ignore formats to make vast quantities of content unavailable to people.
And to determine the business model through which you could access content and to have an immense influence over the entire structure of the Internet.
So that much was clear.
It sounds melodramatic but the future of the Internet was already an issue at that point.
It was very clear the browser was the leverage point.
We were very clear about our jobs.
"One second, I'm gonna tell a couple of stories and then I'll get you Chris."
But we were very clear that our jobs were on the line.
It wasn't just me.
It was everyone I named and Marcia.
Is Marcia here?
I didn't see her hand go up.
But we would have meanings as the small group that was mozilla.org when the tensions got really high and we would get together and we would say things like
"""What happens if AOL pulls the plug?"
What happens if we're all fired tomorrow?
"How do we keep Mozilla operating?"""
It comes and goes.
"Like this many thing else, comes and goes."
"Like I was saying, just recently, you see the thoughts , they're random."
They're not sequential.
They're not really.. they're random.
"Like I was saying you were thinking, somehow meditating on just being self and then suddenly there is sort of like pizza or something come then after this sort of like 'aha, you know, go shopping in this place' and then 'ha, e-mail to somebody', you know, it's like just coming up like this."
But this kind of thought for you is more seasonal.
"It comes about, because there is something that is grown around this thought, that seems"
like it is intensely got some kind of nectar promise in it.
"But now, you're aware this now."
Because the fruit of this attachment or activity is that you're not happy about it.
You're not happy with it.
You're not happy with it.
Nobody is happy with it.
"Because you've the power to dream , but you don't have the power to make your dream come true."
Whatever we might think.
"If you've the power to decide what should appear in your life, Ok?"
"You're the architect and designer, everything that happens to you."
"Then, you , with that, all of you will be clear about who you're or something, if this is what you want."
Or you wouldn't include anything that is uncomfortable as an experience.
You will go all for chocolates flavored moments.
"So, something is, life takes that away from you."
You don't have this power.
"You may dream, but the purpose of life, is not to fulfill or to satisfy your projections."
"So, that is a wisdom in this and a maturity to learn to let go of that."
That these dreams they're depleting of your energy.
And brings in the state of confusion.
"So, what I'm pointing you to, is only the space of the awareness within which the story of , this kind of romance, and what this kind of images come and then another image come also, and it passes."
Something else comes.
Momentary attention passes.
"Innumerable thoughts , waves of , tsumani of thoughts come and they don't stick because you've no interest."
"But, some come and they stick."
"They had a server tag which resembled their script tag, which caused stuff to run on the server, and they had a write function which would cause the insertion of whatever text you were writing into the HTML output stream."
So it had all of the vulnerabilities that PHP has.
"It had all the disadvantages of the other template system plus, at the time, a pretty slow JavaScript engine."
That product was eventually withdrawn and replaced with J2EE.
"What if we did it right, instead, this time?"
We have one of those opportunities in history where we can try it again and this time get it right.
What if we had server side JavaScript with an event loop?
Not a template system but an event loop.
"Well, it turns out we've got it."
We already have it.
"It's node.js, which runs on top of V8."
"It implements a web server in a JavaScript event loop, and it is brilliant."
It is a very high performance event pump.
"It can take events and move them really fast through its event queue, in and out and across the world."
"Not only that, it got READ right."
"Here's the final system read from node.js, and it has a callback function."
"The callback function receives the data that you ask to read, and that's right."
"I mean, we finally have a correctly implemented, correctly designed read function."
"Everything in the node.js API is non-blocking, or should have been."
There are a couple of exceptions.
"One is, it has some synchronous functions which do block."
That's really unfortunate.
I wish they weren't there.
"There are non-blocking versions for most of them, but there shouldn't be any."
It's just too big a hazard.
"The other is, there's a require function that blocks, which is used for loading script."
"That's really unfortunate, I'd like to see that fixed too."
"But otherwise, node.js is just really good stuff."
There are a lot of advantages that come from it.
One is that you can run the same stuff on both sides of the network.
We can take YUI -- the same YUI that you're running in the browser -- and run it in the server.
That means your applications can run on either side.
Listen to this:
It is known now that chocolate is the number one longevity food in the world.
That is known.
"It is the number one food for your heart  according to the research, for your heart."
It's also a great way to party and have a good time  without a hangover.
Chocolate grows across  the temp required that the -- what we call the tropical belt  of the world; from about 20 degrees north latitude  to 20 degrees south latitude.
In that belt.
And it's originally from the Americas:
"Central America,"
"Venezuela, Ecuador."
Most people now believe that chocolate  is originally from the Orinoco river basin of Venezuela.
"That's where the Spanish first rolled into and saw tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands  of wild cacao trees, but no people, 500 years ago."
I searched all over the planet.
I visited shamans asking them  what they thought about chocolate.
"This shaman in the Amazon told me  that you can take the cacao tree bark, peel it off, soak it in ice-cold water."
"It releases the gel in 24 hours, and when you rub that in your scalp, it cures male pattern baldness."
I'm an infopreneur.
"My eyes went into dollar signs,  when I heard that."
"You mean, there is a product that would sell more than chocolate itself, that comes from the chocolate tree?"
And we're researching this right now.
First and foremost I am a researcher.
"That's what I love to do, I love to study, research and look into the data."
"Chocolate is the number one food in magnesium of any food in the world, that is the number one mineral deficiency in the Western world."
"Also, chocolate is the highest  natural source of iron, the highest natural source of manganese and the highest natural source of chromium of any major food in the world."
These are very important minerals  for blood building.
"They're very important for stable blood sugar and, of course, magnesium de-stresses us."
Could we use that?
I think so.
"Chocolate is also extraordinarily rich in phosphorus, zinc and copper."
Zinc and copper for healthy nervous system  and phosphorus for bone.
"We always hear about calcium,  calcium, calcium."
"Phosphorus,  we need that for healthy bones."
"Nomads don't generally produce manufactured goods, which means they need to trade, so they almost always live near settled people."
And 3.
"Because they generally live close to nature and in harsh conditions, pastoralists tend to be tougher than diamond-plated differential calculus."
"Think of the Huns, or the Xiongnu, or the Mongols."
(wild galloping music) Okay.
"Stan, that's enough."
Back to me.
Come.
STAN!
"I AM THE STAR OF THE SHOW, NOT THE MONGOLS!"
Hi.
Sorry about that.
So one last thing.
"Pastoral people also tend to be more egalitarian, especially where women are concerned."
"Paradoxically, when there's less to go around, humans tend to share more, and when both men and women must work, for the social order to survive, there tends to be"
"less patriarchal domination of women, although Mongol women rarely went to war."
I can't tell your gender.
"I mean you've got the pants, but then you also have the [floopity] flop, so that's the technical term, by the way."
I'm [an] historian.
"If you had to choose a pastoral nomadic group to come out of central Asia and dominate the world, you probably wouldn't have chosen the Mongols, because, for most of the history we've been discussing, they just hung out in the foothills, bordering the Siberian forest, mixing herding and hunting, quietly getting really good at archery and riding horses."
"Also, the Mongols were much smaller than other pastoral groups,"
like the Tatars or the Uighurs.
"And, not to get all great man history on you or anything, but the reason the Mongols came to dominate the world really started with one guy, Genghis Khan."
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.
"The story goes that Genghis, or Chinggis, Khan was born around 1162, with the name Temujin, to a lowly clan."
"His father was poisoned to death,"
"leaving Temujin under the control of his older brothers, one of whom he soon killed during an argument."
"By 19, he was married to his first, and most important, wife, Börte, who was later kidnapped."
This was pretty common among the Mongols;
Temujin's mom had also been kidnapped.
"In rescuing his wife, Temujin proved his military mettle and he soon became a leader of his tribe, but uniting the Mongol confederations required a civil war, which he won,"
largely thanks to two innovations.
"Suppose you want to represent sets of strings, well you basically just generalize the hash function."
I think one of the classic ones for strings is called the
Rabin-Karp algorithm.
And it's simply the same idea that you have a mapping from your import into a set of integers.
"Wow, OK, maybe not so wow, but this is now constant."
This is constant time access.
So I can do searching in constant time which is great.
Where's the penalty?
What did I trade off here?
Well I'm going to suggest that what I did was I really traded space for time.
It makes me sound like an astro physicist somehow right?
What do I mean by that?
"I have constant time access which is great, but I paid a price, which is I had to use up some space."
In the case of integers it was easy.
"In the case of characters, so I have to give up a"
"list of 256, no big deal."
Imagine now you want to do faces.
"You've got a picture of somebody's face, it's a million pixels."
Each pixel has a range of values from zero to 256.
I want to hash a face with some function into an integer.
"I may not want to do the full range of this, but I may decide I have to use a lot of gigabytes of space in order to do a trade off."
"The reason I'm showing you this is it that this is a gain, a common trade off in computer science."
"That in many cases, I can gain efficiency if I'm willing to give up space."
"Having said that though, there may still be a problem, or there ought to be a problem that may be bugging you slightly, which is how do I guarantee that my hash function takes any input into exactly one spot in the storage space?"
She give any reason for discontinuing these appointments?
"Yes, she told me she was convinced that her condition was a spiritual one."
"It was the conviction of her priest, she said, and she shared his beliefs."
Was it your impression that Emily had placed her care... ...entirely..?
- Leading the witness.
Sustained.
After the end of October... ...did you ask Emily why she had stopped... ...filling her Gambutrol prescriptions?
Yes.
"Back 1 in x, we go down 3."
Just like that.
"So if we connect the dots here, it'll look something like this."
I'll do my best to draw a straight line.
"So the second graph, 2y plus 4 equals 6, we put it into slope-intercept form and we graphed it."
"Now, the whole point of this question was to identify the number of solutions that it has, the system."
A solution to a system of equations is an x and y value that satisfy both of these equations.
"Now, if there were such an x and y value that satisfied both of these equations, then that x and y value would have to lie on both of these graphs."
Because this blue line is all of the pairs of x and y's that satisfy the first equation.
The red line is all of the pairs of x's and y's that satisfy the second equation.
"So if something's going to satisfy both, it's got to be on both lines."
"When you look here, are there any points that are on both lines?"
"Well, no."
These two lines never intersect.
A point of intersection is a point that is common to both of these lines.
"No, they don't intersect."
No intersection.
So there is not a solution to this system of equations.
There is no solution.
We know that because these two lines don't intersect.
And you didn't even have to graph it.
The kind of giveaway was that these are two different lines.
"They have different y-intercepts, but their slopes are identical."
"So if you have two different y-intercepts and your slopes are identical, then you have two different lines that will never intersect."
"And if they represent a system, or if they're the graphs of a system of equations, that system has no solution."
We tried talking to him about the hot topic right now.

"I'm going to start with a quote by the Dalai Lama,"
"""Today, more than ever before,"
"life must be characterized by a sense of universal responsibility not only nation to nation and human to human but human to other forms of life."""
That's what I'm here to talk about;
"I'm passionate about wildlife conservation, thus, other forms of life."
"In the last ten years, I've done everything I can to learn as much as I can about it."
"I've read books, I've talked to experts,"
"I've gone to conferences, and traveled the world."
I wanted to see for myself what's going on in these places.
"I visited chimpanzees in Uganda,"
I visited mountain gorilla families in Rwanda.
"Everywhere I go, the root cause of the dwindling numbers of these species is human population pressure."
"A recent visual example I saw of this is in Uganda, with farms going up the hillside right to the boundary of Bwindi National Park, part of the last remaining habitat for the mountain gorilla."
Let's talk about population.
"We're at 6.7 billion people in the world today, expected to rise to nine or ten billion just in the next 40 years."
The problem is we've already got a billion people who don't have enough to eat.
"What is it going to be like when we increase the pressure, the human population pressure, by another 50%?"
"So, I think, what we are going to have are more conflicts, more wars over scarcer resources,"
less drinking water per person.
"We're going to have less food per person, more disease, and suffering."
"It's difficult to comprehend, but that's suffering on a global scale when we are talking about billions of people."
I know this is sobering to think about.
"By adding all streets surrounding the square , the area becomes at most 130,000 square meters which will fit at most 516,000 persons i.e., about four protesters for each meter square based on the international standards"
Protesters against Morsi were gathered in additional square which is the perimiter of the presidential house (AL-ETEHADYA)
"Thousands were around the perimeter that was around 1.4 Km and width of 45 m which means total area about 63,000 meter square"
"And another protest at the north the presidential house with an area of 9000 meter square which means total protests area around the presidential house is 72,000 meter square that fits at most 288,000 protesters hence, the total number of protesters in the largest two squares is alittle more than 800,000 protesters i.e., less than a million protester over a total area of about 200,000 meter square"
which is 60% of the area of ALHARAM in Makkah (One of the largest gathering squares in the world)
"As the area of Alharam based on the Saudi government is 356,000 meter square fits about 1.25 million based on the official Saudi government release"
Investigators said some other cities had protests against President Morsi but the main protests were in Altahrir and Alethadya in Cairo
Cairo has one fifth of the total Egypt population
With another mathematical equation
less than a million from one fifth of Cairo population were out to protest against President Morsi
"And if the same density were there in the rest of the Egyptian cities we will reach to the same result, that about 4 millions at most participated in the 6-30 protests"

She has long proclaimed her innocence.
"On Thursday, FBI Special Agent Aaron Ford spoke at a press conference announcing Shakur's placement on the Most Wanted Terrorists list."
"He refers to Shakur as Joanne Chesimard, her original name:"
AARON FORD:
"Openly and freely in Cuba, she continues to maintain and promote her terrorist ideology."
She provides anti-U.S. government speeches espousing the Black Liberation Army message of revolution and terrorism.
"No person, no matter what his or her political or moral convictions are, is above the law."
"Joanne Chesimard is a domestic terrorist who murdered a law enforcement officer, execution-style."
AMY GOODMAN:
That's FBI Special Agent Aaron Ford.
"In a moment, we'll be joined by two guests: the scholar and activist Angela Davis, who faced her own murder trial decades ago, and Lennox Hinds, Assata Shakur's longtime attorney for some 40 years."
But first we turn to Assata Shakur in her own words.
"In 1998, Democracy Now! aired her reading an open letter to Pope John Paul II during his trip to Cuba."
She wrote the message after New Jersey state troopers sent the pope a letter asking him to call for her extradition.
ASSATA SHAKUR:
*My name is Assata Shakur and I was born and raised in the United States.*
*I am a descendant of Africans who were kidnapped and brought to the Americas as slaves. *
*I spent my early childhood in the racist segregated South. *
"*I later moved to the northern part of the country, *"
*where I realized that Black people were equally victimized by racism and oppression.*
"*I grew up and became a political activist, *"

"It's a strong contingency to natural chemicals, more toxic chemicals are natural chemicals."
Which mother would give cancer to her child?
"When we are romanticizing nature, we are putting us down, because the mother is good, so the child is bad."
"So, there is no ""Mother Earth""."
"We can learn from nature; it's a partnership, it's learning, it's being proud of our own qualities as well."
Our natural lifetime expectancy is 30 years.
"When we get older, it's our creativity, it's our civilization, it's our science, it's our industry, it's our medicine."
"So, we don't need to talk about ""Mother Earth""."
"A mother would not have a girl losing her leg, just by biting."
No.
"So, there is no reason to romanticize nature, because when we romanticize nature, we always feel guilty."
"And out of guilt, we are not creative,"
"Out of guilt, you cannot develop new things."
"So, it's about becoming native to this planet."
Why do we delegate being native to the Yanomamis?
We are the native people of this planet.
Why do we delegate being in harmony with nature to Aborigines?
We are the aborigines of the planet.
We are the natives of this planet.
"If we don't learn to become natives to this planet, then, we will destroy each other."
"For example, we talk about overpopulation, you could see the curve of overpopulation."
The weight of ants; it's about to four times more than of all human beings.
"And because ants don't make waste; because ants live only three to six months, because ants never take elevators, they are equal to 30 billion people in their calories consumption."
"So, we are not too many, we are just stupid, we make waste."
"Even when we think about ""zero waste"", we think about waste."
"It's the same thing, when I tells you, ""Don't think about the pink crocodile!"""
We think about the pink crocodile.
But nature doesn't think about waste.
Nature only makes stuff for biological cycles.
So we can learn from nature.
But we do not just live.
"We like washing machines, we like computers."
"The ribosome is composed of a large and of a small subunit and these are depicted in the film as tumbling, rolling clusters of body amorphous by themselves, but organized and structured when in the act of translating the message."
First the small subunit with the aid of an initiation factor captures the message.
Then the first transfer RNA carrying its quanine amino acid is brought to the ribosome message complex by a second dancing initiation factor.
This requires energy and that is represented by a puff of smoke.
"Next the large ribosomal subunit tumbles into place and then the process of bringing each amino acid to the ribosome message complex is accomplished by the T-factor and its GTP cohert and so in the order prescribed by the balloon colors in the message chain, each amino acid is brought to the assembly site to be added to the growing chain by the peptide synthase."
"Next in an energy requiring step the messenger RNA, tRNA complex is shifted so as to bring the next message unit into the ribosome to allow the process to repeat itself."
At the end the terminator factor seeing the termination signal clears the completed protein from the last tRNA releasing it from the ribosome.
So that the ribosome can do its job again the two subunits are split apart and separated from the messenger by the ribosome releasing factor.
"My diagram is of necessity static, but protein synthesis is a dynamic process."
This movie tries to bring those dynamic interactions to life.

That dish belongs to...
Felix. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Congratulations.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Great job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Bring your dish down please, darling."
(Felix) It's a huge validation.
This is definitely one of the proudest moments that I've had in my life. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come and stand over here.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I'm trying to just be humble and, like, you know, keep my composure, but I don't think that Felix deserved to win."
Which sucks.
I'm so bummed.
Great job.
Really good job indeed.
"(Felix) I did a Chinese five-spice seared duck breast, and I did a sauce for it, and eggplant and sweet potato chips."
Phenomenal execution.
Very nice.
"The sauce and everything on the plate really worked. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe) We recognized it immediately as being&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; restaurant-quality, and the flavor &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is fantastic.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Felix)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you so much.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Felix is now a frontrunner.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The competition is on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"So, Felix, for winning today's mystery box challenge, you're coming with us to find out your huge advantage &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in the next challenge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go."
"Well done.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) As the winner of the mystery box challenge,"
Felix is now the first home cook to enter the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; pantry.
"Here, Felix is in control of the first elimination test."
Each elimination test will see at least one person
leave the competition.
(Felix) I'm surrounded by the most amazing fresh produce.
It was the most beautiful pantry I had ever seen in my life.
(Announcer) Felix now gets to choose the style of food or the dish that everyone must cook.
"However, the one thing she cannot control is the theme of the challenge."
That is in the hands of the judges.
"Today, you'll be cooking one of our three most intimidating dishes."
I'm down.
"Even though I was practically raised on it, it's a dish that intimidates me because it's so difficult to execute."
And it's a dish that takes me back to my grandmother's kitchen and my mother's kitchen. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It is Italian risotto.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"And risotto refers not only to rice, but the technique involved in making it."
"Because, as opposed to steaming it or boiling it, we saute it."
"There is one dish that always gives me the chills, because you can't hide behind adding different little touches &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and ingredients&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and garnishes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
The system is off its rocker.
"To conclude, some food for thought."
"First, for the Zande, there's a no concept of absolute evil."
There's no abstract evil force or double.
There are only humans who do evil things.
Evil happens.
Rather than exists.
It happens in witchcraft carried out by neighbors and even family members.
"Neighbors aren't evil in and of themselves, usually your buddies."
"But once their witchcraft heats up, evil things can happen."
"Second, witchcraft is a total system."
"The belief in witchcraft not only explains why bad things happen, but it offers a possibility for families to fight for the health of their loved ones."
"Furthermore, because of their belief in witchcraft, the Zande do their best not to upset their neighbors and not to outdo their neighbors."
"And finally, people who believe in witchcraft are not like aliens from outer space."
"Their rational, intelligent people just like us who do their best and their particular cultural, social, historical, and environmental context to find meaning in their world."
Franz Boas has said that tradition late shackles upon all of us.
"People who grow up in Zande Land, such as these children, are as unaware of the shackles of their traditions as people growing up in the American Midwest."
"If everyone around us is wearing the same shackles, it's hard to see them."
"I think the world would be a safer, more livable place if we recognize the shackles that tradition has laid upon us, and that can lead us to believe that our worldview is the only bright one."
"For then, we'd be able to respect the validity and the beauty of other belief systems, including witchcraft."
Thank you very much.
[applause]
(lively music)
Beth:
We're looking at a lovely little Friedrich in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin called Woman at a Window.
"Like so many of Friedrich's paintings, we see a single figure from behind."
Steven:
This is his wife and his studio in Dresden.
"We see her back, but we don't stay there."
"Instead, somehow we begin to imagine what she sees as she looks out this window."
Beth:
We imagine her life in what seems like a rather constricted environment and this really rather small view of the outside world.
Some people just have the ability to get people on their side.
They have good reasons.
They know how to explain things well.
They're just naturally persuasive.
They can sell things effectively.
They just have that persuasive power.
And that's a form of power as well.
"Well so now what we've done, we've gone through norms, we've talked about status and power."
These are all important ingredients.
"Hopefully you'll be aware of these, look for these and try to use them constructively too in your own group dynamics."
And I wish you the best in doing that.
"Stop the disco music, it steals our jobs, the Musicians' union says -"
- who demands a special disco fee and that discotheques shouldn't be allowed to serve alcohol.
Disco music on grammophone is competing dance orchestras to death.
The Musician's union now tries to save the live music by demanding a special disco fee -
- and retracted liquor license for restaurants who abandon live music for disco.
Every month one dance orchestra here in Sweden dies and the lines of musicians waiting for unemployment benefits are growing. ♪ I am a giant tree. ♪
"Janne Landegren, finalist in the Swedish Eurovision song contest qualifier two years ago -"
"- and vocalist in Telstars, one of the most wellknown dance orchestras in Sweden."
But now Telstars has disbanded.
The latest victim to the death of dance orchestras and Janne Landegren is going to the office for unemployment benefits.
-It feels tough to have to disband a group like Telstars.
"Not just because it affects me personally, economically."
-And your family?
-And my family economically to say the least.
"It also feels hard to disband a group like Telstars that have existed since 1963, for 16 years."
The Musicians' union forces so called live music upon us.
This is live music if there is such a thing.
"Today this type of public usage is totally unregulated.For example we can listen in department stores, elevators, sports arenas and discotheques."
This without any compensation to the musician who is the person actually performing.
We can't accept that.
The disco fee hasn't been decided but today the Swedish broadcasting corporation pays 32 SEK for every minute of record music played.
"I think first and foremost that you can explain to people the only thing that counts in life is to develop yourself in the good sence, being a good person ... and then learn that being with other people also means imply giving up things"
"We owe it to others to take care of them, and it is a very but that is very difficult for people to learn even if it, in fact is pure logic"
Martin:
But isn't that very greek?
Ole:
"It is very Greek and very Christian, and the Christianity is good"
Martin:
Then it is very Greek beeing so very good ..
Ole:
"You could say so, yes ... and not only Greek / Catholic"
We must help to build a society that is not just about claiming a lot of stuff for ourselves but a society where we help and support others and not because we thereby help and support ourselves
One becomes wiser beeing a decent person
I try as good as I can to explain that to people although I wonder why it should be necessary
"One also have to try to take your own medicine which is the worst of it all, but I'm working on it"
Martin:
"But perhaps the paradox of this project is that if you have to be really really good to yourself, there is some who interprets it as ""not caring about others"""
Ole:
"No, I do not think that, that is the way to take care of yourself..."
The Greeks had a slogan saying
"""εαυτό τους"" meaning ""look after themselves"""
"In latin it is ""cura de se"".. um.. but does not involve any form of selfishness"
Martin:
But there ought not be a difference in taking care of yourself and take care of other
It should be able to go well together
Ole:
"It should be, because we are the others hostage and we only exist because the others have been there to begin with"
Martin:
"But then, why does it not work?"
Ole:
I think this has much to do with not prioritizing the right way in our upbringing and our education
Take private schools..
Earlyer they were there for those students who didn't do so well in the public schools
And you can confirm that I found for these numbers that theta 1 is about 7.5 degrees.
This is now for maxima.
And so roughly at an angle which is half that value you will find silence.
Silence means that the two radio waves will kill each other.
Essential for the maximum to be here is of course that the two transmitters are in phase.
We could have rigged it up so that they were 180 degrees out of phase in which case there would be silence here.
Silence in this case means that the radar would kill the radar.
"But I do use the word silence for a good reason, because the way we rigged this up is the same way we did it before."
We modulate this 10-gigahertz signal with a 1000-hertz audio signal.
We call that amplitude modulation.
And the receiver which is here receives the 10-gigahertz radiation which is modulated at 1000 hertz.
We feed it to an amplifier.
We demodulate it and you will hear the 1000 hertz.
And so we can also move it along this track here and find the location X1 whereby we have our first maximum apart from the 0.
And I found that that is very roughly at 15.5 centimeters.
And you should confirm that using those equations.
Equations are the same.
"Whether you deal with sound or with red laser light or with gigahertz, makes no difference."
And so let's turn now to this demonstration.
I will turn on the -- the two transmitters and here is the receiver which is exactly at angle theta 0.
So there's a maximum.
"I'm now going to close one transmitter, [tone] put my hand in front."
[tone]
And you think about what will be the reduction of intensity of the sound here.
[tone]
"If I close one, it's substantially down."
You may think that it is down by a factor of two.
Because we have only one transmitter instead of two.
You're wrong.
"If you think that, you do not understand interference."
It is 4 times lower when I hold my hands over one.
Figure it out for yourself.
URLs.
These URLs were created by things like different types of navigation.
"So Googlebot, in terms of crawling your site, doesn't just look at, say, 200 unique URLs."
"But actually has to determine which URLs to crawl of the 380,000 that were created."
You can see how
Googlebot might want to be more efficient in crawling by looking at these two URLs.
"Now, the first one says, ""category equals YouTube."" Let's say that URL to 20 unique items on the page."
"But on the second URL, it's ""category equals YouTube and size equals medium."" So it's the exact same items."
"But now just say, filtered down to five."
"Because of the ""size equals medium"" parameter."
So in this way Google would rather just crawl the first URL and reach all 20 of the items.
Rather than crawling both URLs and seeing a redundant five items.
"Essentially, with your input in URL parameters, it helps us to understand your site better."
So we can crawl more efficiently.
"By crawling more efficiently, we don't crawl as many duplicates."
And that will save you bandwidth.
And helps us to focus on your unique content.
Rather than crawling the duplicate of information repeatedly.
"But if you want URLs removed, you can go to URL Removals in Webmaster Tools."
"Again, the URL parameters feature is to crawl more efficiently."
It's not about removals or explicit robots.txt disallowing.
Another background piece of information that I'd like to mention is that page-level markup is still taken into consideration in tandem with URL parameters.
So if you have page-level markup.
"Like rel, ""canonical"", or rel, ""next"" ""prev"", or rel, ""hreflang"", that's fine and can still be used by Google."
Even if you are using URL parameters.
Just make sure that we can still crawl your page.
Meaning that it's not robots.txt disallowed.
Or you haven't set it to not be crawled in URL parameters.
"As long as we can crawl your page, we can still use the page-level markup."
"Since we've covered the background information, let's now talk about the types of URLs that are eligible for this feature."
Here's one from the Google store.
"It says, ""category equals office."" Other URLs would be things like ""category equals wearables"" or ""category equals wearables and size equals medium."""
"We cannot make energy saving window without toxic materials in it, otherwise it doesn't work."
"So, this means to reinvent our materials to go into technical cycles."
"So, we now make washing machines where you can wash just 3000 times."
"We now make materials which can go into technical cycles, and biological cycles."
But this means reinventing  everything you see in front of you.
"We don't need to say, ""Oh, I'm so sorry to be here."""
"We can say, ""Hey, we are not good enough."
"Our design is not good enough  because it makes toxic waste."""
"Now, we try to minimize our footprint but we reach the opposite"
"We are making the wrong thing perfect, and by that, they are perfectly wrong."
"When we send these things to recycling, we only contaminate the biological system."
Because it was never designed for recycling.
"The design that you do is so important, but right now this design is amazingly primitive."
"Look, I became a designer."
"You can see when you look in the internet, you find I'm designing materials,"
"I'm designing materials like washing machines that only do five thousand loads of washing,"
But this is because the designers don't do their job.
I'm designing edible fabrics.
What we do see here?
"Stinking PVC, never designed for human beings."
Destroying fertility.
The whole system is very primitive.
That means that we need to reinvent all our materials again.
This is the amount of diapers which one baby makes in one year.
"In Europe, 20% of all waste stream in households are diapers."
"And, because they get older, the diapers get bigger."
There is some potential in it.
"A baby takes about 7,500 diapers."
"If we could make diapers for babies, which allow them to go into biological systems, if we change the soap absorbents and the plastics, we could grow with one baby,  150 trees, just with one baby."
So this baby could be carbon positive from the beginning.
"It's really carbon positive, not carbon neutral."
"With learning how to use the sun, we can reinvent everything to go back into technical systems and biological systems."
That's why we try to reduce our footprint.
Maybe you know this joke;
"One planet meets another planet, and says, ""You really look terrible today""."
"And the other planet says, ""Yes, I have Homo sapiens""."
"The first planet answers,"
"""Don't worry, I had this before;  it will disappear somehow""."
"We feel so bad, we think it's better we are not here."
"With all these environmental disasters, we lost a whole generation of good scientists."
"We have lots of smart MBA's, we have brilliant lawyers, but we don't have enough engineers."
"We don't have enough good scientists because how can you study chemistry, when you see Bhopal?"
"How can you study physics, when you see Chernobyl?"
And the one who studies to be a scientist did with a bad conscience..
"So that's why they try to be ""less bad""."
He apologizes everyday for being here.
That's the reasons that we're trying to minimize our footprint.
"We walk, and when we are in Sweden, for example, your footprint means destruction, that's why people try to minimize their footprint."
"But, when you are here, your footprint means the water stays longer."
"So why do we want to minimize our footprint, when we can have a beneficial footprint?"
So we can make things completely differently.
But this is what we do.
"Here, it stinks, this is PVC."
Never designed to go in biological systems.
"This is our catalog, it stinks; never designed for toilet paper."
It's hazardous waste.
"We need to reinvent our products, and the products need to look different, completely different."
"Everything that gets consumed; food, detergents, backpacks, need to be designed to grow up into biological systems."
Everything that is just used as a service needs to go back to the technical system.
"You cannot consume a window, you don't consume a washing machine, you don't consume a TV set, you only use it."
"So, we need to distinguish between two different cycles."
"Things which get consumed, like shoe soles, need to be designed to go to biological systems."
"Things which are just used, like the washing machine, need to be designed for the technical cycle, but right now,  they are just hazardous waste."
"So, we need to reinvent our products, completely from the beginning."
"Still, I think it's important to go to the hospital and get the diagnosis, for a record."
"Ah, for a record."
Right.
"Even if you think the diagnosis is off the mark, the fact that it's off the mark may later serve as an evidence of some kind."
The diagnosis can prove that a symptom similar to it did happen to you.
So I think you should go to the hospital.
I see.
But I hear many mothers have had bad experiences with doctors.
That's true.
"I know doctors have said various things to mothers, such as ""overreacting,"" ""too nervous,"" or ""that may be pollen allergy."""
But this is something Japanese doctors should learn as well from now on.
"We, too, often had bad experiences with doctors in Chernobyl."
"When they hear the words ""radiation exposure,"" they only think of cancers or leukemia."
"However, the health problems of children living in the contaminated areas are relatively minor and cannot be diagnosed."
"They have a whole range of such symptoms, which is called ""a bouquet of symptoms."""
The Japanese doctors who went to Chernobyl as part of the relief effort didn't examine such children.
They only treated children with more serious diseases.
"But you know, the children who got cancer is just the tip of an iceberg."
"Under the tip, there are innumerable children who have such minor symptoms as, say, fatigue."
Fatigue is a typical symptom of thyroid disorder.
Or eye swelling.
I frequently heard from mothers their children suffered from eye swelling after they fell in the contaminated places.
I hear there's a similar case recently.
Yes.
I often hear the story of how children fell in a sandpit with high radiation and their eyes get swollen the next day.
Sometimes swollen in purple.
"Also, quite a few people claim that bruises have appeared, or that moles have appeared or disappeared, which seem to have nothing to do with stress or physical conditions."
Some women claim the menstrual period has stopped or the menstrual cycle is irregular.
Others are saying their allergy has gotten worse.
Or their diseases have recurred.
These are the symptoms I noticed when looking at the emails.
"Another problem right now is people are eating contaminated food, because the Japanese radiation safety limit for food was raised."
Generally speaking there's not a real problem for health if we have much lower meat consumption.
And there are potential benefits.
I mean after all colon cancer is one of the commonest cancers in high income countries.
And the risk of colon cancer is higher with high meat consumption.
"So there would be a real benefit in terms of colon cancer risk, for example."
Going from our level of consumption to something that's just a bit below half of that would not involve any significant health harms and would almost certainly bring health benefits.
"As you have probably already guessed, I'm a vegetarian."
I actually used to like eating meat quite a lot.
"But that was until around twelve years ago when I saw a Dutch TV documentary called ""What the cow wants""."
It contained some really bizarre footage.
This hole was made a few years ago.
Cows can live very long with this.
Sometimes more than ten years.
This is a hole with a diameter of around 4 inches.
Inside there is a silicone ring.
With inside a lid.
"When I push, it should be possible to open it."
Now it's open.
The lid comes out.
Here we have a part of the grass the animal just ate.
"When I saw this, for me that was the very limit."
"Animal diseases, animal suffering, animals that were no longer treated as living beings."
I had seen it all and I thought:
"""No, not in my name!"
"I want no part in this any more."""
And that's how you put the lid back on.
"In the factory farming industry, animals are adapted to the food that we choose to give them and the massive stalls in which they are forced to live."
"They are mutilated, they are given antibiotics to stop them getting sick."
Pigs are now sometimes even given anti-stress pills to help them cope with their unnatural living conditions.
"Yet the fact that it turns out that livestock makes an enormous contribution to greenhouse gas emissions by belching, farting and defecating doesn't necessarily mean that we'll start keeping fewer cows, pigs and chickens?"
"No, the industry will simply dream up something new."
"Would you believe it, they now even make fist-sized pills to stop cows from farting so much?"
These kids are being medicated as routinely as we had our tonsils taken out.
"And on the same whimsical basis, and for the same reason - medical fashion."
Our children are living in the most intensely stimulating period in the history of the earth.
"They're being besieged with information, and force their attention from every platform, computers, from iPhones, from advertising holdings, from hundreds of television channels."
And we're penalizing them now for getting distracted.
"From what, boring stuff, at school for the most part."
"It seems to me it's not a coincidence, totally, that the instance of ADHD has risen in parallel with the growth of standardized testing."
"Now, these kids are being given Ritalin and Adderall, and all manner of things, often quite dangerous drugs, to get them focused and calm them down."
"But according to this,"
Attention Deficit Disorder increases as you travel east across the country.
People start losing interest in Oklahoma
[laughter].
They can hardly think straight in Arkansas
[laughter].
"And by the time they get to Washington, they have lost it completely."
"And there are separate reasons for that, I believe"
[laughter].
It's a fictitious epidemic.
"If you think of it, the arts, and I don't say this exclusively of the arts."
I think it's also true of science and of maths.
"But let me, I say about the arts particularly because they are the victims of this mentality currently, particularly."
The arts especially address the idea of aesthetic experience.
And aesthetic experience is one in which your senses are operating at their peak.
When you are present in the current moment.
When you're resonating with the excitement of this thing that you're experiencing.
When you are fully alive.
And anesthetic is when you shut your senses off and deaden yourself to what's happening.
And a lot of these drugs are that.
We're getting our children through education by anesthetizing them.
And I think we should be doing the exact opposite.
"We shouldn't be putting them asleep, we should be waking them up to what they have inside of themselves."
"But the model we have is this, it's, I believe, we have a system of education that is modeled on the interests of industrialism, and in the image of it."
"So you want more workers and fewer machines, right?"
"Given the machines and workers, this is a perfectly substitutable production function."
The marginal rate of technical substitution is k over l.
"You're perfectly indifferent between these two, given that-- not perfectly substitutable, but at this point you're indifferent between the two."
"So given that you're indifferent and the machines cost twice as much, why not buy half as many machines?"
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
"But then, if the machines cost twice as much, why buy any machines?"
JON GRUBER:
"Oh, that's very good point."
Because it's not a perfectly substitutable function.
My bad.
"If it was, if the production function-- great question."
Let's say the production function was of the form q equals k plus l.
That's perfectly substitutable production.
"Then you're right, in that situation you should only buy workers because they do exactly the same thing."
But that's not the case here.
This exhibits diminishing marginal product.
"So if you only bought workers, eventually each worker would do so much less that you'd be better off getting a machine."
"It's not perfectly substitutable, I misspoke before."
At the margin they have an equal effect.
"But as you get more and more laborers, they'll be less and"
"less productive, so eventually you're going to want to buy a machine."
But you're only going to buy half as many machines as workers.
You never want to buy one machine per worker.
"But you also don't want no machines per workers, because the workers won't have anything to do then."
"Here you'd want no machines per worker, right?"
"The optimal thing to do, if you have a perfectly substitutable production function, you'd only just buy the cheaper input."
"But that's not the case when you have diminishing marginal products, then you're going to use a combination of inputs."
But the combination used will be determined by the prices in the market.
Other questions about that?
"So now we can ask, just as we asked in consumer theory, how does a price change in the price of goods affect your consumption decisions, we can ask how does a change in the price of inputs affect your production decisions?"
"Soon, they all do."
"So, can our ape cousins pass this test?"
A keeper places a mark on a female orangutan.
"Next, they put her in front of a mirror."
She has seen her reflection before but this time she notices that something has changed.
Her hand goes to the mark.

Welcome to Lecture six of Networks friends money and bytes.
The question we're going to formulate and answer today is why does Wikipedia even work?
Now the word work here is very vague but roughly speaking means that it achieves what it's sets out to do.
"To create a free, open, online interactive encyclopedia."
And there are many reasons why it should not have worked.
We're going to take a look at the challenges it faced and then zoom into a specific item of consensus formation.
"But before that, let's do a, a very quick recap of what we have been in the space of Work 2.0."
"We talked about Google's page rank, which turns a graph of webpage connection, into a single rank order list, according to the importance scores."
"Then, we talked about Netflix recommendation,"
"Which turns a user movie rating matrix into many ranked orderless, one for each user."
Then we talked about average rating on
"Amazon, or more generally speaking rating aggregation."
That turns a vector of rating scores for each product into a single scaler.
And then use that to generate a ranking for different products.
"The last lecture, or this lecture, we will be talking about voting systems that turns a set of rank ordered lists, many of them, into a single rank order list."
In terms of ambiguity of the problem statement.
Or perhaps this is in ascending order.
Looks like all four of them are very heavily used in both online space in our other aspects of daily lives.
"Now to Wikipedia, which was launched a little over a decade ago in 2001."
And is a result of three movements.
One is wikis as a template for online collaboration.
The other is free and open software movement.
And the third is the emergence of online encyclopedia.
Wikipedia is free.
"So, they can be described by four numbers, three spatial coordinates and a time coordinate."
They can be anything.
"You know, turning on a light, doing anything you want to do."
"Receiving a photon, whatever it is."
But they are points in a four-dimensional space-time and therefore require four numbers to describe them.
"And you can only get from one to another if they're separated from a time-like, that is to say, a negative, interval."
"Okay, so this expression, which I'll write down again, this is called a metric."
And the particular metric that I've written down here is the metric for flat space.
"Because remember, this is special relativity."
"There's no masses, no curvature of space, none of that stuff, yet."
This is the metric for flat space with no mass present.
And there are many other metrics possible.
"Any time you add mass or do other things, you get different kinds of metrics more complicated than this."
"So, what's special about special relativity is that you use the metric appropriate for flat space as opposed to the many other different kinds of metrics that you can use in general relativity, which has a much more general form for the metric."
"I should say, you can also write this down."
You can write down the spatial terms here in polar coordinates.
Remember polar coordinates?
"Polar coordinates, you describe the position in space, instead of with x, y, Z, you describe it with a radius, a distance from zero, and some angles."
"And it turns out, that's convenient to do so."
"Let me write this down in polar coordinates, or in polar."
That's an r.
Let me write that explicitly.
"This is an Omega, that's some angle."
And then the T thing remains the same.
And I've pulled a little bit of a notational fast one on you here.
I've gone away from the deltas and I've written these down as d.
This is the differential d.
Those of you who have taken some calculus will remember this.
"If this were a calculus-based course I would explain why I did that, but I'm not going to."
"So, just allow me this slight of hand, here."
"For technical reasons, these have to be differential."
Yes?

GlRL:
You know how frustrating it is trying to help your kids when they're sick.
I don't feel so good.
GlRL:
A visit to the doctor's office can be a challenge.
[ Blows nose ]
"No, I don't want you to take my temperature."
No!
I wish it would feel better -- my ear.
GlRL:
"Snort, sniffle, sneeze -- no antibiotics, please!"
"As a parent, you want to help make your child feel better as fast as possible."
It's tempting to think that antibiotics are the answer when your child is sick.
But that may not always be the case.
You don't look so good.
"A lot of illnesses can be caused by viruses, and antibiotics don't work on viruses."
"In fact, antibiotics are strong medicines that can have serious side effects."
DR. WHlTNEY:
"I'm a doctor, but also the mother of two kids."
[laughter]
[tone]
Go very slowly.
[tone]
Who has found clear location where [tone] the sound is nearly zero [tone] or practically zero?
[tone]
Most of you.
And you certainly can hear if you move that there's an enormous difference [tone] in sound intensity.
[tone]
[tone]
"So again, who has found locations [tone] whereby you clearly say this is practically silence?"
[tone]
"Ah, you see them all the way in the back, [tone]"
"[tone] and the separation, how far you have to move, depends on how far you are away from me."
Sit down again.
[audience noise]
Young was a sound engineer and as a sound engineer he was very familiar with the interference of sound.
He knew that sound and sound can make silence.
And so in 1801 he demonstrated in a convincing way that light plus light can create darkness.
"That would be the nail in the coffin that would demonstrate uniquely that light are indeed waves, and there was still this controversy between Huygens and Newton as you perhaps remember."
Newton wanted light to be particles but Huygens wanted them to be waves.
And the way that Young did his experiment is as follows.
"He had a screen, don't think of it as this big, you're talking now about extraordinarily small dimensions, you will understand shortly how small, and in this screen are two openings, two pinholes, and light is coming from the left and think of light as being plane waves."
"They reach these two openings and these two openings according to Huygens will produce circular waves, spherical waves of course, three-dimensionally."
These openings become Huygens sources and spherical waves will propagate out in this direction.
And so now we have exactly the situation that we had with our sound.
Now if all works well there should be directions theta away from this line where you see darkness and other directions where you see bright light.
"And we are going to do it in a way, we have the luxury of laser beams, so we have very strong"
"light sources, which Young did not have."
"The way we are going to do it, we have a -- a slide, which is completely black, but with a razor blade two"
lines have been drawn on it.
And so I will draw these lines as white lines.
"Somebody asked, ""What's special about special relativity, and what's general about general relativity?"""
How do they relate?
"So, we'll come back to that one."
"Somebody also asked,"
"""Why use the speed of light to convert time into space and vice versa, to get them in the same coordinate system?"""
"So, why use c to convert time to space and vice versa?"
"And then, also, there was the question of, you know, ""What is the mathematical formulation of general relativity?"""
"So, how to express general relativity in some kind of equation."
"And we'll get to the key equation, which is something called a metric, for general relativity, and then we're going to stop."
Because to go on from there is fairly heavy calculus and we're just not going to do that.
But I want to get at least that far.
"Okay, so let's go back to special relativity for a minute."
"So, special relativity."
"Flat space-time, no gravity."
And you'll recall what happens.
"As you get close to the speed of light, all sorts of things that you thought were kind of constant and properties of objects,"
"like mass and length and duration, and duration of time, and things like that, all start to get weird and change."
"So, length, time, mass, all these things, vary with the velocity of the person doing the measuring."
"And so, you could ask the question, is there anything that doesn't vary?"
Is there anything that's an invariant?
"And the answer is, yes."
There are some things that don't vary.
"So, some things are invariant."
"And Einstein actually said later in his career that it's actually the invariants that are important, not the things that change."
"And so, he should have called his theory invariant theory instead of relativity theory."
Think of what that would have done to pop philosophy.
"Instead of saying, ""everything is relative,"" all this stuff, you would have had the exact same theory."
You would have called it invariance theory.
"And the pop philosophy interpretation of this would be,"
"""some things never change."""
And it would have been a whole different concept in three in the morning dorm room conversations.
"Okay, so some things are invariant, what things?"
I'm Kelly MacDonald for Accessible Media attending the Design Enabling
Economies and Policies conference hosted by OCAD and G3ict.
This two-day think tank will examine new strategies in digital inclusion beyond current approaches.
"Axel Leblois, President and Executive Director of the Global Initiative for Inclusive Information and Communication Technologies."
Or G3ict for short.
AXEL:
"As you know, there was a significant milestone back in 2006, when the United Nations General Assembly actually passed the text of the"
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
"Which today, has been signed by 153 countries and ratified by 104."
"Which means, in the short part of time, that Convention has established itself worldwide as the global legal framework to protect the rights of persons with disabilities."
KELLY:
The conference had guest speakers that addressed the crowd.
"Jutta Treviranus,"
Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University.
So the Inclusive Design Institute is a regional research hub with many postsecondary partners;
"Eight, in fact, all in the greater Toronto area."
"And partnerships with collaborating private sector organizations and community organizations, all working together to try to ensure that the emerging technologies that we all depend upon become accessible to the full diversity"
That is the users within our community.
KELLY:
A joystick plugged into an interface allows the user to move the cursor around on a mobile phone.
Three press-buttons connected to an interface allow the user to perform the same functions on a tablet.
"So there's a central facility here at OCAD University that includes actually 9 labs, with various functions."
And it's spread over 3 buildings.
"But, in additions to that, there are satellite facilities at the 8 other academic institutions as well."
KELLY:
Attending the first DEEP conference
I'm Kelly MacDonald for Accessible Media.
"Now, what does this continue command actually do?"
What happens if we set a stepping variable to false?
"Is it the program resumes until it exits, the program resumes until the next breakpoint is reached, the program resumes until the next function is called, or does the program stay in the same line?"
Keep in mind that all of these options assume that we return true in our program.
(whispering) Hi!
[music].
So let's get going today.
And what we were talking about
"last time is the discovery that the atom was not the most basic constituent of matter, that there was a particle that was even less massive than an atom."
And that is the electron.
"But today, we're going to discover the nucleus."
And so this is 1911.
And this is Ernest Rutherford in England.
And what he was interested in doing was studying the emission from these newly radioactive elements that were being discovered.
"So the emission from radium, for example."
What he did was he got a sample of radium bromide from his friend Marie Curie.
And what was known was that this radium bromide emitted something called alpha particles.
And the exact nature of these alpha particles was not known.
"However, what was known was that they were heavy particles, that they were charged and that they were energetic."
"And, of course, today we know what these alpha particles are."
"They are helium double plus, a helium with two electrons removed."
All right.
So he got this radium bromide.
And alpha particles are being emitted from the radium bromide.
"And he had some kind of detector way out here, which detected these alpha particles."
"And what he found was that at the detector there were about 132,000 alpha particles per minute."
That was the count rate that he was able to measure.
"And then, because he was just trying to figure out what is the nature of these particles, he did this experiment."
"He took a gold foil, a really thin gold foil here, really thin meaning 2^10-5 inches."
That's two orders of magnitude thinner than the diameter of your hair.
I've always wondered how he handled that.
That is pretty thin.
But he put that in there.
"And lo and behold, the count rate that he measured once this gold foil was in place, the count rate was still 132,000 alpha particles per minute."
It appeared that all of the alpha particles that were being emitted just went through the foil right to the detector.
It didn't even seem like those alpha particles knew the foil was there.
So I've seen my share of waiting rooms like this.
She's right.
"If antibiotics are used too often for things they can't treat,"
"like colds, flu, or other viral infections, they can stop working effectively against bacteria when you really need them."
"Antibiotic resistance, when antibiotics can no longer cure bacterial infections, has been a concern for years."
Everyday problems can become much worse if we can't use our first line of defense.
Children can need hospitalization for superbugs that don't respond to common antibiotics.
"As a parent, you can do something."
"For example, understand that many ear infections and sore throats may not need antibiotics."
"Work with your doctor to understand the difference between infections that are viral and don't respond to antibiotics,"
"like the cold or the flu, and infections that are bacterial and do respond to antibiotics, like strep throat."
Always follow the directions on any antibiotic prescription.
"This means taking the prescribed amount of medicine, even if feeling better, and not sharing or saving antibiotics, not even for other family members."
Antibiotics are a powerful tool.
"But you wouldn't slice a tomato with a chain saw, right?"
Antibiotics may not always be the answer.
Learn more by working with your doctor or other healthcare provider to make sure your children always get the best treatment that's exactly right for them.
Let's see how our other doctor is doing with her patients and find out what treatments might help.
GlRL:
"Soothe a sore throat with ice chips, sore-throat spray, or lozenges, but don't give lozenges to young children."
Use a decongestant or saline nasal spray to help relieve nasal symptoms.
"Put a warm, moist cloth over an ear that hurts."
"To help relieve a cough, use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer or try breathing in steam from a bowl of hot water or a shower."
You might need some pain reliever for that ache or fever.

It looks like her patients are in good hands.

I guess moms and doctors can work together.
It also does not compensate for your contribution as writer to different articles.
It is open.
Anyone can write and edit and debate.
And this dynamic changes both the number of articles and details of many articles very.
Dynamically.
"Sometimes as soon as announcement is made in the public or event happens within a minute or sometimes right at the same time as that event unfolds, it is updated."
It's interactive.
"There's talk page, there's history page, you can interact with the other contributors or the editors."
And it is extensively linked.
"In fact, when you Google search certain kind of our keywords, Wikipedia articles are popped up."
And then you can look at each Wiki article.
There are many hyperlinks embedded in the text and a many footnotes at the bottom.
"So, the Wiki articles themselves also form."
A very large and substantially linked network.
There are perhaps more links per node than then the general web space and there are many such nodes.
"With in a decade since founding Wikipedia has already has 4,000,000 english articles and all together 27,000,000 articles in many different languages."
"So, by all accounts, wikipedia has been very successful."
"It is not, however, the first attempt to build an encyclopedia online, not even the first attempt to build it based on free open dynamic interactions."
So there must be something that they did right and better than the previous attempts.
We'll be looking at those momentarily.
"At the same time, we also recognize there are limitations."
"For example, there are misinformations."
"Some information on Wiki's are just rang, wrong, especially in articles with a very small audience."
"But what is important is that we can provide our effective, self-correcting mechanism."
Usually the misinformation on Rose and
Lily popular weekend articles are very effectively corrected by the community of contributors.
"There are also just mistakes, honest mistakes."
"But then again, everybody can edit an article."
"An edit can stay there as long as no other contributors can present a better, stronger case otherwise."
Then there are also missing information.
No encyclopedia can include all the information you want.
Different people also have different definitions of what constitute an encyclopedic kind of article.

GROWing together....
Growing a better future...
What is GROW?
The GROW campaign is a global effort aimed at addressing the broken food system.
The movement aims to put food on the table for the 1 billion people who go to bed hungry.
These people have little or no access to resources needed to produce food ... or they have no money to buy food at all.
"The GROW movement pushes for better policies on agriculture, the environment ... and bring back the control over food production from the big agribusinesses ... to the hands of small farmers, fisherfolks, rural women and indigenous peoples."
Why join GROW?
"In Southeast Asia, such movement is crucial."
"Here, 6 out of 10 people go to bed hungry."
"Majority of them are farmers, rural women, fisherfolks, and indigenous peoples."
They are also the planet's main food producers.
Women do both productive and reproductive work and make up half of the rural labor force.
"But women have less access than men to resources and opportunities ... such as land, livestock, wages, education, financial services, and access to technology."
Other problems are making the situation worse.
Land grabs are endangering the region's food security.
Small scale farmers are pushed off their land by private sector investments in agriculture.
Southeast Asian countries are among the biggest destinations of such investments.
Extreme weather changes brought about by climate change is causing floods and droughts.
"And an example of this might arise when multiple concert, consulting firms compete for the same contracts."
And they start to differentiate into types of specialists.
"And according to Scott, competitive dependence arises under normative coordination or co-optation in the forming of interlocking boards of directors."
"When you have trade associations, joint ventures, and horizontal mergers when competitors kind of merge."
The argument is that these kinds of strategies correspond with particular.
"There're kinds of, of resource dependence relations."
"Just like all the theories we've reviewed in the course so far, resource dependaence theory is flawed, it's not perfect."
It's not a panacea.
And it has certain shortcomings.
And I want to discuss a few of those right now.
First.
Resource dependence theory has an assumptions built in that all organizations are more or less similar.
They approach the environment in the same way.
They acquire resources in an uncertain world.
Those firms are staffed by boundedly rational managers who are seeking to optimize both their own and their organizations interests.
"But it, you kind of have to ask yourself, is that accurate?"
Do some organizations live outside the issues of resource dependence?
Are they more about identity and matching?
It's not clear here.
"Another thing that, to consider, is whether the notion of certainty and uncertainly are relatively clear with resource dependent series."
Is dependence on social resources and knowledge clear whereas dependence on money and materials are less clear or more clear?
Resource dependence theory is purely resource exchange based.
And as soon as there is clarity and value and importance but all too often the value of a resource is unclear until well after the fact.
"So meaning making and sense making are lost by resource dependence theory and we, we kind of ignore all that."
"Also, we kind of wonder with resource theory as to what happened to culture and mission."
"It talks about normative coordination but it doesn't thoroughly describe it and we find far stronger characterizations of that process in theories and, like organizational culture."
Slide 30.
Last.
All of the dependencies are described in pair wise fashion.
"And we have to kind of wonder with resource dependency, what about the larger network."
Can the larger network pattern define opportunities and constraints.
Can the network define norms and pressures better than relations of dependence.
"If the crop fails, my family will starve"
We'll have to borrow money to buy food
Environmental changes are already affecting freshwater fishing on the Mekong
The study identifies the Ton Le Sap lake in Cambodia as an ecological hotspot
"Linked to the Mekong river, the lake is a very important wetland"
The Ton Le Sap lake is in Cambodia and is one of the very important ecosystems
It supports the livelihood of a large number of people who are dependent on for their livelihood through fish production
People here know how their lives and jobs are linked to the ebb and flow of natures cycles
Now these patterns are being disrupted by reduced rainfall and river flow
This is partly the result of dam building upstream
The Mekong countries have to carefully manage the upstream-downstream tensions
They also have to balance competing demands for water
"For example, from cities and villages"
"And among the different sectors such as farming, households, and industry"
Then there are other challenges 2 out of every 5 people in the basin don't have safe drinking water or proper toilets
They are just too poor to afford these basic amenities
"To improve their living standards, countries need to invest more in rural areas"
The study recommends Mekong river countries to improve how they manage their water and land
"This needs better policies, institutions, and systems"
Countries sharing the Mekong river or same rivers they have to act together and they have to develop the policies on how to conserve and how to conserve the Mekong river and also how to properly manage the Mekong river
The study found the Mekong river basin moderately vulnerable to environmental changes
There aren't any major water shortages in this river basin as yet
"For now, the Mekong is holding up, despite many pressures"
But all this can change if less water is flowing down the river and the demand for water keeps growing
"That's why the Mekong countries need to watch this river, their main lifeline"

"As Chingphulon Konthousu grew up, she was known for her beauty and gentleness. She used to go to woods, lakes and open meadows for fun. One day, while Tampha was out in an open field with her friends, a strong wind blew. Tampha was lifted up by a whirlwind towards the sky. Her friends could do nothing but watch. The wind took her to heaven, the abode of Salailen. He was waiting for her."
"Tampha was unhappy about being far away from her parents and friends. To please her, Salailen promised her that the people of her native place would attain immortality and be safe from all diseases. Still, her parents, family and friends cried for the loss of her. Salailen told them that Tampha was safe with him. He told them about the promises he kept to her. Many years had passed and Salailen and Tampha had a son. She and Salailen named their son Khoriphaba."
"Tampha's parents wanted to see her. So they planned to meet her. Men went on a hunting expedition with their hunting dogs across the Thangjing Hills. Unfortunately, they could not catch even one animal. The tired hunters rested under the shade of a tree. Meanwhile, one of their favorite hunting dogs wandered away. The dog saw a large python sitting in sun. It barked at the python. The python killed it. Later, the hunters found the dead dog and carried it home. They prepared a funeral for the dog. The smoke from the funeral rose up towards the sky."
"Up in Heaven, Tampha saw the smoke rising from her native place. She knew it was for a funeral. She worried about her people. Perhaps someone had died even though Salailen had promised to keep them safe from disease. She asked Salailen about his promises. Salailen told her that the funeral was only for a dog. She did not believe him and wanted to see her parents. Reluctantly, Salailen allowed her to meet people under some conditions. She should leave only after their son Khoriphaba had gone to sleep and should come back before he woke up. Also, she should not consume any earthly foods or drinks. Then, he placed a golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) for her to climb down. She landed on the Thangjing Hill and then went to Konthoujam, her native land. She met her near and dear ones. Her mother offered Tampha delicious foods."
"Tampha did not accept her mother's offers. However, her mother caught hold of her and tried to force her to eat. Tampha told her mother of the conditions with which she was leaving heaven to meet them on earth. Then, her mother arranged a shade with seven layers of false ceiling, enclosed by seven layers of drapery. Her plan was to block the vision of Salailen from above. Inside the shades, she served out delicious food for Tampha. Poor Tampha was compelled to eat what her mother had so lovingly prepared for her. But the God Salailen saw it happen even through the drapes. As Tampha started eating, Salailen proclaimed from heaven that she could not come back to his abode. He spat a blob of spit on her hand (or ""on her food"" in another version). The golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) was also lifted up. Poor Tampha was abandoned from heaven. Salailen also took back his promises of immortality and immunity to disease."
"Later, she lived in the outskirts of Konthoujam. Since then, she came to be known as Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi."

Battle of Wilson's Creek
"The Battle of Wilson's Creek, also called the ""Bull Run of the West"", was a battle of the American Civil War. It was the first battle that took place west of the Mississippi River. Nathaniel Lyon, the Union general, was the first general killed in the Civil war."
Prelude to the battle.
"During the summer of 1861, the Union and Confederate Armies were both trying to control Missouri. By the second week of July 1861, the Union Army of the West commanded by Brigadier general Nathaniel Lyon, camped at Springfield, Missouri. In total, he had about 5,400 soldiers in his command."
"About 75 miles to the southwest of Springfield, the pro-Southern Missouri State Guard were camped. They were under the command of Major general Sterling Price. Price was joined by Confederate generals Benjamin McCulloch and Nicholas Bartlett Pearce. Combined their forces numbered about 12,000. In late July both forces started moving closer to together, each army trying to learn what they could about the other. There was a skirmish at Dug Springs, Missouri on August 2. This is near present-day Clever, Missouri. The Union forces won but this is when Lyon realized the Confederates had more than twice the forces he had. The Union forces retreated back to Springfield."
The battle.
"On August 9, 1861, Lyon marched his troops from Springfield to where the Confederates were now camped at Wilson Creek. His plan called for Colonel Franz Sigel to do a flanking maneuver on the Confederates and attack them from their rear. The rest of Lyon's forces would attack from the north."
"On August 10, Sigel's flanking maneuver surprised the Confederate army. It allowed the Union army an early advantage. The two armies fought fiercely in the fields and hills around Wilson's Creek. After six hours of fighting and numerous casualties on both sides, the Union forces withdrew. Siegel's attack had at first proved very successful, but fell apart when he mistook the Confederate 3rd Louisiana for federal troops and allowed them to get too close without being challenged."
"Three times the confederates attacked the Union line and failed to break through all three times. During the battle, Lyon was killed and Major Samuel D. Sturgis replaced him. Meanwhile, Sigel's mistake had cost him the advantage and his forces were routed. After the third attack at about 11:00 am, the Confederates withdrew. With his ammunition running low and his men exhausted he withdrew to Springfield. Too disorganized to follow, the Confederate army did not pursue. Technically, it was a victory for the Confederate Army since the Union Army left the field. However, it can be considered a victory for the Union since they still kept control of Missouri. The Confederate army called the battle of Wilson’s Creek, the Battle of “Oak Hill(s)”."

"An example would be to use the number 9. For every number less than 8, the sigma is 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 10, 8 and 16. (""σ""(""m""))/""m"" is 16/9. (""σ""(n))/n is equal to 13/9. 13/9 is less than 16/9. This makes 9 not a superabundant number"
"The first few superabundant numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, ... ."

Isthmohyla pseudopuma
"The meadow tree frog or Gunther's Costa Rican tree frog (""Isthmohyla pseudopuma"") is a frog that lives in Costa Rica and Panama. In Panama and parts of Costa Rica, it lives between 1000 and 2400 meters above sea level. On the Pacific side (west) of the mountains in Costa Rica, it lives no more than 864 meters above sea level."
Appearance.
The adult male frog is 37.6 to 42.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 41.1 and 45.6 mm long.
This frog is brown and light brown on the back and yellow on its belly. It has a white stripe on both back legs. Some of them have blue color on their middles.
Actions.
"This frog hides during the day in bromeliad plants and other plants with large leaves. At night, it goes to trees and bushes to look for food."
"These frogs lay eggs after heavy rains. The males go to water, deep water if they can, and sing for the females. The females choose the largest male frogs. The female lays 500 eggs at a time, 1800 to 2500 eggs per female per year."
"The tadpoles eat plants and dead things. They will also eat frog eggs and smaller tadpoles. They will eat eggs and tadpoles from other species or other Gunther's Costa Rican tree frogs. If the pond starts to dry up, the tadpoles become frogs quicker than if it did not dry up."
Threats.
"This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives, because of climate change, and because there is more ultraviolet B light than there was. This light can hurt this frog."

"American bombers dropped 1,400 tons of bombs onto the Cassino Abbey."
"German paratroopers went into the abbey's ruins. Between 17 January and 18 May, Monte Cassino and the Gustav defences were attacked four times by Allied troops. The German defenders were finally driven from their positions, but with many losses for the Allies."
Background.
The Allied landings in Italy in September 1943 were followed by an advance north in two parts. An advance was made on each side of the mountain range in the middle of Italy.
"On the western side, U.S. Fifth Army moved from Naples. In the east General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army moved up the Adriatic coast."
The Fifth Army made slow progress because of difficult land and German defences. The Germans were protected in positions. The original plans that Rome would be captured by October 1943 did not occur.
"Although in the east the Ortona was captured, the advance stopped in December because of snow. Going to Rome from the east was not possible. Highway 6 ran through the Liri valley. The south entrance to this valley was Cassino. It was an important part of Gustav Line, the strongest defensive positions in the Winter Line."
"Because the old Benedictine Abbey was important to history, German units did not put defensive positions in the Abbey."
Some Allied aircraft saw German troops in the Abbey. The Abbey looked over the valley. This made it a good place for German artillery observers. This made Allied commanders want to bomb the Abbey.
First battle.
Plans and preparation.
"The plan of U.S. Fifth Army commander General Clark was for British X Corps to attack on January 17, 1944. The British 46th Infantry Division was to attack on January 19. This would support the main attack by U.S. II Corps on their right."
The main central attack by U.S. II Corps would start on January 20. The 36th (Texas) U.S. Infantry Division would cross a river five miles from Cassino. The French Expeditionary Corps would move towards Monte Cairo.
"Fifth Army had only reached the Gustav line on January 15, having taken six weeks and getting 16,000 casualties."
Attack.
"The first attack was made on January 17. Near the coast, British X Corps crossed the Garigliano. General von Senger, commander of German XIV Panzer Corps did not think he could stop the attack. He asked for more troops. The 29th and 90th Panzer Grenadier Divisions were sent to him. X Corps had 4,000 casualties during the first battle."
"The central attack by U.S. started on January 20. They were attacked by General Eberhard Rodt's 15th Panzer Grenadier Division. The attack was a failure, with 36th Division losing 2,100 men killed, wounded and missing in 48 hours."
The next attack was on January 24. The U.S. II Corps attacked across the
Rapido valley north of Cassino. The 34th Division pushed back General Franek's 44th Infantry Division.
"On the right, the Moroccan-French troops made good initial progress against the Germans. The two Moroccan-French divisions had 2,500 casualties in their battles around Monte Belvedere."
"The U.S. 34th Division had to fight southward. By early February, American infantry had captured point less than a mile from the abbey. By February 7 a battalion had reached a hill below the Abbey. Attempts to capture Monte Cassino were stopped by machine gun fire from the slopes."
Afterwards.
"On February 11, after a 3-day attack on Monastery Hill and Cassino town, the Americans pulled back. U.S. II Corps was tired after two and a half weeks of fighting. They lost 80% in the Infantry battalions, about 2,200 casualties."
Second battle.
"This was called Operation Avenger. With U.S. VI Corps under threat at Anzio, Freyberg asked to help at Cassini. Freyberg thought there was only a 50% chance of success for the attack."
Destruction of the abbey.
"Allied officers started to think the Germans were using the abbey of Monte Cassino as an artillery observation point. The Allies thought of bombing with ""blockbuster"" bombs."
"The bombing in the morning of February 15, 1944 involved 142 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses heavy bombers followed by 47 North American B-25 Mitchell and 40 Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. They dropped 1,150 tons of bombs on the abbey. This turned it into rubble. II Corps artillery shelled the mountain. The German positions above and behind the monastery were untouched."
After the bombing.
Pope Pius XII said nothing after the bombing. Cardinal Secretary of State called the bombing “stupidity.”
It is now known that the Germans had agreed not to use the Abbey for military purposes.
"Following its destruction, paratroopers of the German 1st Parachute Division occupied the ruins of the abbey. They turned it into a fortress and observation post."

Third Punic War
"The Third Punic War (149 BC to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. It was fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage, and the Roman Republic."
"The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars, and was mostly just the Romans attacking the city of Carthage in the Battle of Carthage. The Romans killed or captured all the people living inside of the city and tore down the buildings. They did this because they hated the Carthaginians after fighting two other wars with them, and didn't want to fight another, so they totally destroyed them."
Punic Wars
"The Punic Wars were a series of conflicts fought between Rome and Carthage between 264 and 146 BC. They were probably the largest wars in the ancient world. The term ""Punic"" comes from the Latin word ""Punicus"" (or ""Poenicus""). This was the word the Romans used for the Carthaginians, due to their Phoenician ancestry."
The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of Carthage and the expanding Roman Republic. What was at stake was control of the trading around the Mediterranean sea. Carthage lost the three wars.
Context.
"Carthage was a trading nation founded by Phoenicians. It was the dominant sea power in the western Mediterranean. It was a maritime empire, in contrast to the land-based Roman empire. The Romans decided they needed Sicily, which was then in Carthaginian hands. The consequence was a series of wars which lasted over a hundred years, and ended in the utter destruction of Carthage."

Formation and early years.
"Notts County started in 1862. The club was started before The Football Association and in the beginning they played a game with club rules, rather than association football. When it started, Notts County, like most sports teams, were considered to be a ""gentlemen-only"" club. Notts County are thought to be to be one of the starters of the current game, even being credited with the invention of the offside trap. Notts County is the oldest of the world's professional association football clubs (There are older professional clubs in other codes of football.)"
"The club in the beginning played at Park Hollow at Nottingham Castle. In December 1864, the decision was made to play games against outside teams, and it was decided that the club needed to find a larger stadium. After playing at several places, The Magpies settled at Trent Bridge Cricket Ground in 1883. When the ground was used for Cricket, they played at Castle Ground or Nottingham Forest's Town Ground. The club moved to their current stadium, Meadow Lane, in 1910."

World line
"A world line is the unique path that an object has as it travels through both space and time, usually called spacetime. As we learn from special relativity, the faster an object goes, the more time slows down for that object. As you can see in the illustration to the right, the slower object has a quicker passage of time than the very fast object, the one which time passes much more slowly for. When an object reaches the speed of light, it will be zero on the ""t"" axis, meaning that it will have made no progress in the time direction. Basically, the world lines show that when the speed of light is reached, time stops for the observer. World lines are very often used in theoretical physics and special relativity, as well as general relativity."
Usage.
"The concept of world lines is used widely in theoretical physics, for it shows some interesting facts about high-speed motion. For example, the time dilation equation presented by Albert Einstein is algebraically undefined when an object's velocity is the speed of light, but using world lines one can find that when the speed is the speed of light, time will stop. Although Einstein's equation (for time dilation) does show that an object going faster than light goes backward in time, the same concept can be described using world lines."

The name honored Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. He was the proprietor of the Northern Neck, a vast domain north of the Rappahannock River. His territory was then defined as stretching from Chesapeake Bay to what is now Hampshire County, West Virginia."
"The original plan of the town called for ten blocks, which form the core of Culpeper's downtown area today. The original town was surveyed by a young George Washington. In 1795, the town received a post office under the name ""Culpeper Court House"" Most maps of the time, however, continued to show the Fairfax name. The confusion resulting from the difference in official and postal names was finally resolved when the Virginia Assembly formally renamed the town Culpeper in 1869 (Acts, 1869–1870, chapter 118, page 154)."
"During the American Revolutionary War, the Culpeper Minutemen, a pro-independence militia, formed in the town of Culpeper. They organized in what was then known as ""Clayton's Old Field,"" near today's Yowell Meadow Park."
"During the Civil War, Culpeper was a crossroads for a number of armies marching through central Virginia, with both Union and Confederate forces occupying the town by turn. In the heart of downtown, the childhood home of Confederate General A.P. Hill stands at the corner of Main and Davis streets. One block north on Main St. (present location of Piedmont Realty) was the frame house where ""The Gallant Major"" John Pelham died after being wounded at the Battle of Kelly's Ford."
"Culpeper began to grow dramatically in the 1980s, becoming a ""bedroom community"" of more densely populated Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. suburbs. A growing number of residents of the town and county of Culpeper once lived and continue to work in those areas."
"In 2011, East Davis Street in downtown Culpeper was named as a 2011 ""America's Great Place"" by the American Planning Association."
2011 earthquake.
"Downtown Culpeper was one of the communities most affected by the August 23, 2011 Virginia earthquake. Several buildings along Main Street and East Davis Street suffered severe damage, and some have been condemned. The earthquake led to the temporary evacuation of the Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation. At the time it was hosting a town hall event for U.S. Senator Mark Warner. In 2014 the Museum of Culpeper History moved into the town's historic train depot."
Demographics.
"As of the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of the town was 61.5% White, 21.9% Black, 0.6% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, and 4.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.0% of the population."
"The town's population included 25.7% under the age of 18, 10.0% from 18 to 24, 30.3% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 15.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 87.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.9 males."
"The median income for a household in the town was at a time $35,438, and the median income for a family was $41,894 but due to the economic downturn this has changed. Males had a median income of $28,658 versus $25,252 for females. The per capita income for the town was $16,842. About 23.0% of families and 26.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 40.8% of those under age 18 and 22.1% of those age 65 or over."

Ratings and run-length achievements.
"Within its first month on air, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" overtook ""Pokémon"" as the highest rated Saturday-morning children's series on television. It held an average national Nielsen rating of 4.9 among children aged two through eleven, denoting 1.9 million viewers. Two years later, the series had firmly established itself as Nickelodeon's second highest-rated children's program, after ""Rugrats"". ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" was credited with helping Nickelodeon take the ""Saturday-morning ratings crown"" for the fourth straight season in 2001. The series had gained a significant adult audience by that point—nearly 40 percent of its 2.2 million viewers were aged 18 to 34. In response to its weekend success, Nickelodeon gave ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" time slots at 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM, Monday through Thursday, to increase the series' exposure. By the end of 2001, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" boasted the highest ratings for any children's series, on all of television. Weekly viewership of the series had reached around fifteen million, at least five million of whom were adults."
Triathlon
"A triathlon is a sport that consists of three different events one after another without resting in between. Usually, they are swimming, cycling, and running. Triathlon has been in the Olympic Games since 2000. One of the hardest and most famous triathlons is the Ironman Triathlon, which involves swimming two miles, biking a hundred miles, and then running a marathon."
Continuous function
"A mathematical function is called continuous if, roughly said, a ""small change"" in the input only causes a ""small change"" in the output. If this is not the case, the function is discontinuous. Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an ""uninterrupted line (or curve)"". They can be drawn ""without lifting the pen off of the page"". The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy."
"Karl Weierstraß gave another definition of continuity: Imagine a function ""f"", defined on the real numbers. At the point formula_1 the function will have the value formula_2. If the function is continuous at formula_1, then for every value of formula_4 no matter how small it is, there is a value of formula_5, so that formula_6, means that formula_7. We can put this another way, given a point close to formula_1 (called x), the ""absolute value"" of the difference between the two values of the function can be made increasingly small, if the point x is ""close enough"" to formula_1."
"There are also special forms of continuous, such as ""Lipschitz-continuous"". A function is Lipschitz-continuous if there is a formula_10 with formula_11 for all x,y ∈ (a,b)."
"A basic way to know if a function is continuous is to use a pencil or your finger. Then, start at the left of the function. Then, move your finger along the path of the function. If you ever need to lift your finger or pencil to keep following the function, then you know it is not continuous. This is because, by lifting your finger, you have ""jumped"" from one section of the function to another. That means you made a very small movement but the function changed very much. This is what the first sentence of this article is talking about."

The Pintupi moved back west, closer to their homeland around Lake Mackay. They set up the town of Kintore in 1981, about west of Papunya. During this time, local painters were slowly forming a new style of art. By the mid-1980s, it became internationally known as Papunya Tula."

They had been forced to leave these lands decades before because of weapons testing at Woomera in South Australia. Kintore is a major centre for the Western Desert art movement, which began at Papunya during the 1970s. The paintings made here are visual descriptions of dreamtime stories. They have gained fame around the world. A number of members of the Aboriginal art school Papunya Tula live at Kintore."

Abduction (logic)
"Abduction is the kind of practical logic which answers questions of the type ""how did this come about?"". It produces answers which are not guaranteed to be correct. Consider the observation that the lawn is wet in the morning. How did that happen? In London, the answer is most often that it rained. But in Los Angeles it is much more likely that someone left the sprinkler on."
"Abduction is logical inference which goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the observation. It makes the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. Abductive reasoning is ""inference to the best explanation""."
The philosopher (1839–1914) introduced abduction into modern logic.
Linezolid
"Linezolid is an antibiotic. It can heal serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that other antibiotics are do not heal. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria which cause disease, like streptococci and MRSA. It is mainly used to treat infections of the skin and pneumonia."
"It is relatively safe to take linezolid for short periods. It can be used in people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common harmful effects of short-term use include headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Long-term use, however, has been associated with more serious harmful effects."

"Kanata, Ontario"
"Kanata is a large suburban area in the western part of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It has a population of 90,000 and is growing very fast. It is just west of the Greenbelt. It is an important area for Hi-tech Businesses. It was an independent town from 1978 to 2000."
History.
"Kanata was originally part of the Township of March. It was settled by Europeans in the early 19th Century. It was mainly agricultural(Farms) until the 1960s when it became the site of a lot of construction. Modern Kanata is largely the creation of Bill Teron, a developer and urban planner who purchased over 3,000 acres (12 km2) of rural land and set about building a model community. It was planned to have a mix of offices, residential(Housing) area, and green area. Kanata was divided into a number of communities. Each was intended to have its own Business Center and unique culture. These include Beaverbrook, Glen Cairn, Bridlewood, Katimavik, Hazeldean, Morgan's Grant, and Kanata Lakes."
"Kanata grew Rapidly. In 1978 the Province of Ontario made Kanata a city separate from the Township of March. Kanata remained a city intil 2001 when it was merged with the city of Ottawa, along with many other cities."
"The city became an important hi-tech centre. DEC was one of the pioneer technology companies in Kanata. The DEC campus has been successively Digital, Compaq, and is now HP. Kanata remains home to many of the major hi-tech employers of Ottawa, such as Mitel, March Networks, Alcatel-Lucent, Dell Canada, Hewlett-Packard, Smart Technologies, Norpak, Nortel, MDS Nordion, Breconridge, AMCC, and Cisco Systems, Inc.. The hi-tech industry is clustered along March Road, in the Kanata North Business Park and Kanata Research Park, and along Eagleson Road, in the Kanata South Business Park."
Location.

Schulze method
"The Schulze method is a way of voting that is used to fill a single vacant position in an election. It was developed in 1997 by Markus Schulze. It is also known as Schwartz Sequential Dropping (SSD), Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping (CSSD), Beatpath Method, Beatpath Winner, Path Voting, and Path Winner. It is used by several organizations including Wikimedia, Debian, Gentoo, BerryTube, and the KDE."
How it works.
"Voters rank the candidates in the order from the one that they most want to win to the one they least want to win. The same preference (how much the voters want the candidate to win or lose) can be given to more than one candidate, and candidates can be given no number (they are interpreted as the worst)."
"Next, for every pair of two candidates, the two are compared: ignoring all other candidates, which of the two in the pair is preferred by most voters? How many voters agree with the majority decision is noted."
"More calculations take place. Given two candidates A and K, A is said to beat K with strength ""t"" if ""t"" voters prefer A to B, ""t"" voters prefer B to C, and so on, and ""t"" voters prefer J to K. The winner W is the candidate which beats any other candidate X with strength ""t"", but X does not beat W with strength ""t""."

After a bit of conversation, the group of friends moves into John Oldman’s house. John’s friends keep asking why he decided to “run off” so quickly. John Oldman does not answer clearly at first, but gradually becomes drawn to telling his friends what is really on his mind. He begins to tell his friends about who he really is, a 14,000 year old Cro-Magnon caveman who has survived until the present. His friends aren’t convinced, but rather constantly question John Oldman in order to prove him wrong. The talk goes on as John Oldman’s friends try to prove him wrong, in biological, historical, and religious terms."
The conversations are driven by John Oldman’s claims of his past. His claims include the following:

Enol
An enol is an alkene that has an OH group attached to one end of the double bond. It is called an enolate if the proton on the oxygen atom is taken away.
"Enols are tautomers of ketones or aldehydes. Tautomers are molecules which are different only in the position of an hydrogen atom. Enols can be made very easily from ketones or aldehydes using a base. They are quite unstable, because the C=O bond is stronger than the C=C bond. However, they can do many interesting reactions. The best example is the aldol reaction."
"Enols of ketones can be made on two different sides. It is important to be able to choose which side to react. The side with less substituents is the easiest one to react: it can be made at low temperature with a bulky base. This is called the kinetic enolate. The other side, with more substituents, is more difficult to react. Higher temperatures are needed. This is called the thermodynamic enolate."
Steric effects
"Steric effects are the effects seen in molecules that come from the fact that atoms occupy space. When atoms are put close to each other, this costs energy. The electrons near the atoms want to stay away from each other. This can change the way molecules want to react. It can also change the shape (or conformation) of the molecule. The amount of space that a group of atoms takes is called the ""steric bulk""."
"An example of steric effects is steric hindrance. This is when a large group in a molecule makes reactions not work. For example, an SN2 reaction does not happen on carbon atoms that have three substituents. Steric hindrance however can also be a positive thing. Sometimes, chemists would like a reaction to happen in one place rather than another one. A bulky group can block a position. It can also change the shape such that only one diastereomer from a reaction is made."
"Steric effects are usually smaller than electronic effects. These affect the molecule's shape and reactivity as well, but they come from the way electrons are placed in bonds."

Cypripedioideae
"Lady's slipper orchids are the orchids in the subfamily Cypripedioideae. They are special because of their slipper-shaped pouches on their flowers. The pouch traps insects so that they must climb up past the modified stamens, where they get or give pollen, fertilizing the flower."
Some people think this subfamily should be different from the Orchidaceae as a family Cypripediaceae.
Pollination.
"A lady slipper orchid has a deep pocket that is actually a bee trap. When a bee crawls down into the flower to get the nectar, the pocket on the flower closes shut. Because of this, the bee is stuck for a while, wiggling and squirming, getting pollen all over itself."
"The bee finally finds a small opening near the top of the orchid, and it gets out so that it can get trapped inside another lady slipper, where it will give that pollen to the other lady slipper's stigma."
"The lady's slipper is also known in the United States of America as the ""moccasin flower"", because it looks like a shoe or moccasin."

Born in the home of an important scholar named Brahmin, Pandita Ramabai had more freedom than many Indian women. Her father taught her and her mother to read Sanskrit writing. She then began to study Christianity in India, and later in England. She decided that it was the best religion; that she should be a Christian. However, she had not yet received Jesus into her ""heart"". Ramabai later said,"

Ruy Lopez
"The Ruy Lopez, also called the ""Spanish Opening"", is an old chess opening. It is named after the Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. He may have invented the opening. These are the opening moves:"
"The Ruy Lopez is one of the most common and well-liked openings. There are many ways to play it. It has always been popular in master chess. White's idea is to try and undermine the center by attacking the knight with his bishop. However, White will not be always able to win a pawn immediately:"
"For this reason White usually plays a longer-term strategy, starting with:"
"Here, Black has two main options. Black can either play with an open center, with 5... Nxe4 or play a closed, positional game with 5... Be7. These openings are called the Open Ruy Lopez and the Closed Ruy Lopez."
Closed Variation.
The closed variation of the Ruy Lopez comes after these moves:
This line leads to a closed . White's idea will be to break open the center with d4. Play typically continues:
"These are the main moves for White. However, White can also play 7. h3 or 7. a4. These moves are played in order to avoid the Marshall Variation."

When the Nintendo DS launched in 2004, it included an early demo of ""Metroid Prime Hunters"", which at that point was titled ""Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt""."
"Like the other titles in the ""Metroid Prime"" series, ""Metroid Prime Hunters"" is a first-person adventure game where the focus is on exploration and discovery. However, it differs from other titles in that there is no assisted aiming, a bigger focus on gameplay, and online multiplayer. Samus Aran, the main character that the player plays as, can access her gunship from anywhere. The game uses both screens of the Nintendo DS: the top screen is used to show Samus' health and the amount of a weapon remaining, while the bottom screen shows the radar. The player moves Samus with the D-pad, and aiming is done with the use of the touch screen on the Nintendo DS' bottom screen."
"Online multiplayer can be played with up to four players. Players can play as Samus or one of six bounty hunters. Each bounty hunter has different forms and weapons. The game's host is able to set options for points and time limits, as well as determine whether or not players can use the radar. If less than four players join a game, computer-controlled characters are placed into the game. In multiplayer, the bottom screen shows the number of kills a player has made and the time remaining in the round."

Commerzbank Tower
"Commerzbank Tower is a skyscraper in Frankfurt am Main, Hessen, Germany. At 259 meters, or 850 feet (300 meters with antenna included), it is Germany's tallest skyscraper and the third tallest building in Europe. It was completed and opened in 1997."
"Commerzbank Tower is located in Frankfurt's district ""Innenstadt"" in the centre of the city. It is home to the headquarters of the second largest German bank, Commerzbank."
History.
"From 1970 onwards, the previous head offices were centralised in Frankfurt am Main, where the legal seat has also been located since 1990. In the early 1990s, Commerzbank sought to build a new skyscraper in the center of Frankfurt am Main. The aim was to consolidate a large part of the rented locations in the city. The extraordinary skyscraper was designed by Lord Norman Foster. Since 1997, the tower has been a prominent feature of the Frankfurt skyline and is regarded as a model for environmentally friendly and energy-saving architecture."
Architecture.
"The floor plan forms a triangle with slightly outwardly curved sides. The tower appears open and transparent due to the atrium, also triangular. A double-skin facade encloses the building. The stepped top of the tower creates a striking building termination and sets an expressive sign for the banking district. The building was constructed from 1994 to 1997 and cost 600 million DM. It has 56 floors and an area of 109,200 square metres. The architect who designed the building is Norman Foster. The skyscraper weighs about 200,000 tonnes and contains 18,800 tonnes of steel - twice as much as the Eiffel Tower in Paris."
Green Building.
"The architect and his client worked together to make the Commerzbank tower innovatively environmentally- and climate-friendly. Natural ventilation and environmentally-friendly air conditioning create a long-term contribution to climate protection. The tower has been supplied entirely with ""green"" electricity since the beginning of 2008 and - like all Commerzbank buildings - is cleaned exclusively with biodegradable cleaning products. In 2009 the city of Frankfurt awarded the Commerzbank tower the ""Green Building Frankfurt"" award."
Present.
"The magnificent building at the Kaiserplatz in Frankfurt is the Commerzbank's Head Office, and 2.800 people work there."
Messeturm
"MesseTurm is a skyscraper in Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, Germany. In English it is known as the ""Trade Fair Tower"". It is Germany's second tallest, and at the time of its building, it was the tallest building in Europe. It is the fourth tallest building in Europe. It is 257 metres (840 feet) tall."
"MesseTurm is located in Frankfurt's district ""Westend"". This is near the same named Trade Fair-Area in the centre of the city. It is home to the German headquarters of Reuters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse."
"The construction began in 1988. It was finished in 1991. It was the tallest building in Europe, between 1991 and 1997. In 1997, Commerzbank Tower became the tallest building in Germany. It was only two metres higher than MesseTurm. The construction of the building's foundation set a world record. The world record was for the longest continuous concrete pour. Ninety trucks poured concrete for 78 hours. They poured it into the deep foundation."
"There is a pyramid on the very top of MesseTurm. It is tall. This makes it very different from other skyscrapers. Because of this shape, people in Germany often call it ""The Pencil."""

People have lived in the area for hundreds of thousands of years but it became a permanent town by the time of the Saxons.
The Domesday Book says there were 120 people living there in the 1100s. The Normans built a small castle there but it was unused and broken by the time of the Tudors.
"The town grew as an important centre for transport. After 1769, ships were able to use the river. It was a stagecoach stop for travel on the road between London and Cambridge. In 1842 the town got a railway station."
"In 1901 there were 7,000 people living there, and by 1951 it was 13,000."
The town is popular for travellers to London because of the M11 motorway (an important road) and good train services to London. Stansted Airport has also caused development.
Raven
"A raven is a big black bird, (""Corvus corax""). It may be called the common raven or the northern raven. It is similar to a crow but bigger. It and the thick-billed raven are the two largest birds in the crow family, and perhaps the heaviest perching birds. The raven's feathers are all black, but a crow has feathers that are white at the bottom. This cannot be seen from a distance."
"The most famous raven is in the Edgar Allan Poe story called ""The Raven""."
"The common raven can be tamed. Some think it is mischievous and sly, and it has been regarded as a bird of evil and mysterious character."
Malnutrition
Malnutrition is eating a diet which does not supply enough nutrients. There are two broad cateogries of malnutrition:
"Sometimes, people need to lose weight, and eat according to a special diet. This is usually not called malnutrition."
"Malnutrition is considered a more scientific and official term than starvation which has negative associations. Malnutrition is not, however, simply a matter of eating too little. Someone can be malnourished if they eat an unhealthy diet. This can be cured by eating a proper balanced diet."
"Children whose daily diet contains less carbohydrate and protein do not grow well. They do not gain weight. Their hands and legs appear as skin and bones. They cry all the time with hunger. They are not active and have sunken eyes. Such children often fall sick. Lack of a particular vitamin is another kind of malnutrition which can cause a particular deficiency disease, such as beriberi and rickets."
"Malnutrition becomes a bigger problem during famine because most of the people do not get enough food, hence increasing the death rate."
The popularity of the folder has lead to modern computers to use a type of data storage called a folder.

An IPv6 address can be long and this can lead to mistakes when typing them into the computer or writing them down. There are two ways in which an IPv6 address can be made shorter without leaving anything out:
DNS.
DNS stands for Domain Name System
"It is also called a service server, and is based on client server network architecture. Like a phonebook, it contains a database of public IP addresses."
Other versions.
"Versions before IPv4 were experimental and never widely used. Version 5 was used exclusively for the Internet Stream Protocol, which was also never widely used."
Eurasia
"Eurasia is the combined landmass of Europe and Asia in the northern part of Earth. It has the Atlantic Ocean on its west, and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The Arctic Ocean is to its north, and the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean to its south. It is the largest of the continents. Its name comes from adding the ""Eur"" from ""Europe"" to ""Asia"". It and Africa form a part of the world called ""Afro-Eurasia""."
"Some geographers say Eurasia is one continent, because Europe and Asia are mostly on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them. The Ancient Greeks divided the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa. To them, the Aegean Sea was the division between the Balkan Peninsula in Europe and Asia Minor in Asia. North of the Sea of Marmara, the Greeks thought the lands on the western side of the Black Sea was Europe and the eastern side was Asia. The ancient Greeks did not know very much about the lands north of the Black Sea. Since Classical Antiquity, people have talked about Asia and Europe separately, so it is now a tradition to see them as two continents."
"Some other continents, which are not completely divided by sea, are joined together by a thin strip of land (called an isthmus). An example is North America and South America, which are connected by the Isthmus of Panama. Europe and Asia are not divided by a sea, nor by any isthmus."
"Outside of geological definitions, Eurasia also includes the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula."
"Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. Here, the dividing line is the Ural Mountains. West Eurasia includes Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia, because the Sahara Desert divides North Africa from Sub-Saharan Africa, and it is as difficult to cross as a sea. Also, North Africa is culturally linked to Europe by the Mediterranean Sea."
List of countries.
The OECD’s Eurasia activities involve 13 countries extending from the borders of the European Union to the Far East:
North Pole
The North Pole is the point that is farthest north on Earth. It is the point on which axis of Earth turns. It is in the Arctic Ocean and it is cold there because the sun does not shine there for about half a year and never rises very high. The ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice.
There is also a Magnetic North Pole. It is near the physical North Pole. A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole.
There is a star called the North Star (or Polaris) that is always in the sky above the North Pole. People can tell how far north they are by seeing how high the North Star appears in the sky.
Plural
"In linguistics, noun phrases have grammatical number. Plural is one kind of grammatical number. In English, plural noun phrases are counted as more or less than one (e.g., ""32 degrees, no bananas"", ""0.5 liters"", ""1.2 grams"", ""two times"", ""three fish"", ""20 mothers""). In contrast, a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only (e.g., ""one time"", ""a glass"", ""the sun"", ""my mother"", ""Jennifer""). Noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in English (e.g., ""water"", ""the meat"", ""some space"", etc.)."
"In many languages, a suffix (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In English, the normal plural suffix ""i""s ""-s"" (e.g., ""cat"" is singular, and ""cats"" is plural)."
Plurals in English.
There are a number of exceptions:
"It is fair to say that most native English-speakers make mistakes in this area, which is one of the more troublesome aspects of English."
Other languages.
All European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each language is different from the one that is applied to English nouns.
"In other languages, such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, there is usually no plural ending."

Filter feeder
"Filter feeders are animals that feed on matter and food particles from water. Some animals that do this are clams, krill, sponges, baleen whales and many fish such as sharks. Some birds such as flamingos are also filter feeders. Filter feeders can help clear water."
Surinam horned toad
Ceratophrys is a genus of frogs. They are part of the family Leptodactylidae. They are also part of the subfamily Ceratophryinae. They are also known as South American horned frogs as well as Pacman frogs. This is because they look like the video game character Pac-Man.

"The RAAF Woomera Test Range is a weapons testing facility in South Australia. It is run by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It covers and area of , and is the world's largest weapons test facility on land. The range is a restricted area, called the Woomera Prohibited Area. The airspace above it is also restricted, and is called the Woomera Restricted Airspace."
"The range was originally set up as a place for the British to test missiles during World War II. The British asked to do weapons testing here (in the centre of Australia), because not many people lived there. A Commonwealth weapons design and test project, called the Australian-Anglo Joint Project, was signed in 1946. The range originally had an area of ."
"Between 1955 and 1963, the British ran a series of seven nuclear-weapon tests at Maralinga, then inside the range. The Joint Project ran until 1980, when the British withdrew from the program. The range is still used as a testing site by the Australian Defence Force. Access is leased to foreign militaries and private companies for their own testing of weapons."
It is named after the Dharuk word for a spear-thrower.
"Balgo, Western Australia"
"Balgo is a small community in Western Australia. It is surrounded by the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert. It is an Aboriginal community; the area is traditionally Kukatja country. There are also some Pintupi families living there, who were displaced in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of them came to live here from Papunya, including some of the original artists of the Papunya Tula movement. Many of them later left Balgo when Kintore and Kiwirrkurra were set up in the 1980s. In 2006, Balgo had about 460 people living there."

Charles Perkins
"Charles Nelson Perkins, AO, (16 June 1936 – 19 October 2000) was an Australian activist and Aboriginal leader. He was also a professional football player."
"Perkins grew up in Alice Springs. His mother was Arrernte, and his father was Kalkadoon. He later moved to Sydney, and graduated from the University of Sydney in 1965. He was the first indigenous Australian to graduate from a university."
"Perkins campaigned for Aboriginal land rights. In 1965, he was an important person in the Freedom Ride campaign, which aimed to raise public awareness of the standards of living, literacy and health conditions among the Aboriginal population. The group was famous for publicising acts of discrimination."
"Perkins was also important in the campaign for the referendum in 1967, which allowed Aboriginal people to be counted in censuses, and parliament to make special laws specifically for Aboriginal people. From 1969, Perkins worked as a public servant in the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs. He was made permanent secretary of this department in 1981, which made him the first Aboriginal to become the permanent head of a federal government department. He served as secretary until 1988."
Perkins died in October 2000 of kidney failure.
Kottabos (Kleophrades Painter)
"Kottabos Player is an Attic red-figure terracotta kylix said to have been painted by someone close to the Kleophrades Painter. It dates to the Greek Archaic period, about 500 BC. The kylix's height with handles is 3 3/16 in. (8.1 cm) and its width with handles is 10 1/16 in. (25.5 cm)."
The diameter of the bowl is 7 5/8 in. (19.3 cm). The kylix is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The figure is a symposiast playing a party game called kottabos. He is about to fling the last of the wine in his cup at a lamp stand in an attempt to knock the lamp stand's finial off. The winner was he who did so.
"Bosley Crowther did not like the movie. He wrote, ""The script was obviously written to bring [Wyman] and Mr. Hudson, who made a popular twosome in the ""Magnificent Obsession"", together again. Solid and sensible drama plainly had to give way to outright emotional bulldozing and a paving of easy clichés."""

"Shapley 1 (also known as ""Sp 1"" or ""PLN 329+2.1"") is a planetary nebula in the constellation of Norma. The nebula was discovered by the astronomer Harlow Shapley in 1936 and it is about 1,000 lightyears away from Earth."
Pus
"Pus is a fluid that is created as a result of certain inflammations in vertebrates. In vertebrates, white blood cells fight the inflammation. Neutrophils destroy the agents that cause the infection, for example bacteria, macrophages engulf and neutralise these agents. Pus is made of dead neutrophils and macrophages, mostly. In most cases, pus is the result of bacterial infection, but it can also result from other conditions, such as psoriasis."
Leptin
Leptin is a hormone made by cells in fat tissue that reduces hunger. That helps the energy balance in the body.
"Leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin, the ""hunger hormone"". Both hormones act on receptors in the hypothalamus. They adjust appetite to get energy homeostasis."
"In obesity, a decreased sensitivity to leptin comes up. This leads to a feeling of hunger, despite high energy stores."
"Although regulation of fat stores is the primary function of leptin, it also plays a role in other physiological processes. These additional functions are still being studied."
Leptin was recently discovered in 1994 by Jeffrey M. Friedman and colleagues at Rockefeller University. Its discovery is important in the study of obesity which has become a problem in western society. The importance of leptin was discovered through experiments done on mice in a laboratory. Scientists found that mice who had more leptin in their bodies were thinner and didn't need to eat as much. Leptin levels can be increased by reducing stress and having quality or restful sleep.
Pollyanna (1960 movie)
"Pollyanna (1960) is a Walt Disney Productions movie. It stars child actress Hayley Mills and Jane Wyman. The movie is based on the 1913 children's novel ""Pollyanna"" by Eleanor Porter.

Violence against women
"Violence against women (VAW in short), also called gender-based violence, is violent acts mostly against women and girls. It is sometimes considered a hate crime. The reason for that is such acts of violence are done against women and girls mainly because they're female."
"The United Nations' Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women says: ""violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power of relations between men and women."""
"Violence against women has several broad categories: rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual violence, forced marriage and female genital mutilation are among those categories."
"On 11 May 2011, Council of Europe has adopted Istanbul Convention against domestic violence and violence against women."
Vacation
"A vacation (American English) or holiday (British English) is a time for people to relax and take a break from whatever they usually do. People spend their vacation time in different ways. For many, it's a time for tourism. They might go backpacking to a holiday camp, or stay in a trailer, hostel, or hotel. Families often take a vacation together. Because the cost of many things is becoming higher, some people are giving up going on vacation to other countries, and are staying in their home country and finding interesting places to go there. This type of trip is known colloquially as a ""staycation""."
"Vacations are usually taken when somebody has time off of work or school. This means that many people go on vacation during religious or national holidays. Many jobs allow for workers to have several days off during which they will still be paid. This practice, known as annual leave, is another common time for people to go on vacation."
Indigenous marriage in South Africa
"Indigenous marriage in South Africa is a social and legal bond between two clans. This bond is built around a man and a woman in a ukulobola covenant. The delivery of ikhazi things like cattle or other valuables from the man’s family to the woman’s. This bond connects the two clans in a permanent relationship. Children the man and woman have make the bond stronger. When the man and woman are married, the woman will leave her clan and join the man's clan."

"Sir Richard Timothy Hunt , (born 19 February 1943 in Neston, Cheshire), is an English biochemist. He is usually known as Tim Hunt."
Hunt shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on cell division.
The prize was shared with Paul Nurse and Leland H. Hartwell. They had discovered the molecules which control cell division.
"Cyclins are proteins that play a key role in regulating the cell-division cycle. Hunt found that cyclins begin to be synthesised after eggs are fertilised. He also found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells, where they also regulate the cell cycle."
Early life.
"At the age of eight he was accepted into the Dragon School, where he first developed an interest in biology thanks to his German teacher, Gerd Sommerhoff."
"When he was fourteen he moved to Magdalen College School, Oxford, where the science prizes now bear his name."
Career.
"In 1961, Hunt was accepted into Clare College, Cambridge to study natural sciences, graduating in 1964 and immediately beginning work in the university Department of Biochemistry."
"He finished his PhD in 1968 and went to New York to work on protein synthesis. Tiny amounts of glutathione inhibited protein synthesis in reticulocytes (immature red blood cells), and tiny amounts of RNA killed the synthesis altogether. After returning to Cambridge he continued work on substances which started or inhibited protein synthesis."
"In 1982 at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, he used the sea urchin (""Arbacia punctulata"") egg as his model organism. He discovered the cyclin molecule."
Hunt found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells where they regulate the cell cycle. His group showed that cyclins bind and activate a family of protein kinases. One of these had been identified as a crucial cell cycle regulator by Paul Nurse.
"In 1990 he began work at Imperial Cancer Research Fund. In 2001 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Leland Hartwell and Paul Nurse for their work on cell division. Other honours followed, and he was knighted by the Queen in 2006."
Personal life.
Hunt is married to Mary Collins. The couple have two daughters.

Architecture.
"Distinctive features of the college's architecture have been used as models by a number of other academic institutions. The University of Chicago and Cornell University both have reproductions of Christ Church's dining hall. Christ Church Cathedral, New Zealand, after which the City of Christchurch is named, is itself named after Christ Church, Oxford. Stained glass windows in the cathedral and other buildings are by the Pre-Raphaelite William Morris group with designs by Edward Burne-Jones."

Roman Wallner also played for Hannover 96, Admira Wacker, Austria Vienna, Falkirk, Hamilton Academical, Apollon Kalamarias and Skoda Xanthi. After his years in Greece he came back to Austria playing for LASK Linz. Because he had also personal problems during his time in foreign countries the contract with LASK was his last chance to gain success in football. He played this year very successfully and scored 19 goals for LASK and Red Bull Salzburg where he went in winter 2010. In the 2010/11 season he was the best scorer for Red Bull Salzburg with 18 goals in the league and 4 goals in international matches."
Emergency telephone
"An emergency telephone is a special telephone that can be used in an emergency situation. Such telephones can usually be found on highways, and other big roads. They can also be found in places where people feel unsafe, such as big parks or the campuses of universities. Emergency telephones are also placed at spots where many people commit suicide, like bridges or cliffs."
"Emergency phones are usually connected directly, there is no need to dial a telephone number. Lifting the receiver, or pushing a button will make the call. Very often emergency telephones will also tell the other side where they are. This is because people may not know where they are or they may be in shock because of an accident that just happened."
"There are many special rules that apply to emergency telephones. They need to be in special colors, because color-blind people may not be able to tell the difference between certain colors. They also need to be easy to use. In an emergency situation, many people do not have time to think about how to operate them."

History.
"The stadium was built at the previous location of a Brazilian Army powder depot. In 1934, the stadium was renamed Estádio Joaquim Américo Guimarães. In the 1970s, the original stadium was closed down. After being reopened in 1984 and operating for some years, the old stadium building was demolished on March 26, 1997, right after a construction project of a new arena was announced. In June 1999, the new stadium was built. In 2005, the stadium was renamed ""Kyocera Arena"", after the Japanese company Kyocera purchased the naming rights."
"The inaugural match of the old stadium was played on September 6, 1914, when Flamengo beat Internacional 7–1. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Flamengo's Arnaldo."
"The inaugural match of the new building was played on June 24, 1999, when Atlético Paranaense beat Cerro Porteño of Paraguay 2–1. The first goal of the stadium after its reinauguration was scored by Atlético's Lucas."
"The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 31,740. It was set on December 16, 2001 when Atlético Paranaense beat São Caetano 4–2, on the first game of that year's Brazilian Championship finals."
"The contract with Kyocera that gave the company naming rights expired in early 2008. It was not renewed, and no new partnership was announced. The stadium went back to its old name, ""Arena da Baixada""."

Eye colour
"Eye color is a visible character caused by two factors: the pigmentation of the eye's iris, and way light is scattered as it hits the top layer of the iris."
"The human eye is different from its nearest relative, the chimpanzee eye. The eyes of chimps and also gorillas are entirely brown. Humans have the white to their eyes. This difference is thought to be significant. In the apes, individuals do not usually look directly at other members of the family, but all the same they keep a close watch on what is going on with the family group. They tend to look out of the corners of their eyes, as if to keep the glance secret. Perhaps to them a direct look is aggressive. Jane Goodall used to be careful and avoid looking directly at the gorilla families in the bush. She would sit at a distance, appearing to nibble at grass and leaves, while making occasional glances at the gorilla family."
Physical cause.
"In humans, the pigment of the iris varies from light brown to black. This depends on the amount of melanin in the iris. The appearance of blue, green and hazel eyes result from the Rayleigh scattering of light in the iris. A similar process accounts for the blueness of the sky. Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or fluid. Eye colour is an example of structural colour which varies according to the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes."
"The brightly coloured eyes of many birds, reptiles and insects is caused by other pigments, such as pteridines, purines, and carotenoids."
Genetics.
"The view that blue eye colour is a simple recessive trait is incorrect. Two main gene loci code for the eye pigment: ""OCA2"" and ""HERC2"". They sit next to each other on chromosome 15. Mutations (SNPs) to these genes account for much of the variation seen in eye colour. ""OCA2"" mutations close to the 5′ regulatory region explain most human eye-color variation. An intron in ""HERC2"" contains the promoter region for ""OCA2"", affecting its expression."
"There are about 15 other genes which have some effect on eye colour inheritance. This is an effect called epistasis, and is not unusual."
Iris (eye)
"The iris (plural: irides or irises) is a thin, circular structure in the eye. It controls the diameter and size of the pupils."
"Eye colour is the colour of the iris. In humans, the iris may look green, blue, brown, hazel (a combination of light brown, green and gold), grey, violet, or even pink. In response to the amount of light exiting the eye, muscles attached to the iris expand or contract the pupil. The larger the pupil, the more light can enter the eye and reach the retina."

Awards.
Lee received a 2010 International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. Department of State.
Wasted username
A wasted username or wasted account is a user account on a website that was not used very much (or at all) after it was made. A person who makes an account like this is called a namewaster or a name waster.
"This word came from YouTube, where many people would post both funny and hateful comments on namewasters' YouTube channels. This was an Internet phenomenon until 2012, when YouTube deleted a lot of these wasted accounts."
Chain mail
"Mail, or chain mail, is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour. Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest."
Etymology.
"The origins* of the word ""mail"" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word ""macula"", meaning ""spot"" or ""opacity"". Another theory relates the word to the Old French ""maillier"", meaning “to hammer” (related to the modern English word ""malleable""). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders."
History.
"Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC. At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe. The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead. Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship. Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century."
Modern uses.
Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters. Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks. But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors. It is also popular in live action role playing.
Afar Triangle
The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.
"The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia."
Human fossils.
Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans.
"Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna."
Geography.
"The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level."
"The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth."
"The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map."
Plate tectonics.
"The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt."
"Restart is a Brazilian teenage pop band. The band's hit songs include ""Recomeçar"", ""Vou Cantar"", ""Levo Comigo"" and ""Amanhecer no Teu Olhar""."
Water treatment
Water treatment is treating water to make it suitable to be used. Providing drinking water is one of the main uses of water treatment.
Many factories also need very clean water to make steam or to make high quality products. Some of this water has to be made very pure with almost no other chemicals dissolved in it.
Treating sewage so that it does not cause harm to the environment is another use of water treatment.
Which type of water is generally used in the treatment of water?
"Saline water can be treated to yield fresh water. Two main processes are used, reverse osmosis or distillation. Both methods require more energy than water treatment of local surface waters, and are usually only used in coastal areas or where water such as groundwater has high salinity."

How is water treated to make it drinkable?
"Filtration - The clear water on top passes through filters composed of sand, gravel and charcoal to remove dissolved particles such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses and chemicals. Disinfection - Chlorine or chloramine is added to kill parasites, bacteria, viruses and germs.Apr 14, 2016"
What is the difference between water treatment and water purification?
"Also known as water purification, water treatment is the process of removing potentially harmful impurities from drinking water. Unlike water filtration, water treatment systems can get rid of all unseen materials by chemically treating the water with iodine or chlorine. ...Nov 4, 2019"

Soju
"Soju is a distilled drink. Soju literally means ""burned liquor""."
"This kind of distilled beverage was first found in Persia, where the distillation methods of producing alcoholic beverage originated from. But through a Mongolian who contacted Islamic culture did this kind of alcoholic beverage and the distillation techniques of making such a drink come about to the East."
"As soju became prevalent throughout Won Dynasty of China, it eventually spread throughout Korea Kingdom, where it became so popular that numerous kinds of soju were created. Because soju created at that time were made from pure grains, it was very tasty and clean. It was also not so strong. However, it was very expensive simply because it was distilled."
"Nowadays, soju is very popular in South Korea. Koreans enjoy drinking soju as a means of promoting friendship and getting closer to each other. Usually, people drink it with ""anju"", a side dish, so as to moderate its bitterness."
Goguryeo
"Goguryeo is a dynasty of ancient Korea which was begun by Jumong () in 37 BC. It was started in the area near the Dongga River, a branch of the Abrok River. Jolbon was the capital city founded by Jumong."
"The legend of the nation's birth is that Jumong was born out of an egg and brought up by King Gumwa () of East Buyeo. The name, Jumong, means a person who is good at archery. Because of his archery skills, Prince Daeso () envied him. So, Jumong felt death threats and decided to escape from East Buyeo with three friends. He went to Jolbon Buyeo and married Sosuno () who was the princess of the nation. Jumong succeeded the king and changed the nation's name to Goguryeo after his surname."
"Since the first king, King Dongmyeong (), Goguryeo had been invaded by several enemies such as the Chinese Han Dynasty, and Xianbei. But, by 11th king's reign, Goguryeo had succeeded in taking control over Liaoong. Until the 24th king's period, it had had its golden age, expanding the range of the nation and driving away all the attacks from ouside. The most famous king was King Gwanggaeto the Great ()."
"However, when it was under the control of 27th king, Youngryou (), Goguryeo was becoming a vassal of the Tang Dynasty. Because of this, the king was killed by Yoen Gaesomoon () and a new king, Bojang () succeeded. After Yoen Gaesomoon died, the people did not cooperate with the nation well and while its control got weak, it was destroyed by the allied forces of Tang and Silla."
Wilhelm Pieck
"Friedrich Wilhelm Reinhold Pieck (3 January 1876 in eastern Guben (today Poland) - 7 September 1960 in Berlin) was an (East) German communist politician. He was a member of the Spartacus League. He was joint founder, and from 1946 to 1950 co-chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED, together with Otto Grotewohl), and from 1949 to his death in 1960 the first and only president of the GDR."
"During the Weimar Republic he was a member of the Landtag of Prussia from 1921 to 1928, and afterwards a member of the Reichstag from 1928 to 1933, both on behalf of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD)."
Beth Elamen Cemetery
"Beth Elamen is the only Jewish cemetery in Beirut, capital of Lebanon. Its spelling in Hebrew is """", meaning: ""House of Cemetery""."
The cemetery is very close to Sodeco Square. It can also be reached using the Damascus Expressway.
Broxbourne railway station
"Broxbourne railway station, opened in 1840, serves Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, England. It is on the West Anglia Main Line, and train services are provided by Abellio Greater Anglia, who also manage the station."
Daemon (computer software)
"In Unix, and in other computer multitasking operating systems, a daemon ( or ) is a computer program that runs as a background task. Many daemons have names that end with the letter ""d"": for example, syslogd, the daemon that handles the system log, httpd, a daemon that handles web requests, or sshd, which takes care of incoming SSH connections."
This frog moves around at night but it does sometimes move during the day. It can climb trees but it spends most of its time on the ground.
The female frog lays 5 to 60 eggs at a time in bodies of water at least 4 inches deep. The eggs sometimes stick to twigs or other things underwater. The tadpoles are about 45 mm long. They are black or yellow-brown in color with a white or near-white belly.
Edible frog
"The edible frog (""Pelophylax"" kl. ""esculentus"") is a species of frogs. It lives in Europe. It is also known as water frog or green frog. However, green frog is usually given to the North American frog ""Lithobates clamitans"". The Edible frog is used as a food source to people in France."
Texas toad
"The Texas toad (""Bufo speciosus"") is a species of toads. They are very small only reaching three inches. They live in the United States in the state of Texas. But they are also found in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Mexico."
"French Cathedral, Berlin"
"(German for: French Cathedral) is the colloquial naming for the ""French Church of Friedrichstadt"" (, ) in Berlin on the Gendarmenmarkt across from the Deutscher Dom (""German Cathedral""), formerly a church of German-speaking congregants."
"The first parts of the actual ""French Church"" were built from 1701 to 1705 for the Huguenot (Calvinist) community. At that time, Huguenots made up about 25% of Berlin's population. The ""French Church"" was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot temple in Charenton-Saint-Maurice, France."
"In 1785 Carl von Gontard modified the church and built - wall to wall next to it - the domed tower, which - together with the French-speaking congregants - earned the church its naming. The domed tower is technically no part of the church, there is no access between church and tower, because both buildings have different owners. The tower, similar to that of Deutscher Dom, was simply built to give the Gendarmenmarkt a symmetric design."
The church is not a cathedral in the strict sense of the word because it has never been the seat of a bishop.
"The domed tower, which is a viewing platform open to visitors, provides a panoramic view of Berlin. A restaurant is located in the basement underneath the prayer hall. The tower also contains the Huguenot museum of Berlin."
Cane toad
"The cane toad (""Bufo marinus"") is a species of toad. They are also known as the giant neotropical toad and the marine toad."
"Cane toads are terrestrial amphibians. This means that they only go back to the water to lay their eggs. They live in Central America and South America. However, they have been introduced to Oceania and the Caribbean."
In Australia.
"Nearly 80 years ago, a group of 102 cane toads were sent to Queensland to catch sugar beetles."
"Cane-growers were concerned about the damage insect larvae were doing to crops. The insects were native to Australia, but bad for the valuable cane crops."
"The first cane toads were brought into Queensland by Reginald Mungomery, an entomologist. Before 1935, Australia had no toads. The entire continent, full of various frog species, had no toads. Tough and always moving into new areas, the cane toads started reproducing and expanding outwards every wet season. This ""invasion front"" moved around 10 km a year until the 1960s, when it began speeding up significantly."
"Cane toads are rapidly adapting to dry climates, a huge change from their origins in the South American rainforest. They have poison gland in their skin."
Their predators.
"In their native habitat, a number of fish and reptiles prey on the tadpoles and the adult toad."
"These include the broad-snouted caiman (""Caiman latirostris""), the banded cat-eyed snake (""Leptodeira annulata""), eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the black rat (""Rattus rattus"") and the Asian water monitor (""Varanus salvator"")."
"They have far fewer predators in Australia but, as time passes, some of the local animals will adapt their behaviour. Already some Australian crows have learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their back. Opossums of the ""Didelphis"" genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad."
In popular culture.
"A cane toad is one of the non-human characters in Dave Barry's 1999 novel ""Big Trouble"" and in the 2002 movie based on the novel."
Parotoid gland
"Supercells impacted Illinois with large hail and strong winds, and possible tornadoes. Hail up to 4-5"" in diameter fell and made damage as well as the winds. Tornadoes were als possible."
Iowa.
"A squall line of severe thunderstorms impacted the area also with large hail and strong winds. Hail up to 3-4"" in diameter fell there along with strong winds. Tornadoes were unlikely but possible."
Indiana.
"supercells and squall lines impacted Indiana with numerous reports of large hail and strong winds. An EF0 tornado dropped down in Indiana along with hail up to 2-3"" in diameter and damaging winds."
Ohio.
"An EF1 tornado in a supercell dropped down in Ohio and did some damage. In that severe thunderstorm with the tornado, strong winds were a problem along with hail up to 1-2"" in diameter."
Pennsylvania.
"An EF2 tornado in a supercell dropped down in south-central PA. The tornado did damage along with hail up to 1/2 to 1"" in diameter."
Tennessee.
"An EF3 tornado destroyed much of the area where the tornado dropped down. Along with the tornado there were strong winds and 1/4 to 1/2"" in diameter hail"
New Jersey.
Severe thunderstorms impacted the state. the severe thunderstorms produced 1/10 to 1/4 inch in diameter hail and strong winds. Tornadoes were unlikely but possible.
Maryland.
A possible tornado did some damage to an area where the tornado possibly dropped down. Otherwise hail and wind were a problem.
Snow and sleet.
"Snow fell acros much of New York State to even NYC and Northern New Jersey. New York City and Northern New Jersey just saw a few snowflakes and sleet flakes, while places north of NYC saw heavy sleet, and New York State saw a general 1-2"" of snow. Some places saw as much as 4-5"" of snow."

WWE Over the Limit
"Over the Limit was a professional wrestling event that was held yearly by WWE, and aired live only on pay-per-view (PPV). The first one was held in 2010, taking the place of Judgment Day in the May slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. The last event took place on May 20, 2012 at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was replaced by WWE Battleground in 2013."
"As is the case with most lower level PPV's made by WWE, the event was held only in arenas in the United States. Championship bouts were scheduled on every card, with the lower level title matches on the undercard and the top level featured on the main card. Under the Brand Extension, WWE assigns its performers to either Raw or SmackDown which cause matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show."
Osamu Tezuka
"Osamu Tezuka (, Tezuka Osamu, November 3, 1928 – February 9, 1989) was a famous Japanese cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer and Doctor of Medicine, although he never practiced medicine. He was born in Osaka Prefecture. He created ""Astro Boy"", ""Kimba the White Lion"" and ""Black Jack"". He is often credited as the ""Father of Anime"", and is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who was a major inspiration for Tezuka."
"Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well received manga series including the children mangas Astro Boy, Princess Knight and Kimba the White Lion, and the adult oriented series Black Jack, Phoenix, and Buddha, all of which won several awards."
"Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Phoenix, which were never released."

Tulle is twinned with:
English grammar
"English grammar is the grammar of the English language. Grammar is the rules about how to speak and write in a language. English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French."
Dialect grammar.
"Dialects of English vary not only in pronunciation but in grammar. For example, people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say, ""I didn't do anything"", while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English might say, ""I didn't do nothing"". London working class version: ""I ain't done nuffink!"" The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live."
"Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using ""proper English"", they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works. The models for ""spoken"" English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English."
Word endings.
"English makes few changes to its word endings. These are called ('suffixes'): plurals and possessives (""John's"") are the most common. English verbs drop most endings except one: I love, you love, they love, but ""she loves"". That final 's' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense: walked, walking."
Word order.
"Word order is the other big difference. In English, adjectives usually come before the noun. Most Romance languages normally put their adjectives after the nouns. For example, in English, a person may say ""I like fast cars"", but in Spanish, it is ""Me gustan los coches rápidos"" [coches = cars; rápidos = fast]. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In German, main verbs often come near the end of sentences, but in English we usually put them between subject and object, as: ""the cat sat on the mat""."
Parts of speech.
"Grammar studies the different parts of language. The parts of language are called ""parts of speech."" The parts of speech are nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections."
Nouns.
"A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. They can be a single thing such as an apple. They can also be plural such as a box of apples. There is a special kind of noun called a proper noun, which is a name. For instance, Johnny Appleseed."
Pronouns.
"Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns. We often use them to avoid repeating the nouns that they refer to. An example is the word ""it."" In the sentence ""I like the ball; it is blue,"" you have to look at what comes before ""it"" to know that ""it"" is talking about the ball. The noun before a pronoun that the pronoun really means is called the antecedent."
There are different types of pronouns in English language. The most important ones are:
Verbs.
"The basic verb form is called the infinitive. The infinitive for existence is ""to be"". A famous example is the speech of Hamlet: to be or not to be?"
Variations of the infinitive create verb tenses.
Adjectives.
"Words that tell you about nouns are called adjectives. When an adjective is used, you learn more about the noun. An example would be the words ""red"" and ""juicy"" in the phrase ""the red apple is juicy."" They do not have any endings. Even if the noun they talk about is plural, they stay the same. You can see this in the sentence ""the red apples are juicy."""
Trivia.
It has the oldest subway-line in Europe.
Twin cities of Budapest:
"Santa Monica, California"
"Santa Monica is a beach town in California. It is next to Los Angeles, California, US."
"It was made a city in 1886. In 2000, there were 88,050 people living there."
It is famous for the Santa Monica Pier that has many fun rides.
Kuwait
"Kuwait is a small Arab country (about 17,819 square kilometers) in the Middle East."
"Kuwait is the most socially progressive country in the Gulf region. It has a small and rich economy. It has about 96 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. Crude oil reserves are the oil that is still under the ground and has not yet been cleaned up. Kuwait has 10% of all of the oil reserves in the world. The country makes a lot of money by selling oil. This money is almost half of all the money the country makes. The oil money is also 95% of the money made by selling things to different countries (people call that exports). Also, the oil money is 80% of the money the government makes. Kuwait is now talking with oil companies of other countries to make oil fields in the northern part of the country."
"Kuwait's weather makes farming hard (too little rain). Instead of farming, the country catches fish and buys food from other countries. About 75% of the country's water to drink has to be distilled (have the salt removed) or purchased from other countries."
"In 1990, Iraq invaded (brought an army in to fight against) Kuwait. This started the first Gulf War. Kuwait's official religion is Islam, although 15% of its population are Christian or Hindu. Arabic is mostly spoken in Kuwait but English is widespread among Kuwaitis (residents of Kuwait). Kuwait is one of the few nations that has education for every age."
Another interesting fact about Kuwait is that a lot of people speak English.

Governorates.
"Kuwait is divided into 6 governorates. The governorates are divided into districts, And the establishment of the governorates of Kuwait dates back to the Emiri Decree No. 6 issued in 1962, which divided Kuwait into three governorates: the Capital Governorate, Hawalli Governorate and Al-Ahmadi Governorate. The decree clarified the work of the governor, his subordination of the governor to the Ministry of Interior, and his responsibility towards security, provided that the Ministry of Interior issues the necessary decisions to indicate the limits of the governor's jurisdiction. There have been some changes regarding the governorates of Kuwait, which we summarize as follows:"
". On November 14, 1979: Some provisions of the administrative division decree were amended so that a fourth governorate, Al-Jahra Governorate, was added."
". On October 12, 1988: The first article of the article was amended to divide Kuwait into five governorates by adding Al-Farwaniyah Governorate."
". On November 27, 1999: Emiri Decree No. 290 was issued to add a sixth governorate, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate."
"Thus, Kuwait has become administratively divided into six governorates, each affiliated with several regions. Warba Island and Bubiyan Island belong to the Jahra Governorate, while the rest of the islands belong to the Capital Governorate."
Tiny Tim
"Herbert Buckingham Khaury, better known as Tiny Tim (April 12, 1932–November 30, 1996), was an American singer and musician. He became popular in the late 1960s due to his appearances on television, and songs played on ukulele with a falsetto voice. His most famous song was ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"". His best-remembered television appearances were on ""Laugh-In"" and ""The Tonight Show"". His first wedding took place on ""The Tonight Show"" in 1969, at host Johnny Carson's suggestion."
Career.
"Not just a performer, he was also an expert , who studied American music from the earliest days of the United States, and performed many historic songs in his act. Over time, he used his falsetto voice less, and performed most songs in his natural, baritone voice."
"When his popularity as a """" lessened, he performed in small nightclubs and other places, as he had earlier. During the 1980s, he toured with a circus, and appeared in a movie as a circus performer who turned to crime. In the 1990s, he recorded new music (including a Christmas album), and joined comedian Pat Paulsen in his latest mock campaign to become President of the United States, as Paulsen's ."
"The coal swamps were world-wide because, for that long time, the continents were close together in Gondwana. Therefore they had similar wet, tropical climates."
History.
The Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the Permian (~300 milliom years ago). Their distribution across several continents led Eduard Suess to suggest the southern continents were once together in a single supercontinent – Gondwana.
These plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian (~250mya).
"The only convincing Triassic records are very earliest Triassic leaves from Nidpur, India. Even these records are somewhat questionable owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic strata at Nidpur."
"Some textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and, in some cases into the Jurassic. These are mistakes based on misidentification of similar leaves, such as those of ""Gontriglossa"", ""Sagenopteris"", or ""Mexiglossa""."
"Glossopterids were, thus, one of the major casualties of the end-Permian mass-extinction event."
Gnetophyta
"The Gnetophytes are a group of seed plants with three genera. Their evolutionary relationships are unclear, but it is now clear that they are related to each other."
The three genera are:
"By looking at the structure of these organisms (morphology) and the DNA (molecular taxonomy), scientists have found that ""Gnetum"" and ""Welwitschia"" are more closely related to each other than to ""Ephedra""."

Warren Zevon
"Warren William Zevon (January 24, 1947 – September 7, 2003) was an American rock singer-songwriter and musician known for including his strange and somewhat critical opinions of life in his lyrics. Zevon wrote many songs that were humorous and often political"
"Many famous musicians have said they liked Zevon's work, including Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. His most famous songs include ""Werewolves of London"", ""Lawyers, Guns and Money"", ""Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner"" and ""Johnny Strikes Up The Band."" All of these are from his third and most famous album: ""Excitable Boy"" (1978). Zevon has written many songs that were recorded by other artists. These include ""Poor Poor Pitiful Me"" (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), ""Accidentally Like a Martyr,"" ""Mohammed's Radio,"" ""Carmelita"", and ""Hasten Down the Wind""."
"Zevon sometimes recorded or sang cover songs. He liked to sing Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" and Leonard Cohen's ""First We Take Manhattan"". He was often a guest on ""Late Night with David Letterman"" and the ""Late Show with David Letterman"". Letterman later sang with Zevon on ""Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)"" with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra."
"He had a lot of problems in his life, including divorce, alcoholism, and suicide attempts. He also had a paranoia of doctors and this killed him: he did not know he had cancer until doctors could not help him."
Early life.
"Zevon was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were to William Zevon, a Secular Jew and Beverly Cope Simmons, a Mormon from Salt Lake City, Utah. They soon moved to Fresno, California. By the age of 13, Zevon sometimes visited Igor Stravinsky where he studied modern classical music. Zevon's parents divorced when he was 16 years old. After the divorce, he dropped out of high school and moved from Los Angeles to New York to become a folk singer."
Success.
"In 1978, Zevon released his most popular and critically acclaimed album ""Excitable Boy"". Radio stations often played the songs off the album, especially ""Werewolves of London."" ""Werewolves of London"" and ""Excitable Boy"" were both examples of black humor (jokes about bad things). The album also had the songs ""Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner"" and ""Lawyers, Guns and Money,"" which were both deadpan humor songs about geopolitics."
"""Rolling Stone"" named the album one of the most important albums in the 1970s. They said that he, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, and Bruce Springsteen were four of the best new artists to emerge in the 1970s."
Names.
"Most Polish counties are named after their capital city, or county seat."
"If a county seat has a double-barreled name, as with ""Maków Mazowiecki,"" the county may become either ""Maków County"" or ""Maków-Mazowiecki County."" Due, in all but the first case, to the existence, respectively, of two ""double-barreled"" county seats with the identical noun name, the corresponding adjectives """"bielski"","" """"grodziski"","" """"ostrowski"" and ""tomaszowski"""" each denote ""two"" distinct counties."
History and functioning.
"Some Polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the ""urban county"" (""powiat grodzki""), similar in local administration and self-governance to ""land counties."" An average county (the largest being the powiat of Białystok) comprises 5 – 8 communes. The largest urban county, in terms of population and area, is the city of Warsaw."
"The history of Polish counties goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic units of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's total dismemberment by its neighbors in 1795."
"In the 19th century, the county continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland""), and as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"" in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań."
"After Poland regained independence in 1918, the county again became the basic territorial unit throughout Poland. ""Powiat""s (counties) were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodships, but were reintroduced in 1999. There are now 314 ""land counties"" (""powiat ziemski"") and 65 ""urban counties"" (""powiat grodzki""), more formally ""municipalities with county status"" (""miasto na prawach powiatu"")."

2 Girls 1 Cup
"2 Girls 1 Cup is the title of the trailer for Hungry Bitches, a scat-pornographic viral video produced by MFX Media. The trailer features two women defecating into a cup, taking turns eating feces, and vomiting into each other's mouths. ""Lovers Theme"" from Hervé Roy's Romantic Themes album released by Tele Music in 1992 plays throughout the video."
"This one-minute video is a viral video that became a well-known Internet meme among bloggers and message boards for its viewers reaction to the content. Around mid-October 2007, video sites such as YouTube were flooded with videos that show others' reactions to watching the video for the first time."
Origin.
"The video came from a Brazilian, Marco Fiorito, who talks of himself as a ""compulsive fetishist"". Fiorito first produced foot fetish videos but soon moved on to coprophagia. The movie was made by MFX-Video, one of several businesses owned by Fiorito. Fiorito says his movies are legal in Brazil, but authorities in the United States have branded some of his movies as dirty and filed charges against Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer living in Florida, listed as an officer of a company shipping Fiorito's movies in the United States. Croce accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to 3 years of unsupervised probation and forfeiture of $98,000. Fiorito said he did not know his movies were illegal in the United States and that his movies often contained chocolate instead of feces to appease some of his actors who were willing to appear in scat movies but not actually eat fecal matter."
"The first few seconds of the 2 Girls 1 Cup video contain the text ""MFX 1209"" (the product code for ""Hungry Bitches"") and the URL mfxvideos.com. The website is Fiorito's MFX-Video. This causes some in the media to incorrectly believe the video is one of the many Croce had to surrender to the Department of Justice but was somehow leaked in the process."
Reactions.
"2 Girls 1 Cup's spread because of the reactions it causes. Hundreds of videos exist on YouTube of users showing the original video to their friends and recording their reactions. Even Joe Rogan, host of ""Fear Factor"", a show known for the nasty things its players eat, had to turn away in a reaction video posted to his blog. A reaction video starring Kermit the Frog proved very popular on the Digg. In January 2008, ""Slate"" magazine wrote about the reaction video with a slideshow about the reactions."
"Violet Blue, an author, stated this website as becoming ""the new 'tubgirl' and goatse all in one nasty moment of choco-poo-love"" in a ""San Francisco Chronicle"" article."

Nepali tea
"Tea plants grown in Nepal, are used to make tea. This tea is called Nepali tea. These plants look, smell, and taste a bit different from other tea plants. They are similar to the tea plants grown in Darjeeling, which are used to make Darjeeling tea. This may be because the eastern parts of Nepal are geographically similar to the Darjeeling region. Darjeeling produces a lot more tea than Nepal. For this reason, tea from Nepal is not as well-known."
There are two types of Nepali tea:
Orthodox tea.
"Like Darjeeling Tea, Orthodox Tea is made from the Chinese variety of tea plants. The tea is rolled by hand, or using a machine. Most speciality teas like green tea, oolong tea, white tea, and hand rolled tea fall under the category of orthodox tea. In Nepal, Orthodox Tea is produced and processed in the mountain regions, at altitudes between and . There are six major districts, primarily in the eastern regions of Nepal that are known for producing quality orthodox tea. They are Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta, Terhathum, Sindhulpalchok and Kaski."

"In these places, it is also illegal to treat a person with a service animal differently than any other person. The person with a service animal cannot be charged extra money, refused service, or kept apart from other people. A service animal can be asked to leave one of these places only if it is out of control (for example, if it is aggressive or urinates inside). The animal has to be on a leash, or controlled by its owner's voice or signals, all the time."
"No one can ask for proof that the animal is a service animal. Owners do not have to carry any special papers or prove that their service animal can do a special task. If an owner and a service animal enter one of these places, workers are only allowed to ask two questions to make sure the animal is a service animal and not a pet:"
It is legal to train your own service animal in the United States.
"Service animals do not get these same protections in most religious organizations. Most religious organizations are exempt from the ADA's requirements, which means they do not have to obey the ADA."
Other laws.
"Other laws have less strict definitions of which animals count as service animals. For example, the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act allows ""dogs and other service animals"" to ride with passengers on commercial airlines."
The Fair Housing Act also requires housing providers to allow service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals). This law does not say that only certain animals are allowed.
Laws in other countries.
Mexico &amp; South America.
"In most places in South America and Mexico, the place's owner or manager gets to decide whether to let a service animal in. There are no laws that protect service animals or their owners. In areas with many tourists, service dogs are generally welcomed without problems."
"In Brazil, however, the President created a new law about service dogs in 2006. The law says that all service dogs in Brazil must be allowed to go anywhere that the public could go. The ""Brasília Metro"" (the Brazilian public transportation system) has developed a program which trains guide dogs to ride it."
Europe.
"Different European countries have different laws about service animals. Some countries have laws that govern the entire country, and sometimes different parts of the country govern themselves."
Australia.
"In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 legally protects all assistance dog handlers."
"However, with current laws, owners may not always be allowed to have their service animals with them in all situations. Each state and territory has its own laws, which mainly have to do with guide dogs. Queensland has introduced the Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009, which protects all certified assistance dogs."
Canada.
"In Canada, any service animal is allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed, as long as the owner is in control of the animal. In Alberta, there is a fine of up to $3000 for someone who refuses to let a service dog into a place where everyone else could go."
South Korea.
"In South Korea, the law says service dogs must be let into any areas that are open to the public. People who break this law can be fined for up to 2 million ""won"" (about $1691 in United States dollars)."

Adaptions (new versions of the story).
There have been different versions of the story:
Nirvana
"In Buddhism, Nirvana is the state of perfect peace free from reincarnation reached by not wanting more than you have. It means happiness and peace. It is every Buddhist's goal to achieve Nirvana. The Buddha described it as:"
"“the far shore, the subtle, the very difficult to see, the unaging, the stable, the undisintegrating, the unmanifest, the unproliferated, the peaceful, the deathless, the sublime, the auspicious, the secure, the destruction of craving, the wonderful, the amazing, the unailing, the unailing state, the unafflicted, dispassion, purity, freedom, the unadhesive, the island, the shelter, the asylum, the refuge...” (SN 43:14)"

British Virgin Islands
"The British Virgin Islands is a British Overseas Territory and are part of the Virgin Islands, a chain of islands in the Caribbean. The islands comprise of the eastern half of the island chain. The British Virgin Islands has sixteen inhabited islands and more than twenty uninhabited islands. Over 22,000 people live there, which is fewer than the neighbouring United States Virgin Islands."
"The capital city, Road Town, is on Tortola, one of the islands in the group. Most of the people live on Tortola, but the other main inhabited islands include Anegada, Virgin Gorda and Jost Van Dyke."
History.
"The islands were originally lived in by Caribbean Indians called Arawaks. By the time the first European explorers discovered the British Virgin Islands all of the Arawaks had left. The first Europeans to try and settle in the British Virgin Islands were the Dutch, but the English came soon after and the English and the Dutch settlers used to fight. The Spanish also claimed the islands, but no Spanish people ever tried to settle there. But the Spanish did attack the British and Dutch settlers."
In 1672 the British took control of the islands during a war against the Dutch and they have held on to them ever since.
"During the early years after European settlement the British Virgin Islands was a plantation economy which relied heavily upon slave labour. After slavery was abolished in the British Virgin Islands there was a long period of decline and many people left. Those who remained were mostly descended from African slaves, although many of them also left to try and find better lives elsewhere."
"In the 1950s the British Virgin Islands got its own government, and the economy of the islands began to get better with the introduction of tourism and financial services."
Government.
"The British Virgin Islands are mostly self-governing, but some parts of the government is run by the United Kingdom."
"A new constitution was introduced in 2007. It grants more control over everyday life to the Islanders, and lists the protection a person can expect from the government. The head of Government in the British Virgin Islands is called the Premier, and he is in charge of a group of ministers of government which is called the Cabinet. Laws are passed by a group of elected politicians in the House of Assembly. Most of the international relations are still dealt with by the British Government in London on behalf of the people of the British Virgin Islands."
Economy.
Most people in the British Virgin Islands work in the tourist trade or in financial services. There are also a small number of farmers and fishermen.
Lamp
"A lamp is a device that makes light and heat. Lamps usually work with electricity, using a lightbulb. In the United States, a lamp is usually considered a desk lamp or floor lamp. Other sources of light are called 'lights', such as streetlights, flashlights, and headlights, which in some countries are called streetlamps, torches and headlamps."

Gaur
"The Gaur is a bovine species, similar to the bison. Bos gaurus (or Indian bison) is the largest living bovine. It is native to South Asia and Southeast Asia."
"The height up to the shoulder of the male is 175 to 195 cm. When the female is 165 to 185 cm. Has the same height. Length from head to body is 240 to 300 cm. And length 70 to 105 cm. Have. The flowering of horns, which are relatively short cylindrical and have a small roundness on the inside, is about 85 to 100 cm. Mating at any time of the year. New chicks are found especially during the months of November to March. Its gestation period is about 270 days."
The pregnant female is separated from her group. Gives birth to a baby and keeps the baby moving around. The female takes constant care of him. Babies start walking a few minutes after birth. The female and cub reunite after being separated from their group for a few days.
"The species is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1986. Population trends are stable in well-protected areas, and are building up in a few areas which had been neglected."
The gaur is the tallest species of wild cattle.
"The Malayan gaur is called ""seladang"", and the Burmese gaur is called ""pyoung""."
"The domesticated form of the gaur ""Bos frontalis"" is called 'gayal' or 'mithun'."
Seed fern
The term seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) are several groups of extinct seed plants (spermatophytes).
The oldest fossil evidence of plants of this type is from Upper Devonian strata. They flourished during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.
Pteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous. Some fossil pteridosperm-like plants seem to have survived into Eocene times in Tasmania.
History of the term.
The concept of the pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century. Palaeobotanists saw that many Carboniferous fossils which looked like ferns had anatomical features like cycads.
"British palaeobotanists made the discovery that some of these fronds were associated with seeds, and concluded that the fronds and seeds belonged to the same plants."
"Initially it was still thought that they were intermediate between the ferns and cycads. In the English-speaking world they were referred to as ""seed ferns"" or ""pteridosperms"". Today, most palaeobotanists regard them as being only distantly related to ferns and that these names are misleading. The names have nevertheless stuck."
"Later during the 20th century, the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds. Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as ""Glossopteris"" and its relatives, which was clearly stretching the concept."
"The seed ferns were by far the earliest seed plants, and must have included the ancestors of the later plants. They are spread across a number of clades, so many palaeobotanists today regard pteridosperms as little more than a paraphyletic 'grade-group'."
"Does the concept of pteridosperms have any value today? Many palaeobotanists still use the term in an informal sense for the seed plants that are not angiosperms, coniferoids (conifers or cordaites), ginkgophytes or cycadophytes (cycads or bennettites)."
"This is useful for extinct seed plant groups, whose relationships are unknown. We can call them"" pteridosperms"" with no suggestion of their being a clade. Also, for curators or collectors, the term 'pteridosperm' is a useful shorthand for describing fern-like fronds probably produced by seed plants, which are often found in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras."
John Riggins
"Robert John Riggins (born August 4, 1949 in Seneca, Kansas) is a retired American football running back who used to play for the New York Jets and Washington Redskins of the NFL. He was nicknamed ""The Diesel"". He won Super Bowl XVII with the Washington Redskins where he was also the MVP and is a member of the Redskins Ring of Fame.

Transsexual
Transsexual people are people who change their appearance to more closely resemble that of the opposite sex. Transsexuals may be male or female. They typically take hormones and often undergo surgeries to support this process. They usually adopt a new name and may legally have their name changed.
People who go from male to female (MTF) are referred to as transsexual women. People who go from female to male (FTM) are referred to as transsexual men.
Ways to go from male to female.
"Transsexual women take female hormones. They may also take drugs that stop male hormones called androgens. Taking estrogen pills makes breasts grow. It does not make beards go away. It does not make voices higher. Transgender women may remove their facial hair so it does not grow back. This takes a long time and hurts. Some transsexual women with low voices have surgery to raise their voices. Other transsexual women try to make their voice sound higher and more female without surgery. Some transsexual women also get surgery on their genitals. This is called a vaginoplasty. This is done by making a vagina from the skin of their penis, which is turned inside out. Some transsexual women also have surgery to make their faces look more feminine. Some also have surgery to make their breasts larger."
Ways to go from female to male.
Transsexual men take male hormones. This will make their voices lower. It will make a beard grow. It can also stop their menstruation. Some transsexual men look like any other man after hormones.
"Some transsexual men have surgery. One surgery is removal of breasts (mastectomy). Some transsexual men also get surgery on their genitals. One surgery is removal of the uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy). Some may also get surgery on their outside genitals. One way takes their skin and tissue and makes it into a penis (phalloplasty). Another way takes the clitoris (which grows bigger with hormones) and puts it where the penis usually is (metoidioplasty). The place where urine comes out (urethra) can be run through the new penis. The phalloplasty looks more like a penis. A metoidioplasty has more sexual function, but it is 5 or 6 centimeters long. Some ways also make a scrotum from the labia. They may also have the vagina taken out or closed."
Detransitioning.
"Very rarely, some people (called ""detransitioners"") who have changed sex decide this was a mistake and return to living as members of the sex in which they were born."
Some of the effects of surgery and hormones can be reversed but others are permanent.

It comes with a special sauce called ""jus"" which is usually made with the juice and fat that came off the roast beef when they were cooking it. It was not originally from France; two restaurants in Los Angeles, California, ""Cole's"" and ""Philippe's"", both claim to have invented it."

"""Funeral Oration"" was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his ""History of the Peloponnesian War"". Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his ""History"" that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said. It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech."
"The Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as ""a eulogy (description) of Athens itself..."". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people."
Gettysburg Address and Pericles' funeral oration.
American Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles' Funeral Oration.
Gorgoneion
"In Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion () was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon's head. (The use of magic against evil, or bad luck is generally called Apotropaism)."
"The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena; both are said to have worn it as a pendant. It was also popular as a royal symbol, worn on shields and capes. These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo."
Evolution.
"Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions, but only about the head, as if the creature had no body. Jane Ellen Harrison notes that ""Medusa is a head and nothing more...a mask."" The body was added many years later. Up to the 5th century BC, the head was shown as being very ugly, with her tongue sticking out, boar tusks, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her."
"The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. In some cases a beard, (probably representing streaks of blood) was added to her chin, making her appear as a wild and sexual god, like Dionysus."
"Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly, strange or frightening. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman."
Usage.
"Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC. One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaeological dig at Parium. Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns. There is a similar image from the Knossos palace, dating from the 15th century BC. Marija Gimbutas even argues that ""the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates""."
"In the 6th century BC, gorgoneia of a basic type of ""lion mask"" were found all over Greek temples, especially in and around Corinth. Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse. Around 500 BC, they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings, but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles (antefix) of smaller buildings throughout the next century."
"As well as temples, the Gorgon image can be found on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast. The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities, making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods. On mosaic floors, the gorgoneion was usually near the door, as if guarding it. On Attic kilns, a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents."
"The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the Byzantine Empire, including Kievan Rus (now the Ukraine). The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists. In the 20th century, the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company."
Origin.
"Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of the Mother Goddess cult linked to ""dynamic life energy"". She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image. Jane Ellen Harrison, on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks. These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at him."

Ferret
"Ferrets (""Mustela putorius furo"") are domestic animals. They are the domestic form of the European polecat. They are in the weasel genus of the family Mustelidae."
"Ferrets have an average length of 20 inches (51 cm) including a 5-inch (13 cm) tail, weigh about . They live for about 7–10 years. Males are larger than females. They are sociable animals, and are usually kept in groups of two or more."
"With their long thin body, ferrets look like a large weasel. They may have different colours and markings on their fur. A lot of ferrets in one place will sometimes have a strange smell. This is caused by natural oils produced by the ferrets."
Behavior.
"As naturally crepuscular animals, ferrets tend to sleep during the day. This deters many people from getting them although most ferret owners say their ferrets change their sleeping schedules to that of their owners."
Ferrets and humans.
"Domesticated ferrets are used for hunting, or can be kept as pets. Hunting with ferrets is called ferreting. Because of their thin body, they can go down into holes and hunt rodents and rabbits. Ferrets have been kept as pets since the Middle Ages."
Health.
"Ferrets suffer from several health problems. Some of the most common health problems are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas, and lymphatic system. Viral diseases include canine distemper and influenza. Health problems can happen in unspayed females when not being used for breeding. Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as Waardenburg syndrome. Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems"
Ferrets as pets.
Ferrets are legal to have as a pet in most places. They are not legal in a few places in the United States. Ferrets should be vaccinated. A breeder or pet store will get it spayed or neutered and also de-scented. Ferrets can spray the natural oils from their anal glands similar to that of a skunk if not de-scented.
Ferrets are very flexible and can fit into small holes to flush out rabbits or rodents. Ferrets can get through open vents or small holes in walls. Ferrets are good climbers so if curtains are touching the floor they can easily climb the curtains.
"Ferrets should be kept in a group, unless you can provide them with multiple hours of activity, they get quite bored when alone. Ferrets tend to sleep curled up together in a ball usually making them indistinguishable from one another."
Diet.
Ferrets are carnivores and cannot tolerate grains or vegetable matter well. Their diet should consist of around 20% fat and 80% meat. Ferrets need a high calorie diet: commercial dog and cat foods do not contain enough fats and protein to suit them. Feeding them such a diet while convenient will ultimately shorten the ferrets life.
"Ferrets are subject to insulinoma and as such they should not be given fruits except on rare occasions as a treat. Raisins are a favorite of most ferret but should be given extremely sparingly. Fresh chicken, turkey or even duck is a good choice for your ferret. Commercial ferret foods are available but many contain grains and also fruits and as such are not suitable for them. Research brand ingredients or find a recipe to make your own."

Chess and computers
"Chess and computers have been connected since the earliest days of the computer. In the 19th century Charles Babbage had thought of the idea,p87 and in modern times Alan Turing, the mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker, put some thought into the idea. He was not a very good chess player, but was one of the creators of the first British computer. He is also credited with the creation of Computer science."
"There are two types of chess programs. One plays against a human opponent; the other helps the user become a better player. The two types can be made to work together, though they have different functions and work in different ways."
Chess engines.
"Chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents. Many have been created; they can play at master level, though their processes are quite different from those of a human being.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;p87 The best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both Kasparov and Kramnik, but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner."
"Competitions are run by putting engines against each other, and the results are published. There is a World Computer Chess Championship, in which the details of the rules may determine which software wins. Software may also be rated on other scales, such as ease of usage."
Fritz.

History.
"""Super Mario 64"" sequel."
"The name ""Super Mario 128"" was first used as early as January 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto, as a possible name for a ""Super Mario 64"" sequel. This rumored expansion and sequel to ""Super Mario 64"" called ""Super Mario 64-2"" was said to be developed for the 64DD, but ended up being cancelled due to the 64DD's commercial failure. Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at E3's 1997 convention that he was ""just getting started"" on the project."
"In November 1999, Shigeru Miyamoto said, ""Well, for over a year now at my desk, a prototype program of Mario and Luigi has been running on my monitor. We've been thinking about the game, and it may be something that could work on a completely new game system."" The game had only a demo of one level made for it. Miyamoto claimed that multiplayer functionality was the first aspect of the game that he wanted to include."
Autonomic dysreflexia
"Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), also called autonomic hyperreflexia, is a medical emergency."
Who Gets Autonomic Dysreflexia?
"AD usually happens in people with spinal cord injuries that have caused damage above the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6, which is about at the same level of the armpits). However, AD sometimes happens in people with spinal damage as low as their tenth thoracic vertebra (T10, which is about a few inches above the level of the belly button)."
AD can also happen in people with diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS).
Symptoms.
Acute AD causes many symptoms. Some are very dangerous. These symptoms include:
What Causes Autonomic Dysreflexia?
Acute AD happens when the involuntary nervous system gets overexcited. The body's fight or flight response kicks in very strongly.
"Scientists think this happens because of afferent nerves. Afferent nerves are supposed to sense things (like touch) and send messages back to the brain and spinal cord so the brain can decide how to react. Scientists think that afferent nerves below the spinal cord injury cause blood pressure to get and stay high, by causing the blood vessels to get smaller. This is part of the fight or flight response."

T. T. V. Dhinakaran
T. T. V. Dhinakaran (born 13 December 1963) is an Indian politician and General Secretary Of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazagam.In the past he was the Treasurer of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party and served as the Member of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. He was expelled from the AIADMK on August 2017.He Also Served As Former Member of the 15th Tamil Nadu Assembly from Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar (2017-2021). He won the highly anticipated RK Nagar by-election in December 2017.
J. Jayalalithaa
"Jayaram Jayalalithaa (24 February 1948 – 5 December 2016) was an Indian actor who became a politician. She served five terms as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, for over fourteen years between 1991 and 2016. From 1989 she was the general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam , a Dravidian party. She was praised and called by the party members as ""Amma""(meaning: mother), ""Thanga Tharagai"" (meaning: Golden Maiden) and ""Puratchi Thalaivi"" (the woman revolutionary leader)."
Life.
"Jayalalithaa first became famous as a leading movie actor in the mid-1960s. She appeared in 140 films between 1961 and 1980 in the Tamil, Telugu and Kannada languages. She also earned the name of ""Queen of Tamil Cinema."""
"In 1991 Jayalalithaa became Tamil Nadu's youngest chief minister. Despite a monthly salary of Rs.1, she made a grand marriage for her foster son Sudhakaran, lavishly spending. In the 1996 election, the AIADMK was nearly wiped out . Jayalalithaa herself lost her seat. The new DMK government filed several corruption cases against her, and she spend time in jail. Her fortunes revived in the 1998 general election, as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam became a key component of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee government that her withdrawal of support thrown the BJP government without majority and further triggered to another general election just in a year in 1999.The AIADMK returned to power in 2001, although Jayalalithaa was personally disbarred from contesting due to the corruption cases. Within a few months of her taking oath as chief minister, in September 2001, she was disqualified from holding office and forced to cede the chair to minister O. Panneerselvam. Upon her acquittal six months later, Jayalalithaa returned as chief minister to complete her term. Noted for its ruthlessness to political opponents, many of whom were arrested in midnight raids, her government grew unpopular. Another period (2006–11) in the opposition followed, before Jayalalithaa was sworn in as chief minister for the fourth time after the AIADMK swept the 2011 assembly election. Her government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda, which included several subsidised -branded goods such as canteens, bottled water, salt and cement. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a disproportionate-assets case, rendering her disqualified to hold office. She returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In the 2016 assembly election, she became the first Tamil Nadu chief minister since M.G.R in 1984 to be voted back into office. That September, she fell severely ill and, following 75 days of hospitalisation, died on 5 December 2016 due to cardiac arrest and became the first female chief minister in India to die in office."
"Jayalalithaa never married and had no children. On 29 May 2020, her nephew J. Deepak and niece Deepa Jayakumar were declared as her legal heirs by Madras High Court."
Death.
"She died in 5 December 2016 due to cardiac arrest according to the reports of the Apollo Hospitals. However, there remain questions about her death."
Gianni Cavina
"Gianni Cavina (9 December 1940 – 26 March 2022) was an Italian actor. He appeared in more than 45 movies since 1949. His best known roles were in ""The House with Laughing Windows"", ""House of Pleasure for Women"" and ""Christmas Present""."
"Cavina died in Bologna, Italy on 26 March 2022, at the age of 81."

"Kaneaster Hodges Jr. (August 20, 1938 – March 23, 2022) was an American Democratic politician and lawyer. He was the United States Senator from Arkansas between 1977 to 1979."
"Hodges Jr. died from an aortic aneurysm on March 23, 2022 in Newport, Arkansas at the age of 83."
"Theism is the religious belief that at least one god exists while rejecting the existence or importance of polytheistic gods or goddesses. In a broader definition it can also be the belief in God or gods in general, including all types of god-belief. Polytheism is the belief in several gods, while monotheism is the belief in just one god. For example, a theistic religion is Christianity. The opposite to a theist is an atheist. An atheist is a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings."
Different theisms.
All of these are rough definitions of the theisms; they are almost always different. We can split them all into different groups:
"Gnosticism and agnosticism can be combined with other forms of theism. For example, it is possible to be an agnostic atheist, or a gnostic theist. In common usage, some people group atheism and agnosticism together under the group of nontheism — absence of clear belief in any deity."
The main types of theism are:
"This is another way to group different theisms, based on the nature of the gods."
There are also these types:
Plesiosaur
"The plesiosaurs were an order of large, carnivorous marine reptiles. They flourished from 245 million years ago (mya) to 65 mya."
"In 1719, William Stukeley described the first partial skeleton of a plesiosaur. The great-grandfather of Charles Darwin, Robert Darwin of Elston told him about it."
"Mary Anning was the first to discover a fairly complete plesiosaur. She found it on the 'Jurassic Coast' of Dorset, England in the winter of 1820/21. The fossil was missing its skull, but in 1823 she found another one, this time complete with its skull. The name ""Plesiosaurus"" was given to it by the Rev. William Conybeare."
"The earliest plesiosaur remains are from the Middle Triassic period,p128 and the group was important through the Jurassic and Cretaceous. They had two large pairs of paddles, short tails, short or long necks, and broad bodies. They died out at the K/T extinction event, 65 million years ago."
Description.
"Plesiosaurs had many bones in their flippers, making them flexible. No modern animal has this four-paddle anatomy: modern turtles use their forelimbs for swimming. They were mainly piscivorous (fish-eaters)."
Pliosaurs.
"The pliosaurs were a group of mostly large submarine predators with short necks and large heads. Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres, and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles. Their streamlined body shape suggests they swam and ate under water."
Long-necked plesiosaurs.
"There were three families of long-necked plesiosaurs, who evidently had a different life-style from the pliosaurs. It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that their method was as surface swimmers, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton. It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water; aquatic mammals operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo-shape, as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs. All the longer-necked familiers were, from the setting of the teeth and jaws, eaters of small fish. However, some at least were bottom-feeders, consuming various prey. Digestion of shellfish was aided by gastroliths."
Gastroliths.
"Plesiosaurs have been found with fossils of belemnites (squid-like animals), and ammonites (giant nautilus-like molluscs) associated with their stomachs. But plesiosaurs could not crack shells. Instead, they probably swallowed them whole. In the belly of a plesiosaur were ""stomach stones"", which are called ""gastroliths."" These stones moved around in the plesiosaur's stomach and cracked or crushed the shells of the animals it ate. One plesiosaur fossil found in South Dakota had 253 gatroliths weighing a total of 29 pounds."
Live birth?
"Live birth has been proved for ichthyosaurs, but is uncertain for plesiosaurs."
"Midland, Texas"
"Midland is a city in the American state of Texas. It is called Midland, because it is the midway point between two bigger cities in Texas, Fort Worth and El Paso. Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy."
"Midland is also famous as the hometown of former First Lady Barbara Walker Bush. She and her husband, former president George H. W. Bush lived there, with their children including the later US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida."
Sardinia
"Sardinia (, Sardinian: ""Sardigna"") is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is an autonomous region of Italy. It was formerly the Kingdom of Sardinia."
"The official name is, in Italian, Regione Autonoma della Sardegna.The capital and largest city is Cagliari."
Geography.
"William K. Everson judges, the film suffered ""under the extrovert and plenty of covered play by Alexander Granach [...] and virtually all other members of the cast out fear."" Also, Lotte H. Eisner criticized the cumbersome play, the actors performances were ""not significant"", which they impute to the fact that Murnau not experienced at this time in the lead actor had been enough."
In other media.
"Aaron Copland's 1922 ballet ""Grohg"" (unpublished and unpremiered until 1992) used ""Nosferatu"" as the physical model for the lead character and roughly follows the storyline."
"Hugh Cornwell of the Stranglers and Robert Williams recorded an album ""Nosferatu"" as a ""soundtrack"" to the film, dedicated to the memory of Max Schreck; it was released in 1979. The front cover was a still picture from the film."
"Werner Herzog's 1979 homage to Nosferatu, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" starred Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula, not Orlok. A sequel to Herzog's film called ""Vampire in Venice"" starred Kinski, this time as Nosferatu, and Christopher Plummer as Paris Catalano."
"The 1979 television movie ""Salem's Lot"" modeled the appearance of Mr. Barlow on that of Count Orlok. In 1998, Wayne Keeley released """", in which the original film was remastered to a soundtrack by Type O Negative and hosted by David Carradine."
"The 2000 Hollywood movie ""Shadow of the Vampire"" told a secret history of the making of ""Nosferatu"", imagining that actor Max Schreck (played by Willem Dafoe) was actually a genuine vampire and that director F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich) was complicit in hiring the creature for the purpose of realism."
"Similarly, the short film 'La duodécima hora' by Rodrigo Plaza and film critic Juanma Ruiz, suggested a hidden plot orchestrated by Nosferatu director and producer, F. W. Murnau and Albin Grau, to hide an elixir of the eternal life. Shot as a mockumentary, the film starred horror icon Paul Naschy and Nosferatu film restorer Luciano Berriatúa."
"Viper Comics's 2010 graphic novel ""Nosferatu"" by Christopher Howard Wolf retold the original 1922 film's storyline with a modern setting and cast."
"The Cartoon Network Adult Swim series Mary Shelley's Frankenhole, a parody of classic horror movies and characters, features Nosferatu as a recurring character."
King Diamond (band)
King Diamond are a Danish heavy metal band. It was formed by King Diamond after the split up of his band Mercyful Fate.
Lego Duplo
"Lego Duplo (also called Lego Preschool, Explore or simply just DUPLO) is another type of Lego toys. The difference is that they are bigger than regular Lego and that they are meant for ages 1½-6, because they are easier to handle than regular Lego. Lego Duplo were launched in 1969."
Obi-Wan Kenobi
"Obi-Wan Kenobi, also known as Ben Kenobi, is a fictional character in the ""Star Wars"" universe. He is one of several primary characters and one of the protagonist in the ""Star Wars"" series. He is a Jedi Master."
"With Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, R2-D2, and C-3PO, he is one of the few major characters to appear in all of the six ""Star Wars"" movies. He is portrayed in the original trilogy by Alec Guinness and in the prequel trilogy by Ewan McGregor and voiced by James Arnold Taylor in ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" series and ""Star Wars Rebels"" series."
Eric Singer
"Eric Doyle Mensinger (born May 12, 1958 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA), better known as Eric Singer, is a hard rock and heavy metal drummer for the rock band Kiss and formerly for singer Alice Cooper. In December 1991, Eric Singer officially became the drummer for Kiss after the death of Eric Carr."
Martin Erat
"Martin Erat (born August 28, 1981 in Třebíč, Czechoslovakia) is a former Czech ice hockey right winger that played for the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played for the Nashville Predators and the Washington Capitals. Martin also has an older brother named Roman who plays in the Czech Extraliga."
Career.
"Before playing in the NHL, Erat played 3 seasons in the WHL 2 for the Saskatoon Blades and 1 for the Red Deer Rebels. Erat has also played 10 seasons with the Nashville Predators and 9 games with the Washington Capitals."
"On March 4th, 2014, the Capitals traded Erat along with prospect John Mitchell to the Phoenix Coyotes for a 2015 4th round draft pick, Rostislav Klesla and Chris Brown."
Portal 2
"Portal 2 is a first-person shooter puzzle video game made by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to the video game ""Portal"". The gameplay is similar to the first game, but it adds new stories, puzzles, and characters. Unlike the first game, it also has a co-op campaign, where two players play as robots built by GLaDOS to solve puzzles that could never be solved by humans."
Twyla Tharp
Twyla Tharp (born July 1 1941) is an American dancer and choreographer. She lives and works in New York City.
"Her work often uses classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music. In 1973, Tharp choreographed the ballet ""Deuce Coupe"" to the music of The Beach Boys. It is considered to be the first crossover ballet. Later she choreographed ""Push Comes to Shove"". That ballet featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of the crossover ballet."
"Tharp has choreographed dances for many important ballet companies around the world. She also has had success on Broadway. In 1985, her staging of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" played at the Gershwin for 367 performances. Her dance musical ""Movin' Out"" ran for 1,331 performances on Broadway. The musical is set to the music and lyrics of Billy Joel. It received 10 Tony Award nominations and Tharp was named Best Choreographer."
Honors and awards.
"Twyla Tharp received two Emmy Awards, 19 honorary doctorates, the Vietnam Veterans of America President’s Award, the 2004 National Medal of the Arts."
Tharp was inducted into the Academy of Achievement in 1993.
She was named a Kennedy Center Honoree for 2008.
Chytridiomycosis
"Chytridiomycosis is a disease that can kill amphibians, for example frogs. A fungus causes it. THe chytrid fungus ""Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis"" causes the disease. The animals can catch it from each other. Chytridiomycosis one reason why there are fewer amphibians on Earth than there were. The fungus has decreased the amphibian population by 30% worldwide. Many spcies are now extict because they died of chitridiomycosis. In some species, only a few animals die, but in other species, they all die. This is called 100% mortality. There is no cure."
Temnospondyl
Temnospondyls are an order of small to giant batrachomorph tetrapods. They lived worldwide from the Carboniferous to the Triassic. A few species continued into the Lower Cretaceous.
"The Temnospondyls are similar or identical to the Labyrinthodonts minus the Lepospondyls. It is probably an evolutionary grade, not monophyletic. It is convenient to use, because all these early amphibia were so different from present-day amphibia.p169 Many in the early Permian looked more like reptiles because they were adapted to life in a drier climate. Nevertheless, they were amphibians, and many larval stages have been found."
"They are a large group of some 40 families and 160 genera.p322 Fossils have been found on every continent. Their evolutionary history spans 210 million years. During this time, they adapted to a wide range of habitats including fresh water, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments."
"Fossils are known from the larval stage, metamorphosis, and maturity.p184 Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales, claws, and armour-like bony plates which modern amphibians do not have."
The youngest known temnospondyl is the Australian Koolasuchus that lived about 120 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous.
Lepospondyl
The Lepospondyli are a large group of batrachomorph tetrapods from the Palaeozoic era. They are sometimes included in the Labyrinthodonts.
"They lived during the Carboniferous to the early Permian. There are six different groups. The Acherontiscidae, Adelospondyli, Aïstopoda, Lysorophia, Microsauria and Nectridea. The included species which looked somewhat like newts, eels, snakes and lizards. Some of them were aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial animals. None of them were big animals."
Peltobatrachus
"Peltobatrachus (from Greek pelte, meaning shield and batrakhos, meaning frog) is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibians from the late Permian period of Tanzania. They were large and slow-moving animals. They reached 70 centimeters (2.3 ft) in length. They were terrestrial amphibians. They only went back to the water to lay their eggs. They eat insects, worms and snails."
Terrestrial animal
"A terrestrial animal is an animal that lives on land such as dog, cat, an ant or an emu. It can also be used for some species of amphibians that only go back to the water to lay their eggs. It is usually a term to describe the difference between animals that live in water, (such as lobsters and fish), from animals that live on land."
Sister group
A sister group or sister taxon is a term used to describe the closest relatives of an organism (or other taxon) in a phylogenetic tree. It is a term in cladistics.
"The sister group of organism A is B. The sister group of the clade B+A, is C."
"Argon is gotten industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year."
"40Ar is made by the decay of 40K with a half-life of 1.25 billion years by electron capture or positron emission. Because of this, it is used in knowing how old rocks are."
Uses.
"Argon is often used when welding steel and similar work, to push away the air around the weld, so the oxygen in the air can't join with the metal being welded. It can also be used in neon lights for a purple color. Argon is used in the poultry industry to asphyxiate birds. Argon is sometimes used for extinguishing (ending) fires."
"Liquid argon is used in neutrino experiments and looking for dark matter. Argon is used to preserve food. Argon is sometimes used as the propellant in aerosol cans. Argon is also used as a preservative for such products as varnish, polyurethane, and paint. Argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent and has been banned as use. It is used to know how old rocks are."
Trade
"To trade is to willingly give things or services and get other things or services in return. For example, a person giving a thing must find another person who wants to get that thing. The giver gets something back in return. A trade is sometimes also called an ""exchange"" or a ""swap""."
An early type of trade is barter. Barter was the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without using of money. Modern traders commonly buy and sell by the use of money. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade. Trade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade.
Terms.
The things that are given from one person to the other are called goods.
"Services can also be part of a trade. One person can do a job or work for another, and get something in return in a trade."
"Money can be given in return for a service or for a thing. If money is part of the trade, then the person who gives the money is buying, and the person who gets the money is selling."
A place where trading takes place is called a market.
"When there is no money involved in the trade, the trade is called barter. If there is money involved in the trade, the trade is called a purchase. In the past people would barter to get what they wanted, instead of buying goods and services."
Economics includes the study of trade.
"Trade occurs not just between people, but also between large companies and even countries. Governments sometimes take some of the money or goods involved trade between countries. This is a type of tax called a tariff. Smugglers try to trade without paying tariffs."
"Free trade between two countries is when there are small or no tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on trade. When one country stops all trade with another country, it is called an embargo."
Types of trade.
Domestic trade.
Domestic trade is the exchange of goods within a country. Domestic trade is very important because it allows different types of goods to reach to all parts of the country. It makes the standard of living of the people of the country better. It helps an industry to grow by making sure that there are raw materials. Domestic trade may be divided into two. They are:
Wholesale.
"Wholesaling is the sale of goods to industrial, commercial, institutional or other professional businesses. They can also be sold to other wholesalers. It is the sale of goods to anyone that is not a consumer. Wholesalers usually buy and sort goods in large numbers."
Retail.
"Retail is the process of selling goods or services to consumers through many means of distribution to earn a profit. The term ""retailer"" usually means where a person sells a small amount of good to many individuals, who are consumers."
International trade.
"International trade is the exchange of goods and services between different countries. International trade has existed throughout history. Some examples include Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, scramble for Africa, Atlantic slave trade, and salt roads. When there is trade between two or more countries, factors like currency, government policies, economy, judicial system, laws, and markets affect trade."
International trade may be split up into three different types.
Import.
An import is a good or service that was bought in one country but was produced in another country.
Export.
An export is a good or service that was produced in one country but was sold to another country.
A wooden spoon is a spoon made from wood. Wooden spoons are used for mixing food. Wooden spoon is also a term for last place in a sporting contest.
Table tennis
"Table tennis, also known as Ping Pong (a trademarked name), is one of the most popular sports in the world, with players in many countries. It is played by two or four people on a table. To play this game, people use bats and small celluloid balls. You need also a net and a table. Table tennis was invented in England in 1880."
"The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), the worldwide organization, was founded in 1926, exactly 46 years after invention. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, 108 years after invention."
Many of the best players in the world today come from China.
History.
"The sport comes from England during the Victorian era, where it was played by the upper-class as a game to be played after meals. It has been suggested that simpler versions of the game should be developed by British military officers living in India during the 1860s or 1870s, who brought it back with them. A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit a golf-ball."
"The name ""ping-pong"" was in wide use before the British manufacturer J. Jaques &amp; Son Ltd coined the term in 1901. The name ""ping-pong"" then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive equipment, Jaques provided, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the ""ping-pong"" name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920's making the various associations change their names to ""table tennis"" instead of the more common, but trademarked, name."
"The next most important innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British addict of the sport, who discovered novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the game. This was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet of rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis became more popular by 1901, to the extent that tournaments were being organised, books being written on the subject, and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902."
"In 1921, the Table Tennis Association was founded, and in 1926 renamed the English Table Tennis Association. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926. London hosted the first official World Championships in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called USA Table Tennis, was formed."
"In the 1930's, Edgar Snow commented in ""Red Star Over China"" that the Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War had a ""passion for the English game of table tennis"" which he found ""bizarre"". On the other hand, the popularity of the sport waned in 1930s Soviet Union, partly because of the promotion of team and military sports, and partly because of a theory that the game had adverse health effects."
"In the 1950's, paddles that used a rubber sheet combined with an underlying sponge layer changed the game dramatically, introducing greater spin and speed. These were introduced to Britain by sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The use of speed glue beginning in the mid-1980's increased the spin and speed even further, resulting in changes to the equipment to ""slow the game down"". Table tennis was introduced as an Olympic sport at the Olympics in 1988."
Ping Pong
Ping Pong may refer to:
Nayarit
Nayarit is a middle sized Mexican state. It is on the West coast of Mexico (on the Pacific Ocean shore).
Native people from Nayarit are called Nayaritas (singular: Nayarita).
"The Nayarit Capital, is Tepic."
Filipino
Filipino might mean:
Mindanao
"Mindanao is one of the three main island groups in the Philippines. It is the southernmost major island of the Philippines, and is the only island in the Philippines to have many Muslim people. Mindanao is northeast of Sabah. It may also refer to the main island in the group."
Phylum
"A phylum (plural: phyla) is the third highest rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. The second rank is kingdom and the highest is domain. Usually biologists count about 32 phyla of animals, about 14 of plants, and about 8 phyla of fungus, but definitions vary."
"With genome analysis, groups of phyla have been put together based on evolutionary relationships. These are informal, not part of the standard classification."
"Botanists usually prefer the word ""division"" instead of ""phylum""."
"Casineria was a tetrapod which lived 340 million years ago (mya) in the Mississippian. It was a small animal, length about 15 centimeters."
It lived in what was then a fairly dry environment in what is now Scotland. It had a mosaic of 'basal' (= primitive) amphibian and 'derived' (= advanced) amniote characters.
"""Casineria"" was at or very near the origin of the amniotes. It may have been one of the very first true amniotes. The only fossil lacks key elements: most of the skull and the whole lower body is missing. This makes exact analysis difficult."
"""Casineria"" was an insectivore. This earliest amniote had five fingers with claws on each hand, and marks the earliest known clawed foot."
"Its name, ""Casineria"", is a latin version of ""Cheese Bay"", the site near Edinburgh, where it was found."
Discovery.
"In 1992, an amateur fossil collector spotted the remains of this four-legged creature on the shore of Cheese Bay, Scotland. For the next five years, the fossil waited at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh while researchers focused on other projects. In 1997, work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix of stone."
The work revealed that the animal probably lived in an environment much drier than previously understood. The findings were first reported in 1999.
Phylogenetic relationship.
"""Casineria"" shows features that ties it in with early tetrapods, notably a generally gracile (slim) build with light leg-bones, unfused ankles and toes ending in claws. This would enable the animal to use their feet actively in traction, rather than as holdfasts. This indicates a mainly terrestrial lifestyle. These traits shows it was closely related to amniotes."
"With its advanced features, ""Casineria"" may have been one of the very first true amniotes, that is, egg-layers before the split between Synapsids and Sauropsids. ""Casineria"" pushes back the origin of amniote lineages much further than was previously realized."
"""Casineria"" and its relatives were perhaps the first vertebrates to live and reproduce on land."
Protoclepsydrops
"Protoclepsydrops was an early amniote from about 314 million years ago. Its remains were found at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs World Heritage Site. The dating of this site has been debated, with dates from 320 million years ago (mya) to 305 mya being suggested.p39 It is now settled as 314.5–313.4 mya +/- 1.1 million years.p40"
"The skeletal remains of ""Protoclepsydrops"" suggest it may have been a synapsid. If so, it is the oldest synapsid known, though its status is unconfirmed because its remains were fragmentary. ""Protoclepsydrops"" lived slightly earlier than ""Archaeothyris"", which was definitely a synapsid. Like ""Archaeothyris"", ""Protoclepsydrops"" had a body shape which resembled modern lizards."
Paleothyris
"Paleothyris was a small, agile, anapsid reptile which lived in the Pennsylvanian epoch in Nova Scotia (about 312 to 304 million years ago)."
"""Paleothyris"" had sharp teeth and large eyes: it was a nocturnal hunter. It was about a foot long. It probably fed on insects and other smaller animals found on the floor of its forest home."
"""Paleothyris"" was an early sauropsid, yet it still had some features that were more labyrinthodont-like than reptile-like. Its skull lacked fenestrae, holes found in the skulls of most reptiles and mammals."
Amy Brenneman
"Amy Frederica Brenneman (born June 22, 1964) is an American producer and actor. She is best known for starring in ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Judging Amy"". She has also starred in many movies. She was born in Connecticut."
Westlothiana
"Westlothiana lizziae is an early tetrapod. It is a transitional fossil, with a mixture of amphibian and early amniote characters.282 Its body shape had a superficial resemblance to modern-day lizards. It lived during the Carboniferous period, about 350 million years ago."
"The type specimen was discovered in East Kirkton Quarry, Bathgate, Scotland, in 1984. It was named after the County of West Lothian where it was found."
"""Westlothiania"" in life."
"This species probably lived near a freshwater lake, probably hunting for other small creatures that lived in the same habitat. It was a slender animal, with rather small legs and a long tail."
"Together with ""Casineria"", another transitional fossil found in Scotland, it is one of the smallest terapods known, being a mere 20 cm in adult length."
"The small size has made it a key fossil in the search for the earliest amniote, as amniote eggs are thought to have evolved in very small animals. There are derived (advanced) features which tie it in with the amniotes rather than amphibians. These are: unfused ankle bones, lack of labyrinthodont infolding of the dentine in teeth, a lack of an otic notch and a generally small skull."
FCSB
"FCSB is a football team from Bucharest, Romania. It was founded on 7 June 1947 as ""ASA Bucureşti"" (""ASA Bucharest""). The original FC Steaua București team was part of the namesake CSA Steaua București sports club and belonged to the Ministry of National Defence. FC Steaua București was forced to change its name to FCSB in 2017. It has won the most championships in Romania, 26, and it is the only team from Romania to win a UEFA Champions League title. Its chairman is George Becali (usually ""Gigi"" Becali)."
Chevrolet Express
Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana are full sized passenger or cargo vans made via General Motors. These vans seat between eight and fifteen passengers. The cargo vans are used for commercial and business purposes. The Express/Savana vans were first produced around 1996.
"Weatherford, Texas"
"Weatherford is a city in Parker County, Texas near Fort Worth. It is part of Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area."
Green River Formation
"The Green River Formation is an Eocene rock formation on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. It records sediment from a group of intermountain lakes. Its fine fossils make this a lagerstätte, a place of exceptional preservation."
"The various fossil beds of the Green River Formation span a 5 million year period, dating to between 53.5 and 48.5 million years ago (mya). During this period the climate moved from the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene."
"The sediments are deposited in very fine layers, in pairs: a dark layer from the growing season, and a light-hue inorganic layer in winter."
"Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year. The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years. The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm, with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm."
"The sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named after the present-day Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. The formation is in three separate basins around the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah:"
Conditions at the time.
The formation has many evaporites – minerals formed by the evaporation of lakes. This suggests that high salinity was one of the causes of the superb fossilisation.
Another factor was the frequent ash falls from nearby volcanoes. Rapid burial also prevents normal decomposition.
Climate.
"Fossils preserved suggest that the region was a low, subtropical, freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated."
"The Green River fossils show a transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles, which do not tolerate frost, and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore forests. As the lake configurations shifted, each Green River location is distinct in character and time. The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements"
Oil shale.
"The Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposits in the world. The 213 billion tons of oil shale contain an estimated 2.38 × 10¹¹ m³ (1.5 trillion US barrels) of shale oil. This is a tribute to the high volume of organic material that was buried. The source of the organic material was probably cyanobacteria, which thrive in warm alkaline lake conditions."
Fossils.
"The lagerstätten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds. Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away. Leaves of palms, ferns and sycamores, some showing the insect damage got during their growth, were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved. Insects were preserved whole, even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets."
"The fauna included fish, alligators, bats, turtles, dog-sized horses, insects, and many other species of plants and animals"
Peggy Lee
"Norma Egstrom (May 26, 1920 - January 21, 2002) was an American actress and jazz singer. She is better known as Peggy Lee. She acted in many movies. She also wrote the music for them. She sang and acted for six decades. Lee was born in Jamestown, North Dakota."
Hurricane Alex (2010)
"Hurricane Alex was a rare June hurricane and the first tropical cyclone of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm first struck near Belize as a tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became a hurricane and struck northeast Mexico; it was the first hurricane in June since Hurricane Allison in 1995. The storm killed 51 people (33 directly) and caused almost $1.9 billion in damage (2010 USD)."
"The parable of the Faithful Servant and parable of the Ten Virgins, adjacent in Matthew, involve waiting for a bridegroom, and have an eschatological theme: be prepared for the day of reckoning. The parable of the Tares the parable of the Rich Fool, the parable of the budding fig tree, and the parable of the barren fig tree also have eschatological themes."
"Other parables stand alone, such as the parable of the unforgiving servant, dealing with forgiveness; the parable of the Good Samaritan, dealing with practical love; and the parable of the Friend at Night, dealing with persistence in prayer."
Art.
"Of the thirty or so parables in the canonical Gospels, four were shown in medieval art almost to the exclusion of the others, but not mixed in with the narrative scenes of the ""Life of Christ"". These were: the Ten Virgins, the Rich man and Lazarus, the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan. Artists famous for depicting parables include Martin Schongauer, Pieter the Elder Bruegal and Albrecht Dürer. The Workers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works. From the Renaissance the numbers shown widened slightly, and the various scenes of the Prodigal Son became the clear favorite, with the Good Samaritan also popular. Albrecht Dürer made a famous engraving of the ""Prodigal Son"" amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance, and Rembrandt depicted the story several times, although at least one of his works, ""The Prodigal Son in the Tavern"", a portrait of himself as the Son, revelling with his wife, is like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene. His late ""Return of the Prodigal Son"" (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) is one of his most popular works."
Poetry and hymns.
"As well as being depicted in art and discussed in prose, a number of parables form the inspiration for religious poetry and hymns. For example, the hymn ""The Ninety and Nine"" by Elizabeth C. Clephane (1868) is inspired by the parable of the Lost Sheep:"
&lt;poem&gt;
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold.
"But one was out on the hills away,"
Far off from the gates of gold.
Away on the mountains wild and bare.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.&lt;/poem&gt;
"Similarly, ""My Hope Is Built"" (Edward Mote, c. 1834) is inspired by the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders, and ""How Kind the Good Samaritan"" (John Newton, c. 1779) is inspired by the parable of the Good Samaritan."
Harmony of parables.
"A sample Gospel harmony for the parables based on the list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels is presented in the table below. For the sake of consistency, this table is automatically sub-selected from the main harmony table in the Gospel harmony article, based on the list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels. Usually, no parables are associated with the Gospel of John, just allegories."
Parallels outside the canonical gospels.
"A number of parables have parallels in non-canonical gospels, the Didache, and the letters of Apostolic Fathers . However, given that the non-canonical gospels generally have no time sequence, this table is not a Gospel harmony."
Parable of the Barren Fig Tree
"The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree (Luke 13:6–9) written in the New Testament is a parable of Jesus. It is a parable about a fig tree which does not produce fruit, unlike the parable of the budding fig tree."
What Jesus said.
Then he told this parable:
What it means.
The owner of the vineyard represents God. The fig tree is a symbol for Jerusalem (and also for Jesus's church). The vineyard where the tree was planted is the earth. The tree was meant to bear the good fruit of the Holy Spirit and the gardener (vinedresser) is Jesus. Fig trees are often planted in vineyards.
"The parable indicates Jesus is giving his hearers one last chance to repent their sins. ""These three years"" refers to the period of his ministry on earth. The parable is connected to the miracle of cursing the fig tree. Richard Whately commented that this parable ""is one which our Lord may be said to have put before his hearers twice; once in words, once in action."""
Parable of the Budding Fig Tree
"The Parable of the Budding Fig Tree is a parable of Jesus. It is written in the New Testament in Matthew 24:32-35, Mark 13:28-31 and Luke 21:29-33. The parable compares the Kingdom of God with a budding fig tree, the opposite of the barren fig tree."
What Jesus said.
He told them this parable:
"""Sovereignty"" when talking about relations between countries mostly means the rights a Sovereign state has over its territory."
Sometimes there is discussion about when a government loses Sovereignty because it is doing bad things for its people. In this case justice may mean other countries need to intrude on the sovereignty of the government.
Inside a Country.
"""Sovereignty"" when talking about relations between groups inside one country usually means which group has the Legitimacy to rule. This may not be certain. Sometimes the group who is most able to rule (because of a strong military) is not Legitimate."
FIFA
"The (FIFA ; French for ""International Federation of Association Football"") is the organization that controls international football (also called ""association football""). The organization’s main buildings are in Zürich, Switzerland. FIFA organizes major international football tournaments, and the most famous one is the FIFA World Cup, which has been held since 1930. FIFA was established on May 21, 1905 in Paris and has 209 national associations as its members. The organization’s official languages are English, French, German and Spanish."
"The president of FIFA is currently Gianni Infantino, serving since 26 February 2016."
"The most powerful organ of FIFA is the FIFA Congress, which is an assembly made up of representatives from each member association. The Congress holds a regular meeting once a year, and since 1998 an additional meeting has been held every year. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's laws."
"The Congress decides whether FIFA should accept new national associations and elects the President of FIFA, its General Secretary and the other members of FIFA's executive committee. The President and General Secretary take care of what goes on within and around FIFA. The executive committee, with the President as its head, is responsible for deciding the dates, locations and format of tournaments."
"Also, there are six regional confederations recognized by FIFA which take care of the game in the seven different continents of the world. National associations must be members of both FIFA and their regional confederation in order for their teams to compete in FIFA's competitions. The six confederations are AFC (Asian Football Confederation in Asia and Australia), CAF (Confédération Africaine de Football in Africa), CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football in North America and Central America), CONMEBOL (Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol in South America), OFC (Oceania Football Confederation in Oceania) and UEFA (Union Européenne de Football Association in Europe)."
American Idol
"American Idol is an American reality-singing competition series created by Simon Fuller, produced by 19 Entertainment, and distributed by FremantleMedia North America. It aired on Fox from June 11, 2002 to April 7, 2016, as an addition to the Idols format based on the British series Pop Idol and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of American television. On March 11, 2018, the 16th season aired on ABC."
"Eventually the American people are allowed to vote by calling or texting, and the person with the fewest votes is off the show."
The TV show consists of multiple rounds of elimination. The singers can be anyone between the age of 15 and 29 years.
Host and judges.
"""American Idol"" has three judges, who give comments on performances."
The three judges are:
Host
Smile
"A smile is a face made by flexing the muscles near both ends of the mouth. The smile can also be made through the eyes (See 'Duchenne smile' below). Smiles usually express happiness. A smile can be natural or fake. However, smiling can be different with animals. When smiling, the teeth shows, but sometimes animals do this when they are threatening. When chimpanzees show their teeth, it can also be a sign of fear."
Dimples.
"Dimples are genetically inherited. They are caused by the flesh underneath the skin, that forms on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Some people may only have one dimple on only one side of the face."
Duchenne smile.
"Although there are many different types of smiles, researchers are interested in the duchenne smile because it is done with the eyes. The Duchenne smile was named after the French physician Guillaume Duchenne. Duchenne identified two types of smiles. A Duchenne smile is when the cheek raises and forms a wrinkle around the eyes. Many researchers think that Duchenne smiles are usually hard to make when you are pretending to smile."
Internet.
"On the Internet, smiles can normally be typed up. This is normally called a smiley, smiley face, or happy face. Smileys show emotion when people are not able to see it in real life. Smileys typed on the computer are called emoticons. Smileys can change depending on where the person typing the smiley is."
"Western Style: :-), :-(, ;-), :-O, :-D, (;D)"
"Eastern Style: d(^.^)b, \(^o^)/, &gt;.&lt;, ^_^, *&lt;):)"
"Scallops and file clams can swim to escape a predator, clapping their valves together to create a jet of water. Cockles can use their foot to leap from danger. However these methods quickly exhaust the animal. In the razor shells the siphons can break off only to grow back later."
Defensive secretions.
"The file shells can produce a noxious secretion when threatened, and the fan shells of the same family have a unique, acid-producing organ."
Comparison with brachiopods.
"Bivalves are superficially similar to brachiopods, but the construction of the shell is completely different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, they are on the left and right sides."
"Bivalves appeared late in the Cambrian explosion and came to increase in the Palaeozoic, and dominate over brachiopods during the Mesozoic. So, it was thought that bivalves are better adapted to aquatic life than the brachiopods, and this caused brachiopods to be out-competed and relegated to minor niches."
"However, after the Permian-Triassic extinction event bivalves had a huge adaptive radiation while brachiopods were devastated, losing 95% of their diversity."
The upshot was that bivalves took over the desirable inshore habitats. Brachiopods now live in deeper waters where food is scarcer.

Bishop
Bishop is a type of clergy in some Christian churches. The bishop is the leader of the Christians and the Christian priests in each diocese. The diocese which a bishop governs is called a bishopric. Episcopal is the adjective for bishops. A cathedral is the church building where the bishop has an episcopal throne. The cathedral is the main church of the diocese and the bishop's see. A bishop may be given the rank of archbishop in an archdiocese.
"Christian priests in some denominations must be made priests by bishops. In these denominations, bishops are above parish priests in the hierarchy of the church's organization. However, some Protestant denominations have no bishops or archbishops. The Presbyterianism is an example. The leader of the Church of Scotland is the Moderator. The General Assembly elects the Moderator of the Church of Scotland each year. Other Christian movements have neither bishops nor priests: Quakers are one example."
"In the Catholic church, the Pope is chosen by all the cardinals from amongst their number. According to church law, this does not have to be the case: any male, unmarried, baptized Christian who is judged fit for the office can become pope. However, the last pope who was not a bishop was Urban VI (elected in 1378)."
"The pope is also 'the Bishop of Rome'. In fact he rules an independent state within Rome, called the Vatican. All Roman Catholic bishops answer to the pope (or to patriarchs in some orthodox churches). In the Anglican church, bishops are governed by Archbishops."
"Usually a bishop can be identified by a special hat, called a mitre."
Tray
A tray is a shallow container designed for carrying things.
"Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off of them. They are often rectangular, and may or may not have handles with which to carry them."
"A butler's tray has a deeper surround, handles on the short sides (usually cut into the surround) so that it can be easily carried, and folding legs. It is used to carry drinks, and can be used as a side table."
Orkney Islands
"The Orkney Islands (often also called only Orkney) is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, United Kingdom. It is about 16 kilometres north of Caithness. 20 of the about 70 islands have people living on them. The administrative centre is Kirkwall (with about 8000 people living there). The next largest settlements are Stromness (2000 people) and St. Margaret's Hope (with about 550 people)."
"In addition to the mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles. All of them are made of sandstone. The climate is mild and the soil is fertile. Most of the land is farmed and agriculture is the main source of income for the economy. There are many birds and fish."
Transportation.
"Ferry services go much of the time to Lerwick (in Shetland). Most islands have air strips (for airplanes). This includes the shortest known flight service in the world, between Westray and Papa Westray. Official flight time is 2 minutes. If the wind goes in the right direction, the flight can take just over a minute."
Methodism
Vasily Chuikov
"Vasily Chuykov (February 12, 1900 – March 18, 1982) was a medieval fish."
"During World War II he was commanding the 62nd army, with which he was especially outstanding himself in the Battle of Stalingrad."
"He was twice Hero of the Soviet Union (1944, 1945)."
He was made Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1955.
Power Purchasing Agreement
"A Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) is a legal contract between a electricity provider and a land owner. The contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owner's land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider. This deal is often done using solar technology, where the electricity provider will install, operate, and maintain solar panels on the land owner's roof. Then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof. Part of the PPA is to set a price for the electrcity (often lower than the previous price the land owner was paying for power line electrcity). If the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner, then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines. If the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs, then he will sell the excess to the power lines."
Schools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their roof. Large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panels.
"Power Purchasing agreements tend to last 5 – 20 years. At the end of the PPA, either the contract is extended, the solar panels are removed from the property, or the land owner buys the solar panels from the electricity provider."
Power Purchasing agreements have been very important to the expansion of solar electricity use in the United States. Investment tax credits from the federal and state governments have helped make the price of solar panels affordable for the providing companies. The tax credit can help pay for significant percentage of the project cost in some cases.
Some of the electricity providers who offer PPAs are:
Pioneer plaque
The Pioneer plaques were a pair of plaques that were launched into deep space on Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11. The same image is on both plaques. The image is made up of many parts.
There is a drawing of a nude human female and a nude human male.
There is a diagram of the change in spin of the electron of a hydrogen particle. This diagram is meant to set up a universal unit of length and a universal unit of time for the rest of the image.
"There is a crude map of our solar system showing a spacecraft leaving the third planet, Earth. There have been negative reactions about the arrow showing the trajectory of the spacescraft. Alien species may not understand the human concept of a line and arrow."
"There is pattern of lines that looks like a star burst design. This is a map. There are 15 lines. 14 of the lines have a long binary number engraved along it. The binary numbers are distances. The distances are not in meters or kilometers, but in the universal unit of distance given by the hydrogen particle diagram. The 14 lines give the distance from the sun to 14 pulsars. The 15th line gives the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy."
Clube Atlético Mineiro
"Clube Atlético Mineiro is a Brazilian football club. Atletico Mineiro was founded in 1908 in the city of Belo Horizonte, where the team plays. The team has ""Galo"" (rooster) as its mascot, for this reason the club is also known simply as Galo."
"Atletico Mineiro is one of the most traditional football clubs in Brazil, being the first champion of the modern version of the Brazilian Football Championhsip. The most important achievement of the club was the Copa Libertadores de America in 2013, which is regarded as the most important tournament in South America."
"In the last five years, Atletico Mineiro is probably passing through the most victorious period in its history, since in the last five years the team has played five out of the nine Copa Libertadores editions the team has ever disputed."

Matthew Flinders (16 March 1774 – 19 July 1814) was an English navigator and cartographer. He was the leader of the first circumnavigation of Australia and identified it as a continent.
"Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, along with Aboriginal man Bungaree."
"Heading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales – a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie."
"Flinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the publication of his widely praised book and atlas, ""A Voyage to Terra Australis""."
Induction coil
"An induction coil or ""spark coil"" is a type of electrical transformer. It is used to produce high-voltage pulses from a low-voltage direct current (DC) supply. To create the flux changes necessary to induce voltage in the secondary coil, the direct current in the primary coil is repeatedly interrupted by a vibrating mechanical contact called an interrupter."
"The induction coil was the first type of transformer. It was widely used in X-ray machines, spark-gap radio transmitters, arc lighting and quack medical devices from the 1880s to the 1920s. Today its only common use is for ignition coils in internal combustion engines and in physics education to demonstrate induction."
Frodsham
"Frodsham is a small market town in the county of Cheshire in the north west of England, north west of Chester, on the River Weaver, and overlooking the River Mersey estuary."
"The town is of Saxon origin, its 11th century church is mentioned in the Domesday Book. When a salt refinery was opened in 1964, salt was brought by river from Northwich."
Great Western main line
"The Great Western main line is a main line railway in England, that runs westwards from London Paddington to . It opened in 1841 and was the original route of the old Great Western Railway. In 1948 it became the Western Region of British Railways. It is now part of the national rail system managed by Network Rail."
Electrification.
"The line was electrified from Paddington to Heathrow Airport in the late 1990s. Work to electrify the rest of the route started in 2011. The aim was to complete the work all the way to Bristol by 2016. Parts of the programme have been deferred because costs have tripled. The four sections deferred are: Didcot to Oxford, Bristol Parkway to Bristol Temple Meads, Royal Wootton Bassett Junction to Bristol Temple Meads and the Thames Valley branches to Henley-on-Thames and Windsor."
Train services.
Most trains are operated by Great Western Railway.
South Western Railway (train operating company)
"South Western Railway (SWR) is an English train operating company owned by FirstGroup (70%) and MTR Corporation (30%) that operates the South Western franchise. It operates commuter services from its Central London terminus at London Waterloo to South West London. SWR provides suburban and regional services in the counties of Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset, as well as regional services in Devon, Somerset, Berkshire and Wiltshire. Its subsidiary Island Line operates services on the Isle of Wight."
Marko Orlandić
"Marko Orlandić (Serbian Cyrillic: Марко Орландић) (28 September 1930 – 20 December 2019) was a Montenegrin politician active during the 1970s and 1980s. In two terms, 1969–1971 and 1971–1974, he was a member of the Federal Executive Council. He was the Prime Minister from May 1974 to May 1978 and President of Montenegro from May 1983 to May 1984."
"From 1979 to 1982, he served as Ambassador of SFRY in Soviet Union (USSR). He was one of the figures who called for Montenegro's independence."
Orlandić died in Podgorica on 20 December 2019 at the age of 89.
Prime Minister of Montenegro
"The Prime Minister of Montenegro (Montenegrin: ""Premijer Crne Gore"") (""Premier of Montenegro""), is the head of the Government of Montenegro. The role of the Prime Minister is to follow and lead the work of the Government, and to submit to the Parliament the Government's Program."
"The current Prime Minister, Dritan Abazović is the member of United Reform Action party and became prime minister in April 2022."
"Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1990 Prague has become one of Europe's most popular tourist places. It has buildings dating from the 13th century to the present day. The castle looks very important on the hillside. Charles Bridge is now closed to traffic so that pedestrians can walk across the bridge and buy souvenirs from the stalls. There are many museums, palaces and theatres. Tourists often go to the Old Town Square in the centre of Prague. There are lots of buildings there from different periods of history. The statue of Jan Hus stands high above the square. There is a famous Astronomical Clock on the wall of the Old Town Hall. There are museums dedicated to famous people including Smetana, Dvořák and Franz Kafka. The Estates Theatre is one of Europe’s oldest theaters. It was built in the 1780s and Mozart conducted the first performance of his opera ""Don Giovanni"" there."
Prague is on the list of World Heritage Sites.
Economics.
"Prague has been important in the economy of what is now the Czech Republic since the region developed industry in the 19th century. Textiles and machinery are made and exported to many countries. Food, electronics and chemicals are produced. Nearly half the people who work are women."
"Prague is becoming a city where many international companies have their headquarters. Since the late 1990s, Prague has become a popular filming location for international productions and Hollywood motion pictures."
There are no ghettos in Prague.
Colleges and universities.
"The city contains several universities and colleges including the oldest university in Central and Eastern Europe: the Charles University, founded in 1348."
Transport.
"Prague has three metro lines, 20 tram lines, and buses that connect to the suburbs. There is also a funicular rail link to the top of the Petřín Hill and a chairlift at Prague Zoo. All these services have a common ticketing system."
"Prague metro is one of the best in Europe for quality and speed. It has got 3 lines (A, B, and C), 65 kilometers and 61 stations."
Trains from Prague connect to major cities in neighbouring countries.
"There is a modern airport, Václav Havel airport Prague, used by many airlines including Czech Airlines."
Sport.
"Prague has many parks and gardens, including a park for culture, sports and entertainments which is named after Julius Fučík, a resistance leader of World War II. It has three stadiums, the largest of which, Spartakiádní stadion, holds 250,000 people. They have a good Soccer team and play many sports."
Wallet
"A wallet is a small flat container, mostly of leather or fabric, that a person uses to hold cash, credit cards, identification cards, etc. Most men usually keep their wallets in their pockets, while women usually keep them in larger bags called purses."
"Wallets, particularly in Europe, where larger coins are prevalent, contain also a coin purse compartments. Some wallets have built-in clasps or bands to keep them closed."
"As European banknotes, such as Euros and Pounds, are typically larger than American banknotes in size, they do not fit in some smaller American wallets."
"A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, program, or service that stores public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to this basic function, a cryptocurrency wallet most often also offers provides encryption and/or the use of a digital signature. Any crypto wallet is a combination of a private key and a public address. There are the following options for crypto wallets: hardware, desktop, paper, mobile, web wallets."
Memory card
"A memory card is a form of flash memory that is used in a range of electronic devices such as a digital camera or video game console. The memory card stores data, images, music, saved games or other computer files."
"Flash memory devices like this contain no moving parts so they are not easily damaged. This means that they are ideal for use in portable devices such as MP3 players, digital cameras, mobile phones etc."
"The amount of data memory cards can store depends on the ""capacity"" of the card. Currently (in 2017) the largest memory cards can store 1 terabyte of data. As the technology improves, larger capacity cards are expected."
"There are many different types of memory cards, for example MultiMediaCard or CompactFlash, but the majority are SD cards or MicroSD."
Computer printer
"A computer printer is a piece of hardware for a computer. It allows a user to print items on paper, such as letters and pictures. Usually a printer prints under the control of a computer. Many can also work as a photocopier or with a digital camera to print directly without using a computer."
Types of printers.
"Today, the following types of printers are in regular use:"
"Stauber first published on YouTube in 2013. His website was launched in late 2017. The website mostly has links to other content such as his social media and merch stores. Stauber also has a Patreon, where he releases unreleased songs and videos monthly. He also releases full versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These full versions are usually released later under ""Jack Stauber's Micropop""."
Early life.
"Stauber grew up in McKean, Pennsylvania. He has one sister, named Kharly. He majored in marketing and minored in studio arts at the University of Pittsburgh. In an interview, Stauber showed his favorite cartoon is Rugrats, and liked the art style, stating ""Take some time to watch a minute of the pilot of Rugrats if you haven’t seen that before. The art style is beyond incredible."""
Work.
"""Buttercup"" and ""Oh Klahoma""."
"Stauber's most famous work, ""Buttercup"", is the first song released on his 2017 album ""Pop Food"". The song, along with remixes and covers of it, became a popular internet meme, especially on TikTok, which helped with its success. The song currently has 279 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. Stauber did not release an official music video for it. The song has been described as ""bubbly, dramatic pop with Panda Bear-esque vocals."" YouTuber ""lisuga"" made a popular fan made video using clips from the Japanese film, ""Kick-Heart"". It is the most viewed Jack Stauber-related video on YouTube, with 191 million views as of May 2021."
"""Oh Klahoma"", the second track from ""Pop Food"", also became popular. The song currently has 74 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. The song is most famously used as background music to a TikTok trend called #ghostphotoshoot, where creators dress up as ghosts and take photos of themselves, sometimes wearing sunglasses and other fashion accessories. However, the trend has become controversial, with critics saying the bedsheet costumes used look like KKK robes."
Style.
"Stauber's visual style is known to be different, with some YouTube videos being dedicated to attempting to replicate the aesthetic that he utilizes in many of his videos. Stauber himself commented under one such video, expressing that he was impressed with the result. Meg Fair of ""Pittsburgh City Paper"" highlighted Stauber's knack of ""pulling unrelated sounds and influences into [his] music"" and liked his ability to switch styles quickly. Jenna Minnig of ""PennState CommMedia"" compared Stauber's music to Ariel Pink's; as both have hypnagogic-pop styles and have similar voices, but believed it was not needed to compare the two. Fans of his music include American rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, actor, rapper, and comedian Andy Milonakis, actor Verne Troyer, indie singer-songwriter Sidney Gish, and model Paris Jackson."
Animations.
"Along with music, Stauber is known for his animations. They are usually separated into three styles: ""surreal"", characters with odd and striking facial expressions and frequently part of his claymations, ""colorful"", which usually are featured in his VHS animations and music videos, and ""Stauber faces"", light-skinned characters with cartoon noses. Stauber is also well known for his frequent use of teeth in his videos and animations. He usually uses detailed resin teeth on his clay characters, although he has used real teeth. He has encouraged fans to send him teeth for him to use in his videos."
"To make his animations, Stauber uses Microsoft Paint for the drawings. He then sequences the frames in Adobe Premiere Pro, and then runs the finished video through a VHS tape."
Discography.
Albums.
Stauber has four albums on both his Bandcamp and Spotify. Stauber uses the Plopscotch Records label to put copyright on his music.

Examinations.
The RCO offers five qualifications or diplomas.
ARCO
"ARCO (short for Atlantic Richfield Company, the original name) is a United States oil company. It has operationsn 2 in the United States, Indonesia, the North Sea, and the South China Sea. As of July 2011, it had more than 1,300 gas stations in the western part of the United States."
ARCO's original parent companies included:
"The two companies merged in 1966, and bought Sinclair Oil Corporation in 1969. In 1978, ARCO opened its first ampm convenience store."
"Between 1970 and 2000, ARCO had a complicated corporate history. By 1985, it sold its Eastern US business to a new Atlantic Petroleum. In 2000, the remaining Western US business was bought by British Petroleum (BP). Finally, in 2013, BP sold ARCO and the Carson Refinery to Tesoro for $2.5 billion."
Oil discovery.
"In 1957, Richfield was the first to drill for oil in Alaska. On July 15 of that year they struck oil with their first well. It was the first major oil discovery in Alaska and tested at 900 barrels a day. In 1968 they partnered with Exxon for Alaska North Slope oil production. In 1980, they were the seventh largest oil company in the United States."
Skating
Skating refers and involves any sport or recreational activity that involves traveling on dry surface or ice using skates.
"There are many varieties of skating, such as:"
Economic bubble
"An economic bubble happens when a market goes through a very fast inflation of value. This increase is followed by a quick decrease in value, called a ""crash"" or a ""bubble burst"". Economic bubbles can be caused by many things, but many economists believe that economic bubbles are related to inflation. An economic bubble can cause an economic crisis due to a loss of investment both by companies and individuals, such as the Great Depression or the Economic crisis of 2007-2010."
"An economic bubble occurs due to the human psychology of an expectation of an unlimited demand for any particular commodity. The market moves up quickly as the investors see an increase in prices due to increase in demand. Prices may eventually fall when supply increases beyond the demand, resulting in the bursting of the bubble. Predicting when this will happen is difficult, hence it may surprise investors."
Population without double counting
Population sans doubles comptes is a phrase in French that means population without double counting in English.
"In France, because of the census, the INSEE has allowed people who live in one place and study in a different place to be counted twice, so as to show how the population moves. Because of this, each commune in France has many numbers of how many people live in it. For example, students may be counted where they study and where they live but do not study (the place they were born in). It is just like allowing students in the United States to vote in the town election of the place they are studying in and the town election where they were born."
Glass transition
The glass transition is the transition of amorphous solids from a hard and brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state. An amorphous solid that goes through a glass transition is called a glass. Supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state is called vitrification.
"The glass transition temperature ""T""g is always lower than the melting temperature, ""T""m, of the crystalline state of the material, if one exists. Above a glass transition temperature, a plastic is rubbery. Below the glass transition temperature, a plastic is solid. Thermosets, or thermo-setting plastics, burn up before they reach their melt temperature, but most thermosets also undergo glass transition."
Uncle Tom's Cabin
"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti-slavery novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was published in 1852. It greatly influenced many people's thoughts about African Americans and slavery in the United States. It also strengthened the conflict between the Northern and Southern United States. This led to the American Civil War. The book's effect was so powerful that Lincoln said when he met Stowe at the beginning of the Civil War, ""So this is the little lady who made this big war."""
"The main character of the novel is Uncle Tom, a patiente sentimental novel showed the effects of slavery. It also said that Christian love is stronger than slavery."
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was the most popular novel of the 19th century, and the second best-selling book of the century (the first one was the Bible). It helped abolitionism spread in the 1850s."
"In these days, it has been praised as a very important help to anti-slavery. However, it has also been criticized for making stereotypes about black people."
Pavel Eljanov
Pavel Eljanov (born 1983) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster.
"Eljanov's most notable tournament result to date was winning Corus B tournament 2007 in Wijk aan Zee, Holland with a score of 9/13. This result enabled him to qualify for the category 20 tournament Corus A 2008."
"On the September 2010 FIDE rating list, Eljanov had a rating of 2761, making him number 1 in Ukraine and number 6 in the world. His results in the Russian premier league had been exceptional. Since then he has slipped to #21."
Lactase
"Lactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose, breaking it down so it can be digested."
"Mammals in their infancy usually make lactase: they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother's milk. Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea."
Lactase evolution in humans.
"Humans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of polymorphism."
The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the development of animal husbandry. This created a system providing a consistent supply of milk.
Hunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers.
Genetics.
"A mutation on chromosome #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives."
"This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait."
"Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution."

"It offers eight beers in the Philippines with its flagship brand Beer na Beer launched in 1988 as Beer Pale Pilsen. It changed its name to Beer na Beer after lawsuits by other breweries using the term pale pilsen. In 2001, Beer na Beer was reformulated and now has 6.0% alcohol volume."
"ABI's seven other beers are sold on a somewhat limited scale, but its Colt 45 brand, launched in 1995, is the biggest among them. This malt liquor's biggest competitor is Red Horse Extra Strong from San Miguel. ABI's other licensed brands are Carlsberg (the brewery's first beer in 1987), Lone Star (launched in 2000), Lone Star Light (2002), Colt Ice (2003), Lone Star ULTRA (the country's first low-carb beer, launched in 2004, Stag (either cancelled or it's just hard to find in the country), and Coors (2008)."
"The company also offers Absolute distilled drinking water, the second biggest-selling bottled water brand in the market behind SMC's Wilkins, and Summit mineral water. They are both launched in 1992."
"In 1995, Q Shandy was launched to compete with SMC's Cali. In 1999, Pacific Sun iced tea was launched. In 2009, Asia Brewery introduced Feelgood, the first juice drink in the Philippines to contain prebiotics."
"Asia Brewery entered the low-priced carbonated soft drinks market by acquiring a license to produce Virgin Cola from Virgin Drinks. They are responsible in distributing products such as Summit Vitaminwater, ZeroCal and 100Plus."
"In 2008, Asia Brewery partnered with Cobra International Beverage Holdings, Inc. introduced the Philippine version of Cobra Energy Drink, is the ready-to-drink energy drink now in the Philippine market."

Optical gain medium
"An optical gain medium (also called an ""active laser medium"") can make light stronger. In general, gain media must be powered by another energy source in order to have energy to provide as light. Some gain media can be powered using electricity, but many others need light energy from bright flash lamps or a laser. Optical gain media are used in lasers. The first lasers used artificial ruby as their optical gain medium."
Microvillus
"Microvillus (plural microvilli) is a very tiny hair-like membrane in the body. The microvillus greatly increase the amount of surface area for a cell. In humans, the microvilli can give a cell 600 times more surface area. They are good for absorbing things and for secreting things. They are found in many places in a human body including the ear, the tongue, the nose and the intestines."
"On a tongue, the microvilli are the tiny hairs on the taste buds that send signals to the brain. These signals are interpreted by the brain, and tells the brain what things taste like. Over time, as a person tastes more and more things, the brain stores the information the microvilli send in a databank of information. This databank is used to compare new tastes to old tastes, and help to classify them by comparing and contrasting their qualities."
"In the intestines, the microvilli are able to absorb (take) nutrients from the digested food for the body to use."
Languages of the United States
"English is the ""de facto"" national language of the United States, with 82% of the population claiming it as a mother tongue, and some 96% claiming to speak it ""well"" or ""very well"". However, no ""official language"" exists at the Federal level. There have been several proposals to make English the national language in amendments to immigration reform bills, but none of these bills have made a federal language. However, some states have adopted the English language as their official language. On the other hand, a lot of another languages, like Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Polish, Finnish, Dutch, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Hindi, Mandarin, Hebrew, Cantonese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Navajo, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Portuguese, etc. Are spoken in the United States as second languages."

In October she published a post on Facebook was describing ""the Eid Al-Adha’s tradition of slaughtering sheep as the “greatest massacre committed by human beings.” Then one candidate from parliament said that ""Her aim is to insult Islam"". Thus she wrote through Ahram Online report ""that humans justified their lust for killing and enjoying the smell of cooking game by attempting to bestow a divine meaning to their actions.” And because of the law that added in 1982 a legislation which stated that there is from six months to five years and fines of LE500 to LE1000 for anyone who uses religion to promote, through speech, writing, or any other medium, extremist ideas with the aim of spreading discord or to belittle one of the monotheistic religions or their different sects, or to harm national unity. she put in jail for 3 years and fined 20.000 LE. Although she said in front of the court that ""she did not aim to insult Islam, but she just explained her point of view. Naoot said through Middle east online ""I’m not sad about the sentencing as I don’t care about going to jail. I’m sad that the efforts of reformists have been wasted,”. As a result, THE ARAB NETWORK FOR HUMAN RIGHTS INFORMATION issued a statement which is ""“the recent surge in the prosecution of opinion makers comes in conjunction with a fierce security campaign launched by security bodies against freedom of opinion and expression, with the aim of narrowing the overall climate of freedom of opinion and expression. Such a matter, in turn, makes Egypt one of the most Arab countries that show hostility to freedom of expression as well as press freedom, especially that about 59 journalists have remained in prison so far.” Fatma is not a political figure, she is an Egyptian writer, poet, translator and journalist who always says her point of view."

Objectivity (science)
"Objectivity in science means that scientific ideas and measurements are tested. That means they are independent from the individual scientist (the subject) who proposes them. In other words, if scientist A claims something, scientist B must be able to check whether A is right."
"The evidence can (in principle) be shown to anyone who doubts it. The ""in principle"" bit is because some science needs complex machinery, and if you don't understand the machinery, you won't understand the results. But elementary science can often be shown in a classroom, or on television."
"Some science does need a proper scientific education. To some extent the general public has to trust a qualified scientist to present the idea in some suitable form. That means on television or on the web, or perhaps in published articles or books. Most awards of the Nobel Prize in science are followed by presentations on various web channels."
"It is generally agreed that, at least in some subjects, modern science needs a person to have some education before they can understand it. Specialist communicators often do this on television or the web. 150 years ago, people read science directly from books written by scientists like Faraday and Darwin. Now most people get their science from people who act as communicators of science."
Objectivity in measurement.
"To avoid the variety in subjective (ambiguous) interpretation of quantifying terms such as ""green"", ""hot"", ""large"", ""considerable"", and ""negligible"", scientists try hard, where possible, to eliminate human senses by use of standardized measuring tools (meter stick, stopwatch, thermometer, etc.) and mechanical/electronic measuring instruments (spectrometer, voltmeter, timer, oscilloscope, gravimeter, etc.) for performing the actual measuring process, eliminating much of the perceptive variability of individual observers. The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units - so that everybody else understands them the same way. Where data must need be used, the ideal is to use ""hard"", ""objective"" criteria for assigning the classifications (see definition), such that different classifiers would get the same results."
Roundhay Garden Scene
"Roundhay Garden Scene is a short movie made on October 14, 1888 in the garden of ""Oakwood Grange"", Roundhay, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It was made by a French man named Louis Le Prince. It was silent. The movie had Adolphe Le Prince, Sarah Whitley, Joseph Whitley, and Harriet Hartley walking in the garden of Oakwood Grange. It is believed to be the oldest surviving movie by many people. It is 1.66 seconds long. The digitalized version lasts 2.11 seconds."
Herpetology

Herp.
"""Herp"" is a vernacular term for reptiles and amphibians. It is derived from the old term ""herpetile"". Linnaeus grouped reptiles and amphibians together in the same class, and that is where the term comes from. The term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of reptiles and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians. There are over 6700 species of amphibians and over 9000 species of reptiles."
Batrachology.
Batrachology is the study of amphibians. Batrachology can also mean that a person enjoys amphibians and are among their favorite pets.

Zuni
"The Zuni, also called Zuñi or Ashiwi are a Native American tribe. They live near the Zuni River. This river flows into the Little Colorado River, in western New Mexico, United States."
"They are famous for their language, which is not like other Pueblo or Native American languages. It is a language isolate."
Fallacy
"A fallacy is an incorrect argument in logic and rhetoric. It gives a result which is not valid or lacks soundness. In mathematics, a fallacy can occur when the reasoning violates the condition of its applicability. Fallacies are either formal fallacies or informal fallacies."
Formal fallacies.
A formal fallacy is an error in logic. This shows in the argument's form. All formal fallacies are types of non sequiturs (the conclusion does not follow from the premises).
"Even if the conclusion of an argument is correct, it is not supported by the logic given."
Informal fallacies.
Informal fallacies are arguments that are fallacious for reasons other than structural flaws. They usually need examination of the argument's content. Some examples of informal fallacies include:
Faulty generalizations.
"Faulty generalizations are made when one reaches a conclusion from weak premises. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions—yet only weakly buttress the conclusions. A faulty generalization is thus produced."
Red herring fallacies.
"A red herring fallacy is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion."
"Red herring – argument given in response to another argument, which is irrelevant and draws attention away from the subject of argument."

Myanmar
Myanmar is a country in Southeast Asia. Its full name is the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. It used to be called Burma. Myanmar is a country in Southeast Asia that is not an island. It is also part of South Asia.
"It is bordered by China on the north, Laos on the east, Thailand on the southeast, Bangladesh on the west, and India on the northwest, with the Andaman Sea to the south, and the Bay of Bengal to the southwest. There are over of coastline."
Government.
"The country was ruled by a military junta led by General Ne Win from 1962 to 1988. Its political system today stays under the tight control of its military government. In 1991, Senior General Than Shwe began ruling the country. In 2011 Thein Sein was elected as a first president of the civilian government. In 2016 Htin Kyaw became the second elected civilian leader. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is prevented from becoming president by the constitution of Myanmar, will act as an advisor to Kyaw."
"In March 2018, Win Myint became the country's tenth and current President."
Origin and history of the name.
"In 1989, the military junta officially changed the English version of its name from ""Burma"" to ""Myanmar"". It also made a new name in English for places in the country, such as its former capital city, from ""Rangoon"" to Yangon. The official name of the country in the Burmese language, ""Myanmar"" did not change, however. The renaming was controversial, seen by some as linguistically bad. Accepting the name change in the English-speaking world has been slow, with many people still using the name ""Burma"" to refer to the country. Major news organizations like the BBC still call it Burma. Some question the military junta's authority to ""officially"" change the name in English in the first place. Aung San Suu Kyi, however, calls the country Myanmar now."
History.
"Myanmar had a strong kingdom in ancient times, but the nation was taken over by the British in the 1800s. It was occupied by the Empire of Japan in the 1940s. Myanmar became independent in 1948 as the Union of Burma, and had a democratic government at first. However, in 1962, a coup d'état brought the military into power, where it has been ever since. The founder of modern Myanmar, Aung San was assassinated months before independence. His daughter Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest many times for leading the democracy movement."
"In 1991, the military junta agreed to democratic elections, which were won by the National League for Democracy, and should have made Aung San Suu Kyi the Prime Minister. However, the dictatorship ignored the results of the elections and continued ruling. In November 2005, the military government stated that the national capital would be moved from Yangon to a location near Pyinmana, which was renamed Naypyidaw in March 2006."
"Young children, because they weigh less than adults, are at particular risk of tertiary injury."
Quaternary injuries.
"Quaternary injuries, include flash burns, crush injuries from falling debris and inhalation injuries, which may make existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD worse."
Quinary injuries.
"This category of blast injury has been added fairly recently to classify injuries, which often results in a hyperinflammatory state may due to exposure to the environmental contaminants associated with the various types of explosive blasts including, bacteria, chemicals and radiation (""dirty bombs"") as well as adverse tissue reaction to fuel and metals in the blast."
Psychological trauma.
The psychological trauma which may occur in explosive blast survivors includes post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A concussion sustained in a blast may also be a risk factor for developing PTSD independent of a person's psychological reaction to the witnessed event. Psychological trauma may also occur in the complete absence of physical injuries.
Neurotrauma.
"Neurotrauma can occur due to the mechanisms of one or more blast injury categories. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue and/or organs also significantly contributes to blast-induced neurotrauma."
"Individuals exposed to blasts frequently have loss of memory for events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation."
Sam Raimi
"Samuel Marshall ""Sam"" Raimi (born October 23, 1959) is an American movie director, producer, writer, and actor. He directed the ""Spider-Man"" movie trilogy (2002-2007). He also directed ""Oz the Great and Powerful""."
"Raimi was born on October 23, 1959 in Royal Oak, Michigan to a Hungarian-Russian Jewish family. He was raised in Birmingham, Michigan. He studied at Groves High School and at Michigan State University. Raimi has been married to Gillian Dania Greene since 1993. They have five children."
Men in Black 3
"Men in Black 3 is a 2012 American 3D science fiction comedy movie. It is about stopping aliens from changing the past in 1969, so Agent J travels back in time to stop that from happening. The movie stars Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin. Movie critic Roger Ebert gave the movie 3 out of 4 stars."
It is a sequel to Men in Black and Men in Black II.
Irán Eory
"Irán Eory (born Elvira Teresa Eory Sidi, 21 October 1937 in Tehran - died 11 March 2002 in Mexico City) . He was a prominent Iranian-Mexican actress."
George Jones
"George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 – April 26, 2013) was an American country music singer known for his long list of hit records, his distinctive voice and phrasing, and his marriage to Tammy Wynette."
"Jones was born on September 12, 1931 in Saratoga, Texas. He was raised in Vidor, Texas."
Jones was married to Dorothy Bonvillion from 1950 until they divorced. Then he was married to Shirley Ann Corley from 1954 until they divorced in 1968. Then he was married to Tammy Wynette from 1969 until they divorced in 1975. Then he was married to Nancy Sepulvado from 1983 until his death in 2013. He had four children.
"Jones died on April 26, 2013 in Nashville, Tennessee from respiratory failure, aged 81."
Grandpa Jones
"Louis Marshall Jones (October 20, 1913 – February 19, 1998), known professionally as Grandpa Jones, was an American banjo player and ""old time"" country and gospel music singer. He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame."
"Jones was born on October 20, 1913 in Niagara, Kentucky. He was raised in Akron, Ohio. He was married to Ramona Riggins from 1946 until his death in 1998. They had three children. Jones died on February 19, 1998 in Nashville, Tennessee from a stroke, aged 84."
"Many industrial power plants burn fossil fuels to get their energy. However, burning fossil fuels can make a lot of oxides (chemical compounds that have oxygen and other elements inside). In fact, the burning of fossil fuels makes 96% of the sulphur oxides in the atmosphere. Some industries also make chemicals that make poisonous fumes (smoke)."
Indoor air pollution.
"Air pollution is not only on the outside. Homes, schools, and buildings can also have air pollution. Sometimes the air inside a building is even worse than the air outside. Many things which humans use every day can pollute the air. Compounds inside carpets, paints, building materials and furniture also pollute the air, especially when they are new."
"In buildings where the windows are tightly shut to stop air leaks, the air inside can be polluted more than the air outside."
Acid precipitation.
"Acid precipitation is precipitation, like rain, sleet, or snow, that contains acids from air pollution. When fossil fuels are burned, they let out oxides into the air. When these oxides mix with water in the atmosphere, they make acid, which fall as precipitation. Acid precipitation can kill living things like fish and trees, by making the place where they live too acidic. Acid rain can also damage buildings made of limestone and concrete."
Ozone hole.
"A global concern is the hole in the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The Earth's ozone layer protects life from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, but in the 1970s, scientists found out that some chemicals let out into the atmosphere makes the ozone turn into oxygen. This lets more ultraviolet rays reach the Earth. During the 1980s, scientists found that the ozone layer above the South Pole had thinned by 50 to 98%."
Human health.
"On March 17, 1992, in Mexico City, all children under the age of 14 could not go to school because of air pollution. This does not often happen, but being exposed to air pollution every day can make people have many health problems. Children, elderly (old) people, and people with allergies especially, can have a lot of problems because of air pollution. Studies from the University of Birmingham showed that deaths because of pneumonia and air pollution from motor vehicles like cars are related."
The World Health Organization said that 2.4 million people died because of the direct problems of air pollution. Some of the problems include:
Agricultural effects.
"In India in 2014, it was reported that air pollution had cut crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in 2010 when compared to 1980 levels. There can also be increased yield of crops due to some air quality conditions."
Louis-Antoine de Bougainville
"Louis-Antoine de Bougainville was an admiral and navigator from France. In 1766 he was sent by his government to make a trip around the world, called ""circumnavigation"", which took from 1766 to 1769. He rediscovered (found again) the Solomon Islands in 1768 (the largest island is named for him). He also collected plants and made a trustworthy chart of some parts of the center of the Pacific Ocean. Bougainville saw a part of the Great Barier Reef, but could not find Australia."
Bougainville
Bougainville may refer to:
Gerardus Mercator
"Gerardus Mercator, also called Gerhard Kremer, and born Gérard de Crémère (1512 – 1594), was a Flemish geographer and mathematician from Belgium. He explored Flanders and made globes about the earth and the sky. He became one of the best mapmakers of the 16th century. The Mercator projection that has his name is a flat map projection of the features of the surface of the earth that can be seen and made only mathematically. It was found to be excellent for navigating on oceans and is still used today. In 1585 he began a great atlas that was later finished by his son. His last years he used for studying theology."
Mercator was born in Rupelmonde and died in Duisburg.
Almond cake
"Almond cake is a cake, made of butter, sugar, almond essence, eggs, ground almonds, and flour, with whole almonds for decoration."
Variations.
Some types of almond cake are:
Countries of the United Kingdom
The number of countries that make up the United Kingdom is often the subject of debate. In decreasing order of area they are:
"The United Nations and UK government says that the United Kingdom is officially made up of 2 countries (England and Scotland), one principality (Wales) and one province (Northern Ireland). However, Wales has not formally been a principality since the 16th century with the . In 2011 the International Organization for Standards Wales the status of country to clear ambiguity and avoid further confusion, thus the first statement may be corrected to 3 countries and 1 province."
Nucleophilic aliphatic substitution.
Grignard reagents are nucleophiles in nucleophilic aliphatic substitutions for instance with alkyl halides in a key step in industrial Naproxen production:
Elimination.
"In the Boord olefin synthesis, the addition of magnesium to certain β-haloethers results in an elimination reaction to the alkene. This reaction can limit the utility of Grignard reactions."
Grignard degradation.
"Grignard degradation at one time was a tool in structure identification (elucidation) in which a Grignard RMgBr formed from a heteroaryl bromide HetBr reacts with water to Het-H (bromine replaced by a hydrogen atom) and MgBrOH. This hydrolysis method allows the determination of the number of halogen atoms in an organic compound. In modern usage, Grignard degradation is used in the chemical analysis of certain triacylglycerols."
Industrial use.
An example of the Grignard reaction is a key step in the industrial production of Tamoxifen. (Tamoxifen is currently used for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in women.):
Peach (disambiguation)
Peach can mean:
Giant Magellan Telescope
"The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) will be the world's largest telescope when it is completed in 2025. Instead of one large mirror, the GMT will have seven separate mirrors working together. This will mean its collecting area is bigger than the actual mirror surfaces. It will be made of seven diameter mirror parts. It will have a the resolving power of a mirror. Its collecting area will be the same as a mirror. The telescope will have over four times the ability to gather light than existing telescopes. It will produce images up to ten times clearer than the Hubble Space Telescope. It will cost $700 million."
Planned site.
"The location of the telescope is the Las Campanas Observatory, which is also the site of the Magellan Telescopes, some northeast of La Serena, Chile. This area has clear weather for most of the year. The night sky in most of the surrounding Atacama Desert region is free from atmospheric pollution. With few cities nearby this is probably one of the places least affected by light pollution. All of this makes the area one of the best spots on Earth for long-term astronomical observation."
Design details.
"The telescope is unique because it will use seven mirror sections, each in diameter. These segments will then be arranged to form a single optical surface. This is difficult as the surface of the outer six mirror segments is not radially symmetrical (that is, they are off-axis). This requires a small change in the way mirrors are usually polished. All seven mirrors will be arranged so that the reflecting surface of each of them is on a common axis. One mirror will be in the center and the other six arranged symmetrically around the center. A focal plane will be on-axis with the entire assembly. The plan is to build seven identical off-axis mirrors. The spare mirror has been made to replace a mirror when it needs recoating, a 1–2 week (per segment) process required every 1–2 years."
"The Steward Observatory, at the University of Arizona, is making the mirrors in a laboratory beneath the university's football stadium. It is using a rotating furnace to make the mirror. The casting of the first mirror was completed on November 3, 2005. But the time-consuming shaping and polishing will be completed in the autumn of 2011."
The telescope will make use of adaptive optics.
Member organizations.
The following is a list of the group which is developing the telescope.
"George P. Mitchell, founder of Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp., and The Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation are giving $25 million to help pay for the telescope."
Stinging nettle
"Stinging nettles (""Urtica dioica"") are a type of plant which have stinging defensive hairs on the leaves and stems. Stinging nettles can be found in America, Europe and Asia."
Sting mechanism.
"The hairs inject histamine and other chemicals that produce a stinging sensation when contacted by humans and other animals. Soaking stinging nettles in water or cooking removes the stinging chemicals from the plant, which allows them to be handled and eaten without injury."
Usage.
"The plant has been used as medicine, food, tea and fibre. Nettles are sometimes used in cheesemaking, as nettle soup or as substitute for spinach. Its stems contain a bast fibre that is used for the same purposes as linen. Nettles have been used to make clothing for 2,000 years."
Ecology.
"Stinging nettles are important food plants for several butterflies, like the peacock butterfly and the small tortoiseshell. Also some deers and other animals eat the plant, preferred the leaf shot."
Many of those who accepted evolution were not much interested in biology. They were interested in using the theory to support their own ideas on society.
Racism.
"Some people have tried to use evolution to support racism. People wanting to justify racism claimed that certain groups, such as black people, were inferior. In nature, some animals do ""survive"" better than others, and it does lead to animals better adapted to their circumstances. With humans groups from different parts of the world, all evolution can say is that each group is probably well suited to its original situation. Evolution makes no judgements about better or worse. It does ""not"" say that any human group is superior to any other."
Eugenics.
"The idea of eugenics was rather different. Two things had been noticed as far back as the 18th century. One was the great success of farmers in breeding cattle and crop plants. They did this by selecting which animals or plants would produce the next generation (artificial selection). The other observation was that lower class people had more children than upper-class people. If (and it's a big if) the higher classes were there on ""merit"", then their lack of children was the exact reverse of what should be happening. Faster breeding in the lower classes would lead to the society getting worse."
"The idea to improve the human species by selective breeding is called eugenics. The name was proposed by Francis Galton, a bright scientist who meant to do good. He said that the human stock (gene pool) should be improved by selective breeding policies. This would mean that those who were considered ""good stock"" would receive a reward if they reproduced. However, other people suggested that those considered ""bad stock"" would need to undergo compulsory sterilization, prenatal testing and birth control. The German Nazi government (1933–1945) used eugenics as a cover for their extreme racial policies, with dreadful results."
"The problem with Galton's idea is how to decide which features to select. There are so many different skills people could have, you could not agree who was ""good stock"" and who was ""bad stock"". There was rather more agreement on who should ""not"" be breeding. Several countries passed laws for the compulsory sterilisation of unwelcome groups. Most of these laws were passed between 1900 and 1940. After World War II, disgust at what the Nazis had done squashed any more attempts at eugenics."
Algorithm design.
Some equations can be solved using algorithms that simulate evolution. Evolutionary algorithms work like that.
Social Darwinism.
"Another example of using ideas about evolution to support social action is social Darwinism. Social Darwinism is a term given to the ideas of the 19th century social philosopher Herbert Spencer. Spencer believed the ""survival of the fittest"" could and should be applied to commerce and human societies as a whole."
"Again, some people used these ideas to claim that racism, and ruthless economic policies were justified. Today, most biologists and philosophers say that the theory of evolution should not be applied to social policy."
Controversy.
Some people disagree with the idea of evolution. They disagree with it for a number of reasons. Most often these reasons are influenced by or based on their religious beliefs instead of science. People who do not agree with evolution usually believe in creationism or intelligent design.
"Despite this, evolution is one of the most successful theories in science. People have discovered it to be useful for different kinds of research. None of the other suggestions explain things, such as fossil records, as well. So, for almost all scientists, evolution is not in doubt."

Bedfordshire
"Bedfordshire is a county of England. Its county town is Bedford. It borders Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire (with the Borough of Milton Keynes) and Hertfordshire. The highest elevation point is 243 m (797 ft) on Dunstable Downs in the Chilterns. The county motto is ""Constant Be"", which is taken from the hymn ""To Be A Pilgrim"" by John Bunyan."
SSSIs.
"There are forty Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in Bedfordshire, designated by Natural England. Thirty-five are listed for their biological interest, and five for their geological interest."
"Three of the sites are also National nature reserves, twelve are in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and eleven are managed wholly or partly by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire."
March 20
"March 20 is usually the first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and the first day of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere."
Groups.
"There are a number of Pygmy groups living in Africa. The three best-known groups are the Mbenga, Mbuti, and Twa groups. Each big group includes several tribes that have their own language."
"The Mbenga people, sometimes called the ""Ba-Mbenga"", live in the western Congo basin. The Mbenga include the Aka people, who speak the Aka language. The Aka live in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo. The M-Benzélé people, or ""western Aka"", and the Ba-Sese people, ""eastern Aka"", are also related."
"Other Mbenga pygmies are the Baka people of Cameroon, Gabon, and Republic of Congo. They speak three very similar languages: Baka language, Ganzi language, and Gundi language. Another group of Mbenga pygmies are the Gyele people. The Gyele live in Cameroon and speak Gyele language."
"The Mbuti people, sometimes called the ""Bambuti"", live in the Ituri rainforest in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. They include the Efé people, Asua people, and the Kango people. The Efé speak the Efé language. The Asua speak the Asoa language. The Kango speak the Kango language."
"The Twa people, or ""Ba-Twa"", live in Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda. The Twa speak Kirundi and Kinyarwanda."
Itihasa
"In Sanskrit, Itihasa means history. For Hindus, an Itihasa is a story that tells about what happened in the past in the land of India. Itihasas are usually epic poems. The important itihasas to Hindus are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Modern excavations and archaeological evidences are slowly beginning to find evidences to prove these Indian epics as actual history."
"The original meaning of Itiihaasa had a more precise connotation than the word History. The etymology attested to by Panini indicates itiha to mean ‘thus indeed, in this tradition’ ."
"One of the earliest references to Itihaasa in the literature of antiquity is in Chanakyas’s Arthashastra. Our investigations lead us to believe that the Maurya empire for which he was the preceptor began in 1534 BCE. He defines Itihaasa, in the context of the syllabus prescribed for training of a Prince, with the following words;"
पुराणमितिव्रुत्तमाख्यायिकोदाहरणं धर्मशास्त्रं चेतीतिहासः
"Puraana (the chronicles of the ancients), Itivrtta (history), Akhyayika (tales), Udaaharana (illustrative stories), Dharmashastra (the canon of Righteous conduct), and Arthashastra (the science of Government) are known by (comprise the corpus of Itihaasah, ) History"
"Kautilya’s Arthashastra, Book 1, Chapter 5"
"Thus, History in this definition takes on the meaning more akin to the sense of Historiography and is perhaps even more eclectic and appears to indicate a superset of political science and History as we use them today. We feel vindicated therefore in calling our forthcoming conference a conference on Indian History ( http://www.india-forum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=2088), since we seem to ascribe the same broad meaning that Kautilya did 3 millennia ago."
"The quintessential quote is that of Kalhana in the Rajatarangini,12th century CE (1147 to 1149 CE) who is regarded as a modern in Indian parlance"
धर्मार्थ काममोक्षाणामुपदेश समान्वितं ।
पुरावृत्तं कथायुत्तरूपमितिहासं प्रचक्षते ।।
“Dharmaartha-kaama-moskshanaam upadesa-samanvitam |
"Puraa-vrttam, kathaa-yuttarupam Ithihaasah prachakshate ||”"
"History will be the narration of events as they happened, in the form of a story, which will be an advice to the reader to be followed in life, to gain the purusaarthas namely Kama the satiation of desires through Artha the tool, by following the path of Dharma the human code of conduct to gain Moksha or liberation."
"Clearly there is an emphasis on the traditions and on the utilitarian aspect of History, embedded in the etymology of Itihaasa. The reason we draw emphasis to the ambiguity in the use of the word History is that, in our usage, while we adhere to the broader usage of the word History, it makes for clarity in usage if the Civilizational aspects are distinguished into distinct categories"
Bhakti yoga
"Bhakti yoga is a Hindu spiritual practice. People constantly pray to, and think about, a form of a Hindu god, usually Vishnu."
"Bhakti is a Sanskrit term. It signifies an attitude of devotion to God. The relation between man and God is imagined as a beloved-lover, friend-friend, parent-child, and master-servant. The Bhakta worships his chosen God by any of these mentalities."
The Bhagavata Purana teaches nine primary forms of bhakti. They are:
International Society for Krishna Consciousness
"The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is a newer religious movement based on the original Vedic culture of ancient India. It is also known as 'the Hare Krishna' movement. It was founded in 1966 in New York City by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The organization's core beliefs are based on three scriptures, Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam and the Caitanya-caritamrita."
Hare Krishna
"This is a list of named minor planets in number order. , it has over 23,081 named minor planets."
Waynehead
"Waynehead is a short-lived animated television series, created by Damon Wayans, and produced by Warner Bros. Animation and Canadian studio Nelvana. It aired on both YTV and Kids' WB from 1996 to 1997. It lasted for 13 episodes in a single season."
Kamen Rider 555
"Kamen Rider 555 (officially ""Masked Rider Φ's"", also read ""Kamen Rider Faiz"" or ""Phi's"") is a Japanese tokusatsu television drama. It is the 13th installment in the Kamen Rider Series. It is a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei, and was broadcast on TV Asahi from January 26, 2003, to January 18, 2004. It aired as a part of TV Asahi's 2003 Super Hero Time block, alongside ""Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger""."
Story.
"The Smart Brain corporation, the world's most powerful corporation, is trying to take over the world using Orphnoch, the ""next stage in humanity's evolution"", to covertly kill off the human population. In pursuit of this, they develop three suits of power armor, called Rider Gears (each for Delta, Faiz, and Kaixa), to find and protect the Orphnoch King, who can fix a defect within Orphnoch DNA which causes their genetic structure to break down, leading to death."
"The Rider Gears are stolen by Hanagata, the Goat Orphnoch and former chief of Smart Brain. He sends them to his foster children (dubbed the ""Ryuseiji"", after the school they attended) so they can stop the Orphnoch from achieving their goal. However, Rider Gears were designed to be worn by Orphnoch, and humans are unable to activate the systems without undergoing genetic generation."
"A young loner, Takumi Inui, is unwittingly drawn into the conflict between the Orphnoch and humans and becomes Kamen Rider Faiz to save the life of Mari Sonada, one of the Ryuseiji. Smart Brain begins training him in an attempt to retrieve the Faiz Gear."
"However, there is division amongst the Orphnoch, as those who wish to co-exist with humans rather than kill him, begin resisting the Smart Brain, who in turn targets them as well. Most of these ""renegade"" Orphnochs are either killed, remain neutral or begin siding with the Ryuseiji against the Smart Brain."
"When the Tokyo police discover the Orphnoch are behind a series of bizarre murders, they begin operations to defeat the creatures, largely unaware of the various factions involved. They even begin performing experiments on captured Orphnoch in an attempt to find ways of destroying them, though this does not go well."
"The Orphnoch King eventually awakens within a young boy named Teruo Suzuki, whom Naoya Kaido and Keitaro Kikuchi saved and befriended. Now, it is up to the holders of the Rider Gears to band together and fight for humanity's survival."
Hermann Müller (politician)
"Hermann Müller (18 May 1876 – 20 March 1931; ) was a German Social Democratic politician who was the foreign minister (1919–1920), and twice as the chancellor of Germany (1920, 1928–1930) in the Weimar Republic. He was one of the German signatories of the Treaty of Versailles (28 June 1919)."
Neue Deutsche Biographie
"Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB; ""New German Biography"") is a biographical reference work. The 26 volumes published so far cover more than 22,500 biographies of peoples and families who lived in the German language area."
Batumi
"Batumi (; ) is the second largest city of Georgia and the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara, it is located on the coast of the Black Sea."
Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser
"The Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser was a Full-Size Vehicle, manufactured by Oldsmobile for three generations, from 1971-1992."
Dashcam
"A dashcam, short for ""dashboard camera"" is a video camera inside a car or other road vehicle that records driving and sometimes what's happening inside the car (useful for taxi drivers) they normally suction onto the cars windscreen and are powered from the car, some have an extra camera that can be put in the rear windscreen to record what's happening behind."
"Dashcams are useful because video doesn't lie, it can for instance be used to see who caused a crash, important because some people deliberately crash into innocent peoples cars and blame them for causing the crash, so they can claim it on their insurance, dashcam footage can settle this, it's also important in other accident investigations, even ones that you weren't involved in, they have also recorded meteors and even airplane crashes."
"Early kinds of dashcam were used by police to film their patrols, but ones made for the average joe have become increasingly avalible in the last 10 or so years."
Dashcams are very popular in Russia.
"The term is also used when replying to a communication that contains a number of points, issues or questions to show that the responses are in the same order in which they were raised in the original document: ""To deal with your queries seriatim..."""
In the United States.
"During the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Marshall, 1801 to 1835, the practice of judicial opinions being delivered in seriatim was discontinued."
"In 2009, Title III, Rule 15(a)(1) of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding Amended and Supplemental Pleadings (part of pretrial procedure) was amended to allow three changes in the time previously allowed to make one change."
"This provision will force the pleader to consider carefully and promptly the wisdom of amending to meet the arguments in the motion... and will expedite determination of issues that otherwise might be raised ""seriatim""."
The right to make changes now ends 21 days after service of a motion.
Memorandum opinion
"In law, a memorandum opinion is usually an unpublished legal opinion that cannot be cited as precedent. It is formally defined as: ""[1] unanimous appellate opinion that succinctly states the decision of the court; an opinion that briefly reports the court's conclusion, usu. without elaboration because the decision follows a well-established legal principle or does not relate to any point of law."" There is no elaboration or explanation because the decision either follows a well-known legal principle or it does not relate to a point of law. A memorandum opinion is also not subject to appeal."
"Generally, memorandum opinions follow ordinary rules, including the application of precedent and the rule of ""stare decisis""."
Per curiam decision
"In law, a ""per curiam"" decision (or opinion) is a ruling issued by an appellate court in which the decision rendered is made by the court (or at least, a majority of the court) acting collectively and unanimously. In contrast to regular opinions, a ""per curiam"" does not list the individual judge responsible for authoring the decision, but minority dissenting and concurring decisions are signed."
"""Per curiams"" are not the only type of decision that can reflect the opinion of the court. Other types of decisions can also reflect the opinion of the entire court, such as unanimous decisions, in which the opinion of the court is expressed with an author listed. The Latin term ""per curiam"" literally means ""by the court""."
United States.
Federal.
"The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are usually not ""per curiam"". Their decisions more commonly take the form of one or more opinions signed by individual justices which are then joined in by other justices. Unanimous and signed opinions are not considered ""per curiam"" decisions, as only the court can officially designate opinions as ""per curiam"". ""Per curiam"" decisions tend to be brief in length. The designation is stated at the beginning of the opinion."
"The notable exception to the usual characteristics for a ""per curiam"" decision is the case of ""Bush v. Gore"". Although it was per curiam, there were multiple concurrences and dissents."
State.
"The Supreme Court of California occasionally releases decisions in the name of ""The Court"". But these are not necessarily unanimous. Sometimes an opinion in the name of the Court may be accompanied by extensive concurring and dissenting opinions."
Canada.
"The Supreme Court of Canada also attributes some decisions to ""The Court"" but does not use the phrase ""per curiam"". In the U.S. the term is used primarily for uncontroversial cases. In Canada, however, it has been used for important and controversial cases to emphasize that the entire Court is speaking with a single voice."
Anita Brookner
"Anita Brookner, CBE (16 July 1928 – 10 March 2016) was a British award-winning novelist and art historian. She was Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Cambridge from 1967 to 1968. She was the first woman to hold this visiting professorship. She was awarded the 1984 Man Booker Prize for her novel ""Hotel du Lac""."

"Tamara D. Grigsby (November 19, 1974 – March 15, 2016) was an American social worker. She was a university professor from Wisconsin. She served as a Democratic Party member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 18th Assembly District, from 2005 until 2013."
"Let there be an observer K who describes when events occur with a time coordinate ""t"", and who describes where events occur with spatial coordinates ""x"", ""y"", and ""z""."
"This is mathematically defining the first observer whose ""point of view"" will be our first reference."
"Let us specify that the time of an event is given: by the time that it is observed ""t(observed)"" (say today, at 12 o'clock) minus the time that it took for the observation to reach the observer."
"Now with these definitions in place, let there be another observer K' who is"
"where ""x""' axis is coincident with the ""x"" axis,"
"and with the ""y' ""and ""z' ""axes - ""always being parallel"" to the ""y"" and ""z"" axes."
"This means that when K' gives a location like (3,1,2), the x (which is 3 in this example) is the same place that K, the first observer would be talking about, but the 1 on the y axis or the 2 on the z axis are only ""parallel"" to some location on the K' observer's coordinate system,"
and
The Lorentz Transformations then are &lt;br&gt;
"Define an event to have spacetime coordinates in system ""S"" and in a reference frame moving at a velocity v with respect to that frame, ""S""′. Then the Lorentz transformation specifies that these coordinates are related in the following way:"
"is the Lorentz factor and ""c"" is the speed of light in vacuum, and the velocity ""v"" of ""S""′ is parallel to the ""x""-axis. For simplicity, the ""y"" and ""z"" coordinates are unaffected; only the ""x"" and ""t"" coordinates are transformed. These Lorentz transformations form a one-parameter group of linear mappings, that parameter being called rapidity."
Solving the above four transformation equations for the unprimed coordinates yields the inverse Lorentz transformation:
"Enforcing this ""inverse"" Lorentz transformation to coincide with the Lorentz transformation from the primed to the unprimed system, shows the unprimed frame as moving with the velocity ""v′"" = −""v"", as measured in the primed frame."
"There is nothing special about the ""x""-axis. The transformation can apply to the ""y""- or ""z""-axis, or indeed in any direction, which can be done by directions parallel to the motion (which are warped by the ""γ"" factor) and perpendicular; see the article Lorentz transformation for details."
A quantity invariant under Lorentz transformations is known as a Lorentz scalar.
"Writing the Lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate differences, where one event has coordinates and , another event has coordinates and , and the differences are defined as"
we get
"If we take differentials instead of taking differences, we get"
"Mass, energy and momentum."
"In special relativity, the momentum formula_17 and the total energy formula_18 of an object as a function of its mass formula_19 are"
and
"A frequently made error (also in some books) is to rewrite this equation using a ""relativistic mass"" (in the direction of motion) of formula_22."
"The reason why this is incorrect is that light, for example, has no mass, but has energy. If we use this formula, the photon (particle of light) has a mass, which is according to experiments incorrect."
"In special relativity, an object's mass, total energy and momentum are related by the equation"
"For an object at rest, formula_24 so the above equation simplifies to formula_25. Hence, a massive object at rest still has energy. We call this rest energy and denote it by formula_26:"
History.
"The need for special relativity arose from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, which were published in 1865. It was later found that they call for electromagnetic waves (such as light) to move at a constant speed (i.e., the speed of light)."
"To have James Clerk Maxwell's equations be consistent with both astronomical observations[1] and Newtonian physics,[2] Maxwell proposed in 1877 that light travels through an ether which is everywhere in the universe."
"In 1887, the famous Michelson-Morley experiment tried to detect the ""ether wind"" generated by the movement of the Earth.[3] The persistent null results of this experiment puzzled physicists, and called the ether theory into question."
"In 1895, Lorentz and Fitzgerald noted that the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment could be explained by the ether wind contracting the experiment in the direction of motion of the ether. This effect is called the Lorentz contraction, and (without ether) is a consequence of special relativity."
"In 1899, Lorentz first published the Lorentz equations. Although this was not the first time they had been published, this was the first time that they were used as an explanation of the Michelson-Morley's null result, since the Lorentz contraction is a result of them."
"In 1900, Poincaré gave a famous speech in which he considered the possibility that some ""new physics"" was needed to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment."
Uh-huh.
and the school that I went to there was fantastic.
"It,"
"I, I really consider myself very, very lucky."
"Uh, we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty-seven, thirty kids to to a class."
Yeah.
"But,"
But your teacher had control.
Yeah.
"We zipped right along, you know."
"I, I was, I was doing mathematics, fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade, easily."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I, I  believe I was too."
"Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"But, you're right, you know."
"With all this, don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights, you've also taken  something away from the discipline, I think."
Uh-huh
"Uh, well, it, it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it, my son would be in private school."
Yeah.
We just cannot afford it.
Right.
"I was going to ask you if there, if that was an option."
"Uh, if,"
"Uh, I'm of the age that could have gone, although I didn't"
"and, uh, I guess, uh, looking back on it, I tend to think it was pretty, uh, mostly a mistake."
Uh-huh.
"On the other hand, uh, the more I learn about the history, the more I see it was incremental, uh, decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but on the whole I think it, uh, probably was the wrong thing to do."
How about you?
"I've driven one uh,"
"I drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while, about a month."
"Uh, in a month I think I put, uh, three oil coolers on it."
"Uh, every time I turned around I was having trouble with it."
Uh-huh.
"Everything else I ever owned was American built. Uh, mostly older cars."
"Uh, I've been a mechanic,"
"well, I worked, starting working my father's service station when I was about, uh, twelve."
Uh-huh.
"So, I've been around cars a lot, but, uh, driven a lot of old Pontiacs."
"My first three cars were, uh, seventy model Pontiacs. A G T O and a Bonneville and a station wagon."
I had a couple of Chryslers.
Had a super B for a while with a four forty in it.
Uh-huh.
It was a lot of fun.
"But, uh,"
"Not much gas mileage, though."
"I don't know,"
gas mileage wasn't too bad.
It got about seventeen.
"Oh, wow."
"Well, till you got crazy with it."
"You know, you get the four barrel all worked up"
"and suddenly it, it, it drops off fast,"
"but long as you didn't spin the tires too much or, or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it, it didn't do too bad on gas."
Yeah.
Didn't have to work too hard to move the car around.
"Now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?"
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
definitely.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I do have my radio going most of the day though,"
"so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know."
Okay.
"Do you  get like one of the talk stations, the news stations?"
"But,"
No.
Uh-huh. *listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh'
"I just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock, nine  o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news."
Sure.
Right.
"But as far as the actual news, I get that from like a call from the,"
can you hold on just for a second?
Sure.
Just a minute.
answers the other Hello sir comes back to speaker
Yes.
"Yes,"
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
Okay
"Uh, I was calling from work"
so and that was a call waiting.
Right.
"it sounds like you, uh, like the news a lot more than I do."
"Me, I figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it."
"But, uh, you know, I, the thing is if, if I catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news."
Or that's what  comes on first.
"Yeah,"
That's true too.
"And, uh, you know, also late at night, you know, I don't like watching the news late at night"
but my wife is usually up then
and so  I can't go to sleep with the T V on.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
"Yes,"
yes.
"So,"
Which I think is a good thing.
It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
"It, uh,"
"plus, uh, you know the safety factor and stuff."
"Well, we enjoy having pets."
"We, uh, you know, I think they're a lot of company,"
"and, and when my mother lived with us, uh, the cat was really hers"
"and, and he was kind of wild."
"Our, our daughter found her and brought her to us,"
"and, uh, that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap."
Oh.
"And she was the only one at first that, you know, could really hold him, you know, because he was really skittish."
"But it was like he knew you know,"
uh-huh.
"and he would sleep with her,"
"and so he was a lot of company to her. You know, and, and just love her."
Yeah.
"And he's, cats are usually so independent"
"but this one you know, he comes up"
"and he crawls up next to my husband now, you know."
"He's,"
"you know, before the dog died, we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side,"
"and the cat would sleep on my husband's side, you know"
And when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row
My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us.
Uh-huh.
"and that's the other issue. Uh,"
the pitch and ...
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well and thread,"
"Uh, I don't go to the movies a whole lot,"
"but, uh, I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES, which turned out to be an extremely good movie."
I haven't seen that yet.
"I, I, I hear,"
"we, a whole bunch of us were going to go see it."
"It's playing at school actually in about two weeks, I guess."
So we're going to go see that.
But you enjoyed that?
"Yeah,"
"it's, it's something that, uh,"
"my brother lives over in Fort Worth,"
"and I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago,"
"and he said, Well I'll wait until it comes out on, uh, tape and rent, rent the video."
"And I said, no,"
this is not one that you want to do that with.
"That's what I heard,"
yeah.
"It's, uh, the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen."
"It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing,"
"it's just, uh, just amazing, amazing picture."
"Yeah,"
"I've heard it, it, it's not one for the videos."
"No,"
"it's one I think,"
"but, you know, every now and then you find one that you say, yeah,"
this is my favorite movie.
"Well, this is the one for me this time."
"Uh, I have a son that is in the fourth grade"
Huh.
"and, uh, they have just now taken up division."
Wow.
Yeah
And
That is slow.
"uh,"
my husband and I go to the store
"and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication, division things"
"and I feel like, uh, there are several areas that we're just really, really slow in."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system."
"It is,"
What do you think's wrong to cause that?
"Well, well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system."
"And the money they do have, they're not, they do not use it wisely."
Yeah.
"Uh, she, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students."
Uh-huh.
And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal  with on an every day basis. Uh
Yeah.
Perhaps.
"but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children."
Yeah.
"And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It  it, you know, it can, it can really be bad."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's one thing I worry about ."
"Uh, also I think, we have a lot of, uh, Hispanics"
"There you go,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
It's got some pretty strong competitors.
"Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base,"
"so, I, I think by now, it's a matter of, uh, personal taste."
"Yeah,"
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.
I can understand that very easily.
"I've used, I've had a class on, um, R Base and also in Paradox"
Uh-huh.
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base.
Uh-huh.
Do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?
"Um, I wouldn't say compatible, but certainly comparable."
"But, uh"
"yeah,"
"I didn't mean compatible,"
I meant comparable.
My brain is going to mush.
Uh-huh.
And what do you work on at T I?
I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I do, uh, mainly business data processing."
Uh-huh.
I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility.
Uh-huh.
"Um, sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem,"
"and that gives me the opportunity to, uh, come in to work and fix it, if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone."
Right.
"Um, I also, uh, handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected,"
"I'm, I'm fairly newly married."
I've only been married less than two years
Uh-huh.
"and before that, I never owned a home or anything,"
so I never had any deductions.
"Right,"
right.
"So, really, it was always just money thrown away."
Thrown away.
"Yeah,"
jeez.
"And I never really thought about it because,"
You were good at it
"Yeah,"
"I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um, became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I suspect that, you know, thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and, you know, the amount that I know they buy, I guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation, and, you know, just don't talk about it."
Yeah.
"Most, most people don't like to talk about money."
"They feel uncomfortable, I think."
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
"You know, for a lot of people it is very personal."
very personal.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"and especially if you, if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be,"
Yeah.
"But I think the, the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt. Not, not including like a mortgage."
"A mortgage is an understandable debt because that's, you have, you have to have a roof over your head."
Uh-huh.
"or I did, have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news."
"I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors,"
Yeah.
and you feel comfortable with them
"and,"
"It is interesting though,"
it becomes a little of personality.
"In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago"
Uh-huh.
"and, and shortly after I got, we got here fourteen years ago"
"and, uh, they had, they had fired him, uh, because he was too"
"anyway, didn't, he didn't have the personality, and wasn't drawing the crowds"
Uh-huh.
and that's interesting.
"That's, that's what the T V stations do."
they're trying to get ratings.
That's true.
"And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings."
Their job.
That's true.
So that really effects how they report the news.
"Well, it's like the, the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a, sometimes a little too cutesy"
"but, I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes."
"Is he the sports,"
"Have you talked, have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes?"
"Yeah,"
"I guess it is time to close now, so I can run go help put the kids to bed."
"Okay,"
well good talking to you.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
Bye-bye.
uh-huh.
and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole.
Uh-huh.
"But I think this, they way the whole economy is going right now, it's just not good to be in debt."
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"that, I would, that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that I was, you know, juggling payments to different people I guess because I never experienced it."
Uh-huh.
"And it's not, because you know, I'm rich or anything,"
"it's just, a mental concept that I have. Yeah,"
Yeah.
that I just.
"Well, when you, when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle, and if you really get into the mind set, I got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul,"
"and it was scary, because I was so good at it."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And I thought, this is not right."
"I mean, this has got to stop, because eventually it'd end up catching up at, catching up with me"
and it hit me in the face.
"Right,"
right.
Um.
"But it sounds like, you know, you, you learned from it"
and you're coming out of it all right.
"I, yeah,"
"I have,"
I've learned a lot from it.
Uh-huh.
"I've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand and my husband's too, because he's, he's the same way I am."
"Uh-huh,"
It's a great idea.
"Hell, I'd love to cut ours in half,"
"but, uh"
Uh-huh.
man.
"And if you figure, get with a financial person."
Yeah.
"And you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan, if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment it'll make, uh,"
Uh-huh.
it has a magic with numbers.
"It, I, it'll shave almost, you know, X number of dollars off,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
we we've become aware of that.
"We have a, there's a loan officer through our church, too, that I think could help us better."
"You know, he does that full time with the bank, you know."
Uh-huh.
"And so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know, that, you know, we know are people of integrity."
So.
Sure.
"You know, that is another thing that, you know,"
we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time
"we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving, you know,"
"we're going to go to somebody that we know,"
"we're going to take someone with us older,"
and we didn't do any of those things.
Somebody you trust.
"You know, there are so many rip-off artists here in this town."
"It's, it's, uh, it's really a sin,"
it really is.
Yeah.
I got taken on some on firewood.
"Uh, what, uh, possessed you to get the dog?"
"Well, I guess, in one sense we felt that, it, it's nice to have a dog even though there are, you know, complications come with it."
Yeah.
"And then with our children, uh,"
"at the time they were, oh, grade five and, and grade eight,"
"so it was an age where it was, uh, we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with, with having a pet."
Uh-huh.
Sure.
"Uh,"
"Sure learn a bit, learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
That's good.
That kind of builds some character a little bit.
"So ,"
"Well, that's the idea."
"I think the reality of it is, that they perhaps,"
"uh, it depends on the, on everyone's discipline."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't, uh, enforce that the kids look after the dog"
"and, uh, we've had him about four years now."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, but I think it does, it, it, you know,"
"it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly, uh,"
"Yeah,"
that's something that's important for sure.
Yeah.
"I think, uh, do you live in a, in a, in a fairly rural part of the, uh"
"Uh,"
"or,"
"Actually no,"
"we live in a, in an area that's, oh, probably about two and a half miles from the university."
yes.
Oh
And I don't know that's true or not.
"I mean, I just heard it in passing,"
"but so what does that,"
Right.
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
"And how is it really transmitted, et cetera."
Yeah.
"Which is, I think, what they also don't know."
"I mean that's,"
"I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know."
Uh-huh.
"It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,"
"but, but that isn't how it was in Africa."
No.
"In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that,"
and it's huge over there.
"So I, I, you know,"
"and it's beginning, other countries"
that's what's his point.
"This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this."
Uh-huh.
"And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?"
Oh.
I mean I don't know.
All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.
"Uh, or maybe they understand but,"
I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, and then the people that have it,"
"it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back."
"and then it had the two swivels in the middle, and then the two swivel chairs on the front"
All right.
"and, I mean it was fantastic,"
Uh-huh.
"and it got good gas mileage,"
but I don't know
"I don't really, I don't,"
"I want something I can drive too, you know,"
"Well well, the mini, that,"
and I was scared to drive that big van.
"you'd be surprised if, if you drive a, one of the, the mini vans, uh,"
"more or less alike the, the, uh, Chevrolet"
"and, uh, well of course, Oldsmobile has got one,"
"and Chryslers got one,"
but they drive remarkably like cars.
"Well, do you, does yours have that this one had it where you know, you would see something coming in the rear view mirror, I mean not the rear, those little side mirror things"
Yeah.
and it would look like it was further back than it was.
Yeah
"but, the little, thing etched in it,"
"say objects are, are closer than they appear or something"
"Yeah,"
does yours do that too?
Yeah.
"Oh. I was wondering if all vans did that,"
"Well you, you can, you can, uh, install those mirrors,"
"we've got the big side mirrors, which are really nice."
"I don't know if you've, well, if you've driven a pick up truck, you know,"
"these are, these, uh, mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high,"
Uh-huh.
"and they're really nice, uh,"
"got them on both sides,"
"And people who do have them, curse."
Right.
"Another thing I have that, um, is weird is the, a locus tree in the back yard."
"As a matter of fact there's three of them, very badly trimmed,"
they aren't trimmed at all.
Uh-huh.
"And I can imagine if I had to mow the lawn in the back, which we said we'd do, if the trees hang down"
"so, and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it."
"Yeah,"
"they're like,"
"I think I've seen those before,"
but I don't remember what they look like.
"They're a pretty tree,"
"but you just, when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns."
"So we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead,"
"So it'll give you room to get under it,"
"sure,"
"Yeah,"
"because I can just see brushing up against it, that it would rip your skin."
Yeah.
It's worse than a rose bush.
Um.
"Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree."
"Oh, a tree is always something very nice to have."
"Yeah,"
"my dad used to work on them,"
so I don't think I'll have a problem.
My husband will have problems borrowing one.
"then you got to get him to,"
"if he's going to do it, you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it."
"Well, if that's not the problem ..."
"Okay,"
and they're pieces of junk.
I know.
"Still at it, hey."
"Yeah,"
"that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one."
Wow.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
"maybe they're getting better,"
"maybe they're starting to get a clue. Uh,"
"Well, they got a three year lead time."
It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so
"Yeah,"
that's just it.
"Technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road."
"But, uh,"
The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time."
"And can you think of any other industry where in software they,"
"Uh,"
"if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail ."
Yeah.
"Or, uh, maybe I say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade."
Yeah.
"It,"
"uh, they keep up with it pretty quickly"
"and that's, that's a real good thing, I guess."
Yeah.
"Uh, I don't know."
"And the hardware, well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity"
and the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along.
"With,"
"I don't know,"
cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue
"but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're negligent"
and they get happy about money
and they just want to sue you.
Yeah.
"Well, yeah."
"That's,"
"yeah,"
exactly.
"When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah."
"And that's just, you know,"
you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time
That's impossible.

I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare
and she takes her little girl with her
"and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire"
and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state
"And that's the people that are working there, you know."
"And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know."
"Oh, that's horrible."
"Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper."
Huh.
"You know, just awful things."
And so I don't know.
I don't have kids
but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.
"I mean, you just don't know."
"I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,"
"but not,"
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts
"and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches."
Um
"At this time of the year,"
and we've been in a drought for the last five years
and this is the sixth year
"and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer."
"Yeah,"
"well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas."
Right.
"But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,"
but we have our share of cold weather as well.
"The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing."
"It didn't stay there,"
"but it was right at,"
"Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?"
Um.
"We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,"
but this year it wasn't bad at all.
I guess that's because we had so much rain.
I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.
"He said it was just,"
"and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I flooded out,"
"Oh, yeah."
"and, uh,"
"Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston"
"and they, uh, the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,"
"and that, uh, caused some, uh, concern, of course."
"Oh, boy."
"They have a, uh, lake cabin"
"I really would like to have something like that,"
"and I'm hoping that by you know,"
"that's like, right now,"
my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now.
"But I keep saying lets put it off, lets put it off, because I'm hoping they'll get so many better features."
"Yeah,"
like what?
"Well, just like that air bag."
I think that thing is fantastic.
"Because I've seen some of the, you know, like the head on collision type things, when they had it and people walk away from it."
Yeah.
"We had one here,"
"I guess it was about three weeks ago,"
"and the people walked away from the, wreck, with no scratches nothing. You know, a few bruises."
That's .
"did you see the, uh,"
"I don't know if it was TWENTY-TWENTY, last Thursday or Friday night on, on seat belts?"
Uh-huh.
Did that scare you a little bit? With the lady being thrown out and run over.
Uh-huh.
You got it.
"I, I, tell you what,"
"I would not, I would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door."
that really
"I, I guess, I,"
"that, that a little more than scared me,"
"that irritated me, uh,"
"that,"
"because it, it, it surely didn't come as a surprise that, that if the door came open the lady would fall out,"
"I mean, and,"
"Well, you know what the average person,"
would you ever have thought of that?
"we can't do that,"
we just can't do that.
And I'm going well how about this way?
"I, I want to do that,"
that was the plan here
Right.
So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.
A cradle for it.
"Yeah,"
so you can steady it
"and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?"
"Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw"
"but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that"
"Right,"
right.
and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.
"I said I'm not that steady,"
it's not going to happen.
Yeah.
So we built a cradle for it
"and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,"
by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
Right.
"So,"
Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?
"Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth."
You know
"Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log"
"and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"if you're looking at adding on you have,"
"Up here in Rochester, uh, we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution."
I'd like to see child care paid for or on-site child care sometime.
"I think that would be a ,"
Huh-uh.
and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of.
They could go visit them during the day.
What?
Yeah
"that's uh, something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children."
"But, I can see how it would be a a real benefit."
Yes
I do.
"Well, we keep a shelter, also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too."
"You know, go on and pay a lump sum"
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay.
"But if you paid in more than you actually used, and the same thing for insurance, what you predict your going to be paying for insurance, as long as you pay, actually pay out that amount of money, you're okay."
"But if you pay out less, then you lose that money."
Um.
"I don't like that part,"
but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.
"Well, that could be, I could see where that would be important."
"And then we got that cafeteria plan,"
do you have that?
No.
No.
I don't know what it's about .
"You can, uh,"
"well you,"
"let's see, it, it shelters you're money that you pay for, for insurance."
It takes it out of your salary before taxes.
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah,"
yeah
"I think the cars are where, where it's at right now as far as pollution goes, air pollution I mean."
Yeah.
"I, you know, Florida doesn't seem to be, at least maybe Miami,"
"but I, I, uh, you know,"
"Fort Lauderdale I, I don't know what the big industries are down there, uh,"
"but, you know, up here we have Kodak"
Right.
and that's the worst polluter.
"They put, uh, uh,"
you can smell ether in the air sometimes
It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.
I guess so.
"Uh, cause they clean the, uh, the lenses for cameras"
"and they, they make film here"
and they're the worst offender
"but it's, you know, it's under so much control."
"You know, sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them"
but that's really getting under control now.
Right.
"I, you know, I don't know in air what they do."
"Uh, I, I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've, I've really seen a lot of, you know, about."
"Uh, I, I know I've seen like, uh,"
"my grandparents live in Corpus Christi, Texas"
"and I know they've, there's a lot of refineries down there"
"and that, that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air."
"I, but I don't know how, uh, you know,"
"there's a difference in what you can smell and what you, uh, you know, what's bad."
"Be interesting to see when, as Mexico develops industrially whether, you know, without,"
"or,"
"Uh, we've got a house,"
"let's see,"
we moved in about four years ago
"and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,"
but it had existed for three years.
Okay.
"This is a whole block of homes that, uh, a builder built all of them"
"and, I guess he, he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal"
So the whole block was all foreclosed.
Oh.
"And, so, some were vacant for quite a while before they, you know, they finally sold them because there were so many."
"Well, your, was your house in good shape,"
was it damaged?
"Yes,"
"no,"
the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open
"Oh, it was?"
"But,"
yeah.
Oh.
"So we just, you know, we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that."
I see.
"And, uh, we're really, we haven't had any problems"
"and, you know, we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything."
But the prices are much lower here
"and this was definitely not a fix up special,"
"but I'll tell you,"
it takes all my time
"Between, we put in our own sprinkler system"
"and I just finished repainting the exterior and, you know, making drapes and buying furniture,"
it's just a money pit. Really is.
Yes.
"Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,"
"the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain, the Rockies"
Yes.
and they're towering above you
and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again.
"Yeah,"
"we're kind of used to that here in Utah,"
"course, there are mountains,"
and I fly into Montana a lot
"and we have a,"
"the mountains are, are really, uh, high"
"and a lot of places we go in to, you just kind of, uh,"
"it's in the little valley,"
"but, I, uh, sure hope we,"
we really need the moisture.
"I hope we can get, uh, get some."
"There's supposed to be a storm,"
"but it split, went down through, uh, northern Arizona and southern Utah"
"and they're not predicting any for the next, uh, week anyway up here"
"so,"
"Well, I noticed on the weather map on, uh, cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way,"
"but I guess it didn't pan out, huh?"

"Construction of the Air Station was undertaken in 1936 with funds provided by the Federal Public Works Administration. The M.H. Golden Co. was the contractor. The area had to be dredged from the bay and filled and brought up to grade level. Long piles were driven in the soil at the building sites for stabilization. The contract called for one hangar with lean-to, a mess hall, a barracks building, two aprons, a runway to the field, and a small wooden seaplane ramp. During and prior to this time a Coast Guard Air Detachment was maintained on Lindbergh Field in one-half of a commercial hangar. This detachment was led by Elmer F. Stone after May 21, 1935. Stone is one of Coast Guard Aviation's most colorful figures."
"In April 1937, the Air Station was commissioned. The first commanding officer was LT S.C. Linholm, who later became Commander of Eleventh Coast Guard District. There had, however, been an Air Patrol Detachment active in San Diego between 1934 and 1937. At the time this was the only Coast Guard air base in California."
"Coast Guard Air Station San Diego saw no radical changes as a result of the declaration of war in 1941. The unit continued to watch and report the activities of fishing boats in the area, to provide assistance in cases of distress, and to provide transportation by air for other government departments. Air Sea Rescue operations were given primary focus from October 1943 on. Between January 1 and December 1, 1944, a total of 124 aircraft went down in waters covered by this unit. Of the 201 pilots and crewmen involved, 137 were saved, 59 were killed outright by mid-air collisions or impact with the water, two are missing, and three who might have been saved were lost because of improper equipment or the failure to locate them promptly."
"In June 1972 a major rebuilding plan was proposed. On January 26, 1983, a ceremony was held signaling the completion of the project."
"In April 1997, the Port of San Diego began a master plan for San Diego International Airport. The goal of the plan is to provide incremental, cost-effective improvements to SDIA to meet the region's near-term demand for air service while a long-term regional air transportation strategy is developed in collaboration with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and other transportation agencies."

"Constantine ""Gene"" Mako ( ; January 24, 1916 – June 14, 2013) was an American tennis player and art gallery owner. He was born in Budapest, capital of Hungary. He won four Grand Slam doubles titles in the 1930s. Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1973."
"His father, Bartholomew Mako (), graduated from the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts in 1914. He started to work as a draftsman for his mentor Viktor Madarász. He was an avid soccer player himself. He fought in World War I. After the war, he left Hungary with his wife, Georgina Elizabeth Farkas Mako () and only son, traveling first to Italy, then stopping for three years in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before settling in Los Angeles, California. There he created works for public places like churches, libraries and post offices. Gene attended to the Glendale High School and the University of Southern California although he was offered a Hungarian University Scholarship in the meantime. He quit before graduation."
"In 1934 he won the NCAA championships in singles and the doubles (with Phillip Caslin) while playing for the University of Southern California where he lettered at USC for three years (1934-36-37). He also won the boys' singles event at the U.S. National Championships in 1932 and 1934 and the boys' doubles in 1932, 1933 and 1934."
"Mako was especially successful as a doubles player with his partner and friend Don Budge. They competed in seven Grand Slam finals, four of which they won."
"In 1936 Gene Mako and Alice Marble won the finals at the US Mixed Doubles Championships against Sarah Palfrey and Don Budge (6:3 and 6:2). They won the Newport Casino Invitational Tournament three consecutive times, from 1936 to 1938."
"From 1935 to 1938 Mako was a member of the United States Davis Cup team and played in eight ties. The US team won the Davis Cup in 1937, defeating the United Kingdom in the final at Wimbledon, and again in 1938 in the final against Australia at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia. As a Davis Cup player he compiled a record of six wins and three losses."
"Mako was in the U.S. Top Ten in 1937 and 1938 (reaching as high as No. 3), and was ranked World No. 8 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph in 1938. That year he reached the U.S. final at Forest Hills versus his double partner, Don Budge, who was in pursuit of the first Grand Slam. Unseeded, Mako reached his only major singles final on victories over sixth-seed Frank Kovacs and the third and first foreign seeds, Franjo Punčec and John Bromwich."
"In 1939 he was suspended and banned from playing for breaching the amateur rules. He and Don Budge allegedly accepted a sum of 20A£ for an exhibition match in Australia, which was against amateurism. Afterwards he continued to play tennis at that time during the Second World War while serving in the Navy. He also played professional basketball while stationed in Norfolk, Virginia."
In 1973 Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 1999 he was elected to the University of Southern California (USC) Athletic Hall of Fame.
"He possessed strong serve and powerful smashes but due to several injuries in his career, he had to give up his power game. He preferred a volleying style, which he perfected with quickness, good angle selection and pacing paired with strategy."
"Apart from being a sportsman, Mako composed music in his early 20s. He's the author of two songs, namely ""Lovely as Spring"" and ""What Did You Dream Last Night?"". He also starred in the 1938 musical ""Happy Landing"" and the 1941 war comedy ""Caught in the Draft"", although he remained uncredited in both movies. Mako married actress Laura Mae Church in Manhattan in 1941. A month later, World War II broke out, and he joined the United States Navy. After this, he worked in a broadcasting studio. After his retirement, he designed tennis courts. His wife worked as an interior designer. He was involved in wrestling and was hired as a coach at the California Institute of Technology while also coaching the basketball team. He owned Gene Mako Galleries in Los Angeles, California. He also published a book about his father titled ""Bartholomew Mako: A Hungarian Master, 1890-1970"". In the final decade of his life, he taught art to up-and-coming artists. He died in 2013 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, aged 97, of pneumonia."

"Alexander Pushkin used his great-grandfather Abram Gannibal as the model for Ibrahim, the lead character in his unfinished novel ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". After leaving school in 1817, Pushkin met Abram's last surviving son, Peter. He met Peter again in 1825, after writing in his diary about wanting to ""get from him some memoirs about my great-grandfather."" He seemed to use his own experiences, along with Gannibal's to create the plot for ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". A stage version of the work was written by Carlyle Brown and premiered at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival's 13th Southern Writers' Project in March 2001."
"Abram Gannibal is a protagonist of the Soviet comedy movie ""How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor"", although the film's plot has almost nothing to do with Gannibal's real biography. The film is partly based on Pushkin's ""Moor of Peter the Great""."
"There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the Battle of Lesnaya by Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger. The young boy present in Martin’s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy’s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal’s possible connection to the artist while in France. A portrait by Adriaan Schoonebeeck is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck’s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal. Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate."
"In the Lesnaya painting, the young boy is dressed in traditional slave attire, which Gannibal did not wear due to his status under Peter the Great."

"Au Wai Lun (, born 14 August 1971 in Hong Kong) is a retired Hong Kong professional football player. He announced his retirement after being unable to get a contract renewal with South China in Hong Kong First Division League after the 2006–07 season. He was considered to be one of the best strikers in Hong Kong."
"Au made his debut in Hong Kong First Division League for Tin Tin on 20 December 1988, against Happy Valley. He was 17 years old at the time and the final result of the match 0–2."
"Au was the leading goal scorer of the Hong Kong team, but retired from international football after an exhibition match with Manchester United on 23 July 2005."
"On the pitch, Au was recognised easily by his hairstyle – he sports peroxide-blond streaks in his locks. He wore the number 7 jersey for South China and was the captain of the team."
"He is also remembered by his famous ""cross passing during 1-on-1"" in the final of 2002 Carlsberg Cup against Honduras. In the match, he received a pass from his teammate, and got a goal opportunity. However, he passed the ball back and did not shoot. Further jokes on this were developed after this incident."
"Being a veteran striker, Au is valued for his international experience and his strong aerial ability. The 6' tall striker remains one of the best headers in the League."
"In the 2005–06 season, his good performance throughout the season could not prevent South China from finishing 7th in the league, with 2 points below the relegation line. He scored 8 league goals that season (4th among all players, 1st among Hong Kong players). Two years after retiring, he chose to return and play for Eastern, one of his former clubs."
"In the summer of 2007, after being offered a new contract with a salary cut by South China, he decided to retire. He claimed that the entire squad received new contracts with increments, but he was the only one with a salary cut. He thought the club was being unfair to him, who contributed for many years, even when the team performed so poor for several seasons."
"After his retirement announcement, he was approached by Star Publishing and with the help of a professional writer, published his biography titled, ""Lun . Football Biography"" (倫．球傳)."

It has been historically referred to as both Little Cacapehon and Little Capecaphon. The name is pronounced or ."
"The Little Cacapon is formed at the confluence of two small streams, the North Fork Little Cacapon and the South Fork Little Cacapon, shortly after they both pass north under the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) at Frenchburg. From Frenchburg, the Little Cacapon flows north between Town Hill, high, to its west and Little Cacapon Mountain, high, to its east. Flowing from a hollow in Town Hill, Shawan Run feeds into the Little Cacapon at Barnes Mill. Two miles (3 km) north, Three Churches Run also feeds into the river from Town Hill. At Higginsville on Slanesville Pike (County Route 3) near the old Vinita School, the river is fed by Crooked Run at Queens Ridge ( high). From Higginsville, the Little Cacapon continues northeast along Town Hill with Noland Ridge bounding it to the east. Also in the vicinity of Higginsville, Little Cacapon-Levels Road (County Route 3/3) intersects with Slanesville Pike, and as its name suggests, the road follows the Little Cacapon north until it diverges northwest to Levels via Hoffman Hollow. It is within this stretch of the stream that the Little Cacapon meanders by the community of Creekvale. At the entrance of Neals Run, the Little Cacapon is met to its east by Spring Gap Mountain and then flows beneath the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and empties into the Potomac River."
"The North Fork is a tributary of the Little Cacapon. The North Fork's source lies in a hollow between Piney Mountain and the southwestern end of Stony Mountain. From its source, the North Fork flows northeast along Grassy Lick Road (County Route 10). South Branch Mountain ( high) joins the North Fork to its west, and along with Stony Mountain to its east, the river diverges from Grassy Lick Road and continues its northeastern route to Shanks where it meets US Route 50. From Shanks, the North Fork merges with Camp Run and flows east under US Route 50 at Frenchburg, where it merges with the South Fork to create the Little Cacapon River."
"The South Fork is an tributary of the Little Cacapon. The South Fork is formed at its headwater in a hollow towards the southeastern end of Stony Mountain along South Fork of Little Cacapon Road (County Route 12) between the communities of Kirby and Ruckman. From its source, the South Fork flows northeast toward Bell Hollow, where it meets US Route 50 and turns north through Frye's Flat towards Frenchburg. The South Fork continues north under US Route 50, where it immediately joins with the North Fork to form the Little Cacapon River alongside Little Cacapon River Road (County Route 50/9)."

"During World War II, the plant was fully occupied building 0-4-0 and 0-6-0 saddle tanks for industrial use, although they did manufacture four PC class 4-6-2s for the Iraqi State Railways in 1940 (one of which was lost at sea ""en route""). In 1943, ninety Austerity 0-6-0ST locomotives were built for the War Department."
"In 1944, the Vulcan Foundry, which had been formed by Robert Stephenson and Charles Tayleur in 1830, acquired a substantial stock holding, and they became part of the English Electric Company. The bulk of the output was for export or industrial use, including fifty South African Class 19D 4-8-2s, Indian YB, YL and WM classes, and ten M class 4-6-2s for the Tasmanian Government Railways. Domestic mainline locomotives included thirty five Class L1 2-6-4T for the Eastern Region of British Railways and 100 9400 class 0-6-0 pannier tanks for the Western Region."
"The last steam locomotives to be built were a conventional 0-6-0T in 1958 and a six-coupled fireless locomotive in 1959. The Forth Street works were closed in 1960 and the Darlington Works, continuing with diesel and electric locomotives became ""English Electric Company Darlington Works"" in 1962."
"The office block and one workshop of Stephenson's Forth Street Works in South St Newcastle upon Tyne have been restored by The Robert Stephenson Trust. The Trust lost its lease to these buildings in February 2009 following purchase of the whole Robert Stephenson & Co and Hawthorn Leslie locomotive works sites for redevelopment as the ""Stephenson Quarter"". The restored block and several other buildings are protected by Listed Building status but future public access is uncertain."

In 1942–43, he played his maiden match in the Ranji Trophy, scoring 13 and 27 runs in his two innings. His highest score in first-class cricket was 142, against Worcestershire in 1954. Domestically, Alim-ud-Din represented Sindh, Rajasthan, Karachi, Bahawalpur and Gujarat, and became the first Pakistani batsman to face a ball bowled by an international bowler on Pakistani soil, in a match between the Sindh and West Indians in 1948. During Pakistan's 1954 tour of England, Alim-ud-Din scored more than 700 runs, including two centuries in the first two matches. He was most successful during 1961–62, scoring 1,020 runs in 12 matches at an average of 51.00. In the same season he captained Karachi, leading the team to victories in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and Ayub Zonal Trophy. His final season in first-class cricket was 1967–68."
"Alim-ud-Din played 25 Test matches for Pakistan during his career and scored 1,091 runs in international cricket at the average of 25.37. He made two centuries and seven fifties.

"Alim-ud-Din started his international career against England in June 1954, at the Lord's Cricket Ground, in a match in which he scored 19 runs. In the fourth Test of the same series Pakistan beat England by 24 runs, recording their first Test win over them to become the first team to defeat England during their maiden tour. Alim-ud-Din managed to score 10 runs in the match. In 1954–55, he played, against India, in Pakistan's first home Tests, finishing the series as the leading run scorer with 332; he made three fifties and in the fifth match scored 103 not out at the National Stadium, Karachi, his first international century. He was the first batsman ever to make an international century on the Ground."
"Alim-ud-Din also toured West Indies as a part of Pakistan cricket team in 1957–58. He was not successful in the series and his highest score remained 41 runs which he made in the fourth Test at the Bourda, Georgetown, Guyana. In 1962, under the captaincy of Javed Burki, Pakistan visited England where they played a five Test match series. In the fifth Test at Headingley, a low scoring match for Pakistan, Alim-ud-Din's scores of 50 and 60 made him the team's highest scorer of the match. In the fifth Test of the home series against England in 1962, he scored his career best 109 runs at the National Stadium. He played his last match against England in Trent Bridge, Nottingham in 1962."
Former West Indian all-rounder Collie Smith was his only wicket in international cricket.
"He is variously known as ""Alim-ud-Din"" and ""Alimuddin"", with ""Wisden"" using the former in earlier editions and the latter in his obituary."
"Alim-ud-Din was born in Ajmer, a city in British India, on 15 December 1930. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, he moved to Karachi along with his family. He lived in London and never married, instead providing for his family. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had given him an opportunity to work at London Heathrow Airport. Two of his brothers, Salimuddin and Azimuddin, both also played first-class cricket. His nephew, James Uddin, the son of Salimuddin, is also a cricketer and currently plays semi-professional cricket in England."
"In later life, his pension was suspended after doubts over his actual birth date. The pension was restored after intervention from the Pakistani President."
"On 12 July 2012, Alim-ud-Din died in Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, London. He suffered from heart and lung diseases. He also had kidney failure and was on dialysis. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) released a press statement expressing sorrow and conveying condolences to Alim-ud-Din's family."

Shujauddin Butt (10 April 1930 – 7 February 2006) was a Pakistani army officer and cricketer who played in 19 Tests from 1954 to 1962.
"He served in the Pakistan Army for 26 years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 1978. In 1955 he toured India with the Pakistan national team."
"1990 also saw the first international tournament—""RugbyFest"" held in Christchurch, New Zealand. As well as a variety of club sides, including teams from Japan (but not the Japanese national team), were four ""national"" teams—USA, New Zealand, USSR, and the Netherlands—who played a round-robin tournament. The winner was New Zealand, who then played—and beat—a combined ""World XV""."
"""Rugbyfest 1990"" pointed the way to the next big leap forward—the first women's rugby world cup, which took place in Wales the following year. Timed to coincide with the second men's world cup being held in England it did not meet with official approval from World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Football Board), a decision which threatened the competition and was a factor in the New Zealand RFU not supporting their entry. However, this did not stop the New Zealanders from taking part—nor Wales, the United States, England, France, Canada, Sweden, USSR, Japan, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands."
"The competition was run on a shoestring. Russian players sold souvenirs before and during matches to raise funds to cover their expenses, while four England administrators re-mortgaged their houses to cover the expenses of attending the competition. But after fifteen matches the first world champions were crowned—the United States, who beat England in the final. Despite the lack of support from the men's game, and very little media coverage, the competition had been a success, and the women's game continued to grow."
"In 1994 a second world cup was awarded to the Netherlands, but constant prevarication by the IRFB about whether they would (or would not) give the tournament official status caused huge problems for the hosts. Without IRFB support there was a fear that many unions would not send teams which would threaten the tournament (and even the Dutch union's) viability. In fact the IRFB went so far as to threaten sanctions against any unions did take part—thus ensuring that New Zealand, Sweden and Germany withdrew. Faced with this the risk of major losses was as too great and the Dutch withdrew both as hosts and participants with barely weeks to go."
"It was Scotland who stepped in to save the event with only 90 days to organise it. The second world cup was in the end a purely northern hemisphere affair with 11 remaining teams (consisting of the four home nations, France, the United States, Japan, Sweden, Russia, Canada and Kazakhstan) joined by a Scottish Students XV. The final was a repeat of 1991, but with this time England overcoming the United States 38–23, the final being played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. Despite everything, the tournament had been a success, and the game continued to grow."
In 1996 the IRFB established a Women's Advisory Committee which produced a five-year development plan for the game. One of its main targets was a 100% increase in player numbers by 2001. Elsewhere in the world...
"Widespread acceptance of the game led to women's versions of other major rugby union tournaments (the women's Five Nations begins in 1999), and growing numbers of headlines. In 2000 the Irish WRFU affiliated fully with the IRFU—but there were still set-backs. In 2002 the Australian RFU dropped support for the women's team's entry to the World Cup. The decision was seen as a factor in IOC rejection of rugby as an Olympic sport, and was reversed two years later."
But this was unusual. Women's teams were now being accepted on the main stage. In 2002 Scotland played their first women's match at Murrayfield and in 2003 England staged the first women's international at Twickenham.
"In 2006 the RFU devoted the rugby museum's main annual exhibition to the history of women's rugby—""Women's Rugby—A Work in Progress"", and the same year saw the Women's Rugby World Cup broadcast live on the internet."
"The growth in popularity among women attracted women in both developed and emerging nations, being the fastest growing sport in the world. The participation rates in both rugby sevens and rugby unions (with 15 players) has close to 500,000 new players joining every year globally. According to World Rugby, women's rugby is growing faster (if not as fast) as men's rugby and it is estimated that by 2026 40% of the total number of rugby players will be female. The game remains an amateur, minority sport—but a fast-growing one played in over 80 countries worldwide. Cost and player numbers mean that, in many of these nations, sevens tends to dominate, but 15-a-side championships have now been established in all regions."
"The highest profile women's rugby tournament is the Rugby World Cup, historically known as the Women's Rugby World Cup. The women's World Cup began in 1991, and has generally been played every four years. The most recent World Cup was held in Ireland in 2017, where New Zealand were the winners. In 2019, World Rugby announced that sex/gender designations would officially be removed from the title of the World Cup; the first tournament affected by this policy will be the next women's World Cup in 2021, to be hosted by New Zealand."
"The most successful nations in the World Cup have been New Zealand, which has won it five times, and England, which has reached the final seven times."
The primary annual global competition for women's rugby sevens is the World Rugby Women's World Series. The Women's Series was launched in the 2012-13 season. It features 4-6 tournaments each year.
"Women's rugby sevens at the Hong Kong Sevens has been dominated by New Zealand, with either the New Zealand team (1999–2001) or the Aotearoa Maori team (playing as New Zealand) winning the annual tournament from 1997 until 2007. The United States won the Hong Kong Sevens in 2008 by defeating Canada in the final (New Zealand failed to send a team)."
The inaugural Women's Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament took place in Dubai together with the men's tournament in 2009. Australia defeated New Zealand 15–10 in extra-time to become the first to win the Women's Rugby World Cup.
"Women's rugby sevens was included in World Rugby's successful bid to reintroduce rugby to the Olympics in 2016. At the 2016 Olympics, Australia defeated New Zealand in the final to win the gold medal."
"Women's rugby sevens has also been added to several regional multi-sport tournaments, including the Pan American Games in 2015 and the Commonwealth Games in 2018."

= = = Robert Keeton = = =
"Robert Ernest Keeton (December 16, 1919 – July 2, 2007) was an American lawyer, jurist, and legal scholar. As a law professor at Harvard Law School and a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts he was known for his work on torts, insurance law, and practical courtroom tactics. Keeton, with Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia School of Law, played a key role in the advancement of no-fault automobile insurance."
"Keeton was born in Clarksville, Texas. He was the second youngest of five children of William Keeton (who owned a general store) and Ernestine Teuton Keeton. One of his brothers, W. Page Keeton, also became a prominent lawyer and educator. Keeton earned his Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin and his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Texas School of Law. As an undergraduate he became one of three students inducted into the Friar Society, an honor society at the University of Texas. In law school he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the ""Texas Law Review"". Keeton went into private practice with the law firm of Baker & Botts in Houston before joining the United States Navy in World War II. As a lieutenant serving aboard the escort aircraft carrier USS ""Liscome Bay"" (CVE-56) he survived the sinking of the ship on November 24, 1943, by a torpedo from the Japanese submarine I-175. Keeton, clinging to debris for hours, was later pulled from the ocean. He was awarded a Purple Heart. Keeton returned to Baker & Botts in 1945 after the war. He later taught at Southern Methodist University."
"Keeton joined Harvard Law School in 1953, where he would remain until 1979. In 1954, he wrote ""Trial Tactics and Methods"", a book of practical advice on courtroom skills. Keeton later developed a program at Harvard (later used at other law schools) in which experienced trial lawyers taught students. One rule of Keeton's program was to not ask hostile witnesses open-ended questions. In 1956, Keeton received his Doctor of Juridical Science from Harvard. In 1973, he was named the Langdell Professor of Law. Keeton served as associate dean from 1975–1979. In the early 1970s, Keeton worked with University of Virginia School of Law professor Jeffrey O'Connell on a study that contributed to the development of no-fault automobile insurance, later adopted by many states. Under a no-fault system, damages below a certain level are paid by insurance companies, thus avoiding a determination of who was at fault."
"Keeton was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on January 25, 1979, to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 21, 1979, and received his commission on March 23, 1979. He assumed senior status on February 28, 2003. His service terminated on September 8, 2006, due to retirement. In 1979 Chief Justice Warren Burger appointed him chair of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a body responsible for developing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
"Keeton presided over the 1988-1989 mail fraud and obstruction of justice trial of Lyndon LaRouche and eleven associates, which ended with Keeton declaring a mistrial. He also presided over the 1995 ""Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc."" trial involving the extent of software copyright, a case that later was decided by the Supreme Court. In 1984 Keeton, along with older brother Page as lead author, and professors Dan Dobbs and David Owen, published the 5th edition of ""Prosser and Keeton on Torts"". The book, based on William Prosser's influential ""Prosser on Torts"" (1941), became a foundational text of tort law and has become frequently used as a law textbook and reference work for many law students, lawyers, and jurists."

"The Port of Salem is a shallow-draft port in the vicinity of the Salem River Cut-Off on the Salem River in Salem, New Jersey in the United States about east of the Delaware River and about from the Atlantic Ocean. It was re-designated a port of entry in 1984 and became a foreign trade zone (FTZ) in 1987. Transloading operations include the handling of a variety of bulk cargo, notably of construction aggregate, break bulk cargo, and containers for clothing, fishing apparel, agricultural produce, and other consumer goods, and has at times involved lighterage. It is operated under the auspices of the South Jersey Port Corporation."
"The Delaware River estuary was the territory of the Lenape. European settlement of the region around today's Salem began in 1638 when the colony of New Sweden was established and the Salem River was called Varkens Kill or Hogg Creek. Tradition holds that ethnic Finns settled inland from Finns Point in 1638. In 1641, a group from the New Haven Colony settled around Varkens Kill. In 1655, it was re-claimed by New Netherland and in 1664 it became part of the Province of New Jersey. In 1675, a land patent was given to John Fenwick, who founded the town. Originally, Salem's wharves were located along Fenwick Creek and Salem Creek, and received calls from Philadelphia, Boston and the Caribbean. During the American Revolutionary War, it was occupied by the British to prevent supplies from reaching American troops. Steamer service between Salem and Philadelphia began in 1825. The Salem Railroad opened in 1863."
"The Salem River Cut-off, which bypasses a large bend in the river at the port, was authorized in 1925. For much of the 20th century, the waterfront along the Salem River Cut-off and Fenwick Creek was dominated by industries centered around glass manufacturing, food processing, and mineral/oil storage. From 1905 to 1978, H. J. Heinz Company operated a large processing plant along Fenwick Creek. Mannington Mills, Anchor Glass, and AluChem are located proximate to the port, as well as the South Jersey Farmers Exchange in nearby Woodstown."
Salem was originally designated a port of entry in 1682 by royal commission of the British Crown.
"The City of Salem established a municipal port authority in 1982. In 1984, the port resumed international shipping operations and the United States Customs Service granted it status as a ""water port of entry"", the first such designation made since the 1930s. It is now a port of entry in United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) District 21, which is headquartered in Newark and covers New Jersey."
"Along with Millville Municipal Airport, portions of the port have been part of foreign trade zone #142 since 1987. Subzones associated with FTZ142 are located at the Port of Paulsboro and other locations in South Jersey."
"The Delaware and Salem rivers are tidal. The Delaware River Main Channel has been maintained at a depth of . Dredging to a depth of was completed in 2017. Reach C, which includes the entrance to the Salem Port, was completed in 2010. The shipping channel of the Salem River is much shallower, making the city a shallow draft port, which prohibits use by Handymax class ships. The Salem River and Cut-Off were first channelized in 1925 to a depth of . The river is entered though Salem Cove about from the Atlantic Ocean at the entrance of the Delaware Bay. The channel travels along the southeast side of the cove for and continues another to the Cut-Off and to the head of navigation at the first bridge crossing (Route 49)."
"The Delaware River is served by various range lights. Reedy Island is approximately southwest of the mouth of the Salem River. Reedy Island Front Light works in conjunction with the Reedy Island Range Rear Light for navigation of the Salem reach of the river. The Finns Point Range Light upstream of the Salem River was deactivated in 1950. From the Delaware River, entrance to the port is guided by the Salem River Range Lights, the Salem River Directional Light (), and 11 other lighted navigational aids."
"The city and county of Salem have a long history of glass manufacturing, along with the site of the first successful glass production facility in North America. Adjacent to the port is the oldest manufacturing facility for glass containers in the United States, established in 1863 and long known as Anchor Glass, once owned by Anchor Hocking and now part of the Ardagh Group."
"The rail line serving the port is called the Glass House Running Track and is an extension of the Salem Branch. On the verge of abandonment by Conrail, the southern section of the route from Swedesboro to Salem was purchased by the county in 1983 and is leased to Southern Railroad of New Jersey (SRNJ). Long neglected, it is in poor condition and travel speeds are very slow. The line is undergoing upgrades to the rail bed, trackage, a trestle at Oldman's Creek, and other work. At Swedesboro, SRNJ interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations to reach Pavonia Yard, the regional rail center."
"Route 45 and Route 49 provide access to Interstate 295, the New Jersey Turnpike and the nearby Delaware Memorial Bridge. In 2005, the Route 49 bascule bridge built in 1927 over the Salem River was replaced with a fixed bridge that can be converted to a vertical lift bridge and has been dedicated the ""Veteran’s of Salem County Memorial Bridge""."
"The Salem Municipal Port Authority was established in 1982 with the intention to revitalize and coordinate shipping in the port district. In 2005, the Salem City Industrial District Brownfield Development Area was created to spur re-use of brownfields, including numerous properties within and adjacent to the port district, which is located along the southern banks of the river between the Salem River Cut-Off and the Route 49 bridge just outside the downtown area. It encompasses several terminal and wharf facilities for barges and container ships for bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers."
"In 2006, the municipal port authority described the typical container ship making use of the port as carrying 150 containers and taking approximately 12 hours to unload and reload. The ""Bermuda Islander"", a Dutch-flagged container ship, calls regularly at Salem."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."
"This station, located atop an embankment, has two side platforms, two tracks and maintains a level grade. It lies at the northern portal of the Washington Heights Mine Tunnel, which takes the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line through the bedrock of Manhattan. North of the station, the terrain of Upper Manhattan drops abruptly and the line becomes elevated to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street."
"Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames at the center. A waist-level black fence runs along either side. The platforms are offset as the South Ferry-bound one inclines more to the north than the 242nd Street-bound one. Each platform has two ""DYCKMAN ST"" mosaics."
"This is one of only two aboveground Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line stations with two tracks (the other being 242nd Street). A center express track, which is currently unused in revenue service, forms just north of this station and runs nonstop to just south of 242nd Street. A spur track used to be located to the south of the station, but was removed when the platforms were extended."
"The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the nearby Substation 17."
"A 1991 artwork in the waiting area is called ""Flight"" by Wopo Holup. It features ceramic relief tiles depicting birds in flight."
"The station's only entrance is a station house slightly above ground level at the southern corner of Nagle Avenue, Dyckman Street, and Hillside Avenue. There is a ramp and stairs from street level to the station house. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to each platform, with an elevator to the southbound platform."
"In February 2014, as part of an ongoing rehabilitation, the MTA built a ramp from street level to the mezzanine and opened an elevator to connect the southbound platform to the mezzanine. The elevator, which was not originally planned in the station renovation, was built due to a lawsuit by the United Spinal Association. The elevator is of a ""machine room-less"" design and is the first of its type to be installed in the New York City Subway system. The renovations also included rehabilitation of the tunnel portal, realignment and rehabilitation of the platforms and installation of new cast iron lighting fixtures."
"The southbound elevator is located at the southwest corner of Hillside Avenue, St. Nicholas Avenue, and Fort George Hill, and is accessible by a ramp to the station house."
"This station is not accessible to the disabled on the northbound side because the suit was settled only after the northbound side was already renovated, and in any case, the area's geography made it prohibitively expensive to add an elevator to the northbound platform. Northbound accessibility was proposed in February 2019 as part of the MTA's ""Fast Forward"" program."

"Bill Schuffenhauer (born June 24, 1973) is an American bobsledder who has competed since 2000. Competing in three Winter Olympics, he won the silver medal in the four-man event at Salt Lake City in 2002."
"Bill grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah and as a child, his mother was a prostitute and drug addict who was often beaten in front of him. He had to steal, to eat from trash cans, and once was caught trying to break into a bicycle store to try to steal something to sell for food."
"The few friends he had were mostly in street gangs, and Bill drank and smoked cannabis often. His mother was often evicted, and he lived in foster homes. Schuffenhauer's maternal grandmother, Sadie Muniz, took him in as he was about to enter junior high in Roy, Utah. ""She reminded me to never give up and always push on,"" he said."
"Because of his grandmother's influence, he began going to school and started to participate in track and field at Roy High School, due to his great speed. He persevered to become an Olympian, and his coaches encouraged him greatly as well. He soon became a decathlete. He went to Weber State University and there he won the junior nationals in 1992. Additionally he played American football in high school."
"Schuffenhauer's Olympics dream as a track and field athlete came to an end in 2000. While training for Sydney, he suffered a bad ankle injury and he could barely walk. When his friend told him that the U.S. Olympic team was practicing bobsledding in Park City, he took the chance to go and observe. While there, the team members noticed his 6-foot, 200 pound frame and asked him he wanted to be a pusher. He accepted and trained with the team from then on."
"He was not originally slated to be a regular member, but was promoted when one of the U.S. four-man team members tested positive for steroids. That crew, piloted by Todd Hays, won a silver medal at the Salt Lake Games."
"At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, Bill's two-man team placed 14th, after which he retired. He had two children and he felt responsible for them. Bobsledders earn only a meager amount, but Bill made the tough decision to continue to aspire for qualification for Vancouver. He fought through a neck injury (2 herniated disks) with the help of a chiropractor and a team physician."
"In January 2010, in St. Moritz, Switzerland, Bill and his 3 USA teammates placed sixth and qualified for Vancouver and it was officially announced on January 17, 2010 that Bill's team would represent the United States at Vancouver. They finished 13th in the four-man event."

= = = Trams in New Zealand = = =
"Trams in New Zealand were a major form of transport from the 19th century into the mid-20th century. New Zealand's first (horse) tramway was established in 1862 (Nelson), followed by a steam tramway in 1871 (Thames), and the first electric tramway in 1900 (Maori Hill, Dunedin). The tram systems in the main centres, and in some smaller towns, were soon electrified. By the 1950s, all systems were in the process of being replaced by trolley-buses or buses. The last tram service closed in 1964, in Wellington. A tram running parallel with a public road opened in Western Springs, Auckland, in 1980 and a central city loop line in Christchurch in 1995. Both are heritage lines."
"Some moves are proceeding to extend tram use in New Zealand again. In Auckland, the MOTAT line was extended in 2006–07 to reach a second site of the museum, and the former Auckland Regional Council promoted the creation of an Auckland waterfront tram line, originally with MOTAT vehicles, but will initially operate former Melbourne trams leased from Bendigo Tramways Company Limited. The Auckland Tramway Limited opened 6 August 2011 with the support of Waterfront Auckland (later merged into Panuku Development Auckland) and the new Auckland Council."
"In Christchurch, the city loop is currently operating on a limited circuit after being reopened 27 November 2013 following the Christchurch earthquake of 2011 which halted services while the CBD was closed off. The tramway was being extended in several small stages starting late 2000s and was nearly complete when the 2011 earthquake struck. While these proposals are all officially heritage / tourist lines, there is some investigation into later extension or conversion for normal transport use. This line was extended in 2014 with the reopening of the full pre-earthquake circuit and the opening of the nearly complete extension through the mall and High Street."
"In 1862 the first horse tramway in New Zealand, between Nelson and the port, opened as part of the Dun Mountain Railway, built to export ore from the mine in the hills above Nelson. Other horse-drawn tram systems were built on the West Coast of the South Island, where a gold rush started in 1864."
"Horse-drawn lines also opened in the main centres; Auckland and Devonport in 1886, Dunedin 1879, Christchurch 1880 and Dunedin 1879."
"At Grahamstown (now Thames) in the North Island where gold had also been found, a steam tramway to Tararu was opened on 2 December 1871, but closed on 11 November 1874, due to 'not sufficient traffic'. A steam locomotive for the tramway was built at Mechanics Bay in 1872 by Fraser and Tinne."
"Fateh became a casualty of Bangladesh's complex and shifting political landscape towards the end of his career. As he was closely identified with Bangladesh's initial, Liberation War era administration Fateh was not favoured by the military-backed regimes which followed it. Contemporary historians have characterised his Ambassadorial assignment to Algeria as a premature transfer and a virtual exile in a diplomatic post which was a relative back-water. One commentator voicing the widely held belief that Fateh was ""a victim of conspiracy hatched against him by anti-liberation forces."
"Retiring in 1982, he lived with his wife Mahfuza Fateh in Dhaka for ten years before they settled in London to be near their sons."
Fateh died in London of natural causes at 0745 on 4 December 2010.
"A Sufi, he once cited a few of the axioms according to which he led his life: ""Do not speak anything that you do not yourself know to be true."" ""Speak in the spirit of offering, without the need to draw attention to yourself."" ""You should stand up when it matters."""
"Fateh was buried with Bangladesh State Honours at Hendon Cemetery, London on 7 December 2010"
"The Bangladesh Government was represented by His Excellency the Bangladesh High Commissioner Professor Mohammad Sayeedur Rahman Khan Khan who delivered a homily which spoke of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's devastation at the news of Ambassador Fateh's death, conveyed the condolences of Foreign Minister Dipu Moni and spoke of the highest standard of public service that Mr. Fateh's conduct and career represented. In consideration of the esteem of the Bangladesh government and its people for Ambassador Fateh, the High Commissioner had personally brought the flag of Bangladesh to be draped over the coffin so that Mr. Fateh could briefly lie in state before his interring. Justice of the Supreme Court the Right Honorable Syed Refaat Ahmed also spoke at the event about Fateh's humility and self-effacement in all contexts, against the backdrop of an enormous contribution to the public and civic life of the country. A few days later at the Qul Khwani and non-denominational Sufi service on 11 December 2010, Murad Qureshi, Member of the London Assembly at London's City Hall, spoke, reminding those gathered that Fateh father chose to stand and be counted during the 1971 war in quite fraught circumstances. The Sufi Order established by Inayat Khan, whose son Vilayat Inayat Khan was a friend of Abul, arranged a non-denominational Sufi Service. Pir Vilayat Khan's son Pir Zia Khan sent a personal message, which also stated: ""Abul Fateh Sahib has lived a life of honour and service and is a mystic in spirit"""

Kenton Road is a main road in the London Borough of Harrow and the London Borough of Brent. It lies in the areas of Harrow and Kenton.
"Its eastern end is the border of Kenton in Middlesex and Kingsbury (in NW9) in London. Kenton Road is the A4006, apart from a short stretch west of Northwick Park roundabout, which is a small part of the A404. The road east of the Kenton Methodist Church originally followed the route of what is now Woodgrange Avenue and was a continuation of Kenton Lane before being upgraded, re-positioned and renamed in the early 20th century as an eastward extension of the original Kenton Road."
"On the north side of the road, almost opposite Kenton station is the Traveller's Rest pub. Approximately further along the A4006, also on the north side of the road, at the junction with St Leonard's Avenue, is the parish church of St Mary-the-Virgin, Kenton, built in 1935-1936 by the architect Harold Gibbons and a local firm of builders, Melsom & Rosier. Approximately further on, on the south side of the Kenton Road is All Saints Catholic Church, built in 1963. About another further on is the Greek Orthodox Church of St Panteleimon. Originally a mission church of the Church of England parish, it was acquired in recent years by the Greek community, which has replaced it with a traditional Greek Basilica complete with bronze dome (2011)."
"As late as 1935 there was a busy blacksmith's forge in Kenton Lane, from the junction with Kenton Road (the junction at that time called 'Brockhurst Corner'). On Saturdays the children of the neighbourhood could be seen clustered round the always-open door, watching the sparks fly as the blacksmith hammered out the red-hot horse shoes on his anvil."
= = = Raeburn Van Buren = = =
"Raeburn Van Buren (January 12, 1891 – December 29, 1987) was an American magazine and comic strip illustrator best known for his work on the syndicated ""Abbie an' Slats"". He was familiarly known in the professional comics community as Ray Van Buren."
"Born in Pueblo, Colorado, Van Buren, a distant relative of US President Martin Van Buren, grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. At the ""Kansas City Star"", he learned cartooning from comic strip artist Harry Wood. In 1913, Van Buren moved to New York, where he illustrated for ""Puck"", ""Life"" and ""The Saturday Evening Post""."
"Van Buren served in the old Seventh Regiment (107th Infantry) of the 27th New York Empire Division in World War I. He was art editor of the division's magazine, ""Gas Attack"". An artistry and illustrative flair were evident in his cartoons, and ""The New York Times"" compared his artwork in the magazine with that of the famous British illustrator Bruce Bairnsfather."
"After military service, he drew cartoons for ""The Saturday Evening Post"", ""The New Yorker"" and ""Esquire"". As a freelance illustrator, he contributed to numerous magazines, including ""Collier's"", ""Redbook"" and ""McCall's"". He was a founder of the National Society of Magazine Illustrators."
"He began drawing ""Abbie an' Slats"" in 1937. The strip followed the experiences of a rural spinster raising her young cousin, a streetwise urban child. It was the idea of Al Capp, who intended to start a second strip to build upon the success of his popular ""Li'l Abner"". Instead of drawing it himself, Capp recruited Van Buren. Initially, Van Buren turned him down, but he was soon lured by the prospect of steady work, as he had just had his first and only child with his wife, Fern. The strip was carried in 400 newspapers but did not equal the popularity of ""Li'l Abner"". Capp abandoned the strip in 1945, turning the writing chores over to his brother, Elliot Caplin. Van Buren stayed on the strip, and it ended with his retirement in 1971."
"Van Buren lived in Great Neck, Long Island. When he died in 1987 at North Shore Community Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island, after suffering an injury in a fall, he was 96 years old."
"In 1984, When Van Buren sent a gift to ""Dear Abby"" columnist Abigail Van Buren (Pauline Phillips), she wrote back on November 30, 1984, thanking him and commenting on the name similarity:"
"With the Gold Key Award, he was honored in 1979 as a member of the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame. In 1958, he was named ""Cartoonist of the Year"" by the Quaker City Lodge of the B'nai B'rith in ceremonies at Philadelphia Pa. Previous winners were Al Capp, Milton Caniff, and George Wunder."
"Van Buren's wartime experiences are chronicled in the book ""Duty, Honor, Privilege: New York's Silk Stocking Regiment the Breaking of the Hindenburg Line"" by his grandnephew Stephen L. Harris. Beginning with ""Abbie an' Slats and Becky"" (Saalfield, 1940), his comic strip was collected in several books."

= = = The Love Cats (song) = = =
"""The Love Cats"" (sometimes rendered as ""The Lovecats"") is a song by English rock band The Cure, released as a stand-alone single in October 1983."
"It was the band's first Top 10 hit in the UK, peaking at number 7. It also reached number 6 on the Australian chart in early 1984. The single later appeared on the compilation album ""Japanese Whispers"", released in December 1983."
"At the time the song was written, Robert Smith was very interested in the work of Australian author Patrick White. According to a number of his fans, Smith was inspired to write ""The Love Cats"" after reading White's novel ""The Vivisector"" (1970), although this claim is difficult to verify. In the novel, the protagonist, Hurtle, is appalled when his lover's husband drowns a sack of stray cats. White draws a parallel between the way in which the cats are discarded, and the treatment of certain characters in the book; by extension, the cats symbolize the most innocent and vulnerable members of society, and the casual cruelty with which they sometimes meet their fate."
"The music video features a number of cats and a large lampshade falling on the head of bassist Phil Thornalley. There are many shots of a mansion which the band told a buyer they were interested in buying it. They returned the keys in the morning. Real cats were supposed to be used but after proving to be troublesome, taxidermied ones were used in the place of cats. Smith said of the video: ""'The Love Cats' is far from being my favourite song: composed drunk, video filmed drunk, promotion made drunk. It was a joke."""

= = = Israel B. Richardson = = =
"Israel Bush Richardson (December 26, 1815 – November 3, 1862) was a United States Army officer during the Mexican–American War and American Civil War, where he was a major general in the Union Army. Nicknamed ""Fighting Dick"" for his prowess on the battlefield, he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Antietam near Sharpsburg, Maryland."
"Richardson was born in Fairfax, Vermont. He was reportedly a descendant of famed American Revolutionary War general Israel Putnam. He was appointed from Vermont to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. He graduated 38th out of 52 cadets in the Class of 1841. He was one of 23 classmates who would become generals during the Civil War. After some routine assignments, Richardson served as a second lieutenant in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He was promoted to first lieutenant on Sep 21, 1846."
"He received two brevets for meritorious service during the Mexican–American War, to captain and major for the actions at Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. In Mexico while serving under General Winfield Scott in the Army of Occupation, he received his nickname, ""Fighting Dick"", which would carry over to the Civil War."
"He later served as a captain in the 3rd U.S. Infantry (a rank he achieved in 1851) at various frontier outposts in Texas and New Mexico Territory, San Antonio, Texas 1848–49, Post Opposite El Paso del Norte, 1849–1850; Fort Fillmore 1851–52, 1852–53; Fort Webster, 1852, 1853–54; and Fort Thorn, 1854–55. He then resigned his commission in 1855 and began farming near Pontiac, Michigan."
"When the Civil War broke out, Richardson was still farming in Michigan. He enlisted in the Union Army and recruited and organized the 2nd Michigan Infantry. He married Fannie Travor on May 18, 1861, in Wayne County, Michigan. When he reported with his regiment in Washington, DC, General Winfield Scott greeted him with ""I'm glad to have my 'Fighting Dick' with me again"". Richardson, promoted to colonel on May 25, 1861, was assigned command of the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, in the newly organized army of Brigadier General Irvin McDowell. His brigade saw limited action at the First Battle of Bull Run near Blackburn's Ford, and in covering the subsequent federal withdrawal to Washington. He was promoted to brigadier general, ranking from May 17, 1861."
"He commanded several brigades in the Army of the Potomac and then the 1st Division of the II Corps during the Peninsula Campaign in mid-1862. He was involved in the fighting at the battles of Yorktown, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days. He was particularly distinguished in sharp fighting near the Chickahominy River. Richardson was promoted to major general after the Seven Days Battles. His division was stationed in Washington, DC, during the Second Battle of Bull Run and did not participate in that engagement."
"Richardson's 1st Division played a key role during the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, attacking Confederate positions in the center of the Sunken Road in support of the 3rd Division of Maj. Gen. William H. French. After stubborn fighting, by 1:00 pm, Richardson had gained control of the high ground in front of the apex of the defensive line, and his men enfiladed the remaining defenders in the road, which would gain the nickname ""Bloody Lane"" for the carnage. Richardson pushed forward beyond the road and was directing the fire of his artillery and organizing another attack when he was struck by a shell fragment."
"Carried to the rear, Richardson was treated at a field hospital. His wound was not considered life-threatening, and he was given a room in Major General George B. McClellan's headquarters, the Pry House. President Abraham Lincoln paid his respects to the wounded Richardson during a visit to the battlefield in October. However, infection set in, and then pneumonia, which claimed the life of the popular general in early November. He was among six generals to be killed or mortally wounded at Antietam."
"His body was escorted to Detroit. Large crowds lined the streets during his funeral procession to nearby Pontiac, where he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery."
"Fort Richardson, a Texas frontier fort active from 1867 to 1878, was named for him."
"The Israel B. Richardson Camp #2 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War in Oakland, Michigan, was also named for the fallen general."
"Battery Richardson, a 12-inch coast artillery gun battery at Fort Hancock, New Jersey, was named for him."
= = = Jere Wood = = =
"Jere Wood (born c. 1949) is the former mayor of Roswell, Georgia, serving five consecutive terms. Mayor Wood defeated Democrat ""Pug"" Mabry, who served as mayor for over thirty years, in the election of 1997. During his election he ran on the platform of slow-growth, fighting urban sprawl and what he viewed as its negative side effects. At the time, he promised to only be a two-term mayor. He ran unchallenged and secured re-election in 2001. Wood is the son of Roy ""Splinter"" Wood, a Democrat, who was Undersecretary of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) during the Carter Administration in the 1970s. Wood won the mayor's race again in the election held in November 2005."
"Mayor Wood is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino."
"During the attempted merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, a number of politicians sent letters to the FCC expressing their support. Wood was one of these, stating the merger would help spur business growth. It was later discovered that Wood had actually submitted a letter that had been ghostwritten by Comcast. Wood was just one of a number of politicians exposed by ""The Verge"" to have participated in such a practice."
"In 2016, Roswell resident Michael Litton filed a lawsuit accusing Wood of violating the city of Roswell's charter by seeking a third term as mayor. Wood, who was first elected in 1997, advocated in 2010 for the Roswell mayor to have a term limit of three four-year terms. He has said the intent was that the clock would start for him when the law was passed, and not when he was first elected."
"Although Wood had enjoyed the support of State Representative Betty Price, she has since stated that she does not intend to amend the charter to allow Wood to run for a subsequent term. She had been willing to support a charter change that would allow the mayor to serve out his term, but no more. ""My goal has been to save the city the expense of a costly trial,"" Price said. Since the start of the controversy, the city of Roswell has spent $16,843 through city attorney fees on defending Wood, as of mid-2016. On August 3, 2017, Wood was removed from office after a judge finding he did violate city law."
"In October 2016, Wood filed suit in Fulton Superior Court against Roswell and the Roswell Council Members over whether he could renovate his home. Wood's home is located in the Roswell historic district, which requites prior approval when renovating. He was initially granted approval by the Roswell Historic Preservation Commission to build a 1.5 story, 3,000 square foot house on his property. However, the city council later overturned the decision in August 2016. Wood alleged in the lawsuit that council members acted improperly by deciding the council had the legal authority to reverse the commission's earlier decision. State historic preservation laws allow ""limited authority"" for the council members to ""approve, modify and approve, or reject"" the historic commission’s final decision, but only if it is found that the commission abused its discretion."
"Wood often mountain bikes, wind surfs or kayaks. He earned his Eagle Scout Award during his youth and has been active in the Boy Scout program in the North Fulton area."

"Juana Manuel of Castile (1339 – 27 March 1381) was Queen consort of Castile from 1369 until 1379. She also was the heiress of Escalona, Villena, Peñafiel and Lara, as well as Lady of Biscay."
She was the daughter of the Infante Juan Manuel of Castile (1282–1348) and his second wife Blanca Núñez de Lara de La Cerda. Her mother Blanca (d. 1347) was a descendant of the Lords of Biscay and of Lara and of Alfonso X's eldest son (Fernando de la Cerda). She was the last legitimate member of the House of Ivrea.
"Her father had been for five years a serious enemy of King Alfonso XI, his former protégé, and the king wished to neutralize or absorb the might of the Peñafiel family. Although Juana was not the heiress (yet), already in her youth she had to go along with royal wishes. The king's very influential concubine, Leonor de Guzmán, wanted to obtain some high prestige and property to her eldest son and had her eyes on the young Juana. On 27 July 1350 her brother and guardian, Fernando Manuel of Peñafiel, had to marry his young sister to Henry (1333–79), eldest of the illegitimate sons of Alfonso XI of Castile. This brought Henry certain lands."
"However it was later that Juana's relatives' heirless deaths made Juana the great heiress she turned out to be, while her husband became threat to the royal power. In 1369, he became King Henry II of Castile, after he deposed and murdered his half-brother to take the throne."
They had the following children:
"In 1361 (at the death of her teenage niece Blanca, daughter of her brother Fernando Manuel who himself had died in c 1350 without other children) she inherited Villena, Escalona and Peñafiel. Because Juana was a maternal granddaughter of La Palomilla, from her another cousin, Isabel de Lara who was murdered in 1361 and her young daughter Florentina (d after 1365), she also inherited Lara and Biscay. In 1369, she became queen of Castile and León."
"When in 1381 she died and left her inheritance to her son, Biscay finally was united with Castile, and ultimately Spain. The Basque people remember her for that."
= = = Happy Sad (album) = = =
"Happy Sad is the third album by singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, released in 1969. It was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, California and was produced by former Lovin' Spoonful members Zal Yanovsky and, coincidentally, his subsequent replacement Jerry Yester. It marked the beginning of Buckley's experimental period, as it incorporated elements of jazz that he had never used before. Many of the songs here represent a departure from the binary form that dominated much of his previous work. The sound of the album is characterized by David Friedman's vibraphone, an instrument which gives the album a more relaxed tone than Buckley's earlier work. The songs are much longer than on previous releases and this style continued through to later works. The vocals on the album are more drawn out than earlier performances and this represents the beginning of Buckley using his voice like an instrument. The lyrics on ""Happy Sad"" represent a change as Buckley stopped working with Larry Beckett, his lyricist on the two previous albums ""Tim Buckley"" and ""Goodbye and Hello"", and began writing the lyrics himself. Buckley's self-penned efforts stand in contrast to Beckett's occasionally political and literary-style work. Buckley would also go on to author all his own material on the following two albums."
"""Happy Sad"" shares much in common with his later albums, ""Lorca"" and ""Blue Afternoon"". Much of the material that would appear on those albums was written at the same time as the songs that appear on this album, representing the most productive and prolific period of Buckley's career. Buckley's musical tastes expanded during the period that the album was written and the first track, ""Strange Feelin"", was directly inspired by Miles Davis' ""All Blues"" from ""Kind of Blue"" and the melody of the song is directly taken from the song. ""Buzzin' Fly"" was written much earlier than the rest of the work and was originally performed with a group Buckley had during high school, the Harlequin 3, with bassist Jim Fielder and later lyricist, Larry Beckett."
"The third track, ""Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)"", is a song composed of various movements and this represents the second time Buckley wrote in this manner, his previous effort being the title track of ""Goodbye and Hello"". The segments of the song were written separately as ""Danang"" and ""Asbury Park"", as demonstrated on the later released demo sessions, """". The final version of the song is backed by an 'ocean' sound effect, however this was not originally intended to feature on the song. Buckley and the band were happy with the take of song but because of a recording problem the track had a slight electric buzzing in the background. The producer solved this by muffling the buzzing with the ocean overdub."
"""Dream Letter"" is as an ode and apology to his ex-wife, Mary Guibert, and his son Jeff Buckley. This is the second song Buckley wrote about the pair, the first being ""I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain"" on his previous LP, ""Goodbye and Hello"". In comparison to that song ""Dream Letter"" has a more apologetic tone, the lyrics reveal this with Buckley lamenting ""Does he ever ask about me?"" . It would be over five years later that Buckley would meet with his son again. The name of the song would later be used for a live album: posthumous release """". The concert features much of the same personnel from the ""Happy Sad""."
"""Gypsy Woman"" is a long track highlighting Buckley's vocal acrobatics and on the record has some qualities of a jam session. Buckley and his band were disappointed with its recording but the song would remain as part of Buckley's live repertoire for the following years. The closer of the album, ""Sing a Song For You"", is more similar to Buckley's work on ""Goodbye and Hello"" than to the songs on the rest of the album. It shares the verse/chorus style and folk leanings of ""Song to the Siren"", which though released on ""Starsailor"" was written around the same period."
"Released at the height of his popularity, ""Happy Sad"" was his highest charting album, reaching #81 in the US Pop albums chart, but Buckley's experimentation on this album would alienate some of the fanbase and his mainstream appeal he gained with ""Goodbye and Hello"". However, this was only the beginning of Buckley's experimentation with sound and genre, and subsequent releases would further reduce his mainstream popularity and see his sales take a downturn."

"Begun in 1964 when Van Gasteren was 42 years old, ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"" finally premiered at EYE Film Institute Netherlands on the occasion of Van Gasteren's 90th birthday, 20 November 2012. Louis van Gasteren was present at the opening and afterwards was interviewed by journalist Raymond van den Boogaard. On November 30 there was a public interview with the author by television critic Hans Beerekamp from NRC Handelsblad."
"Vimeo.com called the film ""a journey in spiritual and geographical terms"" and Realtofilm.nl wrote, ""The film not only gives a peak into a fascinating era, it is a highly original autobiographical portrait."" Some reviews were negative. Yara Plasman of Filmtotaal.nl described the film as ""a veritable hotch-potch/jumble of various images, sometimes spontaneous while at other times obviously enacted, with or without a clear storyline . . ."""
"Principal photography for ""Nema"" began in 1964 in the Netherlands and lasted five years as Louis raised money as he went. Filming eventually covered ten countries. Jan de Bont was the cinematographer on the principal scenes of the film, including scenes in New York, Vancouver, San Francisco, Timothy Leary in Millbrook, and Meher Baba in India. Additional cameramen during the very long shooting period included Milek Knebel, Theo Hogers, Roeland Kerbosch, Olof Smit, Bert Spijkerman, Louis van Gasteren, and Kester Dixon (for final filming in 2012)."
"Van Gasteren worked hard to get an interview with Meher Baba for ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"". In 1967 Meher Baba was near the end of his life and in strict seclusion. Through the help of numerous contacts with people he met in his travels who had met Baba in the 60s, including Irwin Luck, Rick Chapman, and Robert Dreyfuss, Van Gasteren was at last able to reach Baba's secretary and arrange a meeting. Van Gasteren told Baba, ""The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension."" The terms were that the shooting could only take place on September 20, 1967, during a short period when Baba would be coming out of seclusion for three hours in order to wash the feet of seven lepers, the last of such an occasion in Baba's life. Van Gasteren was told that if he was there on time, he could film and interview Baba. Van Gasteren arrived in Bombay on September 17, and at Meherazad at precisely 9:00 A.M. on September 19, accompanied by cameraman Jan de Bont and soundman Peter Brugman, and was shown around the location in preparation for the following day's shoot and met Baba. The following day, September 20, the crew filmed forty minutes of film footage of Baba and the surrounding area, including the interview seen in the film. About half of this footage was released in the 1997 documentary, ""Beyond Words""."
"Filming stalled in 1969. After two attempts to complete the film in the 70s and 80s, a final attempt to edit the film was begun in 2009 by filmmaker and editor Ilja Lammers who began to gather and assemble the material. The 35mm film was digitized by EYE Film Institute Netherlands in 2010. Completion financing was received from Netherlands Film Fund and EYE Film Institute and the film was finished in 2012, 48 years after principal photography began. The film premiered at EYE on Van Gasteren's 90th birthday. Gasteren was present at the opening."

"""Hello"" is a song by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson, from her fifth studio album, ""Stronger"" (2011). Written by Clarkson, Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with production by Abraham and Oligee, ""Hello"" is a midtempo rock song about searching for companionship in hopes of not being lonely, in which the singer asks, ""Hello? Is anybody listening?"""
"Upon its release, ""Hello"" was received with positive reception from music critics, who regarded it as a vocal highlight of ""Stronger"". Boosted by digital sales during the album's release, the song entered the South Korean Singles Chart at number 47. Clarkson has also performed it a limited live performance during her Stronger Tour in 2012."
"""Hello"" was written by Kelly Clarkson Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with Abraham and Goldstein (as Ollgee) handling the song's production. During the summer of 2011, Clarkson and McKee had collaborated on tracks such as ""Hello"" and ""Alone"", intending it to be recorded for Clarkson's fifth studio album, ""Stronger"", which was released on October of that same year. An acoustic version of the ""Hello"" was included as the opening track of her first extended play, ""The Smoakstack Sessions"" (2011)."
"Written in the key of E minor, ""Hello"" is a midtempo rock song with guitar chords and its hand claps. According to the sheet music published by Kobalt Music Publishing, Clarkson's voice range featured in the song spans from A to E. Jarett Wieselman of ""omg! Insider"" noted that its chord progression is similar to Katy Perry's single ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" (2011), a track also written by McKee."
"""Hello"" has received positive reviews from music critics. Jason Lipshutz of ""Billboard"" described it as ""a slightly more rugged track that finds its groove in the chorus. The handclaps on the bridge are a nice touch"" and added that the song ""is gonna be a killer in concert."" ""Seattle Post-Intelligencer""s Jason Scott described ""Hello"" as a ""Fun"" and ""cool"" track. He compared it to tracks recorded on ""All I Ever Wanted"" (2009) and noted that the track relies ""solely on the ""O"" vowel to tell a story. ""Ignorance isn't wise, but it beats being alone,"" Clarkson sings before asking if anybody is listening. We hear you loud and clear!"" Brian Mansfield of ""USA Today"" considered ""Hello"" as a vocal highlight of ""Stronger"", he wrote in his review: ""this rock tune sounds happier than its lyrics, which depict Kelly as feeling alone even when she's not by herself."" Sam Lansky of PopCrush compared it to ""Mr. Know It All"", and described it as a '90s throwback. He wrote, definitely works, especially with the hooky chorus and heartbroken ferocity of the bridge: ""Holding onto the memories of when I, I didn't know / Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone."" Ryan Pearson of ""The Huffington Post"" noted that ""there is an undertone of loneliness and sadness coursing throughout, including some downbeat lyrics co-written by Clarkson herself. ""Hello, is anybody listening? Won't somebody show me that I'm not alone,"" she sings on ""Hello""."""

Six more episodes were released by Cicierega between 2006 and 2009. Approximately one year after the seventh episode was released, a new video appeared on Neil's channel announcing an exclusive ""Potter Puppet Pals"" channel. On the same day, three more videos were released on this page. The ""Potter Puppet Pals"" make appearances at some Harry Potter parties, such as Yule Balls 2007 and 2010."
"Both the original animated episodes, as well as the first seven live-action episodes, have been published to the official ""Potter Puppet Pals"" webpage."
"Much of the humor derived from the series originates from Cicierega's unique interpretation of the principal Harry Potter characters. Some characters are given personalities designed to contrast completely with their attitudes in the Harry Potter books. Cicierega's Harry is portrayed as an extremely brash, arrogant, and vain teenager who is ""rife with boyish attitude,"" while Dumbledore is a nudist. Other times, an aspect of the original stories is blown out of proportion for comedic effect, such as Hermione Granger's love of reading and matter-of-fact approach to problems.

= = = Emperor Duzong = = =
"Emperor Duzong of Song (2 May 1240 – 12 August 1274), personal name Zhao Qi, was the 15th emperor of the Song dynasty in China and the sixth emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. He was a nephew of his predecessor, Emperor Lizong, and reigned from 1264 until his death in 1274."
"His birth name was Zhao Mengqi but his name was changed to Zhao Zi in 1251 and finally to Zhao Qi in 1253 after he was designated as Emperor Lizong's heir apparent. Duzong's reign was filled with rebellions and warfare; the court was dominated by his chancellor Jia Sidao and Duzong himself gave in into drinking and women, thus abandoning his duties. He died in 1274 leaving behind three young boys, one of whom took the throne as Emperor Gong. He is the last Emperor of the Song to issue coins; subsequent Emperors were too busy fighting the Mongols to establish mints to cast any coins and did not have enough resources."
"Emperor Duzong's mother wanted to have an abortion because she thought she was of low social status so she took drugs in an futile attempt to abort Duzong. Duzong was born anyway but the drugs affected him in many ways such as that his intelligence was lower than an average person, his hand and feet were soft; using them in an awkward fashion and he couldn't even speak until he was seven years old. He was Yurui's only son. Like his uncle Zhao Yun, he lived in Shaoxing."
"Duzong was discovered by his paternal uncle Zhao Yun, better known as Emperor Lizong in 1253, who was sonless and therefore had no heirs so to compensate, adopted Duzong and designated him crown prince in 1260, an action historians still view as confusing. Emperor Lizong died in 1264 and Emperor Duzong then ascended the throne."
"Emperor Duzong's reign was plagued with rebellions, warfare and corruption in his court; many officials accused the chancellor Jia Sidao of corruption but Duzong trusted Jia Sidao who Duzong honoured by bowing down to Jia even calling him ""teacher"" and according to anecdotes, when Jia was considering resigning, Duzong knelt down in tears begging Jia to remain in office."
"Emperor Duzong ignored his duties and instead delegated all state and military affairs to the hands of Jia Sidao; the emperor instead indulged in drinking, women, and lived in opulence. To make things even worse, Duzong’s intelligence was lower than a normal person and he was often depressed. At first, he told the officials to be straightforward and tell him the problems in the countries, but this was all an act. Soon, he completely neglected his duties. Furthermore, he had a very high sexual appetite. Under Song laws, any woman who had sexual relations with the emperor had to pay respects to the emperor every morning. At one point, there were as many as 30 women paying their respects to Emperor Duzong in one morning. Duzong also gave official documents to four of his most favored women."
"The Mongols had spent decades harassing the Song Empire's borders and were on the verge of conquering the whole of China. Emperor Duzong however, ignored this problem instead choosing to drink and indulging in sex because when Duzong heard that Xiangyang was being besieged by Mongol troops, Duzong asked Jia Sidao ""I hear that Xiangyang had been besieged by the Yuan troops for several years. Is this true?"" in which Jia said in all seriousness ""Well, I haven't heard such a thing."" Duzong replied with ""A palace maid told me this."""
"Lu Wenhuan sent a messenger to Emperor Duzong, to request immediate reinforcements to defend Xiangyang. The messenger successfully got by the Yuan forts and reached the emperor but upon hearing the effectiveness of these new trebuchets, the emperor considered Xiangyang lost and did not send reinforcements. The decisive Battle of Xiangyang was fought in 1274 when the Mongols succeeded in capturing and destroying the last Song stronghold. The loss of Xiangyang sealed the fate of the Song dynasty and the news of its capture was deliberately hidden from Emperor Duzong by Jia Sidao."
"Emperor Duzong died shortly thereafter from overindulgence in wine but Richard Davis and other sources claim that, Duzong died suddenly from a severe negligence of a Palace Doctor. In any case, he was succeeded by his sixth son, Zhao Xian (Emperor Gong), who was then only four years old. Although Emperor Duzong was technically not the last emperor of the Song dynasty, historians see him as the last Song emperor who could have made decisions that would've significantly halted or even prevented the fall of the dynasty."
Emperor Duzong was buried in the Yongshao Mausoleum on January 1275.

During the reign of Andrew II, he was a faithful supporter of crown prince Béla, who held the title of Duke of Transylvania after 1226, following the agreement between the king and his son after a series of conflicts for the throne. Sometime Duke Béla acted independently of his father, as it is demonstrated by his grant of tax exemption to Transylvanian knights in 1231 and by his donation of lands situated in Wallachia in 1233. Pousa served as master of the treasury (""camerarius"") for Béla in 1225."
"He was appointed voivode of Transylvania in 1227. According to László Markó, he held the office between 1226 and 1229, however existing charters only prove the term of voivodeship in 1227. He served as master of the horse for duke Béla between 1229 and 1233."
"When Béla ascended the throne in 1235, Pousa was appointed voivode of Transylvania for the second time. In 1241, Transylvania suffered during the Mongol invasion of Europe. Güyük Khan invaded the province from the Oituz Pass in March. Voivode Pousa fought them with his royal army near Burzenland (), where he fell in battle on 31 March 1241.

= = = AVX-512 = = =
"AVX-512 are 512-bit extensions to the 256-bit Advanced Vector Extensions SIMD instructions for x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) proposed by Intel in July 2013, and implemented in Intel's Xeon Phi x200 (Knights Landing) and Skylake-X CPUs; this includes the Core-X series (excluding the Core i5-7640X and Core i7-7740X), as well as the new Xeon Scalable Processor Family and Xeon D-2100 Embedded Series."
"AVX-512 is not the first 512-bit SIMD instruction set that Intel has introduced in processors: the earlier 512-bit SIMD instructions used in the first generation Xeon Phi coprocessors, derived from Intel's Larrabee project, are similar but not binary compatible and only partially source compatible."
AVX-512 consists of multiple extensions that may be implemented independently. This policy is a departure from the historical requirement of implementing the entire instruction block. Only the core extension AVX-512F (AVX-512 Foundation) is required by all AVX-512 implementations.
"The AVX-512 instruction set consists of several separate sets each having their own unique CPUID feature bit; however, they are typically grouped by the processor generation that implements them."
"The VEX prefix used by AVX and AVX2, while flexible, did not leave enough room for the features Intel wanted to add to AVX-512. This has led them to define a new prefix called EVEX."
"Compared to VEX, EVEX adds the following benefits:"
"The extended registers, SIMD width bit, and opmask registers of AVX-512 are mandatory and all require support from the OS."
"The AVX-512 instructions are designed to mix with 128/256-bit AVX/AVX2 instructions without a performance penalty. However, AVX-512VL extensions allows the use of AVX-512 instructions on 128/256-bit registers XMM/YMM, so most SSE and AVX/AVX2 instructions have new AVX-512 versions encoded with the EVEX prefix which allow access to new features such as opmask and additional registers. Unlike AVX-256, the new instructions do not have new mnemonics but share namespace with AVX, making the distinction between VEX and EVEX encoded versions of an instruction ambiguous in the source code. Since AVX-512F only works on 32- and 64-bit values, SSE and AVX/AVX2 instructions that operate on bytes or words are available only with the AVX-512BW extension (Byte & Word support)."
"The width of the SIMD register file is increased from 256 bits to 512 bits, and expanded from 16 to a total of 32 registers ZMM0-ZMM31. These registers can be addressed as 256 bit YMM registers from AVX extensions and 128-bit XMM registers from Streaming SIMD Extensions, and legacy AVX and SSE instructions can be extended to operate on the 16 additional registers XMM16-XMM31 and YMM16-YMM31 when using EVEX encoded form."
"Most AVX-512 instructions may indicate one of 8 opmask registers (k0–k7). For instructions which use a mask register as an opmask, register `k0` is special: a hardcoded constant used to indicate unmasked operations. For other operations, such as those that write to an opmask register or perform arithmetic or logical operations, `k0` is a functioning, valid register. In most instructions, the opmask is used to control which values are written to the destination. A flag controls the opmask behavior, which can either be ""zero"", which zeros everything not selected by the mask, or ""merge"", which leaves everything not selected untouched. The merge behavior is identical to the blend instructions."
"The opmask registers are normally 16 bits wide, but can be up to 64 bits with the AVX-512BW extension. How many of the bits are actually used, though, depends on the vector type of the instructions masked. For the 32-bit single float or double words, 16 bits are used to mask the 16 elements in a 512-bit register. For double float and quad words, at most 8 mask bits are used."
"The opmask register is the reason why several bitwise instructions which naturally have no element widths had them added in AVX-512. For instance, bitwise AND, OR or 128-bit shuffle now exist in both double-word and quad-word variants with the only difference being in the final masking."
"The opmask registers have a new mini extension of instructions operating directly on them. Unlike the rest of the AVX-512 instructions, these instructions are all VEX encoded. The initial opmask instructions are all 16-bit (Word) versions. With AVX-512DQ 8-bit (Byte) versions were added to better match the needs of masking 8 64-bit values, and with AVX-512BW 32-bit (Double) and 64-bit (Quad) versions were added so they can mask up to 64 8-bit values. The instructions KORTEST and KTEST can be used to set the x86 flags based on mask registers, so that they may be used together with non-SIMD x86 branch and conditional instructions."
"Many AVX-512 instructions are simply EVEX versions of old SSE or AVX instructions. There are, however, several new instructions, and old instructions that have been replaced with new AVX-512 versions. The new or majorly reworked instructions are listed below. These ""foundation"" instructions also include the extensions from AVX-512VL and AVX-512BW since those extensions merely add new versions of these instructions instead of new instructions."

The hospital was named in honor of Frances Siedliska, the founder of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. The hospital opened on March 18, 1937 – one day ahead of schedule – to care for victims of the New London School explosion."
"In 1948, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth completed the purchase of the hospital from the City of Tyler and in October 1965, Mother Frances Week was celebrated in Tyler, dedicating a new wing. This $4.5 million wing added 110 new patient beds and a new cafeteria to the hospital."
"In 1934, The Trinity Clinic began as The Bryant Clinic. It was founded by Dr. William Howard Bryant and Dr. Sidney W. Bradford. The Bryant Clinic received the first call for help in Tyler to treat the victims of the New London tragedy. In 1948, The Bryant Clinic changed its name to The Medical & Surgical Clinic and later, with the addition of two other Tyler-area medical practices, became Trinity Clinic. Today, Trinity Clinic is the area's biggest multi-specialty medical group, with over 300 providers representing 38 specialties in 36 clinic locations in East Texas."
"In 1995, Mother Frances Hospital and Trinity Clinic merged, creating Trinity Mother Frances Health System, one of the first integrated health care systems in the United States. In 2007, Trinity Mother Frances Health System changed its name to Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics."
"In May 2016, Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics merged with CHRISTUS Health to create CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System and CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic."

The firm was formally incorporated on May 23, 1899, and held the distinction of being ""the largest business of its kind outside of New York City."" The store was first located at 187-189 South State Street in the Chicago Loop (the city of Chicago's central business and shopping district) and later moved to the John Crerar Library building at 150 North Michigan Avenue where it remained until the department store ceased operations in 1979. At the time of its closing, Shayne's was a department store specializing in women's ready-to-wear, couture and furs."
"The achievements of the Shayne brothers in the manufacture of fine furs helped to bring a newfound respect for American manufactured furs which were primarily reserved only for the elite European manufacturing houses of Russia, France and Germany. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (also known as the Chicago's World Fair), ""The New York Times"" reported, ""The joint exhibit of C.C Shayne of New-York and John T. Shayne of this city has received awards which, by reason of their number and their language, leave no doubt that the Shayne fur products surpass those made in any part of the world."""
"On July 10, 1894, John T. Shayne commented to the Committee of Finance of the United States Senate that U.S. furriers were losing significant income from garments that were manufactured overseas and then brought back to this country duty-free by tourists. Shayne stated to the Committee of Finance, ""I could get up a petition that would almost reach from the Senate Chamber to the White House, but do not wish to encroach upon your valuable time."""
John T. Shayne & Company was one of the earliest Chicago retailers to join in America's burgeoning mail order business during the turn of the 20th century. Shayne's first mail order publication dates back to 1906 and is featured in the Chicago Public Library Trade Catalog Collection at the Harold Washington Library.
"Mail order merchandising played an important role in retail distribution during the 20th century. These catalogues provided rural communities access to an array of merchandise; items ranging from tooth paste to prefabricated houses were marketed to small towns and remote rural communities, transforming the way American's purchased goods."
"Chicago area retailers were among the nation's first companies to publish mail orders. The city was ideally suited for America's growing mail order business due to its central location, access to a national rail system and advances made in mail delivery. Chicago became a nationally recognized city through the many images that found their way into these mail order catalogs. These publications shaped the nation's perspective of Chicago and encouraged tourism to the city."
"On March 21, 1899, ""The New York Times"" reported, ""John T. Shayne, a wealthy furrier, and a prominent Democratic politician, brother of C.C. Shayne of New York, was shot, and probably fatally wounded, this afternoon by Harry H. Hammond, a tailor. The shooting occurred in the cafe of the Auditorium Annex, where Shayne was sitting at lunch with Mrs. Hammond, the divorced wife of Hammond, and two other ladies."" Shayne did miraculously recover from the shooting incident."
"Patrick Dennis, author of the bestselling novel ""Auntie Mame"" referenced John T. Shayne and Company in his subsequent novel ""Little Me"". The main character of the novel, Belle Poitrine, describes her shopping spree ""I went on a mad round of shopping -diamonds and pearls- from Peacock's, glossy furs from John T.

"John McPherson (19 June 1868 – 31 July 1926) was a Scottish footballer who played for Cowlairs, Kilmarnock, Rangers and the Scotland national team."
"Born in Kilmarnock and known as 'Kitey' from a young age, McPherson started his career with his local side Kilmarnock, winning the Ayrshire Cup in 1885. He appeared for English club Everton as an amateur in 1887, also playing for Cowlairs of Glasgow in the early rounds of the 1887–88 Scottish Cup, which led to a protest by their defeated opponents Third Lanark over the possibility of McPherson and others having professional status (prohibited at the time). Another player (Robert Calderwood) was found to have been paid by an English club and the match was replayed, with Cowlairs winning again. McPherson did not return to Everton, featuring instead for Kilmarnock in the same edition of the Scottish Cup before spending the next two years with Cowlairs, after which he joined Rangers in 1890."
"McPherson played mainly as a striker at Rangers, but was often used in other positions including goalkeeper. He played in the inaugural Scottish League season, 1890–91, where Rangers finished as joint champions with Dumbarton. McPherson's first recorded appearance was in a friendly against Everton on 19 April 1890 at Ibrox, and he scored in a 6–2 defeat. His first League appearance, however, was in Rangers' first ever Scottish League match, on 16 August 1890 in a 5–2 win over Hearts at Ibrox, in which he scored. McPherson scored 15 goals in Rangers' 18 matches in the League that season, including four in a 6–2 win over Cambuslang at Whitefield Park on 23 August 1890 (the first ever hat-trick scored in the Scottish Football League) and five in an 8–2 win over St Mirren on 4 October 1890."
"Despite Rangers' successful introduction to the Scottish Football League, they had to wait until season 1898–99 to win the League title again. It was done in style as Rangers won all of their 18 League matches, with McPherson netting 10 times. That remarkable season was the first of four consecutive League titles and McPherson made significant contributions to all of them, scoring nine goals in 1899–1900, seven in 1900–01 and three in 1901–02 — which proved to be his last season with Rangers."
"McPherson also won three Scottish Cup medals with Rangers, the first in 1894, where he scored in five of Rangers' six matches, including the 3–1 final win over Celtic at Hampden. McPherson also scored in the 1897 final, where Rangers defeated Dumbarton 5–1. His third medal came a year later, 1898, in a 2–0 win over his former club Kilmarnock. His final recorded appearance for Rangers was in a 2–0 friendly defeat to Glentoran on 2 April 1902."
"McPherson was also a Scottish International, winning a total of nine caps and scoring six goals. He is one of four players named John McPherson (none of whom are related) to have represented Scotland at full international level. He also played five times for the Scottish League representative side."
"A qualified engine–fitter, McPherson maintained a close association with Rangers after his playing years, serving as a director from 1907 until his death in 1926 at the age of 58. He is buried in Craigton Cemetery not far from Ibrox Stadium."
"McPherson had several family members involved in football. His son, also John, played at Junior level with Benburb, and his grandson Johnny (known as 'Sailor' due to his wartime navy service) played a single league match for Rangers in 1948 followed by spells at senior level with Ayr United and in the juniors with Irvine Meadow."
"In addition, his younger brother David was a teammate at Rangers, had a long spell at Kilmarnock (including in the 1898 Scottish Cup Final where he and John were on the opposing teams) and was also a Scottish international. Elder brother James was a teammate at Kilmarnock, Cowlairs and the Glasgow FA team, played as a guest for Celtic and spent a lengthy period as a trainer at Newcastle United working with Frank Watt; when James retired, the role was taken by his son , whose previous jobs included the Norway squad at the 1920 Olympics, Vitesse in the Netherlands and Bayern Munich in Germany. Another of James's sons was also a trainer/manager who led HBS to the Dutch championship in 1925, while his daughter Mary married Newcastle player and Germany international Edwin Dutton."

The first ""megatrend"" is ""Power of Nature"" which is the industry looking into materials that have always been looked at as waste as a more sustainable method to making new clothing. The materials that will mitigate negative impacts from the industry include vegan materials from the earth and recycling old fabric into new clothing. The second ""megatrend"" is ""Rent a Closet""; this initiative has been around for a while. This trend ultimately lowers the new purchase of clothing and disposal of clothing, which means less waste. Rent the Runway is an example of the ""Rent a Closet"" trend. Rent the Runway started as a company that would give luxury brands like Hervé Leger, Vera Wang, Etro to people who may not be able to afford the clothing at regular retail price. Renting and sharing clothing is also known as CFC (collaborative fashion consumption) a sustainable fashion trend consumers are getting involved in. The third trend is ""Long Live Fashion"" is the revival of Vintage clothing. Vintage clothing is a way to lower the amount of clothing that gets disposed of and ends up in landfills. Companies like RE/DONE, Vintage Twin and Frankie Collective sell re-paired vintage clothing. Repairing and reselling clothing has less negative impact than creating new clothing does. The fourth megatrend is ""innovative recycling"" which is looking at waste as value. The industry is starting to create incentives for consumers to participate in the recycling of clothing."
Tailored couture is one option for the future of a greener fashion industry as it can potentially lead to less waste and more jobs improving the economy. Tailored couture is no longer desired because of the convenience of malls and stores provide but the consequence of the convenience is the pollution of the environment. Tailored clothing if it were to become the norm mass production of clothing that will not be bought can be reduced and reusing and redesigning old clothes to fit could reduce the amount of old worn out unfitting clothes thrown out or given away.
"In 2019, the UK Parliament's Environment Audit Committee published a report and recommendations on the future of fashion sustainability, suggesting wide-ranging systemic change, not least government regulation and tax-incentives for sustainable practices, such as lowered VAT for repair services. As highlighted in the report, wide political and social changes are needed to push industry towards more sustainable practices and levels of consumption: brands doing ""less harm"" is not enough. The report finishes with the following statement;""Retailers must take responsibility for the social and environmental cost of clothes. They should use their market power to demand higher environmental and labour standards from suppliers. Offering rental schemes, lifetime repair and providing the consumer with more information about the sourcing and true cost of clothing are all measures that can be more widely adopted. Shifting business practice in this way can not only improve a business’s environmental and social impact but also offer market advantage as they respond to the growing consumer demand for responsible, sustainable clothing.""(p.54)"

= = = Palinuro = = =
"Palinuro is an Italian small town, the most populated civil parish (""frazione"") of Centola, Province of Salerno, in the Campania region. The name of the town is derived from Palinurus, the helmsman of Aeneas, as recorded in the fifth and sixth books of the ""Aeneid""."
"Palinuro lies on the southern side of Cilento, on the Tyrrhenian Sea and in the northern part of Cape Palinuro. The town, situated at the estuaries of the Lambro and Mingardo rivers, is also the main port of the comune. It is 7 km from Centola, 8 km from Marina di Camerota, 10 km from Pisciotta and 80 km from Salerno."
"Palinuro is part of the Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park, an area of ""shrubland"" typical of Mediterranean countries."
"It is popular with tourists, especially in summer, due to the cleanliness of its waters and beautiful beaches; and is regularly awarded five stars Blue Flag <br>"
"The town is also famous for the caves along its coast, which are regularly visited, especially by frogmen."
"The town is linked to Salerno and Naples by hydrofoils. The nearest main road is 10 km to the north, connecting Salerno-Battipaglia-Paestum-Agropoli-Vallo della Lucania-Policastro-Sapri."
"The nearest railway station, Pisciotta-Palinuro (on the Naples-Reggio Calabria line) is 8 km to the north and is linked to the town by regular buses."
"The Arco Naturale beach of Palinuro was selected as a location in various films including Jason and the Argonauts, Hercules and the Captive Women, and Clash of the Titans."
= = = Down in the Boondocks (song) = = =
"""Down in the Boondocks"" is a song written by Joe South, with sampling from Gene Pitney's ""Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa"", and recorded by American artist Billy Joe Royal. It was a hit in 1965, reaching number 9 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart. In the UK, it hit number 38 on the ""Record Retailer"" chart. In Canada, the song reached #1 on the RPM Magazine charts, August 9, 1965. The song comes from the album ""Down in the Boondocks""."
"The song is sung from the perspective of a self-proclaimed ""boy from down in the boondocks."" He sings of a girl who lives nearby, for whom he feels love and he steals away with occasionally. The people who live or are born in the boondocks are suggested to be a lower class than those in the city. The girl's father is the singer's boss man, which, along with the social division, prevents him from proclaiming his love and connecting with them, despite the shared feelings (which is the basis for the line ""but I don't dare knock on her door/for her daddy is my boss man""). The singer proclaims that ""one fine day, I'll find a way, to move from this old shack,"" presumably to be able to join the higher class members of society and finally be able to date the girl within the public eye."
"Session musicians on this recording included Reggie Young on electric guitar, Bill Hullett on acoustic guitar, Sam Levine on horns, Clayton Ivey on piano, Bob Wray on six string bass, and Greg Morrow on drums."
"Penny DeHaven's 1969 version reached No. 37 on the ""Billboard"" country chart. The song was covered in 1978 by Kenny Loggins on his ""Nightwatch"" album, and twice in 1980, first by Ry Cooder, included it on his album, ""Borderline"" and by D.L. Byron, featuring backing vocals by Billy Joel. It was also recorded by Depeche Mode member Martin Gore for his first solo CD ""Counterfeit E.P."" in 1989 but was ultimately left out of the final track listing. In 2012 the band U.S. Girls covered the song on their album ""Gem"". The country vocal group Home Free covered the song for their album ""Country Evolution"". Holy Sons (Emil Amos) covered the song on the album Decline of the West Volumes 1 and 2."
"Marjanović was born into a large working-class family with 7 children in Knin, in the Littoral Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia). He had 4 brothers and 2 sisters. His father, Dušan, worked in the local factory, while mother Marija was a homemaker."
"After completing primary school and gymnasium in his hometown, Marjanović moved to Zagreb where he attended musical academy which he never finished."
"He then moved to Belgrade, where in 1960 he graduated at University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics, more specifically at the department for microeconomics."
"Upon graduation, Marjanović came back to Knin since he found employment there as the supervisor in Tvik factory. From there, he advanced to the position of financial director, and eventually moving on to metallurgical factory in Zenica. In 1973, he transferred to the Moscow outpost of Progres - a state company that handled close to 80% of Yugoslav black metallurgy and other heavy industries."
"By 1976 he quickly advanced up the ranks to become one of the directors at Progres. He handled company's steel division in Russia quite successfully while developing an impressive network of influential friends and business partners such as Viktor Chernomyrdin (later to become Prime Minister of Russia), and Yuri Brezhnev, son of Leonid Brezhnev."
"In 1979, Marjanović was named as Progres' general director."
"From 1989 until 1994, he was the president of FK Partizan's executive board. One of his more notable moves while at the post was bringing Predrag Mijatović to the club in December 1989. Mijatović, at the time a young promising player from Titograd's FK Budućnost, was very close to signing with Hajduk Split when Marjanović stepped in and convinced him to come to Belgrade. Upon leaving the club, Marjanović was named Partizan's honorary president."
Marjanović officially commenced his PM term on 18 March 1994. He was widely regarded as little more than a puppet of then Serbian president Slobodan Milošević.
"After early parliamentary elections in late 1997, Milošević's SPS-led coalition (with Yugoslav Left and New Democracy) formed a government with far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS) led by Vojislav Šešelj. Marjanović was picked for another PM term that started on March 24, 1998."
"Naturally, Marjanović continued as a mere extension of Slobodan Milošević who at this time held the post of President of Yugoslavia. Here's how sources from the top levels of Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia described Marjanović's government modus operandi in ""Evropljanin"" magazine: ""Prime Minister Marjanović suggests something – ministers do not vote – and then Marjanović simply concludes the matter as agreed on. Of course Marjanović neither suggests nor concludes anything without first consulting Milošević"". (""Evropljanin"" issue #13, 19 October 1998, p. 15)"
"Even deputy PM Vojislav Šešelj indirectly confirmed this operating procedure when he said the government meetings are always well prepared, never lasting longer than 15–20 minutes. (""Srpska slobodarska misao"", Vol. I 2000, issue #1, p. 142)"
"This two-year period is widely seen as the most brutal whilst Serbia was led by Milošević. Marjanović's government (with Šešelj as its deputy PM), passed two of what critics consider to be the most draconian pieces of legislation in Serbian political history: the University Law that stripped the University of Belgrade of its autonomy, opening the way for the government to install professors, deans and rectors, as well as the Information Law, which aimed to restrict the activities of media financed by political enemies; despite this, the media played a prominent role in the 5 October 2000 coup d'état."
"Similarly to his first term in office, Marjanović again took a back seat, leaving the limelight to more aggressive members of his cabinet like deputy PM Šešelj and Minister of Information Aleksandar Vučić."
"On 21 October 2000, two weeks after the Bulldozer Revolution, Marjanović resigned to be replaced by a transitional government composed of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) until new parliamentary elections could be organized."
"Marjanović continued to lead Progres all throughout his six and a half years as Serbian PM, though he claimed his status at the company was frozen. The company, which during the 1990s started importing gas from Russia (deal personally negotiated by Marjanović) was still officially publicly owned."
"Although allegations of wrongdoing ran rampant for years, Marjanović was never prosecuted. No legal action was taken against him after the new authorities took office following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000. On 23 January 2002, Marjanović was re-elected as Progres' main board president."
"He died on 21 February 2006, in Belgrade, at age of 68, from undisclosed causes."

For the 2006 U.S. World Team Trials in March, Schultz was named skip, or captain, of Team USA (the team's regular skip, Cassie Johnson, did not play in the tournament), and the team finished fourth under her direction."
"She joined the Erika Brown rink in 2011. Brown and her team won the 2013 United States Women's Curling Championship and went on to represent the United States at the 2013 World Women's Curling Championship, finishing in fourth after losing the bronze medal game to Canada's Rachel Homan. They also qualified to participate at the 2014 United States Olympic Curling Trials.

"Bobby Kingsbury (born August 30, 1980) in Cleveland, Ohio, is an American baseball player. He is a two-time Atlantic 10 Player of the Year and went on to play in the Pittsburgh Pirates minor-league organization. Kingsbury was the first baseball player to earn back-to-back Atlantic 10 Player of the Year Awards, in 2001 and 2002. He went to school at Fordham where he set an NCAA record for stolen bases in a game (8), and was drafted by the Pirates in the 8th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, but his excellent glove, a quick bat, an intelligent hitting approach, and his work ethic could have given him a third or fourth-round pick if he'd gone to a warm-weather college."
"During the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens, Greece, Kingsbury, who has a Greek grandmother, was given the chance to play for the host nation, Greece. Most of the players on the Greek baseball team were Americans with Greek heritage, including North Florida coach Dusty Rhodes, and White Sox scout John Kazanas, Clay Bellinger of the Orioles, outfielders Nick Markakis the Orioles and Nick Theodorou of the Dodgers, and catchers Mike Tonis of Royals and George Kottaras of the Padres."
"Kingsbury, an alumnus and 2008 Hall of Fame inductee of Fordham University and current member of the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, picked up one of the biggest hits of the tournament for Greece, an RBI triple, in their lone win, which came against Italy in the preliminary round."
"In the spring of 2006, Kingsbury was invited to the Pirates major-league camp in Bradenton, FL as a non-roster invitee. During the seventh inning of the first game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Kingsbury dove for a ball in right field and upon hitting the ground dislocated his left throwing shoulder. He fully tore his rotator cuff and labrum thus ending his 2006 campaign."
"A common Renaissance and Baroque theme is females that are abducted or seduced by divinities. This includes Leda and the swan as Zeus, as well as Europa, Antiope, and Danae. Many portrayals of women being seduced by divinities are shown in a sensual manner. For instance, Rubens's ""Leda"", is very erotic. Leda is shown fully nude with her buttocks and left breast being visible. The swan is caressing her on her most intimate area with its neck cradled between her breasts. The swan is depicted as a graceful animal who also can ravish."
"There are many variations to the myth of Leda and the swan. Leda is sometimes called Nemesis and other times they are two separate people. Leda was married to the king of Sparta, Tyndareus. She is the mother of several children though she is most known for giving birth to Clytemnestra, Helen, Pollux, and Castor. The most common myth claims that Zeus transformed himself into a swan to couple with Leda. Some versions claim that she loved Zeus and willing had sexual relations with him, while other versions claim she was seduced and therefore was not willing. That same night, she coupled with Tyndareus also. Leda then gave birth to four children at the same time. The two pairs of twins resulted in Helen and Pollux belonging to Zeus, and Clytemnestra and Castor belonging to Tyndareus. Though each pair is attributed to either Zeus or Tyndareus, each man is said to be the father of all four children. Castor and Pollux were called the Dioscuri meaning “Zeus’s sons,” even though Castor was mortal because he was the son of Tyndareus and Pollux was immortal because he was the son of Zeus."
"According to Hermes in Lucians’ ""The Dialogues of the Dead"", Leda and her daughter (Helen of Troy) are the only women worthy of the title “beauties of old.” Rubens's depictions of Leda clearly embody the phrase. With Leda's curvy figure, alabaster skin, and golden hair, she is a sight to behold. Because Rubens was known for this type of female figures, Leda was the perfect subject to paint. Rubens became famous partly for his Rubenesque figures and were not common at the time, making his two ""Leda’s"" stand out even more."

= = = Control Center (iOS) = = =
"Control Center (or Control Centre in some countries) is a feature of Apple Inc.'s iOS operating system, introduced as part of iOS 7, released on September 18, 2013. It gives iOS devices direct access to important settings for the device by swiping a finger up from the bottom of the display (or a swipe down from the top right corner on iPhone X, XS and XR series and iPad devices). It is similar to the SBSettings tweak for iOS jailbreaking."
"Control Center gives iOS users quick access to commonly used controls and apps. By swiping up from any screen – including the Lock screen (if the control center is set to be accessed from the lock screen) – users can do such things as switch on Airplane mode, turn Wi-Fi on or off, adjust the display brightness and similar basic functions of the device."
"Since iOS 7, it also included an integrated flashlight function to operate the reverse camera's flash LED as a flashlight. The flashlight feature is only available on iPhone and iPod Touch, and iPad Pro. Beginning with iOS 9.3, a Night Shift toggle became available through the Control Center on all iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad models that have an Apple A7 chip or later."
"Other functions are offered, such as the ability to turn Bluetooth, and Do Not Disturb on or off; lock the screen's orientation; play, pause, or skip a song, see what is playing; connect to AirPlay-enabled devices; and quickly access the clock, calculator, and camera apps. Users also have access to AirDrop, previously only available on Macs and newly added to iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch models using the Lightning connector in iOS 7, as a method of transferring files between Apple devices."
"In iOS 7 through iOS 9, it featured a single-paged slide up panel with a blurred background, which provided a layer of translucency over the content below. The design for the most part remained the same, aside from a few small, occasional changes. Due to the intense resources needed to create a blurred effect, iPhone 4, iPad 2 and iPad 3 do not feature a translucent background, and instead feature a grey background with slight transparency without blur."
"In iOS 10, it morphed into a card-like design with a white background, and separated into three separate cards accessible by swiping horizontally. The first card consisted of main device controls, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Do Not Disturb, while the second page was dedicated to media controls, and the third page for controlling HomeKit enabled devices linked in the Home application."
"The Control Center received a significant redesign in iOS 11, unifying its different pages into one and allowing users to 3D Touch (or long press on devices without 3D Touch) the icons for additional options, and vertical sliders allow users to adjust volume and brightness. The Control Center is customizable via the Settings app, and allows for a wider range of settings features to be shown, including cellular service, Low Power Mode, and a shortcut to the Notes app. These changes are still present in the current stable release of iOS 12."
"iOS 12 brought few new additions to Control Center, but of them, the most notable being updates to Do Not Disturb. Now, when users 3D Touch, or long press the Do Not Disturb icon, it allows them to automatically set when a Do Not Disturb session will end. Current options include setting it to turn off after one hour, when leaving your current location, the next morning, or when a calendar event ends."
"Control Center has received generally positive reviews. In contrast for the user having to access the Settings application to change most preferences, Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch thought that ""separating [Control Center] from that function and making it accessible throughout the iOS user interface via a simple swipe up from bottom is a really big improvement."""
"The iOS 11 update was criticized for changing the way the buttons for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work; more specifically, the toggles would disconnect devices from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, while leaving the radios on. The Electronic Frontier Foundation stated that this change not only hurt battery life, but was also bad for security, describing the buttons as turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ""off-ish"" (greyed out, but not crossed out, as it would appear if switched off directly from the Settings app), as well as further criticizing the connections resuming at 5:00 am everyday."

"The ashy-gray tube-nosed bat (""Murina cineracea"") , is a species in the vesper bat family Vespertilionidae, found in southern Asia, including Pakistan, northern India, Burma, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. They have tube-shaped nostrils (hence the name) which assist them with their feeding."
"The ashy-gray bat is one of 126 new species found in the Greater Mekong region during 2011. There were two other tube-nosed bats found in Southeast Asia in 2011: Beelzebub's tube-nosed bat (""Murina beelzebub"") and Walston's tube-nosed bat (""Murina walstoni""). All three species are small for bats and ""M. cineracea"" is small for a ""Murina"" bat. These three new tube-nosed bats were discovered by a team from the Hungarian Natural History Museum (HNHM) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI). All three of these bats live in tropical forests, making them endangered by deforestation."
"The name ""ashy-gray"" comes from the color of their dorsal fur, while the ventral fur is dark gray, and there is some white fur on the breast area. In some areas the tips of the hair are dark. It lacks the golden guard hairs so common in other members of the genus ""Murina"". This bat is small enough to fit in a person's hand, weighing . As of 2013, there are still few details known about them and their ecology and it is suspected there are many more species of bats yet to be discovered in the region."
"Vespertilionid bats have many cryptic species. As an example, the members of the ashy-gray bat were formerly classified as Scully's tube-nosed bat (""Murina tubinaris""). Eight new species were found in Southeast Asia between 2005-2009. The use of DNA technology has proved very useful in differentiating between the various species of ""Murina""."

"Unlike the communities of Altenburg, Frohna and Uniontown that were settled by Saxon Lutherans from Germany, Friedenberg was founded in 1838 by Lutheran immigrants from Bavaria, Germany. These Bavarians came from the Upper Franconian region, some from the city of Langenstadt near present-day Kulmbach. These immigrants worshiped in members’ homes until a log church was built in 1846 north of Cinque Hommes Creek. From 1852 until 1885 the congregation worshiped at their church on Frankenberg overlooking the Cinque Hommes Bottoms. In 1885 the congregation moved to its present site in Friedenberg and built a brick church. Peace Lutheran church disbanded in 1980."
= = = CBD and South East Light Rail = = =
"The CBD and South East Light Rail is a partly-opened Australian light rail line in Sydney, New South Wales, running from Circular Quay at the northern end of the central business district to the south-eastern suburbs of Randwick and Kingsford. It is part of Sydney's light rail network. Major construction commenced in October 2015. The project is being managed by Transport for NSW. Construction, operation and maintenance of the line is contracted to the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium."
"Passenger services between Circular Quay and Randwick, known as the L2 Randwick Line, commenced on 14 December 2019, while services between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford, known as the L3 Kingsford Line, are expected to commence in March 2020."
"Since the light rail network's original line opened in 1997, a line through the Sydney central business district had been suggested numerous times but failed to achieve State Government support. This changed in February 2010 when the Keneally Government announced a new line from Haymarket to Circular Quay via Barangaroo. The final route was not decided, with the three options being to send the line north via George Street, Sussex Street or a loop using both."
"When the O'Farrell Government took office in March 2011, it committed to building a line through the CBD to Barangaroo, with a preferred route along George Street. It also committed to conducting feasibility studies into the construction of lines from the City to Sydney University and the City to the University of New South Wales. On 8 December 2011, the government announced shortlisted potential routes for these extensions. In 2012, Transport for NSW (TfNSW) decided the routes to Sydney University and Barangaroo via The Rocks provided fewer customer benefits and were considered a lower priority. A route from Circular Quay to the University of New South Wales via Central station was seen as the best option."
"On 13 December 2012, the government announced a commitment to build a $1.6 billion line from Circular Quay down George Street to Central station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade with branches to Kingsford and Randwick. Construction was expected to begin in 2014 and to take five to six years."
The line services areas that were previously served by Sydney's former tram network. Some of the new route follows tram lines of the former network.
The route is mostly on-street but includes an off-street section through Moore Park. The only major engineering works on the line were a new bridge over the Eastern Distributor and a tunnel under Moore Park and Anzac Parade. There will be between eight and ten new traffic light controlled intersections created along the route.
"Several changes to the design were announced in December 2014. The major changes involve revising platform lengths at all stops to support an increase in the length of the trams from 45 metres to 67 metres, redesigning several stops, switching technologies for the delivery of the wire-free section and the removal of a proposed stop at World Square. It was also announced that the projected cost had increased from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion. The government claimed the increase was due to the design modifications, but a 2016 report produced by the Audit Office of New South Wales found that the increase was largely due to TfNSW underestimating the cost of the project."
"A pedestrian zone was established along approximately 40% of George Street, between Bathurst and Hunter Streets."
"The section between Bathurst Street and Circular Quay is wire-free, with trams using Alstom's proprietary ground-level power supply technology to run instead. This was originally to have been achieved by equipping the trams with batteries and providing recharging facilities at stops."
"The line is designed to handle special events in the Moore Park precinct and at Randwick Racecourse. Events at Moore Park were initially planned to be served using two coupled trams long, with double length platforms at the Central Station and Moore Park stops. Following the decision to make all tram vehicles operate in coupled pairs with a total length of , the plans to build double length platforms at Central and Moore Park were abandoned, and platforms of all stops will be long."
"A depot for the trams was built at the north-western corner of Randwick Racecourse, providing stabling facilities and allowing light maintenance. Heavy maintenance will be conducted at the Lilyfield Maintenance Depot at the site of the former Rozelle Yard. The maintenance depot will be accessed via the Inner West Light Rail."
"The line was built as a public-private partnership (PPP), with the contract covering detailed design, major construction, operation and maintenance of the line as well as the provision of rolling stock. A contract for early construction works was awarded to Laing O'Rourke in July 2014."
"In February 2014, three consortia were short listed for the main contract – covering the construction and operation of the line:"
The iLinQ consortium withdrew after Balfour Beatty pulled out. Balfour Beatty was reportedly concerned about cost overruns for the project and falling profitability of the company as a whole.
"The Udzungwa Mountains are a mountain range in south-central Tanzania. The mountains are mostly within Iringa Region, south of Tanzania's capital Dodoma. The Udzungwa Mountains are part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, and are home to a biodiverse community of flora and fauna with large numbers of endemic species."
"The mountains are home to the Hehe people, and the name Udzungwa comes from the Kihehe word “Wadzungwa"", which means the people who live on mountainsides. Iringa is the largest settlement in the mountains, and the regional headquarters."
"The Undzungwa Mountains cover an area of 16,131.40 km², the largest of the Eastern Arc ranges. The highest peak in the range is Luhombero at . The mountain range extends generally northeast-southwest. The Usangu Plain lies to the northwest, drained by the Great Ruaha River and its tributaries. The Great Ruaha River separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Rubeho Mountains and Uvidunda Mountains to the northeast. The Kilombero River valley lies to the south and southeast. To the southwest the Makambako Gap separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Kipengere Range."
"Both the Great Ruaha and Kilombero rivers are tributaries of the Rufiji River, which empties into the Indian Ocean. The Lukosi River originates in the central part of the range, and empties eastwards into the Great Ruaha. The Little Ruaha River and its tributaries drain much of the western portion of the range, emptying northwards into the Great Ruaha."
"The Udzungwa Mountains intercept moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean, and receive more rainfall than the surrounding lowlands. Most of the rainfall occurs in the November-to-May wet season, although mist and light rain occur at higher elevations during the dry season months. Rainfall is higher on the southern and southeastern slopes facing the Indian Ocean, and lower in the mountains' rain shadow to the north and west. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations."
"The Udzungwa Mountains, along with the others in the Eastern Arc, are made up of ancient crystalline Precambrian rocks that were uplifted over millions of years along fault lines. The most recent period of uplift started 30 million years ago, but the fault system and uplift process may be far older. Soils derived from these ancient rocks are not as fertile as the younger volcanic soils of mountains to the north and west."
"About thirty million years ago, the area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a cooler and drier period some ten million years ago, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as ""islands"" where the tropical forests continued to flourish. The long-term persistence of a humid climate and the isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna. The Udzungwa and other Eastern Arc mountains has extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species). 10 percent of them are protected by the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and the Udzungwa Scarp Nature Forest Reserve."
"The Udzungwa Mountains are covered with lowland rainforest, montane rainforest, miombo woodland, grassland, and heathland. Forests extend from 300 to 2579 meters elevation, and vary in composition and species type with elevation and rainfall. The wetter eastern and southeastern slopes receive more rain from the Indian Ocean and support evergreen forests on the lower slopes; the drier western and northwestern slopes have decidious miombo forests and woodlands at lower elevations and evergreen forests only at higher elevations."
Broad areas of forest on the central plateau have been cleared for agriculture and pasture. An analysis of satellite images taken between 1999 and 2003 found 1353 km² of the mountains were still covered in evergreen forest.
"The mountains are home to many mammals, including Abbott's duiker ""(Cephalophus spadix)"", Kipunji ""(Rungwecebus kipunji)"", and Udzungwa red colobus ""(Cercocebus galeritus)"", and unusual animals such as the grey-faced sengi ""(Rhynchocyon udzungwensis)"". The Udzungwa forest partridge (""Xenoperdix udzungwensis"") is an endemic species, with its closest relatives appearing to be the hill partridges of Asia. Elephants ""(Loxodonta africana)"" are found in the forests along the southern escarpment."
"Although the two mountain groups are ecologically distinct, the Eastern Arc Mountains share many species and plant communities with the Southern Highlands which lie to the southwest across the Makambako Gap. Both are Afromontane regions, home to characteristic montane species and ecologically distinct from the adjacent lowlands. The Southern Highlands' climate is more influenced by Lake Malawi than by the Indian Ocean. Some limited-range montane species, including the Kipunji and Kipengere seedeater ""(Crithagra melanochrous)"", inhabit both the Udzungwa Mountains and the Kipengere Range."
"The Kihansi spray toad ""(Nectophrynoides asperginis)"", which was found only around a waterfall on the Kihansi River, became extinct in the wild in 2009 when an upstream dam altered its habitat. The toads have since been reintroduced after a successful captive breeding program."
"Protected areas include Udzungwa Mountains National Park (2088.69 km²), and Udzungwa Scarp (20,220 ha), Kisinga-Rugaro (14,164 ha) and West Kilombero (c.55,000 ha outside the national park) forest reserves"
"It is possible to visit the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and go hiking and trekking. The park has no roads passable by vehicle and is accessible only by foot. The trekking routes vary, from the short and easy one-hour Sonjo Waterfall hike to the extremely difficult 6 day trek the Lumemo Trail. The most popular route is the Sanje Waterfalls trail, taking about four hours to complete."
"The World Wide Fund for Nature is working with local communities to protect the park and provide conservation and management support, monitoring, research and ecotourism initiatives. The help of the local communities is encouraged by giving them access to resources such as the collection of firewood, harvesting medicinal plants and gathering grass for thatching."
"Tanzania's A104 highway runs from northeast to southwest through the central plateau of the mountains, extending northeastwards to Dodoma and southwestwards to Makambako, Mbeya, and the border with Zambia. The A7 highway meets the A104 at Iringa, and extends eastwards through the mountains to Morogoro and Dar es Salaam."
"The Tazara Railway skirts along the southern escarpment of the Udzungwa Mountains, passing through Kidatu (where it meets the Misuku branch of Tanzania's Central Line at a break of gauge), Katulukilla, Mang’ula, Kiberege, Siginali, Ifakara, Idete, Ruipa, Mbinga, Mngeta, Ikule, Chita, Chisano, Mlimba, Lumumwe, Mpanga, Kitete, Kimbwe, Uchindile, Mgololo, Kiyowela, Kitandililo, and Mahongole."

In 1990, they beat ""Rheydter SV"" 2:0 to claim the national amateur championship.

The next year the club only escaped relegation because a pair of teams that finished ahead of them were denied licenses due to their financial problems. By the turn of the millennium ""Salmrohr"" was playing in the Oberliga Südwest as a fourth division side."

= = = Defense Language Aptitude Battery = = =
"The Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) is a test used by the United States Department of Defense to test an individual's potential for learning a foreign language and thus determining who may pursue training as a military linguist. It consists of 126 multiple-choice questions and the test is scored out of a possible 164 points. The test is composed of five audio sections and one visual section. As of 2009, the test is completely web-based. The test does not attempt to gauge a person's fluency in a given language, but rather to determine their ability to learn a language. The test will give the service member examples of what a selection of words or what a portion of a word means, then asks the test taker to create a specific word from the samples given."
"Preparation for the DLAB includes multiple study guides and practice tests. These resources give one the appropriate means by which to prepare for the test and gauge a possible outcome. However, a study guide for the DLAB is not like traditional studying - you are not learning content that will be on the DLAB, but rather learning the style of the DLAB. Someone failing the test or getting a low score can always retake the DLAB but only after a wait of 6 months. For most service members, this is too long and will cause them to miss the deadline for submitting their scores. Adequate preparation is thus a near-necessity."
The languages are broken into tiers based on their difficulty level for a native English speaker as determined by the Defense Language Institute. The category into which a language is placed also determines the length of its basic course as taught at DLI.
"To qualify to pursue training in a language, one needs a minimum score of 95. The Marines will waive it to 90 for Cat I and Cat II languages and the Navy will waive it to an 85 for Cat I languages, a 90 for Cat II languages, and a 95 for Cat III languages. The Air Force does not currently offer a waiver. The Army National Guard is able to waive a score of 90 into a Cat. IV language."
"The DLAB is typically administered to new and prospective recruits at the United States Military Entrance Processing Command sometime after the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is taken but before a final job category (NEC, MOS, AFSC) is determined. An individual may usually take the DLAB if they score high enough on the ASVAB for linguist training and are interested in doing so. The DLAB is also administered to ROTC cadets while they are still attending college. The DLAB is also used for the Australian Defence Force."
"Furthermore, the DLAB is a required test for officers looking to either join the Foreign Area Officer program or the Olmsted Scholar Program. The required grade for these programs is a 105, but the recommended grade is at least a 130 or above."
"Military personnel interested in retraining into a linguist field typically also must pass the DLAB. In few select cases, the DLAB requirement may be waived if proficiency in a foreign language is already demonstrated via the DLPT."
"While these scores are required to enter a language program of that category, often placement is based upon need rather than score. For example, a service member that receives a score of 115 may be placed in Russian (category III). The maximum score on the DLAB was 176, but has recently been lowered to 164."

"Aribert (or Heribert) (Italian: ""Ariberto da Intimiano"", Lombard: ""Aribert de Intimian"") (Intimiano, between 970 and 980 - Milan, 16 January 1045) was the archbishop of Milan from 1018, a quarrelsome warrior-bishop in an age in which such figures were not uncommon."
"Aribert went to Konstanz in June 1025, with other bishops of Northern Italy, to pay homage to Conrad II of Germany, the beleaguered founder of the Salian dynasty. There, in exchange for privileges, he agreed to crown Conrad with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which the magnates had offered to Odo of Blois."
"This he did, on 26 March 1026, at Milan, for the traditional seat of Lombard coronations, Pavia, was still in revolt against imperial authority. He journeyed to Rome a year later for the imperial coronation of Conrad by Pope John XIX on 26 March 1027; at a synod at the Lateran he negotiated a decision of the precedence of the archdiocese of Milan over that of Ravenna. He subsequently joined an imperial military expedition into the Kingdom of Arles, which Conrad inherited upon the death in 1032 of Rudolph III of Burgundy, but which was contested by Odo."
"In the political arena of Italy, power was disputed between the great territorial magnates— the ""capitanei""— with their vassal captains and the lesser nobility— the ""valvassores""— allied with the burghers of the Italian communes."
"Aribert created enemies among the lower nobility, against whom he perpetrated the worst violences, and with the metropolitan of Ravenna, whose episcopal rights, along with those of the smaller sees, he ignored. A revolt soon engulfed northern Italy and, at Aribert's request, Conrad's son, the Emperor Henry III, travelled south of the Alps in the winter of 1036/37, to quell it. The Emperor, however, took the position of champion of the ""valvassores"" and demanded that Aribert should make a defence against charges brought against him, but Aribert refused, on the grounds that he was the emperor's equal."
"Jason Ankeny of Allmusic gave the album a positive review, describing it as ""one of the group's most personal and dark records."" ""The Chicago Tribune"" critic David Levinsky wrote that ""the LP suffers from overly lush production, supplying one too many monolithic synth chords.""

= = = Salomée Halpir = = =
"Regina Salomée Halpir (1718 – after 1763) was an 18th-century oculist. She often earns the title of the first female doctor from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. What is known about her life is known from her memoirs, written in 1760, which is a unique example of travel memoir and women's literature. Halpir expressed decidedly un-womanly characteristics and ambitions. Instead of dedicating her life to raising children and being a good wife, as dictated by the 18th-century social norms, Halpir strove to become a successful medical doctor and expressed her hunger for travel and adventure."
"She is known under a great variety of names. Her first name is often given as Salomea, Salome, or Salomėja. In her memoir, she referred to herself as Salomea, but she signed the dedication as Regina. Her maiden name is rendered as Rusiecki, Rusiecka, Ruseckaitė, Rusieckich. Halpir or Halpirowa is her married name from the first marriage. Her name from the second marriage is rendered as Pilstein, Pilsztyn, Pilsztynowa, Pilštyniova, or Pichelstein. Even after bitter divorce from her second husband she continued to use his last name, perhaps because it sounded more noble. In the dedication of her memoir she used the fourth surname – Makowska. It has been suggested that it is the surname of her third husband, but the origin of that surname remains unknown."
"Halpir was born near Navahrudak, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, to the family of Joachim Rusiecki of petty nobility. At the age of 14 she was married off to a German Lutheran oculist Dr. Jacob Halpir. The couple moved to Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, where Dr. Halpir practiced medicine and had many clients while facing cut-throat competition from Jewish and Muslim doctors. Despite, or perhaps because of, her being a poorly educated Christian woman in an Islamic country, Halpir was trained by her husband and assisted him in his operations eventually becoming an accomplished physician herself, with a specialty in cataract surgery. Her status as a female helped her find a niche serving female patients and her status as a foreigner helped her skirt Islamic traditions that severely limited women's freedom. Halpir never received any formal training in medicine."
"Later, her husband fell ill. He died leaving Halpir with their 2-year-old daughter, Constance. After this, Halpir embarked on an extensive journey throughout Europe. During the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39), she bought four Austrian prisoners of war. Three of them were ransomed by relatives while the fourth, ensign Pilstein, became her second husband. She traveled to Poland where Michał Kazimierz ""Rybeńko"" Radziwiłł made her husband an officer and offered her the position of doctor's residence in Nesvizh. Harpin traveled to Saint Petersburg to free some Turkish prisoners of war. There she gained access to the imperial court and met Empress Anna of Russia and future Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After several months she returned to Poland. She divorced her second husband, whom she bore two sons, after she accused him of adultery, attempting to poison her, and extortion. She moved to Vienna where Prince József Rákóczi fell in love with her, but she declined his marriage proposal. Halpir became romantically involved with a Polish nobleman, seven years her junior, who took advantage of her wealth. She also accused him of starving one of her sons to death. She returned to Constantinople and became a physician of the women in the harem of sultan Mustafa III. Until recently, her destiny after 1760, when she completed her memoir, was unknown. Dariusz Kołodziejczyk has found that in 1763 she was employed as a physician in the Khan’s harem in Bakhchysarai and as such she served as an informant of the Russian consul Aleksandr Nikiforov."
"Halpir's 388-page autobiography was discovered by a Polish historian Glatman in the library of Prince Czartoryski. The memoir was published as ""Proceder podróży i życia mego awantur"" (My Life's Travels and Adventures) in Poland in 1957. A number of the events in the memoir seem far-fetched and implausible. For example, she described how her leg became limp and visibly shorter due to a magic omen. Therefore, biographical accuracy of her memoir is disputed and some researchers prefer to treat it more as a work of fiction than factual autobiography."

"An Intent in the Android operating system is a software mechanism that allows users to coordinate the functions of different activities to achieve a task. An Intent is a messaging object which provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications in the Android development environment. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities: Intents provide an inter-application messaging system that encourages collaboration and component reuse."
"An Intent is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed. ""For Dummies"" likens an Intent to flicking a switch: ""Your intent is to turn on the light, and to do so, you perform the action of flipping the switch to the On position."""
"The concept was created as a way to allow developers to easily remix different apps and allow each type of task (called ""activity"") to be handled by the application best suited to it, even if provided by a third party. Although the concept was not new, the Android architecture doesn't require elevated privileges to access the components, which makes it an open platform."
"Activities in Android are defined as classes that control the life cycle of a task in the user interface. The activities supported by an application are declared in a manifest, so that other applications can read what activities are supported. Intents in one application can start particular activities in a different application, if the latter supports the message type of the Intent."

6. Zhōnggǔ:
"If one just knows that one should not sever ties with others but does not know how to weigh others to give evenly, then there is no danger of becoming an egoist, but on the other hand those who follow the Way and strive to perfect themselves will also be seen as approaching egoism and consequently one will not dare act in like manner."
"If one understands that one should not sacrifice oneself for others but cannot give to others on an individual basis, then there is no danger of loving indiscriminately, but on the other hand those who follow the Way and strive to perfect the whole Empire will also be seen as approaching indiscriminate love and consequently one will not be willing to act in like manner."

8. Shùgû:
"The point is, egoism is one extreme, and indiscriminate love is another extreme. That is why it is easy to understand that Yang Zi and Mo Zi each held on to an extreme."

"There are two types of printing and publishing related to the eight-legged essay, one for the exams themselves and the other for public purposes. After the test-takers finished with their exams, their papers were collected in the testing room and sent over to be graded. They were then printed with the graders' comments and in the order of the score rank. During the late Ming Dynasty, commercial publishing also increased in the face of increasing commercialization of culture. The public printing, publishing, and dissemination of the essays prompted more people to be interested candidates of the civil service examination during the Ming and Qing dynasties."
"One virtue of the eight-legged essays is that its composition is well defined and easy to follow. For the purpose of administering a large group of exam-takers, this structure allowed convenient regulation as the exam-takers were not likely to deviate from the requirements. Thus, this format contributed to ensuring standard and fairness in the civil service examination system. The examiners could reduce the amount of time spent in grading exams by being accustomed to this format, and uncertainties in the grading schemes were reduced. A scholar named Tian Qilin defended the eight-legged essay by arguing that it embodies the complex Chinese cultural and literary tradition."
"As early as the 17th century, the form's adoption was blamed for the decline of classical poetry and prose during the Ming Dynasty. The critic Wu Qiao wrote that ""people exhausted themselves on the eight-legged essay, and poetry was only composed with their spare energy."" Writing at the same time, the political theorist and philosopher Huang Zongxi echoed these sentiments. Also, the essay did not allow for any personal opinion and was completely impartial. As a result, it led to the gradual narrowing of people's innovative thinking and consequently their minds, thus achieving a constraining effect on Chinese people and the nation. The eight-legged essay has been associated with the ""petrification in Chinese literature"" and ""China's cultural stagnation and economic backwardness."""

Unlike the Model A, it featured a true elevator carried at the tail rather than at the front. It was the last Wright model to have an open-frame tail. The Model B was a dedicated two-seater with the pilot and a passenger sitting side-by-side on the leading edge of the lower wing."
"Besides their civil market, the Wrights were able to sell aircraft to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps (S.C. 3, 4, and 5) and to the United States Navy as hydroplanes (AH-4, -5-, and -6), in which services they were used as trainers. Furthermore, the Wrights were able to sell licenses to produce the aircraft domestically (to the Burgess Company and Curtis, which designated it Model F), as well as in Germany. The deal with Burgess was the first license-production of aircraft undertaken in the United States and most of the approximately one hundred Model Bs produced were actually built by Burgess. A modified Model B, redesignated Model EX (for Exhibition) achieved fame as the ""Vin Fiz Flyer"", the first aircraft to cross the United States. Burgess also planned a refined version as the Model G, but this was never built."

"The station operates on three FM frequencies; the three were previously separate stations centred on each of the broadcast areas, which have over time combined into a single regional service. The station is also available online."
"The station launched under its current identity and format on 4 July 2010; it has operated under various owners, formats and identities previously, with the three services having launched independently of each other in 1999 as a series of local stations each focused on a specified broadcast area. All programming is now identical across the three licence areas."
"The Breeze is based at Roman Landing in the Kingsway area of Southampton, sharing facilities with another Nation Broadcasting-owned station in the region, Sam FM."
The 107.8 FM service launched under the name SouthCity FM on 5 September 1999.
"In 2004, the licence was acquired by Southampton Football Club, who renamed the station as The Saint, effectively making it an FM version of their existing club station of the same name (which was broadcasting on digital TV and online). The service was at this point based at studios within Southampton FC's ground, St Mary's Stadium."
"On 26 July 2007, Southampton FC confirmed it had sold the station to South Wales-based radio group Town & Country Broadcasting - a firm headed by lifelong Southampton FC fan Jason Bryant (formerly of Talksport and Virgin Radio). The sale led to a rebranding of the station as 107.8 Radio Hampshire from 6 August 2007.

"Sisenand (Spanish, Galician, and Portuguese: ""Sisenando""; ) ( 605 – 12 March 636) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 631 to 636."
"Sisenand was the governor of Septimania, when the nobles revolted against the Visigothic king, Suintila, over the latter's confiscations of lands and distribution of privileges between the nobility and clergy. Sisenand joined the rebellion and overthrew Suintila with the aid of Dagobert I, King of the Franks, to whom Gothic nobles offered a plate of pure gold in return, weighing 500 pounds. The plate was allegedly a gift that Aetius, a Roman general, gave to Thorismund, then king of the Visigoths, in 451. After successfully overthrowing Suintila and capturing Zaragoza on 26 March 631, Sisenand proclaimed himself king. The victory of Sisenand also represented the triumph of the nobility over the common people, although the greatest beneficiary was the clergy, who took advantage of the weariness of the other contenders to enhance their own influence."
"Upon assuming the throne, he had Suintila, the previous king, declared a tyrant for his many crimes, iniquity, and accumulation of wealth at the expense of the poor; he also removed all taxes on the clergy."
"Between 632 and 633, there was apparently an attempted uprising within the kingdom, led by Iudila, only attested to by two coins from Mérida and Granada bearing the inscription IUDILA REX.. The revolution failed, and Iudila was later killed."
"In order to obtain ecclesiastical conformity, on 8 December 633, Sisenand convoked the IV Council of Toledo, which drew up civil and ecclesiastical laws within the Visigothic kingdom, including the death penalty, excommunication, and condemnation to perpetual perdition for those rebelling against the king. Similar penalties were approved for those who wished to dispense with such law of choice. However, the council did not concede any hereditary right to the king; the next king would be elected by the bishops and magnates from one of their own."
Sisenand died a natural death in the city of Toledo on 12 March 636. Chintila was chosen by the bishops to succeed him.

"The first disc collects 15 singles from the band's Slash Records career in chronological order. It features the most recognized hits and promos. The second disc has a handful of unreleased songs, b-sides, demos, and live recordings, which were chosen by record label Slash rather than the band themselves. Some of the notable previously unreleased material includes ""The World Is Yours"" and ""I Won't Forget You""."
"There were three different versions that were put out for this compilation. Between the versions, the title and covers were altered. The single disc edition was tagged ""The Greatest Hits"", while the dual disc was labelled ""Greatest Hits""."
"The album art for the American release was the red question mark on black background, while the UK, European, Argentine, and Oceanian releases featured the Benny Hill art. The Oceanian double disc edition also had a ""Limited Edition 2CD Set"" sticker, as in other markets the bonus disc was not limited. In Europe only a single disc edition was released. For this, the first five tracks off the second disc were simply added to the end of the compilation."
"The album was originally called 'Who Cared a Lot?'. It had a different order of tracks and a different cover, but only saw release as a promo."
= = = Jukung = = =
"A jukung or kano, also known as cadik is a small wooden Indonesian outrigger canoe. It is a traditional fishing boat, but newer uses include ""Jukung Dives"", using the boat as a vehicle for small groups of SCUBA divers."
"The double outrigger jukung is but one of many types of Austronesian outrigger canoes that use the crab claw sail traditional throughout Polynesia. Whilst this sail presents some difficulties in tacking into the wind, actually requiring to jibe around, a jukung is superb in its reaching ability and jibe-safe running. They are usually highly decorated and bear a marlin-like prow."
"People in Kalimantan also named their boat Jukung. It is used for transport in daily activities such as going to the office, to school, or shopping in pasar terapung (The Floating Market, a very famous tourist attraction)."
"Currently there is a modern version of jukung made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe in Indonesia. Advertised as unsinkable, the main body is made of a closed HDPE pipe that contains sealed air as the source of its buoyancy."
"In the late 1980s there was a seafaring journey of over 1000 nautical miles in open outrigger ‘jukung’ canoes by nine crews, who sailed from Bali to Darwin across the Timor Sea. Crews were from New Zealand, Australia, USA, England, Japan, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Indonesia. This was a three-month expedition masterminded by Bob Hobmann, filmed and made into a documentary called ""Passage out of Paradise""; it was featured by the National Geographic Society as ""The Great Jukung Race"". It was the first ever expedition of this kind, following purported austronesian sailing routes in craft dating 7,000 years old."
"The expedition started in Bali, where once crews were familiar with sailing their Jukungs they embarked on a two-month adventure following the ancient sailing routes (1,000 yrs BC), along the eastern Islands via Komodo Island. They completed the journey with a treacherous 5 day sail across the Arafura Sea to Darwin, via the Tiwi Islands."
"Challenges experienced were storms requiring numerous boat repairs, waterspouts, excessive exposure to sun, heat, or rain, adverse currents & whirlpools. Hazards included drifting onto war-torn Timor, unpredictable behaviour/welcome from remote villagers, salt water boils, wound infections, malnutrition, near misses with night-time freighters, sightings of sperm whales and giant white sharks. Some sailors were viciously attacked by hornets while preparing to leave a remote beach camp. The crews rebelled & unanimously decided to sail as a group, as opposed to racing the final leg of the journey, for safety."
"As a result, all sailors miraculously survived a cyclone >110 km/hr winds in their tiny (6 ft long, 50 cm wide) primitive bamboo/rope jukungs, although the Australian crew was lost for 2 days, located by the Australian coastguard, with a smashed jukung washed up on an island."
"Genetic data indicate the ""molestus"" form in the London Underground appear to have a common ancestry, rather than the population at each station being related to the nearest above-ground population. Byrne and Nichols' working hypothesis was that adaptation to the underground environment had occurred locally in London once only – many hurdles must be overcome to become adapted to the subterranean environment, and understandably it would occur rarely. This hypothesis implies that local adaptation would be expected in different locations around Europe and beyond, as each local population evolved an offshoot that overcame the problems of living underground."
"However, more recently collected genetic evidence reported by Fonseca and others suggests a single ""C. molestus"" form has spread throughout Europe and beyond, since populations over a large area share a common genetic heritage. These widely separated populations are distinguished by very minor genetic differences, which suggest the underground form developed recently; a single mtDNA difference is shared among the underground populations of 10 Russian cities, and a single fixed microsatellite difference occurs in populations spanning Europe, Japan, Australia, the Middle East, and the Atlantic islands. This worldwide spread might have occurred after the last glaciations or may be even more recent, due to the insects hitchhiking on world trade routes; one possibility is the international secondhand tire trade. The tires retain water in which the larvae can survive, and completely removing water from an old tire can be difficult."
"Now, the persistence of hybrids in northern climates apparently may be another evolutionary problem that can be solved, but only rarely: the Fonseca paper obtained genetic evidence that the recent colonization of America by ""Culex"" mosquitoes actually involves a strain derived from a rare successful hybridization between ""C. pipiens"" and ""C. molestus"". They suggest hybridization may explain why the American form bites both birds and humans (this interpretation is controversial, see letter from Spielman ""et al."" and the response that follows it in ""Science""). The consequences of this more indiscriminate feeding hit the news in 1999 with the outbreak of human encephalitis in New York, caused by West Nile virus. It was the first documented introduction of this virus into the Western Hemisphere; perhaps because in the longer established populations, the Old World northern above-ground ""C. pipiens"" almost exclusively bites birds, with the human-biting ones being incarcerated below ground."
"""Culex molestus"" has been observed in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australasia. Its country of origin is thought to be Egypt, although it has likely spread via trade and colonial passages over the past centuries."
"In the summer of 2011, an invasion of ""Culex molestus"" appeared on the Upper West Side in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. The mosquito is well known for being commonly found in sewers of New York and thriving throughout the year feeding on humans. Residents of older brownstones found the mosquitoes coming from the underground into basements and then through air vents and other openings into their homes. The city government did not make this infestation of the pest a top priority because they tested negative for West Nile virus and because of the high cost of mosquito control."
"In Australia, ""Culex molestus"" was first recorded in the 1940s, and has since spread across all southern states, causing a significant biting nuisance in urban areas. Unlike most Australian urban mosquitos, ""molestus"" is active through all 12 months of the year. Its introduction was likely through military movements into Melbourne during World War II, and genetic studies have indicated its most likely passage was from eastern Asia and Japan. It has also been identified as a potential vector for several Australian blood-borne diseases, such as Ross River virus."

"Clemens Erwein Heinrich Karl Bonaventura Freiherr von und zu Franckenstein (14 July 1875 – 19 August 1942) was a German opera composer, studying in Vienna, Austria, and later in Munich, Germany, with Ludwig Thuille and at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt with Iwan Knorr. After a visit to the USA he conducted the Moody-Manners Opera Company in England from 1902–1907, then worked at the court theatres of Wiesbaden and Berlin, until the court theaters were abolished after the First World War. He was general director of the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich (1912–1918 and 1924–1934). He produced the Munich Opera Festival through 1934 when he was forced out by Nazi prohibitions."
"Franckenstein was born in Wiesentheid, Germany to Karl Freiherr von und zu Franckenstein (1831–1898) and Elma Gräfin von Schönborn-Wiesentheid (1841–1884). His brother was Austrian Ambassador to England, Georg von und zu Franckenstein (1878–1953). Georg's son, actor Clement von Franckenstein (1944–2019), was his nephew."

"The IBM Z family maintains full backward compatibility. In effect, current systems are the direct, lineal descendants of System/360, announced in 1964, and the System/370 from the 1970s. Many applications written for these systems can still run unmodified on the newest IBM Z system over five decades later."
"Virtualization is required by default on IBM Z systems. First layer virtualization is provided by the Processor Resource and System Manager (PR/SM) to deploy one or more Logical Partitions (LPARs). Each LPAR supports a variety of operating systems. A hypervisor called z/VM can also be run as the second layer virtualization in LPARs to create as many virtual machines (VMs) as there are resources assigned to the LPARs to support them. The first layer of IBM Z virtualization (PR/SM) allows a z machine to run a limited number of LPARs (up to 80 on the IBM z13). These can be considered virtual ""bare metal"" servers because PR/SM allows CPUs to be dedicated to individual LPARs. z/VM LPARs allocated within PR/SM LPARs can run a very large number of virtual machines as long as there are adequate CPU, memory, and I/O resources configured with the system for the desired performance, capacity, and throughput."
"IBM Z's PR/SM and hardware attributes allow compute resources to be dynamically changed to meet workload demands. CPU and memory resources can be non-disruptively added to the system and dynamically assigned, recognized, and used by LPARs. I/O resources such as IP and SAN ports can also be added dynamically. They are virtualized and shared across all LPARs. The hardware component that provides this capability is called the Channel Subsystem. Each LPAR can be configured to either ""see"" or ""not see"" the virtualized I/O ports to establish desired ""shareness"" or isolation. This virtualization capability allows significant reduction in I/O resources because of its ability to share them and drive up utilization."
"PR/SM on IBM Z has earned Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 5+ security certification, and z/VM has earned Common Criteria EAL4+ certification."
The KVM hypervisor from Linux has also been ported.
"Since the move away from the System/390 name, a number of IBM Z models have been released. These can be grouped into families with similar architectural characteristics."
"The IBM zEnterprise System (zEnterprise), announced in July 2010, with the z196 model, is designed to offer both mainframe and distributed server technologies in an integrated system. The zEnterprise System consists of three components. First is a System z server. Second is the IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX). Last is the management layer, IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager (zManager), which provides a single management view of zEnterprise resources. The zEnterprise is designed to extend mainframe capabilities – management efficiency, dynamic resource allocation, serviceability – to other systems and workloads running on AIX on POWER7, and Microsoft Windows or Linux on x86."
"The zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX) is an infrastructure component that hosts both general purpose blade servers and appliance-like workload optimizers which can all be managed as if they were a single mainframe. The zBX supports a private high speed internal network that connects it to the central processing complex, which reduces the need for networking hardware and provides inherently high security."
"The IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager integrates the System z and zBX resources as a single virtualized system and provides unified and integrated management across the zEnterprise System. It can identify system bottlenecks or failures among disparate systems and if a failure occurs it can dynamically reallocate system resources to prevent or reduce application problems. The Unified Resource Manager provides energy monitoring and management, resource management, increased security, virtual networking, and information management from a single user interface."
Highlights of the original zEnterprise z196 include:
"The newest zEnterprise, the EC12, was announced in August 2012, and included:"
"On April 8, 2014, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the System/360 mainframe, IBM announced the release of its first converged infrastructure solution based on mainframe technology. Dubbed the IBM Enterprise Cloud System, this new offering combines IBM mainframe hardware, software, and storage into a single system and is designed to compete with competitive offerings from VCE, HP, and Oracle. According to IBM, it is the most scalable Linux server available with support for up to 6,000 virtual machines in a single-footprint."
"In June 2014, IBM announced it had shipped its first Enterprise Cloud System to Vissensa, a UK-based managed service provider."
Specific models from this family include:
"The IBM System z10 servers supported more memory than previous generation systems and can have up to 64 central processors (CPs) per frame. The full speed z10 processor's uniprocessor performance was up to 62% faster than that of the z9 server, according to IBM's z10 announcement, and included these other features:"
Specific models from this family include:
"In July 2005, IBM announced a new family of servers – the System z9 family – with the IBM System z9 Enterprise Class (z9 EC) and the IBM System z9 Business Class (z9 BC) servers. The System z9 servers offered:"
Specific models from this family include:
"The zSeries family, which includes the z900, z800, z990 and z890, introduced IBM's newly designed 64-bit z/Architecture to the mainframe world.

"Bob Wren Stadium features many modern amenities and has a capacity of 4,000. The stadium has 100 chairback seats that are part of the VIP club, named the Baumholtz club in honor of former Ohio baseball player Frank Baumholtz. In addition, there are around 1,000 bleacher-back seats in the stadium and another 1,000 seats of regular bleachers. Down both the third and first base lines there are two grassy knolls that are capable of seating up to another 1,000 fans."
"There are two concession stands available with traditional ballpark fare, and members of the Baumholtz Club have access to a private lounge that serves more upscale food items. The press box provides multiple phones and computer lines for members of the media. There are also two radio broadcast booths and one television broadcast booth available."
"The stadium has already undergone several modifications since opening. In 2003, a large Daktronics digital scoreboard was added to the outfield of the stadium. That same year, heated batting cages were added to the northeast of the stadium, allowing Bobcat players to practice inside during cold weather. Most recently, lights were installed in 2004. As a result of this new addition, 15 of Ohio's 28 home games in 2005 were played at night."
"The stadium is named for former Bobcat head coach Bob Wren, who held the highest all-time winning percentage of any Ohio baseball coach."
"In addition to serving as the home of Ohio Bobcats baseball, Bob Wren Stadium is home to the Southern Ohio Copperheads of the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League and is the home of the state American Legion baseball tournament every year."

"Queen Charlotte Sound was named by James Strange on August 5, 1786, in honour of Queen Charlotte, the consort of King George III. Strange was the leader of a fur trading expedition of two vessels, the ""Captain Cook"", under Captain Henry Lawrie, and the ""Experiment"", under Captain John Guise. During a boat excursion up Goletas Channel, Strange saw an opening ahead and named it Queen Charlotte Sound. The body of water he named was what is today known as Queen Charlotte Strait. For some time Queen Charlotte Strait was also called Queen Charlotte Sound, until 1920 when the BCGNIS and Hydrographic Service distinguished between Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait. George Vancouver, who used the name in his maps and writings, wrote that the sound was named by Mr. S. Wedgeborough, in command of the ""Experiment"" under James Strange, but this is probably a mistake."
"The strait lies between the Mainland and Vancouver Island portions of the Mount Waddington Regional District, a form of regional municipal governance with power over zoning, building and sewer permits and inter-municipal integration. Most communities in the region, however, are Indian reserve communities of the Kwakwaka'wakw peoples which are outside the jurisdiction of regional district governance. The traditional territories of most of the various Kwakwaka'wakw peoples overlap in the strait, which is a vital fishery resource and transportation link between their communities."

"Interfaith Alliance and its partner organization, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, work out of their main office in Washington, D.C.. The group has local affiliates around the United States."
"Interfaith Alliance realizes the powerful role that religion plays in America, and it values the positive impact that religious belief can have on American politics. However, Interfaith Alliance's concern is that religion and the United States government are becoming dangerously entangled. Interfaith Alliance believes that religion is being manipulated as a tool to influence policy and advance political strategy. Interfaith Alliance works to ensure the sanctity of religion and the integrity of politics. The group also supports an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation."

"Delta Force: Black Hawk Down is a first-person shooter video game developed by NovaLogic. It was released for Microsoft Windows on March 23, 2003; for Mac OS X in July 2004; and for PlayStation 2 and Xbox on July 26, 2005. It is the 6th game of the ""Delta Force"" series. It is set in the early 1990s during the Unified Task Force peacekeeping operation in Somalia. The missions take place primarily in the southern Jubba Valley and the capital Mogadishu. The game also features a mission editor with which players can make custom missions."
"The gameplay in ""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" differs heavily from earlier installments in the series. While all earlier ""Delta Force"" games focus on long distance outdoor combat and have open ended mission design, ""Black Hawk Down"" focuses on close quarters combat in urban environments with heavily scripted missions more similar to the then-recent . Many of the series' trademark features, such as bullet ballistics and later weapon sway, were abandoned in favour of simpler action-focused gameplay. The player is usually accompanied by a squad of three AI-controlled soldiers, whom the player is able to give simple commands such as the order to hold fire, hold position or throw a grenade."
"Like in earlier ""Delta Force"" games the campaign in ""Black Hawk Down"" is divided into distinct missions. While the campaign is linear, most of the time three missions are available at the same time, allowing the player to complete them in any order. Completing a mission saves the campaign progress and usually unlocks a new one. Already completed missions can be accessed from an ""instant action"" list."
"In addition to the singleplayer campaign, ""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" features LAN and online multiplayer with support for up to 50 players in a single match, breaking the record for the largest console multiplayer battles at the time."
"The online multiplayer is powered by NovaWorld which tracks players' statistics, gives them increasing ranks and has a matchmaking system. Various gameplay modes are available including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill as well as objective-based ones. Like in the previous two ""Delta Force"" games players can choose one out of several character classes with individual characteristics."
"The player begins the game as a soldier with Task Force Ranger, commanding 3 team members: Huck, Mother, and Preacher. They take part in the Unified Task Force peacekeeping operation during the Somali Civil War. Following the third mission, the player assumes the role of the same soldier. He/she is assigned to 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, taking part in Operation Gothic Serpent, a military operation conducted during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. During the latter section of the game, the player will still play as that soldier, but is now sent to the 3rd Ranger Battalion and the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, commonly known as Delta Force."
The final mission features an alternate history in which the player and a team of operators carry out the assassination of Mohammad Farrah Aidid.
"""Delta Force: Black Hawk Down"" uses an engine based on ""Comanche 4"" which allows for more detail and advanced visual effects thanks to shader support. Also vehicle movement is not restricted to specific pre-defined paths anymore and the AI drivers are able to avoid obstacles. It is the first engine used by the series to support platforms other than PC."
"In 2004 an expansion pack titled """" was released for the PC and PlayStation 2 versions of the game, adding two campaigns which take place in Colombia and Iran respectively."

= = = Autos sacramentales = = =
"Autos sacramentales (Spanish ""auto"", ""act"" or ""ordinance""; ""sacramental"", ""sacramental, pertaining to a sacrament"") are a form of dramatic literature which is unique to Spain, though in some respects similar in character to the old Morality plays of England."
"The ""auto sacramental"" may be defined as a dramatic representation of the mystery of the Eucharist. At least this is the definition that would apply to the ""auto"" of the time of Calderón. It does not so well fit, however, those of the preceding century, many of which were sacramental in character only because they were presented during the feast of Corpus Christi. They are usually allegorical, the characters representing, for example, Faith, Hope, Air, Sin, Death, etc. There were some indeed, in which not a single human character appeared, but personifications of the Virtues, the Vices, the Elements, etc."
"The ""auto sacramental"" was always presented in the streets in connection with the celebration of the feast of Corpus Christi. It was preceded by a solemn procession through the principal streets of the city, the houses along the route being decorated in honor of the occasion. In the procession appeared the priests bearing the Host under a splendid canopy, followed by a devout throng, in which, in Madrid, often appeared the king and his court without distinction of rank, and last of all, in beautiful cars, came the actors from the public theatres who were to take part in the performance. The procession usually halted before the house of some dignitary while the priests performed certain religious ceremonies, the multitude kneeling meanwhile as if in church. At the conclusion of these, the auto was given. These performances, and the procession as well, were given with much splendor and at great expense, being limited only by the resources of the particular town in which they took place."
"Religious exhibitions were popular with the public in Spain as early as the 13th century. These typically consisted of simple dialogue, presented at Christmas, Carnival, Good Friday, or Easter during religious festivals. As time progressed, the celebration of the feast day of Corpus Christi became larger and with that came the desire for drama surrounding the feast day and honoring the Eucharist became apparent. The first ""autos"" were derived from religious material that already existed, but by the beginning of the 16th century, the first true ""auto"" ""sacramental"", meaning the theme of the play was the mystery of the Eucharist, was presented. It was ""El Auto de San Martin"", by Gil Vicente."
"During the 16th and 17th centuries these ""autos"" continued to appear, being gradually improved and elaborated until brought to their highest state of development by Calderón. He has left about seventy ""autos"", the best known of which are ""The Divine Orpheus"", a work of considerable poetic merit, ""The Devotion to the Mass"", and ""The Captivity of the Ark"". His ""autos"" were the most popular and were the only autos performed in Madrid from 1647 to 1681. These ""autos sacramentales"" produced a great effect on the people. From time immemorial, allegory of every kind had powerfully appealed to them, and these autos took a strong hold on the popular favor, coming as they did during religious festivals, with their music and their splendor, coupled with the fact that they were given at public expense and with the sanction of the Catholic church."

= = = 7-demicubic honeycomb = = =
"The 7-demicubic honeycomb, or demihepteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 7-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 7-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 7-cubes become alternated into 7-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 7-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,4} facets."
"The vertex arrangement of the 7-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 84 vertices of the rectified 7-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""7-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 84 of this lattice. The best known is 126, from the E lattice and the 3 honeycomb."
"The D packing (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two ""D lattices"". The D packings form lattices only in even dimensions. The kissing number is 2=64 (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8)."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four 7-demicubic lattices: It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."

There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of different colors on the 128 7-demicube facets around each vertex.
= = = Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy = = =
"Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy or Majjari Narasimha Reddy (24 November 1806 – 2 February 1847) was an Indian freedom fighter. Son of a former Telugu Palegaadu Mallareddy and Seethamma, Narasimha Reddy was born in Rupanagudi village, Uyyalawada Mandal, Kurnool district. He and his commander-in-chief ""Vadde Obanna"" were at the heart of the rebellion against British in 1846, where 5,000 peasants rose up against the British East India Company in Kurnool district, Rayalaseema Region of Andhra Pradesh. They were protesting against the changes introduced by the British to the traditional agrarian system in the first half of the nineteenth century. Which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximize revenue through exploiting lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished."
"The father of Narasimha Reddy was related to the Polygar (jagirdarr) family of Uyyalawada in Koilkuntla taluk who had married two daughters of the Polygar of Nossam. He had three sons, of whom Narasimha was the youngest. His first wife was Siddamma."
"The EIC's introduction to the Madras Presidency of the 1803 Permanent Settlement, which had first been enacted in Bengal Presidency ten years previously, replaced the agrarian socio-economic status quo with a more egalitarian arrangement where anyone could cultivate provided that they paid a fixed sum to the EIC for the privilege of doing so."
"The Polygars and other higher-status people who preferred the old agrarian system ""represented the decadent social order"", were in many cases ""upstarts"" and ""were also the heirs of a social system in which various orders of Hindu society were integrated through ages"". These people were dispossessed of their lands, which were then redistributed, but the primary purpose of the changes was to increase production rather than to restructure the social order. In some cases, it coincided with a punishment because among the dispossessed were those who had recently been involved in fighting the EIC in the Polygar Wars. Some received pensions in lieu of the lost lands but at inconsistent rates."
"The changes, which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximise revenue, deprived village headmen and other higher-status people of their role as revenue collectors and position as landholders, while also impacting on lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished. The population came to the view that the British were taking their wealth and that those who were dependent on the traditional system no longer had a means of making a living. As the old order collapsed into disarray, the once-authoritative Polygars, including Narasimha Reddy, became the focus of attention from sufferers, whose pleas fell on deaf British ears. The Polygars saw a chance to mobilize peasant opposition both for genuine social reasons."
"Narasimha Reddy's own objections too was based on their outcomes. Compared to the Polygar of Nossam, the pension awarded to his family upon their dispossession was paltry and the authorities refused to increase it by redistributing some of the Nossam monies when that latter family became extinct in 1821. At the same time, some of his relatives were facing proposals for further reductions in their land rights, including by a reform of the village policing system."
"Things came to a head 1846 when the British authorities assumed land rights previously held by various people who had died in the villages of Goodladurty, Koilkuntla and Nossum. Encouraged by the discontent of others, Reddy became the figurehead for an uprising."
"An armed group, initially comprising those dispossessed of inam lands around Koilkuntla, was led by Reddy's Right-hand man Vadde Obanna in July 1846. The Acting Collector for the area Lord Cochrane, believed that Reddy had material support from fellow pensioners in Hyderabad and Kurnool, whose land rights had also been appropriated. The group soon attracted support from the peasantry and was reported by British authorities to have rampaged in Koilkuntla, looting the treasury there and evading the police before killing several officers at Mittapally. They also plundered Rudravaram before moving to an area near to Almore, pursued by the British military forces who then surrounded them."
"A battle between Obanna's 5000-strong band and a much smaller British contingent then took place, with around 200 of the rebels being killed and others captured before they were able to break out in the direction of Kotakota, Giddalur where Reddy's family were situated. Having collected his family, he and the rest of the rebels moved into the Nallamala Hills. The British offered incentives for information regarding the rebels, who were again surrounded amidst reports that unrest was now growing in other villages of the area. In a further skirmish between the rebels and the British, who had sent for reinforcements, 40–50 rebels were killed and 90 were captured, including Reddy. Although there was no evidence of Obanna's capture, he most possibly was also a captive along with his leader."
"Warrants were issued for the arrest of nearly 1,000 of the rebels, of which 412 were released without charge. A further 273 were bailed and 112 were convicted. Reddy, too, was convicted and in his case received the death penalty. On 22 February 1847, he was executed in Koilkuntla in front of a silent crowd of over 2000 people."
British kept his head on the fort wall in public view until 1877. The East India Company reported in their district manual of 1886 that
"The Renati Surya Chandrula Smaraka Samithi was formed to preserve the memory of Reddy and the philanthropist Budda Vengal Reddy, both of whom were born in Uyyalawada village. The committee published a book in both Telugu and English, titled ""Renati Surya Chandrulu"" (""The Sun and Moon of Renadu""), in 2015. It contains excerpts from research papers by historians."
"A movie based on Narasimha Reddy's inspiring life, ""Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy"" directed by Surender Reddy and starring Chiranjeevi was released in the Telugu film industry on 2 October 2019. He was referred as a dacoit by British as he was helping people"

Binetti is a surname. Notable people with this surname include:
"Osada's placement there was noted in ISU's decision not to continue this dual-grouping policy, because her scores in free skating would have placed her 7th in ""Group A"" in that segment, which would have placed her significantly higher overall. However, she was never given the opportunity to place above 16th in free skate, due to her placement in ""Group B."" By contrast, many strong compulsory figure skaters who were poor free skaters ended up placing high in the end, because they were guaranteed at least a 15th-place finish in free skating, as long as they placed in the top 15 after short program."
"Given the way Osada skated in the 1982–1983 season, many expected her to continue to progress in the world ranks. However, she placed poorly in compulsories at 1983–1984 All Japan Championships, where she finished 4th, costing her the opportunity to compete at the Sarajevo Olympics in 1984. Around this time, Osada experienced a growth spurt, which made her triple jumps less consistent and less dynamic. Although she won a couple of bronze medals at NHK Trophy, she was never able to regain her national title, nor was she able to make the Japanese world or Olympics team. By 1986, she was no longer training seriously, as she shifted her focus to her studies at Hosei University. She retired quietly after the 1989 season."

"David Arthur Gnohéré (born November 20, 1978) is a retired Ivorian-born French professional footballer. His brother, Harlem, is also a footballer."
"Gnohéré's first taste of English football came at Lancashire club Burnley. After a successful trial period at the club, he signed a contract to be a part of Stan Ternent's squad in 2001. 'King Arthur', as he was effectively nicknamed, became a firm fans' favourite at the club with his dominant displays and his excellent runs up the field from defence."
"His finest hour was in a local derby away at Preston North End. He stunned the Lilywhites with two goals, including one from a classy set up from Alan Moore. He was a constant fixture in the Burnley team during the 2001/2002 season, where Burnley looked likely to gain promotion to the Premier League."
"Gnohéré failed to live up to his early form at Burnley in the following seasons and was subsequently released when his contract expired. He joined Queens Park Rangers after an initial loan, but left the club at the end of the 2004/05 season. During his spell at QPR, he scored once in the Football League Trophy against Kidderminster Harriers."
"After a spell out of the game, Gnohéré signed for Oxford United in August 2007. However, after a string of poor performances for the U's and the return of regular defenders from injury, the club decided not to renew his month-to-month contract, and he was released on October 2007."
= = = BglII = = =
"""Bgl""II is a type II restriction endonuclease isolated from certain strains of ""Bacillus globigii""."
"The principal function of restriction enzymes is the protection of the host genome against foreign DNA, but they may also have some involvement in recombination and transposition."
"Like most type II restriction enzymes, ""Bgl""II consists of two identical subunits that form a homodimer around the DNA double helix. Each monomer is 223 amino acids and symmetrically bind both sides of the unique palindromic nucleotide sequence AGATCT, cleaving the scissile phosphodiester bond between the first Adenine and Guanine nucleotides on both strands of the DNA molecule, creating sticky ends with 5' end overhangs."
"Being a type II restriction enzyme, ""Bgl""II does not require ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for its enzymatic function, but only requires association with a divalent metal cation, most likely Mg. Unlike other restriction enzymes of its class, ""Bgl""II has been shown to possess some unique structural characteristics, such as a β-sandwich subdomain, and appears to undergo a unique conformational change upon dimerization, but its overall structure and mechanism of catalysis remain consistent with other type II restriction enzymes."
"Restriction endonucleases play a very important role in modern molecular cloning techniques. Because of their unique recognition/cut sites, restriction enzymes can be used to precisely cut DNA at specific locations in a predictable manner. Once cut, the DNA (usually) possesses so-called ""sticky ends"", which can then allow the DNA fragment to hybridise into a DNA vector. Ligating enzymes are used to covalently link the desired fragment to the vector for subsequent DNA cloning."
"""Bgl""II catalyses phosphodiester bond cleavage at the DNA backbone through a phosphoryl transfer to water. Studies on the mechanism of restriction enzymes have revealed several general features that seem to be true in almost all cases, although the actual mechanism for each enzyme is most likely some variation of this general mechanism. This mechanism requires a base to generate the hydroxide ion from water, which will act as the nucleophile and attack the phosphorus in the phosphodiester bond. Also required is a Lewis acid to stabilize the extra negative charge of the pentacoordinated transition state phosphorus, as well as a general acid or metal ion that stabilizes the leaving group (3’-O)."
"Although restriction endonucleases show little sequence similarity, crystal structures reveal that they all share a highly similar α/β core consisting of a six-stranded β-sheet flanked by five α-helices, two of which mediate dimerization. This core carries the active site (catalytic center) and the residues that contact DNA in the major groove. ""Bgl""II is unique in that its α/β core is augmented by a β-sandwich subdomain that has several projections that extend outward to grip the DNA, allowing ""Bgl""II to completely encircle the DNA molecule. This atypical feature of ""Bgl""II suggests a unique hinge motion for DNA binding and release."
"Comparative structural studies of the free enzyme vs. the ""Bgl""II-DNA complex showed that the enzyme opens by a dramatic scissor-like motion, accompanied by a complete rearrangement of the α-helices at the dimer interface. These structural studies also revealed that within each monomer a set of residues lowers or raises to alternatively sequester or expose the active site residues. These dramatic differences in structure in the free vs. bound enzyme have yet to be observed in any other restriction endonuclease and may possibly represent a novel mechanism for capturing DNA that may extend to other proteins that encircle DNA."
"Structural studies of endonucleases have revealed a similar architecture for the active site with the residues following the weak consensus sequence Glu/Asp-(X)-Glu/Asp/Ser-X-Lys/Glu. ""Bgl""II's active site is similar to other endonucleases', following the sequence Asp-(X)-Glu-X-Gln. In its active site there sits a divalent metal cation, most likely Mg, that interacts with Asp-84, Val-94, a phosphoryl oxygen, and three water molecules. One of these water molecules, is able act as a nucleophile because of its proximity to the scissile phosphoryl (its orientation being fixed by a hydrogen bond with the side chain amide oxygen of Gln-95) and its contact with the metal cation (which lowers its pK, promoting the water's nucleophilicity)."

= = = TRAMP complex = = =
"TRAMP complex (Trf4/Air2/Mtr4p Polyadenylation complex) is a multiprotein, heterotrimeric complex having distributive polyadenylation activity and identifies wide varieties of RNAs produced by polymerases.It was originally discovered in ""Saccharomyces"" ""cerevisiae"" by LaCava et al., Vanacova et al. and Wyers et al. in 2005."
It interacts with the exosome complex in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and is involved in the 3' end processing and degradation of ribosomal RNA and snoRNAs. The TRAMP complex trims the poly(A) tails of RNAs destined for Rrp6 and the core exosome down to 4-5 adenosines assisting in transcript recognition and exosome complex activation. The substrate specificity of exosomes is improved in the presence of TRAMP complex as it acts as a crucial cofactor and helps in maintaining various activities.
"In this way, TRAMP plays a critical role in ridding the cell of noncoding transcripts generated through pervasive RNA polymerase II transcription, as well as functioning in the biogenesis and turnover of functional coding and noncoding RNAs."
"TRAMP complex also affects various other RNA processes either directly or indirectly. It is involved in RNA export, Splicing, hetero-chromatic gene silencing and helps in maintaining stability of genome."
Pol(A) Polymerases showed various genetic interactions with DNA Topoisomerases Top1p and hence they were called topoisomerase-related function Trf4p and Trf5p due to this interaction with DNA it has an important part in genomic stability. In the cell Trf4p is in higher concentration as compared to Trf5p and also has a stronger effect on the phenotype. Trf4p is present throughout the nucleus while Trf5p is mainly found mainly in nucleolus. The Trf4p structure consists of a central domain and a catalytic domain which is similar to the structure of canonical polymerases.
The non-canonical Poly(A) polymerases (Trf4p or Trf5p) of the TRAMP complex which belong to the Cid1 family do not contain RNA recognition motif (RRM) therefore additional proteins like Air1/Air2 are required by the non-canonical polymerases for polyadenylation.
The zinc knuckle proteins Air1p/Air2p (Arginine methyltransferase-interacting RING-finger protein) are mainly involved in the binding of RNAs. There are five CCHC (C stands for Cysteine and H stands for Histidine) zinc knuckle motifs which are present in between the C and N terminals.
"In Air2p proteins, the fourth and fifth zinc knuckle have different roles. The fourth zinc knuckle have a role in RNA binding while the fifth knuckle is important for protein-protein interactions. Air2p interacts with the central domain of Trf4p and polyadenylation activity of Trf4p is dependent on this interaction as deletion or mutation of the knuckles hinders the polyadenylation activity. Air1p is responsible for inhibiting methylation of Npl3p (a protein which is responsible mRNA export). Air1p/Air2p also direct abnormal mRNPs to TRAMP pathway and bring about their degradation."
"The Ski2 like helicase Mtr4p was discovered during the screening of heat resistant mutants that gather Poly(A) RNA in the nucleus and is mainly involved in unwinding activity. Mtr4p (also called as Dob1p) is an SF2 helicase and belongs to DExH-box RNA helicases family consisting of two RecA like domains. It also consists of WH domain (Winged Helix domain), an Arch domain (also called as stalk and KOW domain [Kyprides, Ouzounis, Woese domain]) and helical bundle domain. The packing of the WH and helical bundle domains on surface of the helicase core results in the formation of a channel for ssRNA."
"Mtr4p requires ATP or dATP hydrolysis for RNA duplex unwinding mediaited by Q-motif. A single-stranded region 3' to the paired region is also essential for the unwinding activity of Mtr4p. Through direct contact with various components of exosome, Mtr4p helps in proper addition of RNA substrates of TRAMP complex to nuclear exosome."
"The difference between non-canonical and canonical Poly(A) Polymerases is that canonical polymerases help in maintaining mRNAs and its activity is regulated by a specific sequence in the mRNA while polyadenylation of non-canonical polymerases uses a different regulated sequence in the RNA and specifies RNAs for degeneration or processing. Canonical polymerases belong to DNA polymerase β superfamily whereas non-canonical polymerases belong to Cid1 family, another main difference is the length of the poly(A) tail; canonical polymerases can add many adenylates thus the RNA produced has longer poly(A) tails while non-canonical polymerases on the other hand can produce RNAs with shorter length of poly(A) tails as they can add only few adenylates."
"The TRAMP complex brings about degradation or processing of various RNAs with the help of 3’->5’ exonuclease complex called the exosome. A hexameric ring of RNase PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain proteins, Rrp41p, Rrp42p, Rrp43p, Rrp45p, Rrp46p and Mtr3p comprises the exosome of ""S. cerevisiae"". The exosome can bring about RNA degradation more efficiently in the presence of Rrp6p with the help of TRAMP complex invitro. Also, RNA degradation is enhanced in the presence of various exosome cofactors which are recruited co-transcriptionally."
"The Ski complex consisting of Ski2p, Ski3p, Ski8p is required by cytoplasmic exosome for all mRNA degradation pathways. The cytoplasmic exosome along with the Ski7p protein attaches to various abnormal ribosomes and mRNAs and brings about their degradation."
"All the components of the TRAMP complex are inter-related to each other. For the activity of Poly(A) polymerases likeTrf4p/Trf5p, zinc knuckle proteins are essential. In similar way RNA degradation brought about by exosomes is stimulated by unwinding activity of Ski2 like helicases and Mtr4p which acts as a cofactor. The unwinding activity of Mtr4p is improved by the Trf4p/Air2p in the TRAMP complex. Mtr4p also has an important role in maintaining and controlling the length of Poly(A) tails. But destruction or absence of Mtr4p results in hyperadenylation and hinders the length of Poly(A) tails."
"A complex formed between Trf5p, Air1p and Mtr4p is called as TRAMP5 complex. In ""S. cerevisiae"" there are two types of TRAMP complexes depending on the presence of polymerases. If Trf4p is present, then the complex is called as TRAMP4 and if Trf5p is present then It is called as TRAMP5."
"RNAs produced by all three polymerases (Pol I, II, III) act as substrates for TRAMP complex. TRAMP complex is involved in processing and surveillance of various RNAs and degrade abnormal RNAs. Different type of RNA substrates include ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nuclear RNAs(snRNAs), Long transcripts of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) etc. But the mechanism by which TRAMP complex identifies various substrates is unknown."
The TRAMP complex works more efficiently in RNA processing by engaging Exosome complex exonuclease RrP6 wherein Nab3(RNA binding protein) plays a crucial role.
Post-transcriptional modifications due to various enzymes like methyltransferase Hmt1p (Rmt1p) may have an indirect effect on chromatin maintenance. The chromatin structures are affected when RNA substrates of TRAMP complex are transcribed across the genome. Various TRAMP components interact physically and genetically with various proteins and bring about changes in chromatin and DNA metabolism.
"Components of the TRAMP complex in ""Saccharomyces cerevisiae"" are conserved in other organisms ranging from yeast to mammals.The TRAMP complex components of ""Schizosaccharomyces pombe"" including Cid14p, Air1p, and Mtr4p are functionally similar to the components of TRAMP complex in ""S. cerevisiae""."

Osada participated in her first international competition as an alternate for another skater, Megumi Aotani, at 1980 Enia Challenge Cup in the Netherlands at the age of 15. There, she landed three triples, a Salchow, a toe loop, and a loop in her free skate, which equaled or exceeded the difficulty of the top male skaters back then. Although her poor standings in compulsories caused her to place 6th overall, she received the special Rookie Award alongside Poland's 14-ear-old Grzegorz Filipowski. Then, in October 1982, Osada placed a close 2nd behind Midori Ito at All Japan Free Championships in Kobe, which was followed by a surprise 4th-place finish at the NHK Trophy in Tokyo, where she placed behind Katarina Witt, Rosalyn Sumners, and Tiffany Chin while finishing ahead of world medalists such as Claudia Leistner and Elizabeth Manley."
"After winning the All Japan Figure Skating Championships in January 1983, Osada was sent to the World Championships in Copenhagen in March, 1983. There, she made a series of errors in compulsories, in which she placed a disappointing 24th. In her short program, she missed the triple loop jump in her combination, which only allowed her to pull up to 21st after this segment of the competition. Due to the new rule instituted in the 1982–1983 season (which, incidentally, was abolished after that season), Osada was unable to skate her free program in ""Group A,"" or the main competition consisting of those who placed 15th or above after short program. Instead, she was placed in ""Group B"" and won the free skate, which resulted in the 3rd-place finish in ""Group B""--or 18th overall."
"""Groves"" was laid down at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts. Her construction was cancelled on 5 September 1944 before she could be launched. The incomplete ship was scrapped."
= = = Public interest theory = = =
"The Public Interest Theory of regulation explains in general terms, that regulation seeks the protection and benefit of the public at large; public interest can be further described as the best possible allocation of scarce resources for individual and collective goods. Regulation means the employment of legal instruments for the implementation of socio-economic policy objectives, for example the government can establish economic and social regulations in order to realize goals like allocative efficiency, stabilization, or fair and just income distribution"
"In modern economies, the allocation of scarce resources is mainly coordinated by the market. In theory, this allocation of resources is optimal, but these conditions are frequently not complied in practice. The allocation of resources is not optimal and there is need for methods for improving the allocation. One of the methods for achieving efficiency in the allocation of resources is government regulation."
"According to public interest theory, government regulation is the instrument for overcoming the disadvantages of imperfect competition, unbalanced market operation, missing markets and undesirable market results. Regulation can improve the allocation by facilitating, maintaining, or imitating market operation. The exchange of goods and production factors in markets assumes the definition, allocation and assertion of individual property rights and freedom to contract."
Public Interest Theory is a part of welfare economics and emphasizes that regulation should maximize social welfare and that regulation is the result of a cost/benefit analysis done to determine if the cost to improve the operation of the market outweighs the amount of increased social welfare.
The following costs can be distinguished in this:
1. The costs of formulating and implementing regulation;
2. The costs of maintaining regulation;
3. The costs of compliance with the rules for industry;
4. The dead weight costs resulting from distortive changes in connection with 1-3.
"Public interest theory is developed from classical conceptions of representative democracy and the role of government, and it has considerable confidence in the civil service, according to Max Weber civil servants are office carriers dedicated to carry out the duties that constitute their particular role or task within a strictly ordered and specialized hierarchy. The combination of merit and tenure with unambiguous norms of impartiality support rational decision making based on administrative decision making where individual decisions are attributed to either the subsumption under norms or the balancing of means and ends."
"In this conception, regulatory administration neither adds to nor subtracts from the policy decided by lawmakers. The public interest may be served, but it is served exactly as interpreted by lawmakers. Bureaucracy does not usurp the public interest, nor does it protect against its usurpation by particularistic interests seeing regulation as a vehicle for their own concerns. Contrary to the capture theory, it states that the ultimate goal of regulation is to pursue some conception of the general good"
"The theory of public interest regulation prevailed up to the 1960s until public choice theory launched its critical attack on established theory. While there is no pointed origin or categorical articulation of this theory, its notions can be traced back to works of Arthur Cecil Pigou; related to his analysis of externalities and welfare economics. This theory was prevalent, especially during the New Deal progressive era, as stated above, starting the 1960s, economists of the Chicago school began critiquing the assumption of benevolent regulators, proposing counter theories, like the Public choice theory, which is based on personal-interests of agents."
"Regulation, according to Public interest theory however, is assumed initially to benefit society as a whole rather than particular vested interests. The regulatory body is considered to represent the interest of the society in which it operates rather than the private interests of the regulators."
One example of the application of Public Interest Theory can be seen in an investigation in Sweden and the energy market:
"We test the public interest and regulatory capture hypotheses, in the context of the Swedish electricity market, by studying the factors influencing the Swedish Energy Agency’s decision to replace decision-makers it employs to hear customer complaints against utilities.We test if the regulator’s decision to retain, or replace, the decision-maker, following a sequence of decisions, can be explained by whether the customer or utility is being favored by the civil servant. Based on whether the regulator replaces the decision maker that it has the power to appoint, we draw inferences about what theory can best explain the behavior of the regulator. The regulator can choose to favor the customer. To do so would be consistent with the fact that the primary objective of the electricity market reform in 1996 was to put the onus on the Swedish Energy Agency to provide stronger consumer protection against market abuse by the electricity utilities. On the other hand, the regulator might be captured because the utilities have more financial and legal resources and they have a well-established lobby organization which the customers do not have. It is not clear, therefore, whether customers or utilities have benefited most during the post-reform regulation."
"The most critiqued aspects of Public Interest Theory, are its ambiguity, and inability to determine when and if public interest has progressed."
Two problems with public interest theory are:
"When the regulatory agency is established, during a period of regulatory reform, the agency is subject to close scrutiny from the government and the public alike and the regulatory agency faces strong pressure to protect consumers from market abuse. However, over time, the focus of government and public attention turn to other issues, removing the spotlight from the activities of the regulator. With this development, the regulator becomes more susceptible to regulatory capture."
"The competing hypothesis is that even when a regulatory body is established to protect consumers from monopolistic abuse, it will be captured by the firms that it is established to discipline."
= = = Daniel Costescu = = =
"Daniel Ştefan Costescu (born 14 July 1976) is a former Romanian footballer who usually played as a striker. He scored 44 goals in 222 matches in the Romanian First Division and 21 goals in 67 matches in the Romanian Second Division. His first match in Divizia A (Romanian First Division) was Olimpia Satu Mare - Petrolul Ploieşti 3-0 on 1 August 1998, while playing for Petrolul Ploieşti. He was selected once in the Romanian Divisionary National Team (comprising players playing only in the Romanian leagues)."
"Born in Câmpina, Prahova county, Costescu began playing football with ""Sterom Câmpina"" in Divizia D (Romanian Fourth Division), and in 1996 he moved to the representative team of the same town, Poiana Câmpina, in Divizia B, the Romanian Second Division. He played 2 years for Poiana Câmpina, scoring 15 goals in 60 games, helping the team getting a top 10 finish in both seasons."
"He then attracted the interest of Petrolul Ploieşti in Divizia A, the best team from the Prahova county, three-time champions of Romania. At Petrolul Ploieşti he established himself as an important striker in the Romanian league, scoring 27 goals between 1999 and 2002. During his time at Petrolul Ploieşti he caught the eyes of Romanian greats Steaua Bucureşti and Dinamo Bucuresti."
"After his experience at Petrolul Ploieşti, he changed the team but not the city, signing for Astra Ploieşti, where he had a prolific season, scoring 10 goals in 26 games, helping them to a record-high 9th position in Divizia A."
"After his short spell at Astra Ploieşti, he returned to Petrolul Ploieşti, where he played for another 2 years, scoring 9 goals in 36 games."
"In 2004, he transferred to a well-established club in Romania, FC Argeş Piteşti, 2-time champions of Romania and the team that gave players like Nicolae Dobrin, Adrian Mutu, Adrian Neaga, Dănuţ Coman and Paul Codrea. But, unfortunately for him, his time at FC Argeş was not one of the best, managing to score just 2 goals in 1 season."
