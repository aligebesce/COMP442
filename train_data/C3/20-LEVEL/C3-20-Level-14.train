This timing will enable even the youngest children to take part.
Mhm.
It was at a church in Hertford.
And we were completely frozen cos the boiler had broken down and we were there at two o'clock to rehearse.
"And  I had one rehearsal of two Bach pieces which were really difficult  and I was com , feeling completely frantic during the break in rehearsal, and went over  to look at the music  and some fellow called Don bounded over to me  and said, oh you can't be  you know you sh can't be looking at that now, ba, la dee da dee da!"
He must have heard that I'd come back from  Ireland.
"So, he was talking about Ireland, really raving about it and  his name's Kennedy and  he's from Liverpool and he likes to think he's got Irish blood in him, he's been there twice this year and"
Mhm.

Really enthusing about it.
So we were chatting away about that.
"And then erm  after the rehearsal  some of us went off to get a pizza  before the concert  and he said to me, erm  are you interested in going to hear the  Mozart Requiem, it's on at the Barbican on Wednesday?"
"So I said, yeah!"
"Co , I've always wanted to hear it, and as you know it's our next concert."

"So he goes, yeah alright then."
"Oh come on you can be on my side  cos it was obvious, like, he was just sort of sat there."
Mm.
"And erm  and then like, he went back in after we'd finished playing and me and Scott carried on playing for a bit  and then erm  what was he going?"
"Oh yeah, he told me afterwards right, that he, the only reason he was angry was because Friday night reminded him of the time in his past or something!"
"And Pete reminded him of, him of the person that he hated and all this!"
"And I was thinking  Shrimpy, you're stupid!"
Get a life !
You sure!
Oh !
"And then, cos I thought boy!"
So what did he do?
"He's really made my life different, this little dog."

"Don't want C D's, set of tapes, C D's are a waste of money."
Why?
"After having a C D for Christmas last year, they're a waste of money."
"No, but it's cheaper to buy a tape because the ."
"Yeah you ain't got, you get better quality on a C D."
"If you've got the C D we could all , yes you do, we could all use it, then you could have blank tapes, and then you can tape it on cassette  but I want a list of two C D's and I, in Argos if there's a watch  nan want's the list and she want's it this weekend."

I'll buy you one.
"It depends where I can spend voucher, I'll buy you one with voucher, how's that?"
So I'm not having that one then?
And I ate me butty there on top.
In the pouring bloody rain and howling wind I expect.
"It was, yeah  it was horrible ."
So then I just had a drive round all the sites.
Did you find them all alright?
Yeah.
I know where I'm going now with er all of them.
"You know and getting to them, I know how to get from one to the other  without going, you know?"
All round the houses.
I've got a good idea of where everywhere is.
So I was quite pleased.
Mm.
When I got back  ooh  you know I told you about that job?
We've put a bid in for Arrow Park.
Mm.
Rob thinks we've got it.
Oh god.
Winning some bloody jobs aren't you.
"What have they done, dropped their prices?"
Well Rob's doing them isn't he?
Oh they have had to drop their prices.
"They've had to  go for the  we did them a few sort of quotes on the survey side of this Arrow Park  and er  we've gotta, you know, really stick to this tight budget because it's the only way you can get them no matter what people are telling you  erm  about the recession being over, people still want things for nothing."
So  this survey might have to be done at the beginning of April.
But it's not a big one so
"Well when's these in Caernarvon, the end of April?"
Starting the twenty seventh of April.
It's the weekend after  's wedding?
Yeah.
So I shall be enjoying myself at  the wedding
Mm.
ready for my hard slog.
Eh?
she's a teacher and I think she thinks that teachers are the only ones that work!
Yeah.
Oh bloody hell!
And I said something
Cor!
to her like erm
Oh yeah .
Yeah.
"erm, what did I say?"
Something about  oh what did I say?
"She's a funny woman anyway, I said something like"
They are  peculiar breed!
I should think  I should think you  it's nice to have the six weeks  ahead of us  and she said  well it's not a holiday!
I thought well I wouldn't mind
Ooh no!
six weeks of not having to get up and you gotta go.
"No, not going into the shop at least, yeah."
Cor!
"She said  she said for the first week you unwind, I thought  if we have a weeks holiday that means that the time you unwind you're back to work again!"
You're back to work .
That's right.
She said and then I have two weeks  erm  homework to mark  and then we have a weeks holiday  I thought well that's two weeks
Yeah.
holiday
Cor!
really.
That's it.
She said and then the next week you're preparing to go back!
Well why can't she do that  two weeks marking in that first week she needs to unwind?
Yeah.
And then have a
"And yet  another client of mine who's a teacher, she said oh yeah she said it's lovely, she said  I suppose I ought to do the  marking and all that  at the beginning she said but I leave it, she said, and I sometimes do it in the last week."
"No, it's a can't be in the garden, can he."
Yeah.
Same as with these next door.
I get right upset about Paddy.
"I mean she's give his kennel away now, and he's got no kennel again."
Ar.
"And he's running streets, and you know how cold it was last week, and he's running streets."
"What she give kennel away for, then."
I don't bloody know.
I think she'd give the dog away as well.
Saw him coming.
"Don't lick, don't let him lick her, Karen."
Don't lick.
You mutt
all right.
I've been round me mums this morning.
I expect I'll go.
Yeah.
any better or.
"She said, when I went round she was sat doing crossword on bed."
"And then, er, I said I've just come to see if you want any cigs."
"She said, well our John's coming down tonight, she said, just get me twenty."
"I said, you might as well get forty, I said, because if he's late coming down"
"Yeah, right."
"And he can't round shop after, you'd be stuck, and I mean, he."
"I don't  Albert don't mind going for her cigs, but it's just that we don't get up early in the morning, you know, and if me mum's ringing at eight o'clock in the morning, 'cos she got no cigs."
"It's a bit unfair like, when when she could at"
I said  she said after my job at
Margaret's not very well.
she hadn't seen Margaret since Christmas Eve.
"Yeah, but she ain't been bad since Christmas Eve."
"Oh, no."
Mhm.
"and four, four nights overtime."
Mm.
"I couldn't do that, not that I want to."
Do you think the conditions make people kind of like-minded in like the respective politics and things like that?
"Do you think it's sort of, you know, do you hold a lot of views in common with people you work beside or?"
"Not, no, not really."
Not really.
We've got quite a mixture.
"Oh, has it gone round a bit?"
"Yeah, it's gone round a bit now."
Yeah.
Well  we had  oh I'm  trying to think what we had today  oh got out of assembly  because  I had to go and speak to this maths teacher who's dead boring!
Mr   but like  I pretended I had to go and see him  not because I had to go and see him just because I didn't wanna go to assembly really!
Oh!
Cos I'm like that!
"We haven't, we haven't got assembly at the moment cos like  you know that erm  musical ?"
Oh yeah.
"It's all, all that but  ooh, that's a groovy  stage !"
Oh What!
Oh yeah
left over  left over at  and stuff which
Oh yes
Oh  we've made these telephones !
And well look
Well we know that now !
Yeah but it's just
"Ah gee  Have a look if Shaun and Joanna are back, oh yeah they are."
"I said I'd go down there but the, like the car wasn't there so I didn't go back."
Oh dear !
"I didn't, I didn't know Joe was out actually."
And what did they call her?
Now she's alright.
"Now she, she picked the paper."
Used to live down the back of us.
But she's moved.
She
She picked all the paper.
"But they pa he painted, he papered every room ."
Really?
Mm mm.
"I mean, they've just had a new double glazed back door put on."
"And that, but  then one morning I we"
"But it doesn't look, it doesn't look double glazed does it?"
No.
"One morning I was off up Bambury Lane and John was waiting  to catch Paul to come  some trust or, I don't know whether it's social or what, bought a detached house on Bambury Lane cos there were an uproar."
Cos Mick started all this up there.
"And it was done  through a trust then, and it was done so quietly that they hadn't time to object."
Mm.
And  mentally  handicapped live in this house.
Well they do object.
"But they've turned this  four, five bedroomed detached house, you know, it's got a ramp now up to the front door, the front door's been altered so"
Mm mm.
"so we  made each  what was the dining room they've made into a bedroom, but just don't  that he, cos you could see  them doing it."
Mm mm.
And all that.
"In fact, Tony  's brother, Freddie, he's there  but Johnny was still outside working and he was filthy!"
Bet if I took his jacket off and put it in that washer it'd of fallen to bits cos it was that mucky.
Urgh!
Oh I thought he was like that.
Arnie was playing football.
They've gone football match at club.
So that'll be another pile of bloody washing!
Oh  in  decent state  he didn't last time I scrubbed  well I wou
go on Monday?
No.
Oh.
Yeah well they sho I said I'd  I was looking through this
Mm
"and I was thinking cor  we say we haven't been doing very well, but look at that week there!"
And then  look  it's not
Yeah.
"too bad for this time of  I bet we're doing better this year, this time of the year than we did last."
Yeah  .
"Well you see you  do that minibus want cleaning up, that blue one  or was that clean before we put it in the shed?"
"No  that's  part of the   the windows washing but I'll  quickly washed over them  just to spruce them up a bit but I thought if I put Mrs  in that, is she driving, or is she not?"
"Erm, I should imagine so."
"Yes, she is."
Is she?
Don't she like the column change?
No.
Oh God!
Well I can't help it.
"Well you'll just have to explain to her, the other one"
Yeah.
hasn't come back after you've
"Well no , no what I'm saying was, the fifteen seaters here you see but  I can't, I shan't be  put the petrol in for the both shall I?clean tomorrow night."
Well I don't know what time she's picking it up at actually.
Oh.
I should imagine that's his number.
What number?
I hope he paid you this week then.
"Yeah,."
Well you  with his money you can pay off them two bills.
Yeah.
They might be symmetrical about here or here.
Or  it this way round.
What's that?
What's that?
That's a .
Erm
Well I mean what gives you that?
What gives you that?
"Well, what does that look like from the way you're looking at it?"
s
"The way you're looking at it, it looks something like erm Y equals X to"
X
the fourth plus three or something.
Mm.
Good.
So looking at it this way up I mean  it's  X equals Y to the fourth  plus three and that's all minus.
Mm.
X X equals three minus Y to the fourth.
It's a funny way of putting it.
Yeah.
But you could write your equation that way.
"Er if someone says that's not good enough, I want it in terms of Y equals"
"well okay we'll have to bring the three over to this side, and take the fourth root,."
"But you can always swap the axes, if you don't like what they give you."
Mm.
"So if, if I say  draw erm  Y equals the square root of X, and you think I haven't got a clue what that looks like."
You can square both sides.
"You can draw Y squared equals X, and all you have to do is say well, I can draw  the other way round."
Mm.
Y equals X squared.
"You draw your Y equals X squared,turn the paper round that way, and whichever way, I'm going to draw Y equals X squared."
"And erm   Y equals X squared, and that's Y and that's an X. Then turn it the other way up to get X equals Y squared, and now that's the Y and this is the X."
"You know, use that as an excuse."
Yeah.
fine okay.
"Right okay I think that's it then,er  Okay"
Right.
so  one's really the one where I need to involve you.
Basically i if you can.
Yeah.
The rest I'll let you know
I hear.
Erm I I'm also I also quite
Ooh
would like to know what's going on with  and .
Whether  actually has any er control over what  's doing in the marketplace.
Okay yeah yeah.
"I know it was Andy  last time and he's a  guy so yeah, I'll find out."
Well  you find out I might be able to find out to .
Well  yeah okay.
"Erm that was a point,, I er  spindle bearings and I want to take the business off 'em."
"Now with it being , we're not gonna look at a high margin straight away cos I know that's a waste of time."
Er but we can make a reasonable margin including spacers.
It's a set of three bearings with a pair of spacers.
"So you have two bearings in tandem, a pair of spacers and a third bearing."
And it's their normal machine centre range.
They use like about forty pairs a month.
Yeah.
"Erm  sell for about eighty seven pound including spacers so I was gonna go in at about eighty three, eighty four but it's the new pricing company so I've got to ask your permission haven't I?"
". It's a new product, I'm gonna make reasonable It's about thirty five per cent margin"
It's a new product?
No it's it's a new size for us to supply.
We've never b
Well
Knowing Yvonne she'll  hee hee!
"Actually it's surprising how many faces you can get  just looking at cheap newspapers you see, incredible!"
You think ooh that's well done  quite easy.

and that's why I've enjoyed coming out this evening.
"And here, here am I, and then I'll say  you know of course I  you know I'm indebted to you because I realize that, you know, Anna-Marie is quite prepared to go out with other men if she wants to"

"And can you tell me the ta , time of trains from  ."
"Yum yum, look, come on over here."
"And that's what he was like on Wednesday night, he said look"
"as so , more or less as soon as he'd said hello he said erm  thirty two and two minutes past the hour, they're your trains."
Yeah.
I had some  like that.
"Like, like little lies, sort of, you know, she sort of pretends, that's her pretend role."
Yeah.
"Well, yeah, I suppose it, yeah."

"You can get, you can get sets of four can't you?"
Oh yes
But six  hard to get.
I'll just try and get two carvers to match
"Yeah, that's, that's the answer really and er if they're not quite the same you can get away with two carvers can't you?"
"But er  oh well  Yeah this is what got me, I like the er the legs you know, the the backs I, I didn't like at all because you've got this blue"

Which piece to use for which course.
"they weren't, they weren't gentlemen so they couldn't be er  they couldn't be officers."
Mm.
Oh there's a lot of that well done wasn't there?
It's called the class structure.
Yeah.
Or system.
"Well, ironically his creed was supposed to be without that wasn't it  Hitler?"
"You know, this supreme race but all  more or less equal."
"Well no, that wasn't the case!"

So get your papers ready and everything tonight
Yeah cos you gotta lay out money aren't you?
Yeah so if I decide to
"Oh he said, when he's finished  I don't whether he's not picking it up till later on."
Ooh and another  that's what I wanted  to tell you about  well I don't think we can help him out.
Oh well.
Gentleman wanted a minibus
Yeah.
"now, he talked rather nice  erm  with having four"
Yeah.
I can't remember his name at all I can I can't think of it now.
I'm gonna go and watch T V.
"Well what he wanted, he wanted a minibus from there  to there and there  well we can't can we?"
We can have one from there  to there  but he can't have one here.
"Daddy, mummy"
Can he?
thinks the key was down
I
the
Jonathan I don't really
"Just a minute Jonathan , let mum   because the college has got one there"
Yeah.
Toby's got one there  and  got the other one there.
Yeah.
Well what time is Toby coming back?
Well so he can't have that one then?
"And the Isle of Ely college is going out for a meal, so that won't be back, so he can't have that one, so we haven't got one!"
No.
"For Friday night, but he can have one  sort of, first thing Saturday morning."
But otherwise we haven't got one.
No  er
"erm, and that lady's gonna ring about the Fiesta"
and then that young boy's gonna ring about the van.
Yeah.
How much did he cost?
Three hundred and fifty.
Three hundred and fifty.
"No it wasn't, it was three hundred."
It was two
Yes it was.
Three hundred and fifty.
"Oh anyway, it was still pretty good wasn't it?"
"Wasn't cheap, I mean"
"No, but I mean you could see   play really well ."
"I mean Southgate's all the more pleasing when you think he's somebody that's worked his way up, right?"
Yeah.
That's really nice to see.
And he played really well.
Southgate is a harder person to mark isn't he?
Yeah.
"I think I'd drop Mortimer  oh look, Palace."
Red car  it's like ours isn't it?
Yeah.
"I'd drop, I'd drop Paul Mortimer"
Yeah.
and have Collymore in right?
"And encourage  that's the trouble, you drop Mortimer you drop somebody who can er flip the ball in but  I think you definitely want to take the heat off Wright."
Now if if all Collymore does is distract   but Mortimer was not playing enough of the game.
"We can't afford  people like Mortimer to, I mean he scored a goal  but I mean"
Yeah.
Eddie  I think is worth  sheer sort of  opening teams up.
"Well he does open, there's no  not many players can play a team better like  than opening up"
"So what'd you do, say you had  back next week so our next game against Birmingham."
What would you do then?
"Well I mean they've got, they've got, he's gotta do something because you're gonna lose that Birmingham game."
It's got a whole tin in that dish  that'll fill it up won't it?
Never mind.
Oh  see him.
"Well I know, but he didn't have top dog meat since he's been here."
Not since he's been back for a week.
"Say that whole tin will do it, won't it?"
"Today  I tried to get a whole tin every day, it's just because it happened."
Say that.
"Leave her alone, come on!"
You have been feeding it though?
"Course I have, been giving it a what we've had, like  when the kids didn't eat their dinner or we ain't eat all our dinner  been giving it what's left on the plate, well"
and he's had chops and mash and all that lot.
Bananas.

Oh did it?
Mm.
"So, so Tessa's might"
It might be it's just under the eye
"Yeah,"
down below

"Ah,."
"That German Shepherd having a good, oh he's gone, it's the   oh dear"
Were lucky to have this place aren't we?
"Oh it's lovely isn't it, it's beautiful."

No.
"because, what with this, the bridges and rivers"
Edge Borough.
", yeah and, and then the recreation ground is, is, when the gypsies's are not there."
"Yeah, yeah, well the di the difficult is now in Simon's Wood, in the car park at Simon's Wood."

"She phoned this morning  and I said I can't come and collect it cos I'm here by myself she said oh I'll bring it in, that's alright, no problem but er we're going away to Gloucester at two o'clock"

"Oh well that's good, right."
otherwise we'll go down
I think we could let her off this time.
that's er all your overheads paid innit?
"That's right, yeah."
"I think Ian used to sell these  things, whatever they are."
Yeah that's what I said he said no it didn't come from me he said but I think they did used to sell something like that.
He popped in a couple of times.
His missus earns nineteen grand a year.
Pardon?
His missus earns nineteen grand a year at the bank.
Cor!
"And he gets about, he didn't say what he got but it's over the twenty three thousand drawings that er they're worried about the level of er tax, you know, for the next"
My goodness.
"So he must, they must get forty grand a year"
"Between them, yeah."
"Well I did a proje projection for the erm guy at Nationwide, I said well it's probably gonna be about a hundred and fifty grand turnover  and about twenty five to thirty percent clear, you know"
Ah
net profit.
"Which is about right I suppose, yeah."
So I said
You want a change?
How
Yeah.
was you thinking of having it cut?
Short.
What short short?
Yeah.
"Actually I think it suits you, I mean really i like  it's not on her face anyway isn't it?"
No  so short
So I think
No.
short hair would suit you cos you haven't got it all over your face have you?
Cos I saw erm  a photo when I was eighteen and I it was  sort of short in the neck  over my ears  short in there and then sort of fuller there and then just a bit of  you know a light fringe not a heavy fringe  and I thought I might have it like that so
Yeah.
That'll be nice  I can't really remember
Well I think if that was me  I'd have that done now  in case you don't like it by the time you  you get married and that could be growing again.
Oh no I wouldn't have it cut until after I got married.
Oh
No.
you'd have it cut after?
Yeah.
Oh.
Cos I definitely want my hair long for when we get married.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah  so that I can either have it  up or down really.
Yeah.
I've got the choice then.
Yeah  I do do you know I don't like to see brides with their hair down  if you've got long hair i
Oh.
but I don't think  sometimes I think  well if it looks nice  but some of them brides on there that just hangs   don't it?
"Oh yeah, I'm not having it like that."
By a total stranger?
Well I suppose I wouldn't do that with a total stranger.
She did.
"I know, but a stra , what do you mean, what do you classify as a stranger?"
Someone you don't know
Yeah.
anything about.
I know that they're they're
Because I go out
they're involved in the ca
if
"in the, erm the choir."
Just because you work with the guy
But you've never had a conversation with him.
Mm mm.
Just because you know the guy from Marks and Spencers.
I did that with Graham.
"I went out, I hadn't even  I'd said hello to him, that was it."
"You see, I think that's really strange  in this day and age."
Yes but you're meeting in a public place.
"Not like, I mean I was making my way there, he was making his way there  and  I wouldn't want them to come and pick me up in the car"
Mm mm.
"and me go off, I wouldn't do that  without really  you know, having been out with him a few times."
But I'd make
Good.
my own way there and meet them.
In a public place.
"But if I met, but then that's slightly different because if I met someone in a  nightclub or  something like that  then I would be quite wary."
Mm mm.
I don't think I'd  I don't know  I don't know what I'd do.
I'd feel quite differently.
"But something like the choir or where you've been working, I don't know you, I, I've got this thing which is"
Yes.
"That was er  that, yeah well it's not out yet is it?"
Looks like a  looks like the front of a B M W to me.
I think that's what they're trying to emulate.
Oh that one.
How much is it?
Supposed to be.
Don't know how much it costs.
"Should think it starts at about sixteen, seventeen thousand  ."
Yeah .
A three's heavy isn't it?
Look.
Yeah.
"So you got any ideas what you're gonna get, what you should get mum for ?"
Er.
We could just  fall back on a bit of sweets and chocolate or something in the end but I'd like to get some
What  what sort of thing are you gonna get her?
there's some funny little weird shops down Thornton Heath aren't there?
What sort of thing are we talking about?
Well I dunno.
Something  I'm not  I've no idea until I see it.
Well something like soap or what?
"Could get her some, some toiletries or something."
I dunno.
I was hoping for something even more er
a Moss chemist might be able to get her some Bromley don't they?
There is a Moss chemist on the way.
Oh yes she did tell me that she'd like some of that.
Yes there is one isn't there?
By  shops.
"Right we, we'll  we'll treat that as a fail safe then."
If we can't see anything more unusual suppose we could always fall back on  the bubble baths or the  anyway I think that's a bit more than  but there you go.
Well I firmly believe in building up a library .
So do I.
Good I'm glad
I I mean there's
you said that because I w I want to buy a book!
no  library because I think  er if you are contacted for information and you are able to say  okay we have a book  or we have books.
Yeah.
"That's that's one of the things I I I ke , I've kept all my New Scientists."
I keep these.
Yeah.
I go through them gonna collate that cos there's loads of stuff in there good.
Yeah.
But I do get quite a few people phone me as you know asking for information.
I just photocopy relevant bits
None of  none of them has got in contact with me.
Really!
No.
Aren't they funny.
I get the feeling
Well I should give you er
that they either phone in.
Phone me and then get it all given to them  just like that.
That yeah.
And no further effort involved cos
"Well I should, I could ."
No it isn't.
"This woman who, who keeps phoning me up about all this oil pollution on her land."
She she.
"I sent, I wrote off to Friends of the Earth, I got a load of information all about the law  and she still phones me up and say oh you know what the District Council's they won't do anything and the N R A wasn't doing anything."
And I said well when did you last contact them?
February!
Apparently she's got a problem that  the oil pollution is coming off this site where they're refurbishing the boilers.
"Sort of big words for little words  that's a big word, you have to think of an addition, I've had it in   nineteen"

Oh yeah.
"peoples of other land, look all the people that come from"
"Mum, how do I get"
Are you sure it's up-to-date though?

Urgh!
"Look famous  famous founders, pioneers  Africa for east or west  I think it'd be there today  the muses  do you know what that says?"

"Well we had a piano actually, we got it for Doreen and Doreen  she started to learn, she went to Mr ."
Remember Mr  that used to live at ?
She went to him and then he flitted away.
And er she just never went anywhere else and gave up.
And Carol liked to come through and just tinker but she never got lessons or anything so we just sold it.
Mhm.
"But, as long as the  music had doh ray mes written on it I could play with one hand but"
Mhm.
other than that I was lost.
"Mhm, do you think it's quite good"
Mhm.
that they're getting a lot of music at school these days and?
"I think it is, yes, I think it's a great thing really."
Do you think it's important?
"Yes, erm  I can't give you a reason why I think it's important though."
But I think it is.
I think it's a it's the lighter side of the  their their schooling.
"They have a serious side but they must have a lighter side as well, mustn't they?"
In the school.
"But you must really enjoy singing to  yourself, you must find that something"
Oh I do.
you get out of singing that you don't get anywhere else.
"Its's no, no, I I do enjoy, I r I like singing."
I like the music.
Mm.
And it was either thinking about the wage packet at end of week which I was at first.
Mm.
"And then  I were coming home and I were, I were really awful."
And I thought why should I?
And then on Thursday  I went in to work and I had had enough.
"And I come home and I says to him, I'm not having this no more."
"I said no,."
Mm.
He says well if you want to pack it in love
Bless you.

"And I did and to be quite honest, I mean  it wasn't the money really when you think about it because at end of day, forty six pound  he were spending in pub anyway."
So  I were working for nothing really.
Yeah.
but he he were getting cos you were going out and having a drink er on er Tuesdays Thursdays Saturdays and Sundays.
"Whereas now, I mean  we don't go."
You don't go.

"And well I, we even considered me and my sister even considered going back into driving instruction."
We went to a seminar
Mm.
a fortnight ago.
"It's stupid, I mean I've been a driving instructor seventeen year, and I'm not allowed to teach over here."
No?
"No, I've got to take it all again."
"You're talking about sixteen, seventeen hundred pound to get you through."
Yeah.
"But you see with this bank thing with the government, you can have a loan  I think it's up to about four thousand pound  like a restart."
And it's a free loan for fifteen months.
Mm.
And then on the sixteenth month you've gotta pay it back.

"Which means we've done three times in a night and a half, Agnes?"
"Oh, she's useless!"
So you're gonna write up the list?

Poke people's eyes  with a
"Cos you don't want wanna have a meal, sort of nicknacky that you can sort of nibble."

"I don't suppose you fancy taking this tape machine home tonight do you, and recording some of your conversation with your brother or something?"
"The longest conversation we have is, get off the computer, it's my turn!"
"Er, I wonder if we should take this to school tomorrow?"
Oh great laugh!

Okay we can't do this I don't like it you know talking to the  on the programme we don't like it at all.

"It's twenty seven minutes past twelve, B B C Radio York the station that's always first for travel."
We're looking at the roads er for North Yorkshire this Saturday afternoon.
On the A one in the Bedale area there's still a mobile lane closure in operation on the north bound carriageway.
That's between Bedale and Catterick at the moment and slight delays are possible there.
Yeah I've read about it.
According to this thing in the paper they er had a hundred and thirty people.
Mm.
And er
Hundred and thirty!
Well  that's what is says there .
You could
quite a lot don't they?
Protestors were joined by York MP Hugh Bailey and City Councillors as they gathered at Heworth on Saturday.
Erm I'm surprised that slightly surprised that with council and Hugh were willing to go down given what we had given our information about how dangerous or not the site actually is.
That it's not very nice but it's er
I didn't know Heworth was gonna be that
Yes.
until it mentioned
They're also apparently  with ill health and amongst people living in the surrounding area.
Whether there's any truth in this is  and the A A E who did the er survey include Atomic Energy Authority who who's  like that as well.
Right okay.
I think we must have missed a briefing from
Must must have done.
Might might be the one when you were away.
Right well there's a nice er we did get in the paper.
We did.
Mm.
Right any tasks to carry forward?
Well erm Steve asked  to write letters to to Penny .
I don't know whether Jean got John  to have written to Jean  or not.
I think he might have done but he didn't say.
Erm apart from that I think we've done everything this week.
Can you just quick quickly fill me in on what this letter to Penny  is?
It was about the supporters' campaign in the last
Yeah.
there's an article about  erm where is it here somewhere  .
"And walked round  ah so they er  got a, sort of court bailiff involved."
"For sixty two pound, it must of cost them more than that!"
Cost a lot of money I would of thought.
They obviously don't like him do they?
No  well  erm  it's a big firm so
Perhaps it's
what they did in  is er  .
Yeah but he's got his self a bad name now isn't he?
Yeah.
"It made me laugh when your mum kept on about him last night, about having all his hampers stolen."
Yeah.
Twenty two grand!
Ridiculous innit?
The blokes on the make isn't he?
Yeah.
You see he's  and then he had the cheek to charge me for insurance!
Well I expect him to pay the insurance.
Who did pay the insurance?
"did, but I  gonna give it back."
"Well I should think so,gonna get twenty two grand out of it!"
"Cos he'd have taken them to court and said well he didn't even pay it, I did!"
Well actually they erm  I think the  maximum they'll pay out is eighteen thousand.
Yeah but I don't think that's gonna be such an easy case to .
"Well, I don't."
You know it looks to me
They said they'd got it.
"they think that it's all cut and dry, well  they haven't got the  then people will come round and investigate yet!"
No.
Mum that'll come out on the tape!
Well I can't stop it cos the kettle's boiling!
Don't be silly!
Mum is there any shandy please?
"To do with application as number forty four your worships, please."
It's in respect of erm  temporary authority  for the  your worship.
"Your worship please  I'd like to make to application on behalf of Mr   for a protection order in respect of Vigitalle Er, Mr  Mr , Mr ."
Your full name is James ?
Yes sir.
And you have resided for the last six months at the  and at er  ?
Yes.
And are you this morning applying for a protection in respect of the  Vigitalle
Yes.
"Er, would you, would you  tell the, your worships what experience you've had in the licensed trade."
"Er, yes sir my current position  er, at the moment I'm at the licensed house trainee manager for  Boddingtons Brewery and I've held that position for  five and half years."
"Er  previously I've had, held  the license of Three Fishes at Lyddon er, for three years  er, previous to that I held the license of the Mason's Arms, with   for three years previous to that  and before I've been connected with the  catering and licensed trade  from be fifteen."
And you're there for quali qualified rather than just the licensed trade would that be ?
"I hope so, yes sir."
"And are you applying to, but,ar are you proposing to apply  for the permanent transfer of this license?"
Yes sir.
Thank you.
"Er, Mrs  please."
"Mrs , your full is Margaret ?"

"Er, application   ."
"Yes,"
?
Occasionally.
"I mean, at the moment there's no housekeeper so unless I actually say to the maid will you just put something in the oven for me?"
That's it.
That's appalling though!
"And on , on erm  Thursday  Thursday evening before they were going out to Mark  she came home at  just about half one."
She came and made me a ham sandwich  and the maid just look at her   to eat it now.
Brilliant!
There really was not a scrap of .
That's awful!
"Because the housekeeper  sorts all that out, so when she's away no one does it?"
"But she bought all these things for me from Marks and Spencers, you know breaded chicken and"
Mm mm.
Mm.
breasts.
Yeah.
I put them all in the deep freeze.
"Unless you think about it, you know the day before  or the"
Yeah
Yeah.
morning you come in.
But surely you can just defrost it in the microwave?
She doesn't have a microwave.
Does she not?
Why doesn't she use a
She doesn't like them.
microwave?
Doesn't like them.
But she bought you one.
She get you one.
That was quite funny because  it was our first Christmas down there  and I was saying to the housekeeper that I  I wouldn't mind having people come and stay and    not a problem because we've got a lovely cooker  and we're going to bring our microwave down from .
"Said it's electric, I'm just going to unplug it and bring it down and put it on the work top."
The only thing is that it's chocolate brown and my kitchen's all white.
You can't have  all in cardboard boxes.
It's erm  not easy to organize.
You can't  and keep them open at the same time.
What is the most common problem you've experienced in your dealings with  Street?
It's phoning them up and the person I want to talk to isn't there!
I think.
"Have you had any, anybody else  phone them up or written to them?"
No?
No.
I think they're quite abrupt and rude whenever I've phoned them up.
Are they?
They're not terribly friendly.
"Oh they're usually okay I, I mean what they don't know  ."
I mean I just find it annoying cos you get through  to somebody who then passes you on to somebody else and then they'll talk to you and say well the person you want to talk to isn't here at the moment so you've had all this phone call and then you've got to ring again.
And you have to do it in office hours as well.
What has been your proudest moment this year?
Oh that was Rob.
When he was able er to enter the sub committee.
Oh yes.
"He was really proud of that and he, he made a point of that being"
I'll write that down.
for him  years of struggle  to get any influence to finally find himself
Oh good one.
What sort of committee is it then?
Hearing aid!
"Well I think one does speak a bit louder in public meetings, it's just ."
And I I can only do this work I'm sorry.

Chocolate
Pardon?
Well sh I don't know.
.
"if anyone offered me a chocolate when I was nursing, yes I would eat it but there was always ."
"Which reminds me, I meant to get weighed this morning before I had my breakfast and I forgot."
"Remind me tomorrow, before I eat anything."
I think I'd better put some washing in before I go out.
Are those ankle boots dry?
What?
achilles tendon
It's better now.
"I d on Wednesday I did the erm  said to me don't do the high heel part if you think it's going to hurt again, you can still have the support under it, but I managed ok."
It didn't hurt.
"The pink one's the dish cloth, the little one's the one I wipe up small spills off the floor."
I wonder how Bryony is?
What?
"I said, I wonder how Bryony is?"
She wasn't very well yesterday.
"Every time she got a bump or a knock off one of the others, she was howling instead of clouting them back."
"And Richard had, I don't think Richard's very well either."
"I said I don't, well stop running the tap."
I said I don't think Richard's very well either.
He cried more than usual.
I wonder what kind of a night Trevor had with them on his own?
What do you think of Granny Jean offering offering again to get Martin from school to save Trevor walking him home?
I don't know.
I like her.
Mhm?
I like her
They let British come into America

"No, no."
Dogs from Britain can practically live anywhere
Yeah.
"Hel hello Topsy, hello Topsy, I'll shall squeeze your feet if you do it any more, I'll shall squeeze your paws and you won't like it."
Is that a good way of stopping her doing it?
"Mm, I always use to do it with my German Shepherd."
"Yeah, but they don't ."
"Cos, cos they're big enough, if they even in love, they can knock a child, well they could knock a grown up flat on your back."
She'll not be too .
"Yes, no squeeze the paws ,"
"We got  ,"
"not, not too hard for her but enough so that it's uncomfortable"
yeah.
"and they hate it, and after, after a week, after a week of having their paws squeezed every time they jump up,stop ."
"I've a lot, a lot of my friends have got  big dogs and they say oh they will jump up and I say squeeze her paws, it usually works"
Mm.
"in a week, ten days, something like."
I'll have to do that.
"They're a very , but they can still knock you flat on your back."
"Oh yeah, well she's had a, a some old chap who was walking around here, she just ran past him"
Yeah.
and she just caught the back of his leg  .
"Oh yeah , behind your knees you can."
He just crumpled up.
"I say she's only doing, she's only playing around."
"Oh yes, it's all affection."
"Mm, I'll have to try that with the feet, come on."
Oh dear god    Those chrysanthemums done well.
"They have, yes  they're er  they're good value those a pot, I mean  but  they're reasonably  when did you get it?"
It must be about three weeks ago.
Can't think what it was for now.
I think it was one of those impromptu ones.
I know  it wasn't my birthday you just came in with it didn't you ?
It's  birthday.
I mean the only trouble is they're no use afterwards are they?
Must have had a brainstorm
I said they're no use afterwards are they?
I don't  I don't know.
Because they're forced I reckon.
Oh.
I think they'll grow if you put them in the garden  eventually.
Well
"Well I mean they won't flower again, that's for certain you see and it's it's gotta be"
"No, well not this year anyway, they  they could"
Oh right.
"Have you got, oh ta look  take this as well."
Yes I'm taking it.
Oh.
I'm going to have a go at this   today.
"They've dried out a bit, been too tacky to do anything with."
"Bye bye chaps, don't let them out."
No  see you then.
Did they try and drag you up the farm yesterday?
"Well he's, he actually was off the lead and he went straight through right to the other gate"
Oh and you kept them off the road did you?
You didn't just er
Oh yes well the gate was open so
and I always do
so she went into the second field
"So do you want the yoghurt, yoghurt before we go to the  ?"
"I don't think it matters, but  if the weather's still going to be freezing at night"
"And if so does, does"
I've got the
"the,it's outside all the time anyway ."
"I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still."
I got it standing on that brick  so it would drain.
I wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
"Some of the  erm  stems on it look as if the  not mouldy but they're, they're sort of"
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put
green.
another one in.
Those hyacinths in the cauldron are taking a long time to come out aren't they?
I know.
"I would have thought the tulip  that went in the er coal scuttle  the tulips in the cauldron  I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely."
I know.
They just straightened
They were

just  grown up again.
"And those  forget-me-nots  that are called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers, they're coming out with erm  tiny  pinkey, purpley flowers."
I know.
"If they're blue, so am I!"
"And then we've got miniature roses gonna come up, one that's on it own, that one with the"
The wha

Is there one in the tub?
No.
Yes.
"Oh ye the one in the tub looks okay, it's the other one."
Mhm.
"I like the other best as well, it's the peach one."
Yeah.
"and er, I said what you mean Charlie, cor all dog's mess all over the place, I said it isn't, I, I said have you ever been and he said no I, I said well there you are, I said if you haven't been I said you don't know what it's like, I said you're talking about some old girl that lives on, in Little Sandhurst, who's got a thing about dogs and I said kicking up a lot of fuss about it, but I said the women's a dam liar"
"He's,, yeah."
and I think it's a friend of his.
Too true.
"Yeah,."
"But it just shows how, here, I said, how embarr there's no different to any other place where ever you go."
"No, no  oh I agree people shouldn't let dogs foul on the pavement and in shopping places and things, cos it can be dangerous, but out in the woodlands if it wasn't for all the animals we wouldn't have any green stuff, trees and bushes seagulls are up ."
No.
"No, it's that , oh."
"It seems, it seems calm enough doesn't it?"
Probably .
Well we haven't got to go long for the shortest day.

About three weeks

"That's right, that's right."
It's the first tomorrow.

Getting up .

"So I said, Mike, is there a fa something wrong with the phone, and he said, no."
"I said, well, they're just connecting it then, and he said, yeah."
"And I said, or he said, I spent half an hour on the phone, trying to study, he said, she was from Ireland, he said, I couldn't understand a bloody word she was saying."
Oh dear.
"He was going on and on, and erm, I said, well, I'm sure that if you go and pick it up, it will be working."
"So he did, and it was working, and he was so, they just connect it from outside,"
"Oh, I see."
from the line box.
Yeah.
"and erm, so er, it was nothing to do with, like coming into the house"
"Oh,"
to connect it.
"So like, I didn't have to be there for the phone at all."
never turned up so
"Oh, that's a bit out of order, they often do that though, don't they?"
Where's your parents been then?
"Oh, erm, they're in Cyprus, so"
"Oh, really?"
I pick them up Sunday.
"Sunday, it's really tight."
"Yeah, Annette was hoping that she wouldn't have to work on Sunday."
"It makes the day disjointed obviously,"
Yeah.
"because she's gonna pick 'em up, but she's got to work like you, slap bang in the middle."
"Yeah, mine, mine used to be something like quarter to twelve, didn't it, quarter to twelve till three, and then they decided to change round, it used to be quarter to twelve to six, didn't it?"
Mm.
"Whereas, we used to be open all day."
Mm.
Got greedy.
I'm doing twelve to three.
Mm.
"they've not, yeah, they've not phoned her up for God knows how long."
Irene's been doing it.
"Cos Irene says give me a ring I says no, I says that's it, I said I've already made the arrangement once and it backfired I says so I'm not doing it no more."
"I says when I'm not feeling well or slept in I says I'm gonna phone police station, I'm gonna go from there, see what they say."
Let them find somebody.
I says I'm not messing about no more.
Do you know everybody's had flu and God knows what and I can't catch it.
"I thought I had it again other day, I felt bleeding awful."
I had that at Christmas which made me bad all over Christmas  right ?
"And everybody , I says marvellous cos I can have some time off,, it's not fair."
"I'm not having that, that's cheating."
"If they can have some time off I can have some time off, fair's fair."
"It dries right quick, it just takes that chill off"
"Kath you've got alarms all over the bleeding place, what are you up to?"
I ain't done nowt.
You div!
Look have you seen this one?
No you're on front of cover.
No she hasn't seen that one.
Well I don't believe you!
Oh alright then.
It must be on back.
"I've seen her ugly face somewhere, I don't know where."
It might be on that one you had upstairs.
Did you do your mum's car then?
Yeah.
What were wrong with it?
Nowt.
I was just checking it over before test.
Eh?
Just checking it over for test.
Just testing it over for test.
"And they wouldn't mess about if you, you  they slapped you if you didn't do as you were told."
So that put me right off for a start.
But erm  you only get one good set don't you?
That's right.
I
"And also you see right from, right from pregnancy"
Well they get it free don't they?
At the moment.
yeah.
I mean er it's before they're  conceived that you've got to try to
"Oh yes, yes."
I mean it's no good  smoking yourself to death and then er
That's right.
falling for a baby and then saying
No no
oh dear
Well that makes me ill now.
"It didn't used to but when I, I, I, I feel like going up to these girls and saying for god's sake take that thing out of your mouth."
That's right.
When they're pregnant or they've got a little baby.
It's horrible.
I mean
But you know you can't tell people.
"This friend of ours who lost his wife last year, well we've got another friend who was very fond of her  she also smokes  we just happened to me we didn't say"
No.
I mean it's happened now so we never
Absolutely.
No you can't.
say to th this chap you know but  we just happened to mention in passing to Jeanette  and she really jumped and said oh Pat didn't smoke a lot.
But
Was it very sudden?
"we know via my daughter  she's a nurse and she said no  cancer  get a lot of uterine cancer and all this it's not, not in the lungs now."
I'll just ri rinse my fingers  hand cream on my hands.
"That  was used as er, I can't remember what Richard was using it as yesterday"
He was poking it
What're we going to do about these tiles for the step?
To cover this little hole up.
I hate to think what must be down there now.
"Oh, where're my other glasses?"
and they were cheaper than
Cheaper?
Fenwicks?
"Cheaper than what you call it, the place in  I've got the price"
Cheaper than the do it yourself shop up ?
But when can we get through to Newcastle?
"Well I, well I'm on a weeks' holiday aren't I, at Easter?"
"And I've got to go, unless we go to  Tuesday  been to the dentist"
Which Tuesday?
After they break up?
That's right.
Which is  next Friday
Yes
So I hope they've sorted out
The what?lin
The  appeal at the school that Mrs  was supposed to have let Miss White know so she could send it off to the parents to get the money back  scanner
You didn't tell me about that
I did tell you
You didn't.
"All you told me, hang on, ah"
Miss White
"all you told me was that Miss White was retiring but I hadn't to tell anyone, which I haven't done, which I don't intend to do"
"At the beginning of Lent, Miss White approached me to see what she should do about the  appeal"
Ah ha
"as she always does, since I said why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was plenty of children  locally?"
And mum and Chrissy slept in the car.
"and and th that's ri they were, they, mum was gonna stay at home and I was gonna take you for a ride on the train"
Yeah.
and then mum decided she was going to come so we took the car.
"And we might, might well have been on that train that had the crash."
Yes.
Thank goodness we didn't.
Well it was one of those things wasn't it?
Well it's a good job mum came.
Mm mm.
"I hope, I hope ."
Well we went past the crash and we could see that there was something going on but we weren't sure what it was.
"It happened just after we went past the, just before."
You could see  er  a couple of Land Rovers going down with flashing blue lights and things towards
I
the crossing.
And th th and they would be police ones if they'd got blue lights and
Mm mm.
"so did you, could you hear the sirens?"
No I couldn't.
"But erm  when we, by the time we got into Hull I heard it on the radio what had happened  and we went to the toy fair and then we came back  and there was er  you could see all the ambulances and everything still there."
And the train was there leaning over.
But half of it was still on the rails.
Yes it was the front coaches went off.
Front coaches?
Onto the side I think.
Well what sort of express?
It was erm  well what do you think it would be?
Er  I think it must have been a multiple unit.
That's right.
It was a diesel multiple unit.
And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters.
Right I I that's fine yes I'll
You see it makes it easier for us as well because it means that if you do if you are there we can leave you in charge for ten minutes while
Presumably Mark will run?
Yeah I would think so.
I'll tell him to give you a ring if it's
Yeah right I'll put him down with a question mark.
Oh it's nice to see people to see a good list of people who are going.
And I could put myself down as  in case I get there for a day or two.
And for candidates erm yeah I'll I'll stand I'll have to bite the boys again.
Yeah.
Talking of standing did did we ever make any progress on Fishergate?
We haven't got anybody.
John hasn't come back to us.
No.
Erm John  said he informed me he he'd stand for Monk again and he I told him to write write a .
John  's Monk.
Presumably in the selection ballot we don't have to
I think we do have
We can have su suggested
But we don't
wards.
But we don't definitely have to sign people.
Er so you were Clifton.
Which is erm Bill
That's Clifton.
That's Clifton.
I I'm certainly interested I'm quite interested in Bishop Hill unless anybody else wants it.
Erm again I mean I'm happy to give that if there's someone actually living in Bishop who wants it but erm I've got erm some someone who lives there wanted me to stand in.
Good reason to er.
Do you have any
Not at this time.
I guess I can stand somewhere.
"So, what I'm saying is they're just th , they're, they're, it's just for er"
The biggest place near it.
the biggest place near it.
Now what
"I'm saying is, is you ought to get very close to that geographical map  because  it's the logistic  logistics er  difficulty with getting, and you ought to know where there are mountains and where there are valleys and the fact that that, in South Wales they can't just go across country, they have to go back down the valley after the M four and up again."
"Cos we're driving lorries, we're not driving little, you know  trial bikes that go over mountains like the Brecons and stuff, you have to"
But we do use the sheep in some ways don't we?
"That's right, that's right, we do use the sheep ."
But not for
No.
the sake of the .
"No, right."
What
"what I'm saying is, you know, you can't go from Stirling to Aberdeen  in a couple of minutes."
That's big country up there.
"And so there's a big mountain range running up the middle of the country, someone thought once was the English Channel."
Well that's okay cos we've got a tunnel now.
"Yeah, we got a tunnel now."
Yeah.
"The English Channel, not the Pennines."
But they're going where's the Pennines?
Erm what I'm saying is
I'd say I don't know where it is at all.
I am saying to you now folks become familiar with the erm  depots.
Now what about the depot numbers?
No idea.
No.
Forty nine.
Not at all.
Forty six.
Forty nine.
I'm gonna call them out.
Aha.
"she said, why can't you be a normal mother and just want chocolates or perfume?"
"I said, well that's not much good when you're hanging from the end of a  rope ."
And who do you go with?
I go with my husband.
Your husband?
Mhm.
"And whereabouts do you go, just"
"Oh  Glencoe, Skye, Aran, you know just"
Mhm.
up there.
"Do you, do you stay up there, do you have"
Mhm.
a caravan.
"No, a tent, or we've got an estate car if it's just a weekend jaunt, and it's maybe wet, we just sleep in the back of the car"
aha.
"So  complete change from this place anyway,"
"aha, and you meets up with so many wonderful people."
"Aha, aha."
It gives you something else to talk about.
"That's right, aha."
"Instead of just,going to Tescos for some groceries or"
"I mean I, I, I don't drink a lot, I mean maybe after I've been out in the hills you have got to drink something to replace the sweat, but I'm not a great drinker and I don't, I don't smoke and I, I don't like discos or anything like that"
Mhm.
so you've got to find something else to do.
"That's right, a healthy pursuit."
I used to play a lot of badminton and swimming but I've got bored out of my ears so it's something to keep fit.
Mhm.
"So I bought myself a bike, and I've been popping backwards and forwards to my like"
How about
Ah but as I say my daughter thinks I'm mad.
how about nicknames?
Yeah.
"You paying me in 'and, and Dennis is paying me in 'and and I'll a er, thousand pound a week, the way that  I keep getting these job offers."
Back-handers.
Anticipation obligations.
The only trouble is they're only offers.
"What's happening down here, then, didn't you hear no more about when you finish then, down here at"
No.
"Only some bad  things, what I've supposed to have done, or what I'm not supposed to have done."
But
Who cares over it.
"some money out of it, I took him to court."
proven.
Oh.
But you can't do it without money.
"No, that legal aid don't go far"
"Legal aid, won't enter enter entertain it."
Not for owt like that.
"No, I'm afraid"
"You see, 'cos you weren't actually employed, you see, 'cos you say,"
No.
"you couldn't really take him to a tribunal could you, 'cos ya"
"No, I weren't employed."
any money to take him to a tribunal.
"Well, I made my, I made it plain that er, at the training centre, you know, I says, I says to em, I said er, in my opinion, I says, he doesn't want, he don't want to kn , he he don't want to know."
"Oy, you."
"He says any anything what goes wrong, he says, you automatically get blamed for."
I told you.
"He says, well, it's your job not to let it go wrong, I said, I didn't let it go wrong."
"I said, but other people let it go wrong and they got away with it."
Look what I found.
I've just called for her money.
Corrinne's money.
I ended up paying for him.
"She's not bothered, she never goes near him."
Never goes near him.
She never goes near him.
She's frightened to death of 'im
isn't it.
I know.
But I don't think Geoff would be very pleased.
"Well, if you say to him, that just say that  and that, that's you know, oh, just say something like, just say something like  I can't keep up with him Dennis, he's throwing loads of dust about, just say to him,think about selling, to you want to buy him back or, you know."
"Well, they won't, I don't think they'd have him back."
No and that's  a
"I don't think, I don't think sell him."
Has he got to wait.
A.
I don't think you'd get what you paid for him.
"Probably not, but I mean, cage is worth a hundred and fifty quid."
That's what Russell paid for the cage.
"Oh, look."
Mm
"Oh, look."
What.
"Look,"
"that he's into,"
"Well, I mean, he's no problem to me."
I'm not bothered about him.
"You know, I'd rather keep him than sell him, but"
"It's like everything else, you've always summat else to bloody feed."
Mm.
"By the way, when we had that pair, that were driving me mad, and then that one died, when we were in bungalow."
"Other one would learnt how to open a crack, and it were in that cage, and it could hear birds outside."
"Anyway in the end we let er Kenny's grandad have 'im, I mean, 'cos they got me mum's bird."
"They've got two of his own, he ended up with four birds."
Barbie doll  and that's what she was.
"Well no, not as attractive as a Barbie doll!"
"Well  no, but"
But
I'm  but the style was there
"She,i it was  it was becoming like a dictatorship!"
It was her at the helm
"Ooh well this is what it beca , it did"
And
"and th the so called democratic, you know, choice of all these poli , all these MP's and what not which would comprise  parliament and government and head of the Tory party at the time  you know i it really  their voices on the, on the  the cabinet  you know, they were, they were just destroyed!"
"Well, you said  you know you, we were on about Germany and, and becoming you know  could it happen again?"
If  if she'd of had her way  she would of been the dictator of this
Yeah.
"country, and she would of been in power forever!"
Oh I know!
"You know that's, she would of been wanting to ma , make her life president or whatever it was!"
"I think she would of done with the Que , er done away with the Queen to get"
"Yes, I think there was a bit of competition on there wasn't"
Yeah.
there?
I'm convinced
But
she wouldould!
"Yeah, I mean"
"If it meant her staying in power that, I mean she"
Well
would of done it she would of got rid of them to make sure she  she stayed there.
Yes it came to er
Are you tired?
A fine state of affairs didn't it
"No, I'm alright Ken, yeah."
with her  even her own party  giving
"Right, so  me and Jim had a chat the other day  just looking at the  the roadside entries and the counts and I was sort of saying  if we work on the basis that we want between ten and twelve people, twelve people maximum"
Mm.
erm I think we're be able to do all the counts with that number of people including the  St David's roundabout and
Mm.
but we do need to clarify exactly what you want on that.
"Whether you want  samples doing cos that's gonna take more people, or whether you're just doing ins and outs  and stuff like that."
Well
And on the other roundabout for that matter.
Are you off?
Yeah I've got a  seminar in Manchester .
Oh right.
How did it go?
Fine.
Probably find that  traffic  percent
"we're just talking now this, this is, this is one we're discussing."
Oh well just south of Caernarvon on the first section erm between Caernarvon and ?
Yes.
Yeah.
Gwyneth haven't really started on doing any of that work yet.
work.
And they need to do traffic.
"And also they need to confirm the traffic erm turning  099 junction at er  I can never pronounce it, beginning with an L."
Yeah .
"And er maybe count, maybe  do their traffic counts out of that as well."
So the guy that was in charge of those schemes with Gwyneth
Yeah.
was at the meeting or came into the meeting to explain about the schemes.
What's his name?
Erm
Peter will know.
Peter's got his name down.
Cos that was one of the things we talked about
Mm.
Yeah but they're like four interviews on a sheet and really sort of
Yeah.
But I mean who
"what, how w , what are w , have we got our current ones, our standard ones?"
Yeah.
Cos presumably it would be best to use those wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"I think  you could, you could accommodate it if you just reduced that sli the, what the normal one slightly, and there's t there's room to put the er translation on the top."
I'll do you a mock up of that and see what you
"Yes, good idea."
what you think.
I think either that or have it on a separate sheet.
But I would have thought it's best to put it on there if we can.
How many are we gonna want?
Three thousand?
Perhaps it's worth having a separate print run for that isn't it?
"Yeah, might be."
"It's not  I think if they use this offset thing, the masters last about five hundred so you're not  it's not, it's not a silly amount."
Yeah.
"Would it take, oh wait a minute!"
Three thousand interviews
What
"say, would you think three thousand interviews?"
I'm just trying to think what we were averaging.
But I mean that  one of them's not gonna  you're not gonna get as many  on that B road.
Will we  will we want those?
Oh I can't remember you know what we used for Ormskirk
It doesn't matter if we  if we get too many cos you can always use
Well that's it.
Can't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
or with a specific letter  for them saying you know welcome if you  if you feel like it.
Actually just just quickly  er I just noticed on that list of your  questionnaires that we got back a couple  that they didn't actually know what was going on.
And that you know perhaps this is er erm publicity wise I wonder whether we're falling a bit short on our  publicity.
Well.
they didn't know  I mean  like first newsletter we've had in ages.
And it's something else that we need to get
we can't just sort of
No exactly
"We've got to get, we should get more publicity."
But it's ever so easy for somebody to sit at home and say well you should be doing this and you should be doing that
Oh yeah yeah.
and not doing
"No I'm I'm not sa , I'm not saying."
I'm not saying you should be  doing anything I'm just er
"No I didn't mean you, I meant them!"
No well .
I well really  I don't think you should say  you're not doing enough!
No
I think last year more or less shows that we really have to concentrate on one thing.
Do it and then plan
Yeah.
plan the next .
Because otherwise we just
And then write about it if we want to.
Yeah.
So what what we'll do quickly  to write and inform them all that we're doing this stall and   won't we?
Yes.
We could even send them  a recycling sheet.
Yeah.
And the most recent newsletter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But at least they were happy, you know what I mean."
'Cos they were with other birds.
"But I never missed, I never missed him."
I don't think you get attached to birds like you do animals.
I don't think you get attached to birds like dogs.
Not like dogs and cats.
No.
"I mean Albert said,if we do get that bungalow, we are  'cos the owner, he said she'll disappear."
She'll disappear.
"I mean I'll be upset about our Whisky, 'cos we're, I mean, we've had a long time, although she's not a pet  pet, you know what I mean."
What  feel like.
"Well, they they just, they go away when you take them somewhere fresh."
and they don't know where they are.
That one.
They're very very
"Sometimes, you're lucky, and you know, if if you keep them in long enough"
"We've always had cats, always had cats, when we lived at  and we moved into  and we'd had this one cat years, it were old cat."
"I wouldn't say it was ready for popping off, you know what I mean."
Yeah
"It were always fit and we were only there a fortnight, three weeks disappeared."
"I mean, if our Whisky died, I wouldn't be as upset about it, as I would about these."
But if she disappeared I'd be worried all time.
And yet
Aye.
"You know, like when our Dawn's kittens disappeared."
"It, they weren't bothered, I think Mick took them away meself."
Yeah.
I'm convinced he did.
I think he did.
"But I were I were upset about that, you know."
without a break.
"Thanks to Ann Mobbs and to Theresa Smith, to Brenda Thornton and to Barbara Bryan."
"That's it from me, Bill Heine."
Thanks for joining us.
Goodbye.
Kelly.
You are once again doing it completely and utterly wrong.
at the wrong place again.
Kelly you have been using
"Kelly, you've done it again."
"Can you walk the right way, no, now do it right Kelly."
Let's see you actually do something for a change..
How do you do this one down here?
You should have.
What else have you been doing wrong Kelly?
. You've been using a brush instead of a spatula for spreading glue.
The spatula .
Right.
Now  I hope that  only Kelly has been doing things as desperately wrong  as Kelly has been doing them.
Looking around at all the  there are a whole lot of people who have left the same even border all the way round instead of having an even border top and sides and leaving a bigger border at the bottom.
Which you'll remember you were told to do so that there's a space For your name.
Sarah stand up and come over here.
"Sam, will you stop doing that please my love and come across here so that you two don't ."
I'm using a white colour pencil here  in order to  draw a line from  to the work that is being mounted on here.
And you might say that the word has not been mounted on there.
No it hasn't because we .
Can you see what I'm doing without me having to ?
Or are you baffled by what you see?
?
Mm?
No.
"it's a demonstration and the, the line itself  is like framed within a frame."
Yeah.
I just saw somebody put it on them on the .
I used to be quite good at
and I'll ask again on Tuesday when I ring.
It's supposed to be very good for you.
"I used to be very good at this, I use to  ."
So did I
"Yes, you did, yes."
We'll put it on the list and I'll try on Tuesday for you.
.
So that's all I've got with me after I've been to .
"Well, you've  anyway, so."
"If they're more than eighty, I, I can't have it anyway."
So you want to keep
"Yo-yo,."
Oh .
"I'm all ready if I got my handbag, but when I start walking because of the cars being broken into I don't carry a handbag, you see, I just carry money in my pocket."
"Oh, there's a lot had their cars broken into ."
"I've had mine done twice, mine done twice, mm, the police were up the other day lying in ambush, and I'd spotted them and phoned the local police station and said there's men lurking in the bushes of  are they policemen?, she said yes madam, they're policemen."
"I don't, I thought they looked to they looked to clean and, and well groomed"
Yeah.
"to be erm, sort of scroungers."
"Right, it doesn't pay to leave your handbag in the car."
No way.
Certainly doesn't.
It isn't the money because the insurance company pay me back the money
"Yeah, yeah."
"the car insurance mends my windows, but it's, it's your bank books, and your credit cards"
I know.
and your driving licence
I know.
"your insurance, all those little things you know, and you don't"
East end then.
Oh he's got a nice shirt on.
"in a pub he was, got drunk and for a twenty pound bet shaved off all his hair."
I still owe him the money.
But he is stupid cos he went hitchhiking once and left a day early to avoid traffic.
"Here, do you know what I fancy?"
I fancy an icecream.
She said well I'll go and get you one.
"He said no, you know what your memory's like, you're bound to forget."
"She said no I won't, what do you fancy?"
"He said well  I fancy  vanilla and strawberry icecream with chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce, crushed nuts and a flake."
"She said right, vanilla and strawberry icecream, chocolate sauce, crushed nuts."
"said right, I shall be back in five minutes."
Two hours later she come back with a ham sandwich.
He said you silly cow!
You forgot the mustard.
East end.
This week on handy hints we are talking fishing.
I once went for a job as a fisherman.
"The boss said Connolly you've got the job, you start on Monday."
"I said that sounds alright, could I have a sub?"
He said no you're on a fishing boat like everybody else.
Well one of the greatest qualities a fisherman can have is of course patience.
And you can spend the whole day without a bite.
"As for me, I always take my packed lunch."
And pot noodles is one of my favourite dishes.
No.
I don't think  that the pub is open  the cafs aren't open  the amusements aren't open.
The bar's open.
No.
All locked up and in darkness.
?
"And this bit I do before the lesson and I do this, clean it up afterwards."
You don't have to do this bit.
"But notice that I'm pouring slowly and gently away from me into the dish which I shall then put in here, and I'm going to put the  the plate, which I described to you before, which has been covered with  what's on the back?"
Straw hat varnish.
What's on the front?
Hard wax.
Hard wax.
And scratched so the acid should bite through there.
Has anybody got a chronometer on them?
What?
you have haven't you?
What?
A watch.
Will you time er  two minutes please?
From the moment this goes into the acid.
You lower it in gently and sloosh it about so that the acid covers the surface.
"Right, you may troop by that and look down there, notice I wasn't wearing the goggles that was naughty of me wasn't it?"
I should have been  er while I go and get a turkey feather.
"Okay, you go and have a look at that covered up."
And try and see if we've got er   forming on the lines.
yes.
"That's what makes er these chemicals so dangerous, you don't know what they are."
What do you think I've got this for?
"Sorry, I can't hear you Paul."
So that er
I still can't hear you.
To scrape the zinc off.
To scrape the zinc off?
When it's ?
"Very good, yes."
That's correct.
As the zinc is eaten away  air bubbl er sorry not air bubbles  gas bubbles  I don't know what gas.
Yeah.
D'ya know what I mean?
"And, and obviously it was ridiculous, every second word I was having to look up and then I'd get all that and it moves onto the next one."
Yep.
Which is ridiculous.
Anybody had
this experience?
"Erm  okay, the first word was erm  it talked about alchemy."
Any other problems with the language?
"Either  other areas where it's very specialized and you had to look up words, or other difficulties with the"
Yeah.
language?
It's not everyday English.
It's not everyday English.
"What at the moment, at th right, so a lot of, erm"
Yeah.
Ah but that is a good distinction.
Stereo.
Erm  ahead  in the sense that
Yeah.
we're used to a lot of Shakespeare's archaisms because he was studying them at A level and Shakespeare's got so a special sort of band of them that he uses.
"Even so, I  they can go and look up that lot of words in Shakespeare."
But Johnson  they're often old words  that are totally out of use  erm  and  we're not even used to Johnson's vocabulary because
it's not taught in schools.
At least not part  the mainstream part of our culture.
Any other reasons for the language difficulty?
"Or that the speech is difficult or the, any, any reason that there's a, a page that's difficult to read?"
"Er, it strikes me with the, with the comedy, he's trying to be so funny that he shoots off at all these angles and not having"
Aha.
"left, sort of boundaries."
Okay.
"So  erm  well, you might like to say that"
Yeah.
"Oh yeah fifty, sixty pounds."
And how long would it last them?
About the same time as us?
Yeah.
I suppose you have to be able to afford all that if you can afford the car in the first place.
Right.
Yeah if you have to moan about that you shouldn't be driving it in the first place.
"Motto, what?"
"Motto of the story is er  er don't, don't buy expensive cars if you're gonna want to run the thing though."
You've spent all your money on this car.
All of a sudden you realize
"Well like that new advert for the Rover he says don't, I keep thinking my back  my back tailgate's  flapping or  I keep hearing, you keep hearing creaking don't you?"
"A creak here and you think what's that, what's this, what's that?"
"So that new Rover has been built so everything fits perfectly, right?"
So nothing rattles.
What do you mean nothing?
No toleran er the tolerance is you know minimal.
Whereas the tolerance here'd be  I dunno eighth of an inch here eighth of an inch there he says  the advert says as soon as you have tolerances like that then thing work loose and start rattling and creaking and
E E.
you can hear it go E E er E.
Yeah.
"you imagine cruising in a car, lovely car like that  and it makes no noise."
"Just cruising away and it just like glides, and you glide you know  like, like Papa's Citroen type  that kind of suspension."
Yeah.
Is this a new Rover?
Crikey what was that?
A Rover.
Was it that Rover?
Yeah.
"Was this a new, is this a new Rover ?"
Carving everybody up.
"No not yet, er only about France, and I told you about"
Oh I'm not sure
the
Oh dear
places you can go to
Mm
which is a fallacy
"I thought it was Barry  there, he looked a bit like him."
"No he's trying to get up, get down naughty boy."
"E T get down, down."
"Down there, there's a good boy"
"If you tell him sternly, he does understand the tone of your voice  if he goes off and sulks for a while, well so be it  you'll have to sulk till you get used to it, there you are."
"in the U K  mm, yeah, all looks very nice, camping"
Joking aren't you camping?
Well that's just what it looks like here  you just eating al fresco and going back up to the chateau at a night
Oh we're back in France again are we?
Mm
Yes
well
"Oh I see, yeah, yes it's"
Mm
"It's not a cheap holiday by the time we get, get down there your petrol"
Well for us I mean it's
and then the ferry across
it's not so bad for somebody living on the south coast
Yes
"but er, as you say erm, really it's such a long journey that you need a breather before you need to start to cross the channel"
Oh yes I think so  a good thing you're inviting Ken didn't I to come with us?
Yes I did mentioned it erm
Did you to Ken?
Well you were there weren't you too?
"I just mentioned it in passing and let the conversation carried on about something else so I, I don't know whether"
"Right, okay,my boudoir, I've just seen a few things  together."
"I should get changed, really, but I'll,"
No.
"what I'll do, is I'll  if I give you my clean shirt, you take it round to yours."
"If I want to change, I'll put it, the only thing is, if we do go up the bar, I think I'll be a bit warm, in something like this won't I?"
"Yeah, that's the trouble isn't it?"
But it's so cold out there.
"I know, it's a bloody, it's such a pain in the arse, because you freeze  to death, bloody getting up there, and then when you get in there, it's so bloody hot."
So start with  what the hell  which is really quite aggravating really.
Sorry?
"It's quite aggravating, innit?"
Mm.
"right, she did take that book with her, didn't she?"
Yeah.
Was she supposed to then?
"Right, lipstick, lipstick, lipstick."
lipstick on your collar    told a tale on you
really.
Oops
You need some more curtain hooks.
"No, I don't."
No.
Is that how many there were up there?
Yeah .
Or have they nicked some?
"They  they tended to spread them out a bit, about the house, you know, just willy-nilly, where they were wanted."
"They're just normal ones, aren't they?"
"Oh, I expect so."
"I know, does look a bit silly, doesn't it?"
"They shouldn't be  like that, we should, like, be able to pull cords and curtains as well gathering them a bit."
They are gathered even now.
"You probably can do in that, I just haven't mucked around with it."
But er I don't think we need to go to that er length with you.
"I've still got those erm, you know, the little purple tablets?"
Yeah.
"That dissolve in water,"
"Yeah, to soak them."
Mm.
"You could, you could go back on the Permitabs if you want."
"It's not desperately moist, although certainly one of them is cracking quite a bit, and if that helps to dry it up and make it more comfortable then it's worth giving them a soak ten minutes a day."
Mm.
"If you want to try those, you dissolve one in four litres of water which is er which is a little, just short"
just short of a gallo yeah you need a bowl.
"Yeah, but then you get the right concentration."
"If you use too high a concentration, it irritates and it stains even more than the dilute stuff does."
But that may be worth a go if you've got some Permitabs left.
Mm.
But I think we'll use some Dermavate Have you got plenty of Dipabase
Yeah.
Good.
"A big tub, yeah?"
Mm.
That's fine.
"Is it alright to put that on, you know, when it's broken?"
The skin
"Yes, you've got, you've got to be a bit careful with broken skin because if you put things directly on it, they tend to irritate."
"It won't do the skin any harm particularly, but it can smart."
And
Mhm.
that might be one good reason for using the er the soaks.
"The other think I'd recommend, is, using a fine pair scissors, is take off the scaly bits, the bits that stick out, cos they're the bits that catch"
Mm.
and hurt and
Yeah.
So the only ones that probably need to get made  are census stop if required etcetera.
So there's only three of those.
Yeah slow census and  whatever.
"So presumably if, if  Staffordshire have them made and we get those three whizzed up to Caernarvon  you know, the rest can sort of fit into place."
"Cos if you put survey instead of census at the bottom, I mean I know that's not strictly speaking how it should be, but they must have signs for us to survey because they have their own, presumably they have their own surveyors go out and"
Yeah.
Yeah like
you know and
you see yellow ones don't you?
On the motorway and stuff
Yeah.
they have survey on.
"But they very often, that triangular one with an exclamation mark, there'll be a little"
Yeah
plate on the bottom that says survey.
yeah.
"Well maybe it's not really right, but, but perhaps that  I'd have thought it would be alright."
Yeah.
"Census, it's probably the same in Welsh as well you know, don't you know?"
"Yeah, I see what you mean."
We might be able to get round it.
I'll see what this fella says.
"Well I mean I was saying to  this bloke well  can you think of anywhere where we might be able to, oh no no  no can't think of anywhere."
Well you could try Clwyd or something but   can't think everybody you know.
Clwyd might well do some.
I wonder
Oh it might be worth giving Nige a ring.
He's at Cheshire.
Oh yeah.
Who do we know at Clwyd?
Davydd .
Who?
Well that's daft innit?
"I says I don't, I says when am I gonna be able to go to town I says and afford fifteen quid for another bloody rail?"
I says you
When you've already got some up.
Yeah!
She wants me to take them down and swap them for one.
Steve'll go mad.
Yeah.
Bloody would an'all.
I thought you crafty sod.
"She wants them to extend to eight feet, well these don't extend to eight feet, they extend to seven."
Oh.
"And I thought no I'm not, Steve's just cleaned them up."
Yeah.
He spent about two hours in with them.
"Have you seen what he's done to ends of them, they've gone silvery, he's rubbed and rubbed and rubbed"
Rubbed too bloody hard .
and he's rubbed all colour off it.
They've got silver ends on them ones.
I said
I says can't you rub harder on other piece.
He ain't done them ones yet.
He's done these ones.
"Well they, are they not silvery then?"
Well he washed this one first and then he went over there and er then it dawned on him that the ends pull off
Ah!
"on ends, so he took the two ends off, cleaned the rails and he was sat on settee watching telly rubbing away and rubbing away and I says hey you gonna put them ends back on?"
And he'd been rubbing for that long they'd gone that colour.
Like my Steven with my new non-stick pans.
I remember.
He took all the black off.
He scrubbed and scrubbed till it all come off didn't he?
mm.
"And she said er  well it does take time for them to dry out doesn't it, she said?"
"But I, there was people in it last week!"
"Yes I know, she said!"
Well if she's covering
I said well there's no way I
she is paid to cover the boss!
"There's no way I'd of slept in it, I said and not  I wouldn't of done it!"
"Let alone, old age pensioners, I said!"
And you know  we've been to a few caravans
Go in that end bedroom and feel the bed!
"that feel a bit, caravans that we used to go to were like this chalet."
The chalets we used to go to  Mrs er  I can't remember her name now!
But her boys used to run steam roller outside middle house and I used to take them in.
She used to see  that the beds were aired.
She did see to them!
She put oil heaters  in the caravan  and she kept the  the mattresses in her bungalow!
She'd only got about eight caravans then.
"And  then we went in and had a caravan  somewhere up by Aberystwyth, Ginnie and me, and you kids."
That was an old farmer's caravan weren't
Yes.
it?
"But it wasn't too, that was too damp to sleep on!"
"who won the bloody war,roof up weren't it !"
"There wasn't, there wasn't a cup and saucer each!"
Remember?
Mm.
And these are no better!
"I mean, caravans are caravans, call them what you like!"
Only one saucepan we had!
And it was stew everyday if we didn't go out for dinner!
Ah!
"Yeah , erm, it's worth waiting to"
I saw Mr Bentley
Mm.
and er he hasn't got any stuff there of course
No.
"but er, he said oh try the guy"
Try?
"the chap in Mold, whatever his name is"
Robert .
"I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well"
Mm.
"so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the"
Yes I thought he probably would.
You were nearly at the end of the tape as well weren't you?
I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and won't be able to turn it over.
"Mm, I don't think so  but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all"
"Nobody's interested no, it's a shame"
"said er , they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er"
"Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the"
Yes
What is it?
What do they call it that hall?
Hawkesbury hall
"Hawkesbury hall, yes"
"by the school, yeah"
"but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be"
"Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe."
Is it?
"Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it"
Oh oh they've just locked
but er
locked it up because er
"Many would say that as George the Sixth, he succeeded where Edward had failed."
George had discipline.
"A sense of duty, a loyal wife and children."
"Affection bringing with it devoted support, brought success from a role undertaken reluctantly."
Edward said he could not fulfil the role without the support of the woman he loved.
Some family black sheep are making a bid for affection.
"Edward had the attention of the whole world, but without adequate personal affection, it was of no avail."
"On December the eighth, nineteen thirty-six, time of the ab abdication, the Times published a singularly apt quotation from  A Hopeless, Throneless King, Loathsome to Men Below To God's Above a Sad Example of the Slights of Life."
What is your view of the way Edward was treated after his  abdication.
"And none of us admits to being alive when all this happened, we, that goes without saying."
Absolutely.
I did see him as a six year old child.
"So  yes, as a"
"Visited our town, our  town."
He was a six year old child.
"Erm, I was a six year"
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah."
So wh wh what do you think of the the attitude that was displayed towards him after the abdication?
"He was very, very, generously treated."
Far too generously.
"I mean, he he could  five hundred thousand pound on a Christmas present to his bride."
My God.
Mm.
"He was more or less paid to go away and keep his head down, wasn't he."
Yeah.
No matter what the cost.
Most of the cr
"Now it's all over,attitude, push it all away."
Yeah.
"All the here , a lot of the hereditary jewellery never, never got found."
No.
No.
Ha!
"I mean, even in France, and I mean, in fact, in fact"
"East Germany, poor devils they"
"in France it's more  it's worse  in in  some respects because er  it seems to be more powerful the erm  the rate of  you know, the feeling of ."
"I mean what can you, what can we do?"
"If, it's happening, I mean  what was the Soviet Union I mean it's"
"Well I said to Margaret, I wonder"
news on it  it's death and destruction there isn't it?
All these minority
I wonder
groups.
"with the Western Groups  after the euphoria of saying oh there, well we've cracked it now!"
We've destroyed communism.
Are they now regretting it?
"And, I don't"
To some degree.
Well
"No, no I think they've"
"And, and the fact that they don't know what's gonna happen, how to contain all this"
Well I think in some respects
stress.
"they, they wanted the downfall of communism"
Oh they did want it!
but  nevertheless it's better the devil you know!
"But, having said that  you know, that  I should imagine that the military  are  regretting it."
"Well I mean, the military will definitely"
"regretting it, in in   the west"
Didn't actually want it to go this far.
because it means  a reduction in forces in in  all these
Yeah.
"countries  erm, and as you say, I mean ha  you know, whether they're American generals or or  the Soviet  generals, whatever  er they're all, they're all feeling the pinch now because er"
"Oh I didn't mean that, I mean"
She is.
"She'll bite you, and our Whisky can"
"She scratched him outside, didn't she."
"And, if she were here three and a half minutes, that's all she were 'ere, and it and it 'em fifty quid."
Yeah.
Bloody ridiculous.
It's all a bloody money making racket.
"Another thing is, I'll tell why we don't want er, they always having valuations, they are, they come and value it, and then they give us money."
That means we're gonna be paying extra eleven thousand with money we ain't got.
Yeah.
That's another reason we're daren't send it off.
Yeah.
"Yeah, because if ya, if ya, get it before ya start your business."
You've still got it to pay as soon as you get it.
Yeah.
"Trust them, because it's in their  at the moment."
"Well, I still believe in  and I don't pushed around and say, no you can't have money, no you can't get insured, and so that means  others."
You haven't lost anything have ya?
"Well, just er disappointment, I suppose."
For what
"Well, yeah,"
"Then again, I mean, I"
There's always summat else you can go and do.
"You know that, doing that, fabricating, and things like that, you know like actual welding and that type of  Er, we wouldn't make as much money out of that as you probably would"
No.
"No, you'll be, you'll be stuck to it, all time, and it's not good for 'im."
No.
And it kills your eyes welding.
Benjy.
"But as he said to me, why don't you go  welding."
"I says, the point is I've got bad eyes as it is,"
Yeah.
so I said well why's that then Norren?
"I've got used to doing it now, you know?"
Yeah
Well she said she's got a lot of scrubs to do and all that business
Yeah
"so she said while you've been doing that she said she's been sort of gassing to anybody you know, so she said it's been mentioned by management and they said oh well she'll be able to sort of hovering while she stood there you know, time, time to natter she could be erm, got time to do that."
"yeah  so I said oh I see, so that was that, so I think they've got a, a meeting in a couple of weeks and they'll sort of tell her discreetly that she has to carry on and do it what she's been the"
"time sort of thing you know, so, said it's been noticed that like"
and all that you know?
Yeah
"But erm, you know, get"
it's got to be scrubbed more often so you know
Normally
that is the same thickness as what this I think  can you hold that dear?
I'm surprised Joy didn't say something about it yesterday actually Joanne
Perhaps she didn't have it
she done quite a bit of hovering really
"Oh that's good then, yeah"
Is it alright now?
"Well, yeah"
It'll only pop out I suppose won't it?
Well it have to pop out but it keeps popping back in again that's all that is
Sorry
"alright thank you, prefers than what you done last time"
"Yeah better than that, yeah"
How's your mouth then?
Alright
Where's the other lighter?
There in here
oh I see.
Where's Samuel
where's Samuel's?
Yeah.
and then someone scores and the guy goes in straight calmly and scores straight away.
You know it's people aren't
Yeah.
"I don't know, it's psychologically sort of still got their mind on going through what's er"
On what happened.
Yeah.
"It's like at school when they're thinking oh no, no and they've scored again."
"It's like you've scored, you're so elated and you"
Fact you you often sort of watch videos of managers.
"Managers are often shrieking you know about what's happening next rather than you know, all their players are jumping with joy all over each other and you think  and they're saying get in your positions."
Do your stuff.
"Don't let it slip straight away, I mean  That was annoying thing is that we didn't deserve to lose three one really, I mean"
Sneak that  that box of sweets in then for mum .
I bet she knows you've done that for her.
Eh?
I bet she knows you've bought that for her.
"Well she knows that we're giving her something, yes."
"I mean we could have been worse, could have forgotten completely."
"I mean it's easy, cos when mum gets all those things for everybody else, clearly she doesn't get something for herself."
Don't know why not.
What did you get her last year?
It was the same thing wasn't it?
"No I didn't get, we didn't do this did we, last year?"
Yes we did.
We always have the tree presents.
Do we?
Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
You what?
Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
Very stylish.
What's the time?
You'd think after that one they'd have thrown the keys away for that.
Mm.
The kid hadn't done much
Get an extra two years for missing.
"the kid hadn't done much, I mean it was nowt  serious ."
You know I had a moving traffic accident
Yeah
"wasn't trucking there, you know  or owt like that."
No sense of humour.
Got brought a pushbike wheel the other day.
Can you get the cogs off that?
Why?
Well they go a lot better on that bike of mine.
I don't think so.
Oh pity.
So what you've done to bend the wheel?
I haven't.
"The gaffer knocked somebody off their pushbike, had to buy him a new wheel  and some compensation"
Scrounge the wheel!
How do you get them off?
He says you go to a pushbike shop and get special tools.
Ring spanner things with the
Mm.
keys on the outside  pumps and things on it to  I wouldn't bother.
A new set of back cogs for bike's only about seven quid.
"A brand new set and they come with the ra with the, erm free wheel and everything all in like, just screw them on."
"Go to a pushbike shop they whip them off and whip them on for you  you buy, you know, if you go out and buy one then just take wheel with you they'll stick them straight on."
Mm   that fellow don't go to the police.
Lucky to get away with having to buy him a wheel  compensation
Unusual innit.
It's very expensive that's why it's unusual.
Sixty nine ninety nine.
The other thing  I mean to be healthy  it's more important  to dry things and keep them dry for a while than to boil them.
Bacteria survive heat for a short time.
Yeah.
But they don't a for the percentage of bacteria that survives drought  is is minimal.
So you don't need to boil  logically.
"Er if you just keep your hankies  iron them, keep them dry."
"Then they are, then they are sterile."
be bothered.
"Anyway, back to the point."
He said pointedly.
Well  leaflet.
stall.
We've got to get back to the stall.
Yeah er the recycling leaflet.
Who's gonna do it?
It's not gonna be done if we don't get somebody to actually front you know
well
take it on
The  thing is that I  I can do  revamp it on computer.
Because it w you can scan
What ma manually?
No you just stick it on  a photocopier
I see I wa before you do that I'll get in touch with the guy who drew it and if he  if he has got  an original copy he might be able to erm to er
"What, what you can do is you can then get basically you get the computer to type that out  type that out."
Ah.
"And then you just do a run, you don't have to go on to print it at all you just print it off."
That's one option
Then photocopy the rest of it.
I've got a laser printer yeah so I mean that's what I use for my business.
I've got a Mackintosh and a laser printer.
So I mean
I've got some recycled paper but but
So you've got  nine  plus four  Did we do a sample all day?
"No, just in the peak hours they're sampling."
Didn't we do them off peak as well?
We should have done them off peak as well shouldn't we?
I don't know.
I mean Jan did those.
I think it was just peak hours.
Er   It's gonna take thirteen people isn't it?
"Yeah, I mean if it was peaks only I mean there's nothing to stop me doing it."
Well I appreciate that.
"Or you use it, you put everybody on in the peaks"
Yeah.
"and then you, you"
You use the
cutback
"In the off, in the off peak they rotate the staff and"
I'm not The thing is what you're assuming then is that the pattern in the peak hour  is typical for the day as a whole.
That's not right is it?
Mm  maybe not.
Well you'll get a different pattern in the morning peak and the evening peak for a start won't you?
Mhm.
Mind you maybe you won't.
"Depends, what you're really concerned about is how does the proportion of traffic  split to left and right and  straight ahead isn't it?"
"If that pattern basically stays the same  then you've got, the volume, the flow will go up and down."
Mm right.
But if we did a full turning count how would we do that?
You can't do it can you?
It's not realistic.
You have to do  if you're doing that you have to have all the ins and outs plus a circulation flow.
Yeah.
And I've never done one like that.
"We've always  you know, found a way round it."
Do they need to do the  they've proposed that they  to bypass erm  if we're doing the Caernarvon bypass.
Well can they detrunk that bit?
Well it doesn't say that.
Well can they detrunk that bit?
responsibility not
Yeah.
theirs if they put the bypass in.
"So what came out of this, well it could be"
So are they looking to build a bypass first?
The gut reaction this morning is we could end up  with a bypass scheme at the end of it and no Caernarvon link.
Oh that's no good is it?
Of course it is.
Cos we're still continuing designing a Caernarvon link .
four percent fee .
"Mind you it's, it's a smaller job."
What's smaller?
"Well if they're doing that then we s we're looking to make this a dual carriageway  on the Richard  principle that if it's a trunk road it's worth building a dual, a dual carriageway."
If you can convince him on traffic grounds fair enough.
So they're serious
"Course the initial thing is we get some reaction back from this, this"
so they're seriously looking to  the trunk road network coming down  bypass and then going off round the Caernarvon bypass?
Or is that just
That wasn't er  Ray  's view.
That was this other guy's view.
Based on this other scheme really he said oh yes.
"But which,whi which other guy?"
This Ve Vernon whatever his name is.
The  are proposing this.
They won't want that.
They wo they won't
But the  the guy that's looking after the  schemes
Yeah.
I'm still amazed about eighty gardens though.
"Eighty gardens, oh  made me laugh."
"Well that's not what amazes me, eighty gardens."
"Eighty gardens, but then as a place that size, and the didn't have any machinery don't forget everything had to be"
"Well I expect now, they've got about five ."
"I should think they probably still, in the, in the high season, I should think they probably still need fifteen, twenty"
"Oh look,tractor  ."
I think it still belongs to the Duke of Devonshire because he was interviewed at the end wasn't he?
Mm.
And he said they have to systematically sell something to keep the place up.
Mm.
But if they can use that er beautiful water
Ah right.
"to generate their own electricity, save them a bomb and they can sell some as well."
I know a lot of people say they shouldn't
Good idea .
"have houses that size, but I think it's an awful shame to let our heritage go."
"Yeah, I agree, if people did ."
"I tell you another thing that amazes me, how any one with a Sovereign right,were a Sovereign in those days, could have given up the palace of Westminster which is so beautiful,palace, together I suppose reigned after the Duke of  is it?"
.
"It was only built erm, what a couple of hundred years ago wasn't it?"
What Buckingham Palace?
Mm.
"I don't know, I didn't realise."
"At Kensington, Kensington palace, but the palace of Westminster I think is the most beautiful building"
Mm.
"and of course they had the Thames which was their main highway, Thames was much easier to use than"
Well that was Buckingham Palace was er .
Oh yes.
.
Oh yeah.
.
Yeah.
Subtract them that way round.
They'll go out.
"And we've got three point one squared, minus"
Two point nine squared .
Two point nine squared .
Mm.
"Which will come to, if we add them it's six times nought point two."
The gradient will be one point two.
That's a bit better because a gradient of one is forty five degrees and we s we said it should be more than that.
Erm  one point two.
Find out which ang what angle has a tan of one point two.
Tan minus one .
One point two.
Fifty.
Fifty.
"So you were, you were closer to seventy."
"You see how hard it is to see just from the graph, from a, from"
Mm.
"a sketch, if you plotted it on paper, but this is without plotting it, we're getting it quite accurately."
"Erm  maybe someone says it could be useful for you to try it again, without any help from this page at all."
"So we've got Y equals X squared, minus one."
And we want the gradient at the point where X equals three.
"But we want to get very very close to it, like only nought point nought one before it and nought point nought one after it."
So what value would ?
Around the point where X is three.
Erm so you'd need  nought in the middle.
"No, I'm not thinking of drawing a sketch at the moment, we've done the sketch on the other page"
Ah.
"and we're just thinking of  what value are we going to, what would be the value of X point nought one before three?"
Er two point nine nine.
Okay.
"Well that's true, yes, yes, I mean that's the lakes, it's lovely up there isn't it?"
"And it's only an hour or so away, so  perhaps you should say that"
get a weekend in
I wonder where there is a cheap place to
where you can old furniture.
"Somewhere where you, where you can go, where you can offer to do the washing up for that afternoon if you get bored"
"No I don't mean that I mean, I, we can find old shops that, are not fully conversant with the modern day prices of furniture"
Oh no
all furniture
you've got no chance
mm.
"No I mean, what is he, different"
"in there, operating in, especially in the what were the eastern country, erm standard of living is"
"Oh there yes, no I meant in this country"
Not on par with ours is it?
"I don't think, I don't think there's anywhere left now, there might be somewhere but it'll be hard to find."
"Have you noticed all these holidays in Italy all Tuscany, you never see any"
"A lot, yeah"
from southern Italy at all do you?
Oh you see a lot of them from erm
"Oh I mean I know you can get the brochures, but in the papers there's"
paediatric coast don't you?
"farmhouse in Tuscany, rows and rows of them."
You see them for Rome don't you?
"Not very often, not in here"
Is it tours?
"Not very often, not really"
"Oh I mean the, the favoured place for the holiday makers is on er on the coast that was er Gisebelle and erm"
"mm, what's the other one?"
Catonica
Is it Rimini?
"Rimini, Catonica all on the"
Regional railways have asked for that as well.
Have they?
Yes.
Erm that that
Well Dennis er Roger's been doing for it for Leeds North West haven't you?
He has.
Yeah.
But he's been doing it manually haven't you Rog?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Be be because I don't think you can trust the forecast reports from DOPACS.
"I think y yo you could blip from month to month er, er as a priority slipped in or changed, or a person slipped out or, or somebody forgot to zero something or y"
It's too fragile isn't it?
It's far too fragile.
Mm.
"It it's there for us to, to use as a, as a sore thumb exercise to ask questions but, but to actually do anything er, er as critical as saying, we're gonna spend twelve thousand pounds next period and eleven thousand pound the period after and fourteen thousand the period after, er I don't think that's"
computer system's tying your hands behind your back.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
"So, so really"
"we're gonna have to have a manual involvement or override there by the project coordinator to, to, to"
"Well if, if you remember we, we agreed with Keith  he would have a think  that and a talk to"
Yeah.
Roy er Roy
You'd remind him about it Hugh.
Yeah.
"But what I'm gonna suggest is that again we go back to the client, and say basically, this is what we think we can provide is that good enough?"
Mm.
This is what you want.
"If we give you that we can give you it in a certain way, but it is not necessarily meaningful."
Mhm.
He wants every single penny accounted for  before he starts doing anything.
But she's that  we
"He had er, fourteen and a half thousand pound once in a building society four year ago  there's nine hundred pound left in his bu er, building society account!"
They want to know where that is.
"She,"
"The solicitor, nobody else, just the solicitor."
Er  he's got some insurance policies  one's for eleven hundred pound  right?
And they're gonna pay that.
And that's gotta go straight direct to the solicitor.
"Also, he's supposed to have had an insurance policies  but General Accident said it's only for a year  and he took it out in seventy seven to nineteen seventy eight."
But he's still got the policy  life insurance on it.
He was insured with the Co-op.
He was insured with the Co-op.
Oh that were a  that'll be  bound to come.
So that's
I don't know.
"Yeah, he won't pay Mrs  insurance money out yet will he?"
"No, he, he, he, he's gotta pay it to the solicitor."
It all gotta go to them?
It's all got to go to solicitor.
And that  fourteen thousand five hundred pound every single penny's got to be accounted for.
Well who's gonna know about that then?
The bank.
Building society he put it in.
The solicitors who gave him the court order  for them to release all the details on that.
And even that car he bought  the
Who?
the solicitor can take it off him
The solicitor wants to know why
And he'd bought a car had he?
Yeah.
For a boy.
X is going to go up when Y is a million.
X X is a million.
X is a million.
"What, what would Y be?"
A million squared.
Yeah.
"So th the minus one doesn't make a lot of difference, so as X is very, when X gets very big, it'll just look like Y equals X squared,taking one off if"
Mm.
you're working with millions of millions.
"So it looks like Y equals X squared, moved up a bit, more or less, as a good approximation."
"I mean a hundred is probably big enough, twenty five might be  is more or less big enough."
Mm.
"Er five, say we can have five here, you can have twenty five,over here somewhere,"
Mhm.
behind your shoulder.
"Yeah it'll actually be twenty five minus one,"
Minus one.
but it's a good enough approximation just to see what it'll look like.
So how do you work out the gradient?
"Well you see, it's pretty flattish isn't it?"
"The gradient of a curve is the gradient of tangent, so we can draw a tangent where you wanted it at that place."
It would be the gradient of the tangent.
Mhm.
"If it was at the bottom where it's flat, where you just, you're just coming down, and then you started to go up again, just at the bottom there, it's, it's zero for"
a moment.
"But what would the gradient be there, and how would we find it?"
Er
"It would, it, up here."
"So could you do an approximation, a ver just a very rough guess."
"I mean does it, does it lie over that way or has it sort of gone back on itself?"
Lies over that way?
Yeah.
that yeah can I answer that
Andrew.
Now you would court martial them well I put it to the S I B
S I B what's that?
That's the Special Investigation Branch .
Special Investigation Branch.
"All the allegations I made, all the beatings I took, I'm bleeding  they investigated nothing, and what the brigadier said, the brigadier is talking nonsense."
He knows that the Army is w widespread in the Army and he .
"It's like everything else you  company commander, you tell him, he throws it out the window."
He sends you away  make you feel happy
"Do you know I've served in the Army for thirty three years and I've commanded every thing at every level in the infantry which both these gentlemen have been in, from a platoon right up now to a brig er brigade and I can honestly tell you that I haven't seen more than a couple of incidents of bullying in the whole of that time ."
You're a commissioned officer
The point is the point is that's that's a good point what you've said you don't see it.
That's the whole point.
You come at a barrack room as an officer
Mm.
"or a corp it doesn't matter,"
Mhm.
You'll see it.
with rank on your arm
Yeah.
the soldiers i that room will act a different way
I I agree.
when the door shuts
I understand that.
a different way again
they will .
"I can understand that , I can understand that."
But it's a matter leadership.
And leadership in the Army is some
Leadership has got nothing to do with it whatsoever.
Leadership
They ring up at seven and eight o'clock at night.
Yeah.
Asking us whether we want to borrow some money.
"Er, asking if there's anything we co , look at him walking about with that"
"Everything, everything, what oh, papers have got, has got Legal and General on it."
Mm.
"So, I thought, well"
Yeah.
it can't be a a dodgy
I don't think it'll be anything dodgy.
It won't be dodgy.
Oh.
"But you can always, easily find out"
"What usually happens, though."
"All you do, is pick the phone up and and get, oh now, what place do you ring."
"I forgot what place you ring, but we're find out, and you ring up to see what they're, what the company's like."
"You know, if it's a variable company."
Yeah.
"Things like that, you could do that."
"Different companies take over, I remember that time we borrowed that four thousand pound."
"We started out with Key Finance and we ended up with Mercantile Credit, didn't we?"
Yeah.
"Changed companies three times, that time we had that four thousand pounds."
"You told me about that, yeah."
Well  said that it will be a sm a really small building society.
"He says, that, 'cos er, it's not"
Well.
"Big building societies are not prepared to give you rates, and small building societies are wanting to get going"
"You see, the only trouble with building societies is, it's the same when you buy a pigging house , they put the money on what you've actually borrowed every year."
Yeah.
"Well, finance companies only, you only get the interest on what is left."
On the money that you owe.
Mm.
If you see what I mean.
Yeah.
Well so you think actually send something through to reprographics  for them to do in Liverpool?
Well you don't want to be doing it on the machine down here do you?
No.
"And if you got three thousand interviews, say a thousand at, well y you probably wouldn't, you'd probably get"
Probably two of those boxes would do wouldn't it?
"you could get  nearly four thousand interviews couldn't you, altogether?"
Yeah.
At two on a page is two thousand sheets  plus however many you'd only get one on.
So I'd have thought three thousand wasn't  out of the way really.
And like you say if there's some left they won't go to waste anyway.
No.
"Oh on the other hand I suppose we could say well we'll use, we'll get some and if we run out we'll use English ones."
"If you do it that way, you know, by the time they get there they should know what the questions are shouldn't they?"
Yeah.
"Excuse me, by the time you run a"
Cos we hold the original  to that.
To the interview
Well we'll need some  anyway.
Yeah.
"We've probably, I mean we, we hold the original on an A three  so it might be worthwhile  doing a  copy of it."
Doctoring it
Oh I see yeah.
to insert the Welsh because John will have to send the original off for
Oh right.
Yes .
We'll have a look
And then we can have the base copy of each then couldn't we?
Good.
"I'll, I'll dig it out after."
What was that one?
it was about death penalty wasn't it?
.
"there's all sorts like, like recruiting, making contact with the schools, er, lobbying, er, there, there about ten or twelve different workshops now, almost on almost every aspects, so and that would be something that we could give, if, if these weren't  ."
"But there has to be one guarantee in  because I think once we had rather good one, about six people kept, you can never tell how many  come, I mean you'd want maybe bigger, more than, more space in this room."
"Well, we've, have got another room maybe we might sometimes be able to use haven't we?"
Well we could use the .
"Or your dining room, yes."
it's probably better that
"Mm, we often need to use one more than one room for those."
Mm.
Mm.
Though we do seem to be doing quite well in numbers.
"Yes, we have lately, yes."
Better than last year.
"That suddenly, I mean it means you divide into smaller groups quite often, and, and have discussions on  you can, yeah.."
Speak on what you've got.
"No, might be my speech, do we need a, meet, meet in a more public place, erm."
"No, no, we can't."
.
"But you, erm"
.
"Yes, yes, you, you."
"Erm, your business would take care of itself if we have that pressure of booking it,."
I honestly think it would.
"I think if anything, I'm sure it would."
"Yeah, mm, sure."
I think.
I'm sure that it would  make us more careful the months before.
"Mm, mm."
"Right, going on the streets think it would, going to find that many people that, that could speak to"
That was
There's that other roundabout isn't there?
You know where the horses were in the field?
That was a four armed roundabout.
Just down from
Yeah.
the station house place where we parked
You'll find that erm  the flows there are very low.
So you think we could get away with treating that as a crossroads and have people
I reckon
doing that?
I reckon
"Well we could have a person counting and not only are they counting what's coming out of their junction, but they could do left, straight on or right."
Treat it as a crossroads  perhaps.
"I reckon  si yes four or six people would cover that, no problem."
I think you'll find the flow is a  a low
it wasn't busy when we were there was it?
"No I mean it may be, you know you  i it may be reasonably busy straight through but I would have thought even there you're probably talking about four  not a lot higher than that I wouldn't have thought."
No.
Okay I'll take four people
And erm we're going very round very slow.
And the visibility was good and everything.
"So I'd have thought that erm  you could put four or six, four or six people on that."
And actually if we just counted this  to through traffic wouldn't be too much
Hello  right.
your pudding?
What erm  have you heard any of it?you have.
What did it sound like?
It's good.
We both just said that it ne you'd never think that you sound right on  tape.
I always think I sound high pitched.
sounds all like bloody  what she does say.
Yeah
Will it go in?
"Yeah, I'm sure it will."
Thank you
Thank you
"They're not really  are they, the Chinese or  Oriental dancers?"
"I don't think so anyway, they seem to be"
A lot of cars at the school this morning.
"I parked right on the end of the erm  the lane, just"
Mm
"in, there was just enough room for me."
Mm?
Course we were late anyway  well not late for John's but
Which way do you go
When I came back
into ?
Cos you can cut through that
"I turn round and go back, yeah."
Mm.
"And of course the coach had come up the hill  couldn't overtake where I was parked, blocking off the entrance to the lane where I'd just come out of so that the string of cars coming down the road and the first one wanting to turn in and of course the coach had covered it."
Oh yeah
It was completely blocked off  coach couldn't go backwards because there was cars behind it.
So I gingerly walked down and crept into the car realized that I was the one that had caused all that
and drove off
And ignored
Slinked off into the mist.
So he couldn't back back then
"No  no that wa that was it, completely stalemate."
"big Volvo estate was facing  if he'd go down there, I can get through and he can come back again and  he wasn't gonna do that."
Too much  brain damage
there's a big notice at the end of the lane which says
Well he'd come up from Totnes this morning.
"and just, I hid under my sleeping bag, er, then, I thought er the mon what would happen to the monster and so he might of stayed there on, you know, all, all night"
John
"Well he did say that the monster was rather large, he looked like a bird"
with some feathers plucked out
What else could you bring in his bag?
Anything else he could of put in the hat Liam?
"He vaguely saw the monster and then he ran back to the camp where he was camping, but he didn't describe"
"Where, where"
"Yeah, where"
So he could of put a little bit in about how he ran back
Yeah
"and what he went through in, in"
that couldn't he?
Yeah
"Right, the people who have not read an essay out yet, I want you to sit, just a minute Michael, next to somebody and I want you to read your essay to them and see what they think about it and how you could maybe improve it and I want Michael and John to go and show Steve your books as well now please, right boys do that now then, yes, could you take yours to show"
please
Do we have to show both?
Not sure  it's still working.
It's still working
The thingy
Is it recording us?
Is it recording?
Yeah
My dad's got all this
"Sorry Steve, erm,"
that you're not going to read your essay and
and that isn't
"essay, either work your book or, and get it"
"er, yes, well it has to be up"
and when you've finished it you can then do a picture about your
"Right erm, can I start by asking you, can you tell me your full name please?"
That right?
They say unless you've been unemployed six months you're not unemployed.
You're looking for a job.
They don't call it unemployed.
Well you can't go on the list for six weeks anyway.
Six months.
"six weeks, yeah."
"Well if you haven't been working for six months you are looking for a job, you are not unemployed."
They don't call that unemployment.
Course this is all  voting   propaganda again.
I mean when is it  it's a disgrace to the social service workers isn't it?
To make them wear uniform.
They're getting them like prison officers and policeman and
Well it's the same as anywhere else.
If you work in Marks and Spencers you wear er their uniform.
If you work in the hospital you wear their uniform.
Yeah.
That's only to advertise the place though isn't it?
Marks and Spencers and
It isn't.
If you went into your Clarke's shoe shop they've all got the same clothes.
"It's it makes it so easy that  the staff, one can't dress any better than the other."
They're all equal.
When you go to places like  in the big stores  the staff have all got the same type of apron er overall.
"And that's for the customer, if it needs help they know who is who to go for advice."
Yeah.
That's all it is.
But when you've got people stood behind a desk and serving you and doing nothing but serving you as you come.
They'll be wanting bank clerks to have uniforms next.
Good god bank clerks have been wearing uniforms for these last three four five years.
Oh I've never seen them.
Well
what's the point in making them worse.
I know.
"So, jump in me box, and I ain't jumping in me box blind, for the last ten years."
I'll manage the way I am.
"You see, that works where I"
Benjy
"Aye,"
"Benjy, look at 'im."
Benjy
"Where are you, when it's gonna be, he said corner, then we'll make an office and a little canteen in that anyway."
"Then there's another long unit right at side of it, just enough to get one trailer in."
"I said, I said, if we do get going, and we do start finding out that it's going alright, he'll turn that, into like er, shop er, blasting shop."
"And like,"
Yeah.
"A spray area, then"
Yeah.
Employ a sprayer.
"So, I mean, we know what we want, but  it's them and not us, I mean, it is frightening to start a business up, 'cos we don't know how much work we'll be getting, but, I mean,"
"Well, it's same for anybody starting any business, ain't it, you don't know if it's gonna work  as well."
"It might go well for the first three or four months, and then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a few months ,"
Yeah.
you could be struggling to keep it above
Yeah.
"and especially, you know, these bloody big firms, they do not like paying bloody bills."
No.
"I mean, you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya, but your business will still go under."
"Yeah, because of it."
Because of it.
Yeah.
"They don't look on them things, how much you've got owed out to ya."
I know.
"When you look you see everything's a bloody risk,"
"my Lord do, do we agree to that now or by tomorrow morning?"
well I would think if it could lodged during the course of the next ten days or so
"certainly, it'll be done by tomorrow morning"
"I'm, I'm, if there any question over it, the reason why I said ten days I'm already sitting in London for, until the end of next week and therefore if there were any question, it's obvious that it came before me, and that"
it'll be done by tomorrow morning
yes
thank you
"yes, yes, that can be prepared and erm a copy of that to doctor  and"
certainly
"doctor  if you don't agree with what it says, erm, you can obviously mention that to  and  er  er along speedily say in the course of this week, the matter can be mentioned in formal to me, erm one morning at ten o'clock next week I would of thought."
In terms of I need to appeal this one
"oh yes, leave to appeal, erm  it doesn't seem to me that this is an appropriate case for leave, or at least for me to grant leave, doctor"

"But that details of that actually has a  but I don't think it's a total story okay so I'll, I'll put it all down on, on paper and then we'll take it from there, okay, thanks, bye ."
Nowadays I mean I know there never used to be apprenticeships for women but
"Well I don't know if there are any women, I couldn't tell you whether any girls have applied to be like trainee tenters, that's people that sort"
Mhm.
the looms.
"Or, the trainees in our department would be female anyway."
Mhm.
"And the way the management work in here,I can say is they,aim they're promoting anybody to a chargehand they usually promote somebody that's actually no threat to themselves."
"There's a kind of yes man, that, that's the way the carpet industry works in general."
Mhm.
They don't promote somebody that's gonna shimmy past them up the corporate ladder although  you couldn't
say this place
"is a, a giant corporation ."
Mhm.
Aha.
"But sometimes I, I do feel that the girls, I, I know a couple of people in other departments that you could say would do the job equally well as the man they've put in, they probably"
Aha.
have bu be a better grounding.
Aha.
Yes.
"But I saw that in the glazier and  when I worked in there, they would bring people in."
Mhm.
Oh
M
they wouldn't promote?
"No, er, if you had a degree,"
Aha.
"and you absolutely no knew nothing about producing plain bearings you were sitting in the chair and probably a guy that worked his way through the factory floor who knew the job inside out, he was still"
a deputy.
Aha.

"Go on then you try and pull it out of us, that's what I'm trying to do look"

"Have then, it's harder than what you think it is this"
Ah?
It's harder than what you think it is this
"Oh, I wonder why this was"

Why's that then?
Metal Mickey.
really
Metal Mickey.
Well that's
really a bright spark.
You know.
Yeah.
What I'm
But erm
"what I suggest is these procedures are, we briefly mentioned this this morning, are supposed to reflect the best practice of what we do now."
Yeah.
That is not what we do now.
"That is actually saying to the Q S, you've now got authority to come in to B E S and effectively do what you do on the civil side."
And what I'm saying is he's certainly not geared up to undertake that task.
And that certainly hasn't
Jim?
been debated.
"On, on, in many cases"
Mm.
Go on.
"I mean if I took your line, your, your logic and maybe I'm misinterpreting it, er we would not have changed anything when B E S came into, to our organization."
"And one of the most significant changes I wanted to make, and I think we have made was that the, the letting of contracts and the vetting of contracts and so on would be done by our Q Ss, in the same way as it is for the civil work"
Indeed.
"for a very simple purpose and that is that it, it improves our internal control."
Yeah.
"It puts an in a a almost er an independent view in there, of the costs and valuation of variations and so on."
"Now I, I think perhaps you're worrying unduly, Jim in so far as, your, your men will continue to administer contracts in the way they do now."
"The they still issue the certificate to the client, which is signed off price correct."
Yes.
"For them to sign off price correct, they have got to have had a look at the measure."
Haven't they?
Well they don't.
Yeah I know.
I use contractions in the newsletter some times which is deliberately honest.
It's like saying avoid cliches like the plague.
I mean I I'd having been  these comments and yes there are a couple of extra points put in there I think that that's fine.
It's nice to get some of it done.
What about the rest of you lads?
Well as soon as I have a window in my diary which I'm not
We'll let you off with the newsletter.
contribution it is said.
Alright I'll I'll undertake to to come up with something for our next meeting.
I mean all I I didn't I just did exactly what I was told.
I put brought out a list of points.
There's no grammar in there.
There's contractions all over the place because erm and all sorts.
I even used numbers instead of writing them out in full verse.
So erm
You can minute me and I'll erm
Did you use any semicolons?
Probably put a split infinitive as well.
Well I've got the checking erm.
Right so Steve is undertaking to be the next brave soldier to  write something for
I don't know what I'm doing.
The general
We have to be very busy.
I mean this this this item has actually been deferred two meetings and
Mm.
Yeah.
We'll just been too busy.
Then I'll try and get something if I get time but.
Okay
Still I suppose the time's it's the actual the calendar's starting to tick for having this  isn't it now.
"Yeah if we're actually ever gonna make use of it we will, joking aside, have to try and get something  ."
Yeah.
"Right,."
Okey-doke.
Hmm.
"It's, it's a bit cracked ."
It makes it very
"As I say it's better than, it's a bit better than it was."
But it's still not that
No.
good is it?
No.
No.
"Right, what we need to do is to hit it fairly hard and try to get it damped down as quickly as we possibly can."
Now don't get rid of the Betnovate have you still got some left?
Mm.
Okay.
Because as soon as it starts to die down you could probably go back on to Betnovate to keep it maintained.
And you may actually have to use Betnovate on a preventative basis every now and again.
"Even if there's not a deal there, as soon as it starts  it's slightly flaky  straight in."
But what I'm gonna do is give you erm Dermavate Dermavate is actually more potent than Betnovate in the ointment form again to get the rapid penetration.
"And once again, like Betnovate it's used twice a day."
And in a similar fashion you should use the Dipabase to keep the skin as soft and moist as you can
Mhm.
rather than letting it get dried out and cracked.
"Dermavate is, as I say, it's more potent, it's probably not so suitable for keeping going with, but for jumping on top of things in a hurry, it's fine."
And I think that's what we ought to use.
"Sometimes you actually need to use it under something, but it's difficult to use under things and part of the hand."
I don't know what you mean under
"Well sort of under a dressing, or"
Oh right.
"under a bit of polythene, so it, it actually gets absorbed even quicker."
Mm.
"But I'll write her a postcard to say, Yes it looks quite interesting when can we see the samples and can you tell us more about how the money works."
Yeah and confirm that that isn't a daily price.
I think that I'll have to confirm with the company.
Yes.
But it just just seems suspiciously cheap.
That twelve
Well I mean it's not the huge massive billboards.
I mean if they're just sort of four foot things I mean it's not you know I think.
Yeah perhaps.
Anyway  that's really into this idea.
Especially Bob's suggestion of calling for people to sponsor
Sponsor
sponsor a poster.
Erm should I at least be prepared to again stick something in the newsletter about .
As you say it's the sort of thing that might appeal to people because then they can go and look at their poster.
Be photographed next to it.
What do you think?
We could always do  posting on the side of the Conservative building.
Your direct your direct action at home.
Yes well come and visit you in prison.
Right does that cover billboards?
Yep.
no that was a good agenda item just got silly.
Okay.
Who wanted to talk about affiliation stroke working with other groups?
This is something we said we were going to discuss at a time in the future and I thought I'd stick it on and see how much time we'd got left.
Right.
Well we've got twenty five minutes at present shall we can you just wipe around a couple of other things and then we'll come back to that if time remains?
Yes do.
Okay.
Right intro leaflet.
Do I hear apathy?
"You're only, you only"
Well you only put
putting that much in
Oh
"in this, in like a pint"
"Mm, so you only want a small amount then really don't you?"
"That's the trouble, I don't need a ruddy gallon"
Mm
"and the other of course is the eight eighty ammonia which is only half of five mil, two and a half mil teaspoon."
Which chemist did you go to?
Bob's
"Oh, and neither of them, no E T will you stop it you two, you see"
Aye
get in your basket this minute
"I thought, I thought the other one had got it"
"go on , go on."
"When you think of it, these chemists to date, no wonder their wives are on a low wage and the moaning all the time because they're not bloody chemists, they're just getting pills out of a box"
"Yeah, that's right , yes, yeah"
"you don't see erm doing this  but, well after that, I mean"
"and er, well years ago they had all these bottle of potions on the back shelf I suppose"
"they were mixing up all the time, it's all antibiotics now and isn't it tablets or"
Mm
bottles of
"already, ready mix"
"There's a jar already done, you just pour it in"
"Yeah, I suppose and mostly to erm, medicines are, are in tablet form aren't they?"
You know you don't get that many liquids it's usually for children isn't it?
Ninety percent probably
The erm you get
The only liquid you get are probably cough medicines and stuff like that and
Yeah
"which are all, er what they called?"
"as opposed to the, but, but some cupboard doors are diamond pattern, Muffin will you be quiet  have we any more bones cooked for them or have they had them all?"
No there's some there
Cooked?
"oh that's what I mean, erm, well listen we'd better try and just, practice somehow and see erm"
what do you
erm
Are you gonna left that battery on
"well, well only temporarily, I only want this"
"it's alright it's just this unit thing, when connected to"
"right erm, just erm"
"It just drops in there doesn't it, hanging"
"oh I would of thought there was a rest for it surely, no?"
Do you think so?
Just down the bottom
Just down the bottom
Right  what you're going to have to do is erm
Get a piece of wood with a nail in it
"Yeah, yeah"
I tell you what get a hold of that and put something underneath it.
"I don't know, it don't seem to react to that, that's a bit, mind you there again there's only going to be that there isn't it?"
"Er, well, put it on the floor"
Go in your basket go on
"Yes, I cannot give it much more"
"re-allocated, I might be able to get the two sides on, but I'll need more, obvious have some more wide bolts for the er top and the bottom"
"So er, what you actually got to have it cut now, what have you?"
Those four
Mm
to that section of the
"oh these are about two inch are they or some, didn't say"
it wouldn't split in half went for it and
Twelve inches across are they?
That way
"No that's what you've gotta, you, he showed us"
Oh
said the stuff you're using is
Rubbish
"old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off?"
Mm
You know
"that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing?"
"And that, and this, you kept getting this er"
"Oh no you, you can use this, but you"
oil through
"don't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says don't even use that."
Oh
"His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can"
Mm
"put, and then wax you see, now this is what we haven't seen yet"
So just use wax to build up the polish
"waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see"
Mm
but you can
"that's what he does, but, if he want, I don't know, he have to"
"Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in?"
That's already done innit?
"Well, cos with him being on night, I don't suppose he got up till about"
"He started just after me, yeah"
"one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the"
"I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he didn't want to bother, but I thought afterwards  that'll be each one of those holes, he"
He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the
yes
or
"well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand"
he will
and they write the lecture for me
they write yeah
they write the lecture as it takes place
yeah
yes
good preparation
Well no there's actually there's a lot of preparation in that isn't there
Well what I do it on is planning
Oh yes
and er control of sub contractors then you get a mixed group from Tarmac er different companies and their conception of what planning is and conception of what controlling sub contractor is
yeah
is totally different so I did the first lecture with what my idea of  to find myself talking to a a contract housing guy whose biggest order was two thousand pounds
right
so I've have them produce the lecture and then we've gone on from like doing
yep
exactly the thing
right
pick out three things and we'll talk about them
"Mm, mm"
and that's how I use visual aids
so it can actually be a stimulus can't it?
so I then find myself doing nothing else but walking around so I go and ask
right
So it forces me
yes
out into the audience
Well that's what you hinted at yesterday as well didn't it?
I mean if if you're here even now you've got your notes down rather than in your hand and and you stand and read but you don't use that or you don't use that then there is that tendency isn't there to?
So the focus of attention switches from people looking at me
"yeah, to the visual aid yes"
to this to actually looking at what they're producing
"right, yes, and that's an important factor that that if you feel everybody's looking at you it is important"
`` The innocent should surely come before the guilty . ''
"`` Why , David , '' said he , `` the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled in court ; but for the lad that shot the bullet , I think the best place for him will be the heather ."
"Them that havenae dipped their hands in any little difficulty , should be very mindful of the case of them that have ."
And that is the good Christianity .
"For if it was the other way round about , and the lad whom I couldnae just clearly see had been in our shoes , and we in his -LRB- as might very well have been -RRB- , I think we would be a good deal obliged to him oursel 's if he would draw the soldiers . ''"
"When it came to this , I gave Alan up ."
"But he looked so innocent all the time , and was in such clear good faith in what he said , and so ready to sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty , that my mouth was closed ."
Mr. Henderland 's words came back to me : that we ourselves might take a lesson by these wild Highlanders .
"Well , here I had taken mine ."
"Alan 's morals were all tail-first ; but he was ready to give his life for them , such as they were ."
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` I 'll not say it 's the good Christianity as I understand it , but it 's good enough ."
And here I offer ye my hand for the second time . ''
"Whereupon he gave me both of his , saying surely I had cast a spell upon him , for he could forgive me anything ."
"Then he grew very grave , and said we had not much time to throw away , but must both flee that country : he , because he was a deserter , and the whole of Appin would now be searched like a chamber , and every one obliged to give a good account of himself ; and I , because I was certainly involved in the murder ."
`` O ! ''
"says I , willing to give him a little lesson , `` I have no fear of the justice of my country . ''"
`` As if this was your country ! ''
said he .
"`` Or as if ye would be tried here , in a country of Stewarts ! ''"
"`` It 's all Scotland , '' said I. `` Man , I whiles wonder at ye , '' said Alan ."
`` This is a Campbell that 's been killed .
"Well , it 'll be tried in Inverara , the Campbells ' head place ; with fifteen Campbells in the jury-box and the biggest Campbell of all -LRB- and that 's the Duke -RRB- sitting cocking on the bench ."
"Justice , David ?"
"The same justice , by all the world , as Glenure found awhile ago at the roadside . ''"
"This frightened me a little , I confess , and would have frightened me more if I had known how nearly exact were Alan 's predictions ; indeed it was but in one point that he exaggerated , there being but eleven Campbells on the jury ; though as the other four were equally in the Duke 's dependence , it mattered less than might appear ."
"Still , I cried out that he was unjust to the Duke of Argyle , who -LRB- for all he was a Whig -RRB- was yet a wise and honest nobleman ."
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` the man 's a Whig , nae doubt ; but I would never deny he was a good chieftain to his clan ."
"And what would the clan think if there was a Campbell shot , and naebody hanged , and their own chief the Justice General ?"
"But I have often observed , '' says Alan , `` that you Low-country bodies have no clear idea of what 's right and wrong . ''"
"At this I did at last laugh out aloud , when to my surprise , Alan joined in , and laughed as merrily as myself ."
"`` Na , na , '' said he , `` we 're in the Hielands , David ; and when I tell ye to run , take my word and run ."
"cried Alan , `` if I make a boat , I 'll make a body to take it back again !"
"So deave me with no more of your nonsense , but walk -LRB- for that 's what you 've got to do -RRB- -- and let Alan think for ye . ''"
"All night , then , we walked through the north side of the Carse under the high line of the Ochil mountains ; and by Alloa and Clackmannan and Culross , all of which we avoided : and about ten in the morning , mighty hungry and tired , came to the little clachan of Limekilns ."
"This is a place that sits near in by the water-side , and looks across the Hope to the town of the Queensferry ."
"Smoke went up from both of these , and from other villages and farms upon all hands ."
"The fields were being reaped ; two ships lay anchored , and boats were coming and going on the Hope ."
"It was altogether a right pleasant sight to me ; and I could not take my fill of gazing at these comfortable , green , cultivated hills and the busy people both of the field and sea ."
"For all that , there was Mr. Rankeillor 's house on the south shore , where I had no doubt wealth awaited me ; and here was I upon the north , clad in poor enough attire of an outlandish fashion , with three silver shillings left to me of all my fortune , a price set upon my head , and an outlawed man for my sole company ."
"`` O , Alan ! ''"
"said I , `` to think of it !"
"Over there , there 's all that heart could want waiting me ; and the birds go over , and the boats go over -- all that please can go , but just me only !"
"O , man , but it 's a heart-break ! ''"
"In Limekilns we entered a small change-house , which we only knew to be a public by the wand over the door , and bought some bread and cheese from a good-looking lass that was the servant ."
"This we carried with us in a bundle , meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the sea-shore , that we saw some third part of a mile in front ."
"As we went , I kept looking across the water and sighing to myself ; and though I took no heed of it , Alan had fallen into a muse ."
At last he stopped in the way .
`` Did ye take heed of the lass we bought this of ? ''
"says he , tapping on the bread and cheese ."
"`` To be sure , '' said I , `` and a bonny lass she was . ''"
`` Ye thought that ? ''
cries he .
"`` Man , David , that 's good news . ''"
"`` In the name of all that 's wonderful , why so ? ''"
says I. `` What good can that do ? ''
"`` Well , '' said Alan , with one of his droll looks , `` I was rather in hopes it would maybe get us that boat . ''"
"`` If it were the other way about , it would be liker it , '' said I. `` That 's all that you ken , ye see , '' said Alan ."
"`` I do n't want the lass to fall in love with ye , I want her to be sorry for ye , David ; to which end there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty ."
Let me see '' -LRB- looking me curiously over -RRB- .
"`` I wish ye were a wee thing paler ; but apart from that ye 'll do fine for my purpose -- ye have a fine , hang-dog , rag-and-tatter , clappermaclaw kind of a look to ye , as if ye had stolen the coat from a potato-bogle ."
"Come ; right about , and back to the change-house for that boat of ours . ''"
"I followed him , laughing ."
"`` David Balfour , '' said he , `` ye 're a very funny gentleman by your way of it , and this is a very funny employ for ye , no doubt ."
"`` He 's the only boy we ever failed with , and I am so grieved , for I thought there was the making of a fine man in him , spite of his faults . ''"
"Dan heard Mrs. Bhaer sigh , and he wanted to ask for one more trial himself , but his pride would not let him , and he came out with the hard look on his face , shook hands without a word , and drove away with Mr. Bhaer , leaving Nat and Mrs. Jo to look after him with tears in their eyes ."
"A few days afterwards they received a letter from Mr. Page , saying that Dan was doing well , whereat they all rejoiced ."
"But three weeks later came another letter , saying that Dan had run away , and nothing had been heard of him , whereat they all looked sober , and Mr. Bhaer said , `` Perhaps I ought to have given him another chance . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer , however , nodded wisely and answered , `` Do n't be troubled , Fritz ; the boy will come back to us , I 'm sure of it . ''"
But time went on and no Dan came .
CHAPTER VII .
"NAUGHTY NAN `` Fritz , I 've got a new idea , '' cried Mrs. Bhaer , as she met her husband one day after school ."
"`` Well , my dear , what is it ? ''"
"and he waited willingly to hear the new plan , for some of Mrs. Jo 's ideas were so droll , it was impossible to help laughing at them , though usually they were quite sensible , and he was glad to carry them out ."
"`` Daisy needs a companion , and the boys would be all the better for another girl among them ; you know we believe in bringing up little men and women together , and it is high time we acted up to our belief ."
"They pet and tyrannize over Daisy by turns , and she is getting spoilt ."
"Then they must learn gentle ways , and improve their manners , and having girls about will do it better than any thing else . ''"
"`` You are right , as usual ."
"Now , who shall we have ? ''"
"asked Mr. Bhaer , seeing by the look in her eye that Mrs. Jo had some one all ready to propose ."
`` Little Annie Harding . ''
`` What !
"Naughty Nan , as the lads call her ? ''"
"cried Mr. Bhaer , looking very much amused ."
"`` Yes , she is running wild at home since her mother died , and is too bright a child to be spoilt by servants ."
"I have had my eye on her for some time , and when I met her father in town the other day I asked him why he did not send her to school ."
He said he would gladly if he could find as good a school for girls as ours was for boys .
I know he would rejoice to have her come ; so suppose we drive over this afternoon and see about it . ''
"`` Have not you cares enough now , my Jo , without this little gypsy to torment you ? ''"
"asked Mr. Bhaer , patting the hand that lay on his arm ."
"`` Oh dear , no , '' said Mother Bhaer , briskly ."
"`` I like it , and never was happier than since I had my wilderness of boys ."
"You see , Fritz , I feel a great sympathy for Nan , because I was such a naughty child myself that I know all about it ."
"She is full of spirits , and only needs to be taught what to do with them to be as nice a little girl as Daisy ."
"Those quick wits of hers would enjoy lessons if they were rightly directed , and what is now a tricksy midget would soon become a busy , happy child ."
"I know how to manage her , for I remember how my blessed mother managed me , and -- '' `` And if you succeed half as well as she did , you will have done a magnificent work , '' interrupted Mr. Bhaer , who labored under the delusion that Mrs. B. was the best and most charming woman alive ."
"Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys -LRB- which he always took away from her next morning -RRB- , and she accepted them with a disturbing smile ."
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was -LRB- in brief -RRB- that they knew they were about to be sent to bed .
It was then that Maimie was terrible .
"Tony entreated her not to do it to-night , and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her , but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile ."
And by and by when they were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying ` Hsh !
what was that ? '
"Tony beseeches her , ` It was nothing -- do n't , Maimie , do n't ! '"
and pulls the sheet over his head .
` It is coming nearer ! '
she cries .
"` Oh , look at it , Tony !"
"It is feeling your bed with its horns -- it is boring for you , O Tony , oh ! '"
"and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations , screeching ."
"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly -- not shamming , you know , but really sleeping , and looking like the sweetest little angel , which seems to me to make it almost worse ."
"But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens , and then Tony did most of the talking ."
"You could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy , and no one was so proud of it as Maimie ."
She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister .
"And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her , as he often did with splendid firmness , that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the gates were closed . '"
"O Tony , ' she would say with awful respect , ` but the fairies will be so angry ! ' '"
"I dare say , ' replied Tony carelessly ."
"` Perhaps , ' she said , thrilling , ` Peter Pan will give you a sail in his boat ! ' '"
"I shall make him , ' replied Tony ; no wonder she was proud of him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They all tickled him on the shoulder -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- But they should not have talked so loudly , for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves , from which the little people weave their summer curtains , and after that Tony was a marked boy ."
"They loosened the rails before he sat on them , so that down he came on the back of his head ; they tripped him up by catching his bootlace , and bribed the ducks to sink his boat ."
"Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you , and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them ."
"Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things , but Tony was not that kind , and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied , ` Just some day ' ; he was quite vague about which day except when she asked , ` Will it be to-day ? '"
and then he could always say for certain that it would not be to-day .
So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance .
"This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow , and there was ice on the Round Pond ; not thick enough to skate on , but at least you could spoil it for to-morrow by flinging stones , and many bright little boys and girls were doing that ."
"When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond , but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first , and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that night ."
It read half-past five .
Poor ayah !
"`` Oh , thank God , '' murmured Mrs. Blythe , in a half-whisper ."
Bruce looked at her curiously .
`` That is what father said when mother told him .
"But when l said it the other day when I found out Mr. Mead 's dog had n't hurt my kitten -- I thought he had shooken it to death , you know -- father looked awful solemn and said I must never say that again about a kitten ."
"But I could n't understand why , Mrs. Blythe ."
"I felt awful thankful , and it must have been God that saved Stripey , because that Mead dog had ` normous jaws , and oh , how it shook poor Stripey ."
And so why could n't I thank Him ?
"` Course , '' added Bruce reminiscently , `` maybe I said it too loud -- 'cause I was awful glad and excited when I found Stripey was all right ."
"I ` most shouted it , Mrs. Blythe ."
Maybe if I 'd said it sort of whispery like you and father it would have been all right .
"Do you know , Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce dropped to a `` whispery '' tone , edging a little nearer to Anne -- `` what I would like to do to the Kaiser if I could ? ''"
"`` What would you like to do , laddie ? ''"
"`` Norman Reese said in school to-day that he would like to tie the Kaiser to a tree and set cross dogs to worrying him , '' said Bruce gravely ."
`` And Emily Flagg said she would like to put him in a cage and poke sharp things into him .
And they all said things like that .
But Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce took a little square paw out of his pocket and put it earnestly on Anne 's knee -- `` I would like to turn the Kaiser into a good man -- a very good man -- all at once if I could .
That is what I would do .
"Do n't you think , Mrs. Blythe , that would be the very worstest punishment of all ? ''"
"`` Bless the child , '' said Susan , `` how do you make out that would be any kind of a punishment for that wicked fiend ? ''"
"`` Do n't you see , '' said Bruce , looking levelly at Susan , out of his blackly blue eyes , `` if he was turned into a good man he would understand how dreadful the things he has done are , and he would feel so terrible about it that he would be more unhappy and miserable than he could ever be in any other way ."
He would feel just awful -- and he would go on feeling like that forever .
"Yes '' -- Bruce clenched his hands and nodded his head emphatically , `` yes , I would make the Kaiser a good man -- that is what I would do -- it would serve him ` zackly right . ''"
"CHAPTER XXVI SUSAN HAS A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE An aeroplane was flying over Glen St. Mary , like a great bird poised against the western sky -- a sky so clear and of such a pale , silvery yellow , that it gave an impression of a vast , wind-freshened space of freedom ."
"The little group on the Ingleside lawn looked up at it with fascinated eyes , although it was by no means an unusual thing to see an occasional hovering plane that summer ."
Susan was always intensely excited .
"Who knew but that it might be Shirley away up there in the clouds , flying over to the Island from Kingsport ?"
"But Shirley had gone overseas now , so Susan was not so keenly interested in this particular aeroplane and its pilot ."
"Nevertheless , she looked at it with awe ."
"`` I wonder , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she said solemnly , `` what the old folks down there in the graveyard would think if they could rise out of their graves for one moment and behold that sight ."
"I am sure my father would disapprove of it , for he was a man who did not believe in new-fangled ideas of any sort ."
He always cut his grain with a reaping hook to the day of his death .
A mower he would not have .
Danger !
"` Are you sure , Wendy ? '"
` Oh yes . '
Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window .
It was securely fastened .
"She looked out , and the night was peppered with stars ."
"They were crowding round the house , as if curious to see what was to take place there , but she did not notice this , nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her ."
"Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry , ` Oh , how I wish that I was n't going to a party to-night ! '"
"Even Michael , already half asleep , knew that she was perturbed , and he asked , ` Can anything harm us , mother , after the night-lights are lit ? '"
"` Nothing , precious , ' she said ; ` they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children . '"
"She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them , and little Michael flung his arms round her ."
"` Mother , ' he cried , ` I 'm glad of you . '"
They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time .
"-LSB- Illustration : PETER FLEW IN -RSB- No. 27 was only a few yards distant , but there had been a slight fall of snow , and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes ."
"They were already the only persons in the street , and all the stars were watching them ."
"Stars are beautiful , but they may not take an active part in anything , they must just look on for ever ."
It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was .
"So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak -LRB- winking is the star language -RRB- , but the little ones still wonder ."
"They are not really friendly to Peter , who has a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out ; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night , and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way ."
"So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament , and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out : ` Now , Peter ! '"
"CHAPTER III COME AWAY , COME AWAY !"
For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly .
"They were awfully nice little night-lights , and one can not help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter ; but Wendy 's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also , and before they could close their mouths all the three went out ."
"There was another light in the room now , a thousand times brighter than the night-lights , and in the time we have taken to say this , it has been in all the drawers in the nursery , looking for Peter 's shadow , rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out ."
"It was not really a light ; it made this light by flashing about so quickly , but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy , no longer than your hand , but still growing ."
"It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf , cut low and square , through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage ."
She was slightly inclined to embonpoint .
"A moment after the fairy 's entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars , and Peter dropped in ."
"He had carried Tinker Bell part of the way , and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust ."
"` Tinker Bell , ' he called softly , after making sure that the children were asleep , ` Tink , where are you ? '"
"She was in a jug for the moment , and liking it extremely ; she had never been in a jug before ."
"` Oh , do come out of that jug , and tell me , do you know where they put my shadow ? '"
"Look at the four of them , Wendy and Michael over there , John here , and Mrs. Darling by the fire ."
There should have been a fourth night-light .
While she slept she had a dream .
She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it .
"He did not alarm her , for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children ."
Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also .
"But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland , and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap ."
"The dream by itself would have been a trifle , but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open , and a boy did drop on the floor ."
"He was accompanied by a strange light , no bigger than your fist , which darted about the room like a living thing ; and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling ."
"She started up with a cry , and saw the boy , and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan ."
If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling 's kiss .
"He was a lovely boy , clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees ; but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth ."
"When he saw she was a grown-up , he gnashed the little pearls at her ."
"CHAPTER II THE SHADOW Mrs. Darling screamed , and , as if in answer to a bell , the door opened , and Nana entered , returned from her evening out ."
"She growled and sprang at the boy , who leapt lightly through the window ."
"Again Mrs. Darling screamed , this time in distress for him , for she thought he was killed , and she ran down into the street to look for his little body , but it was not there ; and she looked up , and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star ."
"She returned to the nursery , and found Nana with something in her mouth , which proved to be the boy 's shadow ."
"As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly , too late to catch him , but his shadow had not had time to get out ; slam went the window and snapped it off ."
"You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully , but it was quite the ordinary kind ."
Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow .
"She hung it out at the window , meaning ` He is sure to come back for it ; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children . '"
But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window ; it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house .
"She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling , but he was totting up winter greatcoats for John and Michael , with a wet towel round his head to keep his brain clear , and it seemed a shame to trouble him ; besides , she knew exactly what he would say : ` It all comes of having a dog for a nurse . '"
"She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer , until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband ."
Ah me !
"The opportunity came a week later , on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday ."
Of course it was a Friday . '
"I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday , ' she used to say afterwards to her husband , while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her , holding her hand ."
"` No , no , ' Mr. Darling always said , ' I am responsible for it all ."
"I , George Darling , did it ."
"Mea culpa , mea culpa ."
' He had had a classical education .
"`` Now , if you make fun of my plan I 'll give you bad coffee for a week , and then where are you , sir ? ''"
"cried Mrs. Jo , tweaking him by the ear just as if he was one of the boys ."
`` Wo n't Daisy 's hair stand erect with horror at Nan 's wild ways ? ''
"asked Mr. Bhaer , presently , when Teddy had swarmed up his waistcoat , and Rob up his back , for they always flew at their father the minute school was done ."
"`` At first , perhaps , but it will do Posy good ."
"She is getting prim and Bettyish , and needs stirring up a bit ."
"She always has a good time when Nan comes over to play , and the two will help each other without knowing it ."
"Dear me , half the science of teaching is knowing how much children do for one another , and when to mix them . ''"
`` I only hope she wo n't turn out another firebrand . ''
`` My poor Dan !
"I never can quite forgive myself for letting him go , '' sighed Mrs. Bhaer ."
"At the sound of the name , little Teddy , who had never forgotten his friend , struggled down from his father 's arms , and trotted to the door , looked out over the sunny lawn with a wistful face , and then trotted back again , saying , as he always did when disappointed of the longed-for sight , `` My Danny 's tummin ' soon . ''"
"`` I really think we ought to have kept him , if only for Teddy 's sake , he was so fond of him , and perhaps baby 's love would have done for him what we failed to do . ''"
"`` I 've sometimes felt that myself ; but after keeping the boys in a ferment , and nearly burning up the whole family , I thought it safer to remove the firebrand , for a time at least , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
"`` Dinner 's ready , let me ring the bell , '' and Rob began a solo upon that instrument which made it impossible to hear one 's self speak ."
"`` Then I may have Nan , may I ? ''"
asked Mrs. Jo .
"`` A dozen Nans if you want them , my dear , '' answered Mr. Bhaer , who had room in his fatherly heart for all the naughty neglected children in the world ."
"When Mrs. Bhaer returned from her drive that afternoon , before she could unpack the load of little boys , without whom she seldom moved , a small girl of ten skipped out at the back of the carry-all and ran into the house , shouting , `` Hi , Daisy !"
where are you ? ''
"Daisy came , and looked pleased to see her guest , but also a trifle alarmed , when Nan said , still prancing , as if it was impossible to keep still , `` I 'm going to stay here always , papa says I may , and my box is coming tomorrow , all my things had to be washed and mended , and your aunt came and carried me off ."
Is n't it great fun ? ''
"`` Why , yes ."
Did you bring your big doll ? ''
"asked Daisy , hoping she had , for on the last visit Nan had ravaged the baby house , and insisted on washing Blanche Matilda 's plaster face , which spoilt the poor dear 's complexion for ever ."
"`` Yes , she 's somewhere round , '' returned Nan , with most unmaternal carelessness ."
"`` I made you a ring coming along , and pulled the hairs out of Dobbin 's tail ."
Do n't you want it ? ''
"and Nan presented a horse-hair ring in token of friendship , as they had both vowed they would never speak to one another again when they last parted ."
"Won by the beauty of the offering , Daisy grew more cordial , and proposed retiring to the nursery , but Nan said , `` No , I want to see the boys , and the barn , '' and ran off , swinging her hat by one string till it broke , when she left it to its fate on the grass ."
`` Hullo !
Nan ! ''
"` It shall be done , ' answered the youth ; ` but you must give me two years to manage it , for my beard must grow so that he may not know me . '"
"` So be it , ' said the king ."
"And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take the road to the dragon 's house and on the way he met a beggar , whom he persuaded to change clothes with him , and in the beggar 's garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon ."
"He found his enemy before his house , very busy making a box , and addressed him politely , ` Good morning , your worship ."
Have you a morsel of bread ? '
"` You must wait , ' replied the dragon , 'till I have finished my box , and then I will see if I can find one . '"
` What will you do with the box when it is made ? '
inquired the beggar .
"` It is for the young man who killed my wife , and stole my flying horse and my bed covering , ' said the dragon ."
"` He deserves nothing better , ' answered the beggar , ` for it was an ill deed ."
"Still that box is too small for him , for he is a big man . '"
"` You are wrong , ' said the dragon ."
` The box is large enough even for me . '
"` Well , the rogue is nearly as tall as you , ' replied the beggar , ` and , of course , if you can get in , he can ."
But I am sure you would find it a tight fit . '
"` No , there is plenty of room , ' said the dragon , tucking himself carefully inside ."
"But no sooner was he well in , than the young man clapped on the lid and called out , ` Now press hard , just to see if he will be able to get out . '"
"The dragon pressed as hard as he could , but the lid never moved ."
"` It is all right , ' he cried ; ` now you can open it . '"
"But instead of opening it , the young man drove in long nails to make it tighter still ; then he took the box on his back and brought it to the king ."
"And when the king heard that the dragon was inside , he was so excited that he would not wait one moment , but broke the lock and lifted the lid just a little way to make sure he was really there ."
"He was very careful not to leave enough space for the dragon to jump out , but unluckily there was just room for his great mouth , and with one snap the king vanished down his wide red jaws ."
"Then the young man married the king 's daughter and ruled over the land , but what he did with the dragon nobody knows ."
The Goblin and the Grocer Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
"There was once a hard-working student who lived in an attic , and he had nothing in the world of his own ."
"There was also a hard-working grocer who lived on the first floor , and he had the whole house for his own ."
"The Goblin belonged to him , for every Christmas Eve there was waiting for him at the grocer 's a dish of jam with a large lump of butter in the middle ."
"The grocer could afford this , so the Goblin stayed in the grocer 's shop ; and this teaches us a good deal ."
"One evening the student came in by the back door to buy a candle and some cheese ; he had no one to send , so he came himself ."
"He got what he wanted , paid for it , and nodded a good evening to the grocer and his wife -LRB- she was a woman who could do more than nod ; she could talk -RRB- ."
"When the student had said good night he suddenly stood still , reading the sheet of paper in which the cheese had been wrapped ."
It was a leaf torn out of an old book -- a book of poetry ` There 's more of that over there ! '
"I turned my back , accordingly , upon the sea , and did not look again till I had counted many hundreds ."
The boat was still heading for the island .
"The next time I counted the full thousand , as slowly as I could , my heart beating so as to hurt me ."
And then it was out of all question .
She was coming straight to Earraid !
"I could no longer hold myself back , but ran to the seaside and out , from one rock to another , as far as I could go ."
"It is a marvel I was not drowned ; for when I was brought to a stand at last , my legs shook under me , and my mouth was so dry , I must wet it with the sea-water before I was able to shout ."
All this time the boat was coming on ; and now I was able to perceive it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday .
"This I knew by their hair , which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black ."
"But now there was a third man along with them , who looked to be of a better class ."
"As soon as they were come within easy speech , they let down their sail and lay quiet ."
"In spite of my supplications , they drew no nearer in , and what frightened me most of all , the new man tee-hee 'd with laughter as he talked and looked at me ."
"Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while , speaking fast and with many wavings of his hand ."
"I told him I had no Gaelic ; and at this he became very angry , and I began to suspect he thought he was talking English ."
"Listening very close , I caught the word `` whateffer '' several times ; but all the rest was Gaelic and might have been Greek and Hebrew for me ."
"`` Whatever , '' said I , to show him I had caught a word ."
"`` Yes , yes -- yes , yes , '' says he , and then he looked at the other men , as much as to say , `` I told you I spoke English , '' and began again as hard as ever in the Gaelic ."
"This time I picked out another word , `` tide . ''"
Then I had a flash of hope .
I remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the Ross .
`` Do you mean when the tide is out -- ? ''
"I cried , and could not finish ."
"`` Yes , yes , '' said he ."
`` Tide . ''
"At that I turned tail upon their boat -LRB- where my adviser had once more begun to tee-hee with laughter -RRB- , leaped back the way I had come , from one stone to another , and set off running across the isle as I had never run before ."
"In about half an hour I came out upon the shores of the creek ; and , sure enough , it was shrunk into a little trickle of water , through which I dashed , not above my knees , and landed with a shout on the main island ."
"A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid ; which is only what they call a tidal islet , and except in the bottom of the neaps , can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours , either dry-shod , or at the most by wading ."
"Even I , who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay , and even watched for the ebbs , the better to get my shellfish -- even I -LRB- I say -RRB- if I had sat down to think , instead of raging at my fate , must have soon guessed the secret , and got free ."
It was no wonder the fishers had not understood me .
"The wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion , and taken the trouble to come back ."
I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours .
"But for the fishers , I might have left my bones there , in pure folly ."
"`` It is easy to try that , '' says Alan ."
"Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his principal possession , and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose , and which is made of old whiskey , strained honey and sweet cream , slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion ."
"The two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel ; but down they sat , one upon each side of the peat fire , with a mighty show of politeness ."
"Maclaren pressed them to taste his mutton-ham and `` the wife 's brose , '' reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection ."
But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath .
"`` I would have ye to remark , sir , '' said Alan , `` that I havenae broken bread for near upon ten hours , which will be worse for the breath than any brose in Scotland . ''"
"`` I will take no advantages , Mr. Stewart , '' replied Robin ."
`` Eat and drink ; I 'll follow you . ''
"Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to Mrs. Maclaren ; and then after a great number of civilities , Robin took the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner ."
"`` Ay , ye can blow '' said Alan ; and taking the instrument from his rival , he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin 's ; and then wandered into variations , which , as he went on , he decorated with a perfect flight of grace-notes , such as pipers love , and call the `` warblers . ''"
"I had been pleased with Robin 's playing , Alan 's ravished me ."
"`` That 's no very bad , Mr. Stewart , '' said the rival , `` but ye show a poor device in your warblers . ''"
`` Me ! ''
"cried Alan , the blood starting to his face ."
`` I give ye the lie . ''
"`` Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes , then , '' said Robin , `` that ye seek to change them for the sword ? ''"
"`` And that 's very well said , Mr. Macgregor , '' returned Alan ; `` and in the meantime '' -LRB- laying a strong accent on the word -RRB- `` I take back the lie ."
I appeal to Duncan . ''
"`` Indeed , ye need appeal to naebody , '' said Robin ."
`` Ye 're a far better judge than any Maclaren in Balquhidder : for it 's a God 's truth that you 're a very creditable piper for a Stewart .
Hand me the pipes . ''
"Alan did as he asked ; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of Alan 's variations , which it seemed that he remembered perfectly ."
"`` Ay , ye have music , '' said Alan , gloomily ."
"`` And now be the judge yourself , Mr. Stewart , '' said Robin ; and taking up the variations from the beginning , he worked them throughout to so new a purpose , with such ingenuity and sentiment , and with so odd a fancy and so quick a knack in the grace-notes , that I was amazed to hear him ."
"As for Alan , his face grew dark and hot , and he sat and gnawed his fingers , like a man under some deep affront ."
`` Enough ! ''
he cried .
`` Ye can blow the pipes -- make the most of that . ''
And he made as if to rise .
"But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence , and struck into the slow measure of a pibroch ."
"It was a fine piece of music in itself , and nobly played ; but it seems , besides , it was a piece peculiar to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan ."
"The first notes were scarce out , before there came a change in his face ; when the time quickened , he seemed to grow restless in his seat ; and long before that piece was at an end , the last signs of his anger died from him , and he had no thought but for the music ."
"But she shook her head and I heard her telling mother later that , in her opinion , ` cooties ' and ` sarks ' were not proper subjects for young girls to talk about ."
"She was especially horrified when Jem wrote in his last letter to mother , ` Tell Susan I had a fine cootie hunt this morning and caught fifty-three ! '"
Susan positively turned pea-green .
"` Mrs. Dr. dear , ' she said , ` when I was young , if decent people were so unfortunate as to get -- those insects -- they kept it a secret if possible ."
"I do not want to be narrow-minded , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I still think it is better not to mention such things . '"
`` Miranda grew confidential over our vermin shirts and told me all her troubles .
She is desperately unhappy .
She is engaged to Joe Milgrave and Joe joined up in October and has been training in Charlottetown ever since .
Her father was furious when he joined and forbade Miranda ever to have any dealing or communication with him again .
"Poor Joe expects to go overseas any day and wants Miranda to marry him before he goes , which shows that there have been ` communications ' in spite of Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"Miranda wants to marry him but can not , and she declares it will break her heart . ''"
` Why do n't you run away and marry him ? '
I said .
It did n't go against my conscience in the least to give her such advice .
"Joe Milgrave is a splendid fellow and Mr. Pryor fairly beamed on him until the war broke out and I know Mr. Pryor would forgive Miranda very quickly , once it was over and he wanted his housekeeper back ."
But Miranda shook her silvery head dolefully . ''
` Joe wants me to but I ca n't .
"Mother 's last words to me , as she lay on her dying-bed , were , `` Never , never run away , Miranda , '' and I promised . '"
"`` Miranda 's mother died two years ago , and it seems , according to Miranda , that her mother and father actually ran away to be married themselves ."
To picture Whiskers-on-the-moon as the hero of an elopement is beyond my power .
But such was the case and Mrs. Pryor at least lived to repent it .
"She had a hard life of it with Mr. Pryor , and she thought it was a punishment on her for running away ."
"So she made Miranda promise she would never , for any reason whatever , do it ."
"`` Of course , you can not urge a girl to break a promise made to a dying mother , so I did not see what Miranda could do unless she got Joe to come to the house when her father was away and marry her there ."
But Miranda said that could n't be managed .
"Her father seemed to suspect she might be up to something of the sort and he never went away for long at a time , and , of course , Joe could n't get leave of absence at an hour 's notice . ''"
"` No , I shall just have to let Joe go , and he will be killed -- I know he will be killed -- and my heart will break , ' said Miranda , her tears running down and copiously bedewing the vermin shirts !"
`` I am not writing like this for lack of any real sympathy with poor Miranda .
"I 've just got into the habit of giving things a comical twist if I can , when I 'm writing to Jem and Walter and Ken , to make them laugh ."
I really felt sorry for Miranda who is as much in love with Joe as a china-blue girl can be with anyone and who is dreadfully ashamed of her father 's pro-German sentiments .
"I think she understood that I did , for she said she had wanted to tell me all about her worries because I had grown so sympathetic this past year ."
I wonder if I have .
"` We must rest here as best we can , ' spoke Covan to the cows ."
And they bowed their heads and lay down in the place where they stood .
"Then came the black raven of Corri-nan-creag , whose eyes never closed , and whose wings never tired ; and he fluttered before the face of Covan and told him that he knew of a cranny in the rock where there was food in plenty , and soft moss for a bed ."
"` Go with me thither , ' he said to Covan , ` and you shall lay aside three-thirds of your weariness , and depart in the morning refreshed , ' and Covan listened thankfully to his words , and at dawn he rose up to seek his cows ."
` Farewell ! '
cried the black raven .
"` You trusted me , and took all I had to offer in return for the food you once gave me ."
"So if in time to come you need a friend , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '"
"As before , the cows were standing in the spot where he had left them , ready to set out ."
"All that day they walked , on and on , and on , Covan son of Gorla walking behind them , till night fell while they were on the banks of a river ."
"` We can go no further , ' spake Covan to the cows ."
"And they began to eat the grass by the side of the stream , while Covan listened to them and longed for some supper also , for they had travelled far , and his limbs were weak under him ."
"Then there was a swish of water at his feet , and out peeped the head of the famous otter Doran-donn of the stream ."
"` Trust to me and I will find you warmth and shelter , ' said Doran-donn ; ` and for food fish in plenty . '"
"And Covan went with him thankfully , and ate and rested , and laid aside three-thirds of his weariness ."
"At sunrise he left his bed of dried sea-weed , which had floated up with the tide , and with a grateful heart bade farewell to Doran-donn ."
"` Because you trusted me and took what I had to offer , you have made me your friend , Covan , ' said Doran-donn ."
"` And if you should be in danger , and need help from one who can swim a river or dive beneath a wave , call to me and I will come to you . '"
"Then he plunged into the stream , and was seen no more ."
"The cows were standing ready in the place where Covan had left them , and they journeyed on all that day , till , when night fell , they reached the cottage ."
"Joyful indeed was the old man as the cows went into their stables , and he beheld the rich milk that flowed into the pail of the golden-haired maiden with the silver comb ."
"` You have done well indeed , ' he said to Covan son of Gorla ."
"` And now , what would you have as a reward ? ' '"
"I want nothing for myself , ' answered Covan the Brown-haired ; ` but I ask you to give me back my brothers and my sister who have been lost to us for three years past ."
"You are wise and know the lore of fairies and of witches ; tell me where I can find them , and what I must do to bring them to life again . '"
The old man looked grave at the words of Covan .
"` Yes , truly I know where they are , ' answered he , ` and I say not that they may not be brought to life again ."
But the perils are great -- too great for you to overcome . '
"` Tell me what they are , ' said Covan again , ` and I shall know better if I may overcome them . '"
"` Listen , then , and judge ."
"In the mountain yonder there dwells a roe , white of foot , with horns that branch like the antlers of a deer ."
On the lake that leads to the land of the Sun floats a duck whose body is green and whose neck is of gold .
Let 's have a go of the rum . ''
"`` Dick , '' said Silver , `` I trust you ."
"I 've a gauge on the keg , mind ."
There 's the key ; you fill a pannikin and bring it up . ''
"Terrified as I was , I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him ."
"Dick was gone but a little while , and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook 's ear ."
"It was but a word or two that I could catch , and yet I gathered some important news , for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose , this whole clause was audible : `` Not another man of them 'll jine . ''"
Hence there were still faithful men on board .
"When Dick returned , one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank -- one `` To luck , '' another with a `` Here 's to old Flint , '' and Silver himself saying , in a kind of song , `` Here 's to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prizes and plenty of duff . ''"
"Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel , and looking up , I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail ; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted , `` Land ho ! ''"
12 Council of War THERE was a great rush of feet across the deck .
"I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle , and slipping in an instant outside my barrel , I dived behind the fore-sail , made a double towards the stern , and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow ."
There all hands were already congregated .
A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon .
"Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills , about a couple of miles apart , and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill , whose peak was still buried in the fog ."
All three seemed sharp and conical in figure .
"So much I saw , almost in a dream , for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before ."
And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders .
The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east .
"`` And now , men , '' said the captain , when all was sheeted home , `` has any one of you ever seen that land ahead ? ''"
"`` I have , sir , '' said Silver ."
`` I 've watered there with a trader I was cook in . ''
"`` The anchorage is on the south , behind an islet , I fancy ? ''"
asked the captain .
"`` Yes , sir ; Skeleton Island they calls it ."
"It were a main place for pirates once , and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it ."
"That hill to the nor ` ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill ; there are three hills in a row running south ` ard -- fore , main , and mizzen , sir ."
"But the main -- that 's the big un , with the cloud on it -- they usually calls the Spy-glass , by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning , for it 's there they cleaned their ships , sir , asking your pardon . ''"
"`` I have a chart here , '' says Captain Smollett ."
`` See if that 's the place . ''
"Long John 's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart , but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment ."
"This was not the map we found in Billy Bones 's chest , but an accurate copy , complete in all things -- names and heights and soundings -- with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes ."
`` I knew it !
"Bring the child to me , and do n't fret ."
"I 'll see to him , and next time you do as I say , '' was the consoling welcome she received as the old lady popped up a sleepy but anxious face in a large flannel cap , and shook the bottle with the air of a general who had routed the foe before and meant to do it again ."
"Leaving her little responsibility in Miss Bat 's arms , Molly retired to wet her pillow with a few remorseful tears , and to fall asleep , wondering if real missionaries ever killed their pupils in the process of conversion ."
"So the girls all failed in the beginning ; but they did not give up , and succeeded better next time , as we shall see ."
Chapter IX .
"The Debating Club `` Look here , old man , we ought to have a meeting ."
"Holidays are over , and we must brace up and attend to business , '' said Frank to Gus , as they strolled out of the schoolyard one afternoon in January , apparently absorbed in conversation , but in reality waiting for a blue cloud and a scarlet feather to appear on the steps ."
`` All right .
"When , where , and what ? ''"
"asked Gus , who was a man of few words ."
"`` To-night , our house , subject , ` Shall girls go to college with us ? '"
"Mother said we had better be making up our minds , because every one is talking about it , and we shall have to be on one side or the other , so we may as well settle it now , '' answered Frank , for there was an impression among the members that all vexed questions would be much helped by the united eloquence and wisdom of the club ."
`` Very good ; I 'll pass the word and be there .
"Hullo , Neddy !"
"The D.C. meets to-night , at Minot 's , seven sharp ."
"Co-ed , & c. , '' added Gus , losing no time , as a third boy came briskly round the corner , with a little bag in his hand ."
`` I 'll come .
"Got home an hour earlier to-night , and thought I 'd look you up as I went by , '' responded Ed Devlin , as he took possession of the third post , with a glance toward the schoolhouse to see if a seal-skin cap , with a long , yellow braid depending therefrom , was anywhere in sight ."
"`` Very good of you , I 'm sure , '' said Gus , ironically , not a bit deceived by this polite attention ."
"`` The longest way round is sometimes the shortest way home , hey , Ed ? ''"
and Frank gave him a playful poke that nearly sent him off his perch .
"Then they all laughed at some joke of their own , and Gus added , `` No girls coming to hear us to-night ."
"Do n't think it , my son ."
"`` More 's the pity , '' and Ed shook his head regretfully over the downfall of his hopes ."
"`` Ca n't help it ; the other fellows say they spoil the fun , so we have to give in , sometimes , for the sake of peace and quietness ."
"Do n't mind having them a bit myself , '' said Frank , in such a tone of cheerful resignation that they laughed again , for the `` Triangle , '' as the three chums were called , always made merry music ."
`` We must have a game party next week .
"The girls like that , and so do I , '' candidly observed Gus , whose pleasant parlors were the scene of many such frolics ."
"`` And so do your sisters and your cousins and your aunts , '' hummed Ed , for Gus was often called Admiral because he really did possess three sisters , two cousins , and four aunts , besides mother and grandmother , all living in the big house together ."
"The boys promptly joined in the popular chorus , and other voices all about the yard took it up , for the `` Pinafore '' epidemic raged fearfully in Harmony Village that winter ."
`` How 's business ? ''
"Jims writhed in those big , firm , capable hands of Mary -- oh yes , she is capable all right -- and choked and wheezed -- and choked and wheezed -- and I felt that he was being tortured to death -- and then all at once , after what seemed to me an hour , though it really was n't long , he coughed up the membrane that was killing him ."
Mary turned him over and laid him back on his bed .
He was white as marble and the tears were pouring out of his brown eyes -- but that awful livid look was gone from his face and he could breathe quite easily . ''
` Was n't that some trick ? '
said Mary gaily . '
"I had n't any idea how it would work , but I just took a chance ."
"I 'll smoke his throat out again once or twice before morning , just to kill all the germs , but you 'll see he 'll be all right now . '"
"`` Jims went right to sleep -- real sleep , not coma , as I feared at first ."
"Mary ` smoked him , ' as she called it , twice through the night , and at daylight his throat was perfectly clear and his temperature was almost normal ."
When I made sure of that I turned and looked at Mary Vance .
She was sitting on the lounge laying down the law to Susan on some subject about which Susan must have known forty times as much as she did .
But I did n't mind how much law she laid down or how much she bragged .
"She had a right to brag -- she had dared to do what I would never have dared , and had saved Jims from a horrible death ."
It did n't matter any more that she had once chased me through the Glen with a codfish ; it did n't matter that she had smeared goose-grease all over my dream of romance the night of the lighthouse dance ; it did n't matter that she thought she knew more than anybody else and always rubbed it in -- I would never dislike Mary Vance again .
I went over to her and kissed her . ''
` What 's up now ? '
she said . ''
"` Nothing -- only I 'm so grateful to you , Mary . ' ''"
"` Well , I think you ought to be , that 's a fact ."
"You two would have let that baby die on your hands if I had n't happened along , ' said Mary , just beaming with complacency ."
"She got Susan and me a tip-top breakfast and made us eat it , and ` bossed the life out of us , ' as Susan says , for two days , until the roads were opened so that she could get home ."
"Jims was almost well by that time , and father turned up ."
He heard our tale without saying much .
Father is rather scornful generally about what he calls ` old wives ' remedies . '
"He laughed a little and said , ` After this , Mary Vance will expect me to call her in for consultation in all my serious cases . '"
"`` So Christmas was not so hard as I expected it to be ; and now the New Year is coming -- and we are still hoping for the ` Big Push ' that will end the war -- and Little Dog Monday is getting stiff and rheumatic from his cold vigils , but still he ` carries on , ' and Shirley continues to read the exploits of the aces ."
"Oh , nineteen-seventeen , what will you bring ? ''"
"CHAPTER XXV SHIRLEY GOES `` No , Woodrow , there will be no peace without victory , '' said Susan , sticking her knitting needle viciously through President Wilson 's name in the newspaper column ."
"`` We Canadians mean to have peace and victory , too ."
"You , if it pleases you , Woodrow , can have the peace without the victory '' -- and Susan stalked off to bed with the comfortable consciousness of having got the better of the argument with the President ."
But a few days later she rushed to Mrs. Blythe in red-hot excitement .
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , what do you think ?"
"He often played ships at the Round Pond , but his ship was only a hoop which he had found on the grass ."
"Of course , he had never seen a hoop , and he wondered what you play at with them , and decided that you play at pretending they are boats ."
"This hoop always sank at once , but he waded in for it , and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond , and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops ."
"Another time , when he found a child 's pail , he thought it was for sitting in , and he sat so hard in it that he could scarcely get out of it ."
Also he found a balloon .
"It was bobbing about on the Hump , quite as if it was having a game by itself , and he caught it after an exciting chase ."
"But he thought it was a ball , and Jenny Wren had told him that boys kick balls , so he kicked it ; and after that he could not find it anywhere ."
Perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator .
"It was under a lime-tree , near the entrance to the Fairy Queen 's Winter Palace -LRB- which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts -RRB- , and Peter approached it warily , for the birds had never mentioned such things to him ."
"Lest it was alive , he addressed it politely , and then , as it gave no answer , he went nearer and felt it cautiously ."
"He gave it a little push , and it ran from him , which made him think it must be alive after all ; but , as it had run from him , he was not afraid ."
"So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him , but this time it ran at him , and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat ."
"You must not think , however , that he was a coward , for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other , but the perambulator had gone , and he never saw another one ."
I have promised to tell you also about his paddle .
"It was a child 's spade which he had found near St. Govor 's Well , and he thought it was a paddle ."
Do you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes ?
"If so , I think it rather silly of you ."
"What I mean is that , of course , one must pity him now and then , but to pity him all the time would be impertinence ."
"He thought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens , and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it ."
"He played without ceasing , while you often waste time by being mad-dog or Mary-Annish ."
"He could be neither of these things , for he had never heard of them , but do you think he is to be pitied for that ?"
"Oh , he was merry ."
"He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your father ."
"Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment ."
Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?
That is how Peter leaps them .
And think of the music of his pipe .
"Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens , but it is really Peter 's pipe they hear ."
"Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?"
"You can be sorry for him for that , but do n't be too sorry , for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her ."
It was the fairies who gave him the chance .
"The Little House Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens , which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans ."
He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon .
"`` I should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more , '' he said wistfully to his sleeping mother ."
He quite argued with her as if she could hear him .
"`` It would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure , '' he said coaxingly ."
"`` I promise to come back , '' he said solemnly and meant it , too ."
"And in the end , you know , he flew away ."
"Twice he came back from the window , wanting to kiss his mother , but he feared the delight of it might waken her , so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe , and then he flew back to the Gardens ."
Many nights and even months passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish ; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long .
"One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say , not only to his particular friends , but to a hundred favourite spots ."
"Then he had his last sail , and his very last sail , and his last sail of all , and so on ."
"Again , a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour ; and another comfortable reason was that , after all , there was no hurry , for his mother would never weary of waiting for him ."
"This last reason displeased old Solomon , for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate ."
"Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work , such as `` Never put off laying to-day , because you can lay to-morrow , '' and `` In this world there are no second chances , '' and yet here was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it ."
"The birds pointed this out to each other , and fell into lazy habits ."
"But , mind you , though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother , he was quite decided to go back ."
The best proof of this was his caution with the fairies .
"They were most anxious that he should remain in the Gardens to play to them , and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as `` I wish the grass was not so wet , '' and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry , `` I do wish you would keep time ! ''"
Then they would have said that this was his second wish .
"But he smoked their design , and though on occasions he began , `` I wish -- '' he always stopped in time ."
"So when at last he said to them bravely , `` I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always , '' they had to tickle his shoulder and let him go ."
"He went in a hurry in the end because he had dreamt that his mother was crying , and he knew what was the great thing she cried for , and that a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile ."
"Oh , he felt sure of it , and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window , which was always to be open for him ."
"But the window was closed , and there were iron bars on it , and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy ."
"Peter called , `` Mother !"
mother ! ''
but she heard him not ; in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars .
"He had to fly back , sobbing , to the Gardens , and he never saw his dear again ."
What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her .
"Ah , Peter , we who have made the great mistake , how differently we should all act at the second chance ."
"But Solomon was right ; there is no second chance , not for most of us ."
When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time .

"Let him alone , and it will all come out soon enough , '' answered Frank , who laughed at his brother , but loved him none the less for the tender heart that often got the better of his young head ."
"But for once Frank was mistaken ; the mystery did not come out , and Jack worked like a beaver all that week , as orders poured in when Jill and Annette showed their elegant cards ; for , as everybody knows , if one girl has a new thing all the rest must , whether it is a bow on the top of her head , a peculiar sort of pencil , or the latest kind of chewing-gum ."
"Little play did the poor fellow get , for every spare minute was spent at the press , and no invitation could tempt him away , so much in earnest was our honest little Franklin about paying his debt ."
"Jill helped all she could , and cheered his labors with her encouragement , remembering how he stayed at home for her ."
"`` It is real good of you to lend a hand , and I 'm ever so much obliged , '' said Jack , as the last order was struck off , and the drawer of the type-box held a pile of shining five and ten cent pieces , with two or three quarters ."
"`` I love to ; only it would be nicer if I knew what we were working for , '' she said demurely , as she scattered type for the last time ; and seeing that Jack was both tired and grateful , hoped to get a hint of the secret ."
"`` I want to tell you , dreadfully ; but I ca n't , because I 've promised . ''"
"`` What , never ? ''"
`` Never ! ''
and Jack looked as firm as a rock .
"`` Then I shall find out , for I have n't promised . ''"
`` You ca n't . ''
`` See if I do n't ! ''
"`` You are sharp , but you wo n't guess this ."
"It 's a tremendous secret , and nobody will tell it . ''"
`` You 'll tell it yourself .
You always do . ''
`` I wo n't tell this .
It would be mean . ''
"`` Wait and see ; I can get anything out of you if I try ; '' and Jill laughed , knowing her power well , for Jack found it very hard to keep a secret from her ."
`` Do n't try ; please do n't !
"It would n't be right , and you do n't want to make me do a dishonorable thing for your sake , I know . ''"
"Jack looked so distressed that Jill promised not to make him tell , though she held herself free to find out in other ways , if she could ."
"Thus relieved , Jack trudged off to school on Friday with the two dollars and seventy-five cents jingling in his pocket , though the dear gold coin had to be sacrificed to make up the sum ."
"He did his lessons badly that day , was late at recess in the afternoon , and , as soon as school was over , departed in his rubber boots `` to take a walk , '' he said , though the roads were in a bad state with a spring thaw ."
"Nothing was seen of him till after tea-time , when he came limping in , very dirty and tired , but with a reposeful expression , which betrayed that a load was off his mind ."
"Frank was busy about his own affairs and paid little attention to him , but Jill was on tenter-hooks to know where he had been , yet dared not ask the question ."
`` Merry 's brother wants some cards .
He liked hers so much he wishes to make his lady-love a present .
"Here 's the name ; '' and Jill held up the order from Harry Grant , who was to be married in the autumn ."
`` Must wait till next week .
"I 'm too tired to do a thing to-night , and I hate the sight of that old press , '' answered Jack , laying himself down upon the rug as if every joint ached ."
"One by one all the kites went up , and floated far overhead like gay birds , balancing themselves on the fresh breeze that blew steadily over the hill ."
Such a merry time as they had !
"running and shouting , sending up the kites or pulling them down , watching their antics in the air , and feeling them tug at the string like live creatures trying to escape ."
"Nan was quite wild with the fun , Daisy thought the new play nearly as interesting as dolls , and little Bess was so fond of her `` boo tite , '' that she would only let it go on very short flights , preferring to hold it in her lap and look at the remarkable pictures painted on it by Tommy 's dashing brush ."
"Mrs. Jo enjoyed hers immensely , and it acted as if it knew who owned it , for it came tumbling down head first when least expected , caught on trees , nearly pitched into the river , and finally darted away to such a height that it looked a mere speck among the clouds ."
"By and by every one got tired , and fastening the kite-strings to trees and fences , all sat down to rest , except Mr. Bhaer , who went off to look at the cows , with Teddy on his shoulder ."
`` Did you ever have such a good time as this before ? ''
"asked Nat , as they lay about on the grass , nibbling pennyroyal like a flock of sheep ."
"`` Not since I last flew a kite , years ago , when I was a girl , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
"`` I 'd like to have known you when you were a girl , you must have been so jolly , '' said Nat ."
"`` I was a naughty little girl , I am sorry to say . ''"
"`` I like naughty little girls , '' observed Tommy , looking at Nan , who made a frightful grimace at him in return for the compliment ."
"`` Why do n't I remember you then , Aunty ?"
Was I too young ? ''
asked Demi .
"`` Rather , dear . ''"
`` I suppose my memory had n't come then .
"Grandpa says that different parts of the mind unfold as we grow up , and the memory part of my mind had n't unfolded when you were little , so I ca n't remember how you looked , '' explained Demi ."
"`` Now , little Socrates , you had better keep that question for grandpa , it is beyond me , '' said Aunt Jo , putting on the extinguisher ."
"`` Well , I will , he knows about those things , and you do n't , '' returned Demi , feeling that on the whole kites were better adapted to the comprehension of the present company ."
"`` Tell about the last time you flew a kite , '' said Nat , for Mrs. Jo had laughed as she spoke of it , and he thought it might be interesting ."
"`` Oh , it was only rather funny , for I was a great girl of fifteen , and was ashamed to be seen at such a play ."
"So Uncle Teddy and I privately made our kites , and stole away to fly them ."
"We had a capital time , and were resting as we are now , when suddenly we heard voices , and saw a party of young ladies and gentlemen coming back from a picnic ."
"Teddy did not mind , though he was rather a large boy to be playing with a kite , but I was in a great flurry , for I knew I should be sadly laughed at , and never hear the last of it , because my wild ways amused the neighbors as much as Nan 's do us . ''"
` What shall I do ? '
"I whispered to Teddy , as the voices drew nearer and nearer . ''"
"` I 'll show you , ' he said , and whipping out his knife he cut the strings ."
"Away flew the kites , and when the people came up we were picking flowers as properly as you please ."
"They never suspected us , and we had a grand laugh over our narrow escape . ''"
"`` Were the kites lost , Aunty ? ''"
asked Daisy .
"` It is behind the oven , ' answered she ."
And again was silence .
"` Mother , dear mother , ' said the young man at last , ' I am almost afraid to ask you ; but I really have grown so stupid of late ."
Where did I hide my own money ? '
"But at this question the old woman flew into a passion , and vowed that if she could find a rod she would bring his memory back to him ."
"Luckily , no rod was within her reach , and the Sodno managed , after a little , to coax her back into good humour , and at length she told him that the youngest Stalo had buried his treasure under the very place where she was sitting ."
"` Dear mother , ' said Lyman , who had come in unseen , and was kneeling in front of the fire ."
"` Dear mother , do you know who it is you have been talking with ? '"
"The old woman started , but answered quietly : ` It is a Sodno , I suppose ? '"
"` You have guessed right , ' replied Lyma ."
"The mother of the Stalos looked round for her iron cane , which she always used to kill her victims , but it was not there , for Lyma had put it in the fire ."
` Where is my iron cane ? '
asked the old woman .
` There ! '
"answered Lyma , pointing to the flames ."
"The old woman sprang forwards and seized it , but her clothes caught fire , and in a few minutes she was burned to ashes ."
"So the Sodno brothers found the treasure , and they carried it , and their sister and the reindeer , to their own home , and were the richest men in all Lapland ."
"Andras Baive -LSB- From Lapplandische Marchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-"
Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they were running races in the summer evenings .
"The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion , and thought that there was no one like him in the world , till , by-and-by , it came to their ears that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp , Andras Baive by name , who was said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff ."
"Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that , and declared that if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense , why , let them !"
"The winter was long and cold , and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive , when suddenly , on a frosty day , he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso ."
"The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength , and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour ."
"As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the shore , and his face shone with pleasure ."
"` That is the very thing , ' laughed he , ' I will make him jump over that boat . '"
"Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge , and they soon settled the terms of the wager ."
"He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner , and would get a large sum of money as the prize ."
"So , followed by many of the villagers , the two men walked down to the sea ."
"An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play , and to hold the stakes , and Andras , as the stranger was told to jump first ."
"Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place , he ran forward , with his head well thrown back , and cleared the boat with a mighty bound ."
"The lookers-on cheered him , and indeed he well deserve it ; but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do ."
"On he came , taller than Andras by several inches , but heavier of build ."
Dick exclaimed .
`` Small blame to him .
"Ye look liker maid than man ; and I tell you more -- y ' are a strange-looking rogue for a boy ; but for a hussy , Jack , ye would be right fair -- ye would ."
Ye would be well favoured for a wench . ''
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , `` ye know right well that I am none . ''"
"`` Nay , I know that ; I do but jest , '' said Dick ."
"`` Ye 'll be a man before your mother , Jack ."
"What cheer , my bully !"
Ye shall strike shrewd strokes .
"Now , which , I marvel , of you or me , shall be first knighted , Jack ?"
"for knighted I shall be , or die for ` t. ` Sir Richard Shelton , Knight ' : it soundeth bravely ."
But ` Sir John Matcham ' soundeth not amiss . ''
"`` Prithee , Dick , stop till I drink , '' said the other , pausing where a little clear spring welled out of the slope into a gravelled basin no bigger than a pocket ."
"`` And O , Dick , if I might come by anything to eat !"
-- my very heart aches with hunger . ''
"`` Why , fool , did ye not eat at Kettley ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` I had made a vow -- it was a sin I had been led into , '' stammered Matcham ; `` but now , if it were but dry bread , I would eat it greedily . ''"
"`` Sit ye , then , and eat , '' said Dick , `` while that I scout a little forward for the road . ''"
"And he took a wallet from his girdle , wherein were bread and pieces of dry bacon , and , while Matcham fell heartily to , struck farther forth among the trees ."
"A little beyond there was a dip in the ground , where a streamlet soaked among dead leaves ; and beyond that , again , the trees were better grown and stood wider , and oak and beech began to take the place of willow and elm ."
"The continued tossing and pouring of the wind among the leaves sufficiently concealed the sounds of his footsteps on the mast ; it was for the ear what a moonless night is to the eye ; but for all that Dick went cautiously , slipping from one big trunk to another , and looking sharply about him as he went ."
"Suddenly a doe passed like a shadow through the underwood in front of him , and he paused , disgusted at the chance ."
"This part of the wood had been certainly deserted , but now that the poor deer had run , she was like a messenger he should have sent before him to announce his coming ; and instead of pushing farther , he turned him to the nearest well-grown tree , and rapidly began to climb ."
Luck had served him well .
"The oak on which he had mounted was one of the tallest in that quarter of the wood , and easily out-topped its neighbours by a fathom and a half ; and when Dick had clambered into the topmost fork and clung there , swinging dizzily in the great wind , he saw behind him the whole fenny plain as far as Kettley , and the Till wandering among woody islets , and in front of him , the white line of high-road winding through the forest ."
The boat had been righted -- it was even now midway on the ferry .
"Beyond that there was no sign of man , nor aught moving but the wind ."
"He was about to descend , when , taking a last view , his eye lit upon a string of moving points about the middle of the fen ."
"Plainly a small troop was threading the causeway , and that at a good pace ; and this gave him some concern as he shinned vigorously down the trunk and returned across the wood for his companion ."
"CHAPTER IV -- A GREENWOOD COMPANY Matcham was well rested and revived ; and the two lads , winged by what Dick had seen , hurried through the remainder of the outwood , crossed the road in safety , and began to mount into the high ground of Tunstall Forest ."
"The trees grew more and more in groves , with heathy places in between , sandy , gorsy , and dotted with old yews ."
"Sharp as must have been his annoyance , Silver had the strength of mind to hide it ."
"`` Yes , sir , '' said he , `` this is the spot , to be sure , and very prettily drawed out ."
"Who might have done that , I wonder ?"
"The pirates were too ignorant , I reckon ."
"Aye , here it is : ` Capt. Kidd 's Anchorage ' -- just the name my shipmate called it ."
"There 's a strong current runs along the south , and then away nor ` ard up the west coast ."
"Right you was , sir , '' says he , `` to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island ."
"Leastways , if such was your intention as to enter and careen , and there ai n't no better place for that in these waters . ''"
"`` Thank you , my man , '' says Captain Smollett ."
`` I 'll ask you later on to give us a help .
You may go . ''
"I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island , and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself ."
"He did not know , to be sure , that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel , and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty , duplicity , and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm ."
"`` Ah , '' says he , `` this here is a sweet spot , this island -- a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on ."
"You 'll bathe , and you 'll climb trees , and you 'll hunt goats , you will ; and you 'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself ."
"Why , it makes me young again ."
"I was going to forget my timber leg , I was ."
"It 's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes , and you may lay to that ."
"When you want to go a bit of exploring , you just ask old John , and he 'll put up a snack for you to take along . ''"
"And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder , he hobbled off forward and went below ."
"Captain Smollett , the squire , and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck , and anxious as I was to tell them my story , I durst not interrupt them openly ."
"While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse , Dr. Livesey called me to his side ."
"He had left his pipe below , and being a slave to tobacco , had meant that I should fetch it ; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard , I broke immediately , `` Doctor , let me speak ."
"Get the captain and squire down to the cabin , and then make some pretence to send for me ."
I have terrible news . ''
"The doctor changed countenance a little , but next moment he was master of himself ."
"`` Thank you , Jim , '' said he quite loudly , `` that was all I wanted to know , '' as if he had asked me a question ."
And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two .
"They spoke together for a little , and though none of them started , or raised his voice , or so much as whistled , it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request , for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson , and all hands were piped on deck ."
"`` My lads , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I 've a word to say to you ."
This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for .
"Mr. Trelawney , being a very open-handed gentleman , as we all know , has just asked me a word or two , and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty , alow and aloft , as I never ask to see it done better , why , he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck , and you 'll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck ."
"Emil went to bed sick , and Dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week ."
"But the lawless lad had no thought of obeying , and soon transgressed again ."
"One Saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play , Tommy said , `` Let 's go down to the river , and cut a lot of new fish-poles . ''"
"`` Take Toby to drag them back , and one of us can ride him down , '' proposed Stuffy , who hated to walk ."
"`` That means you , I suppose ; well , hurry up , lazy-bones , '' said Dan ."
"Away they went , and having got the poles were about to go home , when Demi unluckily said to Tommy , who was on Toby with a long rod in his hand , `` You look like the picture of the man in the bull-fight , only you have n't got a red cloth , or pretty clothes on . ''"
"`` I 'd like to see one ; there 's old Buttercup in the big meadow , ride at her , Tom , and see her run , '' proposed Dan , bent on mischief ."
"`` No , you must n't , '' began Demi , who was learning to distrust Dan 's propositions ."
"`` Why not , little fuss-button ? ''"
demanded Dan .
`` I do n't think Uncle Fritz would like it . ''
`` Did he ever say we must not have a bull-fight ? ''
"`` No , I do n't think he ever did , '' admitted Demi ."
`` Then hold your tongue .
"Drive on , Tom , and here 's a red rag to flap at the old thing ."
"I 'll help you to stir her up , '' and over the wall went Dan , full of the new game , and the rest followed like a flock of sheep ; even Demi , who sat upon the bars , and watched the fun with interest ."
"Poor Buttercup was not in a very good mood , for she had been lately bereft of her calf , and mourned for the little thing most dismally ."
"Just now she regarded all mankind as her enemies -LRB- and I do not blame her -RRB- , so when the matadore came prancing towards her with the red handkerchief flying at the end of his long lance , she threw up her head , and gave a most appropriate `` Moo ! ''"
"Tommy rode gallantly at her , and Toby recognizing an old friend , was quite willing to approach ; but when the lance came down on her back with a loud whack , both cow and donkey were surprised and disgusted ."
"Toby back with a bray of remonstrance , and Buttercup lowered her horns angrily ."
"`` At her again , Tom ; she 's jolly cross , and will do it capitally ! ''"
"called Dan , coming up behind with another rod , while Jack and Ned followed his example ."
"Seeing herself thus beset , and treated with such disrespect , Buttercup trotted round the field , getting more and more bewildered and excited every moment , for whichever way she turned , there was a dreadful boy , yelling and brandishing a new and very disagreeable sort of whip ."
"It was great fun for them , but real misery for her , till she lost patience and turned the tables in the most unexpected manner ."
"All at once she wheeled short round , and charged full at her old friend Toby , whose conduct cut her to the heart ."
"Poor slow Toby backed so precipitately that he tripped over a stone , and down went horse , matadore , and all , in one ignominious heap , while distracted Buttercup took a surprising leap over the wall , and galloped wildly out of sight down the road ."
"`` Catch her , stop her , head her off !"
"run , boys , run ! ''"
"shouted Dan , tearing after her at his best pace , for she was Mr. Bhaer 's pet Alderney , and if anything happened to her , Dan feared it would be all over with him ."
Such a running and racing and bawling and puffing as there was before she was caught !
"The fish-poles were left behind ; Toby was trotted nearly off his legs in the chase ; and every boy was red , breathless , and scared ."
"They found poor Buttercup at last in a flower garden , where she had taken refuge , worn out with the long run ."
"We can count , I take it , on your own home servants , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
"`` As upon myself , '' declared the squire ."
"`` Three , '' reckoned the captain ; `` ourselves make seven , counting Hawkins here ."
"Now , about the honest hands ? ''"
"`` Most likely Trelawney 's own men , '' said the doctor ; `` those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver . ''"
"`` Nay , '' replied the squire ."
`` Hands was one of mine . ''
"`` I did think I could have trusted Hands , '' added the captain ."
`` And to think that they 're all Englishmen ! ''
broke out the squire .
"`` Sir , I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up . ''"
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' said the captain , `` the best that I can say is not much ."
"We must lay to , if you please , and keep a bright lookout ."
"It 's trying on a man , I know ."
It would be pleasanter to come to blows .
But there 's no help for it till we know our men .
"Lay to , and whistle for a wind , that 's my view . ''"
"`` Jim here , '' said the doctor , `` can help us more than anyone ."
"The men are not shy with him , and Jim is a noticing lad . ''"
"`` Hawkins , I put prodigious faith in you , '' added the squire ."
"I began to feel pretty desperate at this , for I felt altogether helpless ; and yet , by an odd train of circumstances , it was indeed through me that safety came ."
"In the meantime , talk as we pleased , there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely ; and out of these seven one was a boy , so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen ."
PART THREE -- My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed .
"Although the breeze had now utterly ceased , we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast ."
Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface .
"This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands , and by many tall trees of the pine family , out-topping the others -- some singly , some in clumps ; but the general colouring was uniform and sad ."
The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock .
"All were strangely shaped , and the Spy-glass , which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island , was likewise the strangest in configuration , running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on ."
The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell .
"The booms were tearing at the blocks , the rudder was banging to and fro , and the whole ship creaking , groaning , and jumping like a manufactory ."
"I had to cling tight to the backstay , and the world turned giddily before my eyes , for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on , this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so , above all in the morning , on an empty stomach ."
"Perhaps it was this -- perhaps it was the look of the island , with its grey , melancholy woods , and wild stone spires , and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach -- at least , although the sun shone bright and hot , and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us , and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea , my heart sank , as the saying is , into my boots ; and from the first look onward , I hated the very thought of Treasure Island ."
"Though I had lived by the shore all my life , I seemed never to have been near the sea till then ."
The smell of tar and salt was something new .
"I saw the most wonderful figureheads , that had all been far over the ocean ."
"I saw , besides , many old sailors , with rings in their ears , and whiskers curled in ringlets , and tarry pigtails , and their swaggering , clumsy sea-walk ; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted ."
"And I was going to sea myself , to sea in a schooner , with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen , to sea , bound for an unknown island , and to seek for buried treasure !"
"While I was still in this delightful dream , we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney , all dressed out like a sea-officer , in stout blue cloth , coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor 's walk ."
"`` Here you are , '' he cried , `` and the doctor came last night from London ."
Bravo !
The ship 's company complete ! ''
"`` Oh , sir , '' cried I , `` when do we sail ? ''"
`` Sail ! ''
says he .
`` We sail tomorrow ! ''
"8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver , at the sign of the Spy-glass , and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign ."
"I set off , overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen , and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales , for the dock was now at its busiest , until I found the tavern in question ."
It was a bright enough little place of entertainment .
The sign was newly painted ; the windows had neat red curtains ; the floor was cleanly sanded .
"There was a street on each side and an open door on both , which made the large , low room pretty clear to see in , in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke ."
"The customers were mostly seafaring men , and they talked so loudly that I hung at the door , almost afraid to enter ."
"As I was waiting , a man came out of a side room , and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John ."
"His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird ."
"He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling ."
"Indeed , he seemed in the most cheerful spirits , whistling as he moved about among the tables , with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests ."
"Now , to tell you the truth , from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney 's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow ."
But one look at the man before me was enough .
"I had seen the captain , and Black Dog , and the blind man , Pew , and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like -- a very different creature , according to me , from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord ."
"I plucked up courage at once , crossed the threshold , and walked right up to the man where he stood , propped on his crutch , talking to a customer ."
"`` Mr. Silver , sir ? ''"
"I asked , holding out the note ."
"`` Yes , my lad , '' said he ; `` such is my name , to be sure ."
And who may you be ? ''
"And then as he saw the squire 's letter , he seemed to me to give something almost like a start ."
Its name is Ben Alder .
"it is a wild , desert mountain full of hills and hollows , and if we can win to it before the morn , we may do yet . ''"
"`` But , Alan , '' cried I , `` that will take us across the very coming of the soldiers ! ''"
"`` I ken that fine , '' said he ; `` but if we are driven back on Appin , we are two dead men ."
"So now , David man , be brisk ! ''"
"With that he began to run forward on his hands and knees with an incredible quickness , as though it were his natural way of going ."
"All the time , too , he kept winding in and out in the lower parts of the moorland where we were the best concealed ."
"Some of these had been burned or at least scathed with fire ; and there rose in our faces -LRB- which were close to the ground -RRB- a blinding , choking dust as fine as smoke ."
"The water was long out ; and this posture of running on the hands and knees brings an overmastering weakness and weariness , so that the joints ache and the wrists faint under your weight ."
"Now and then , indeed , where was a big bush of heather , we lay awhile , and panted , and putting aside the leaves , looked back at the dragoons ."
"They had not spied us , for they held straight on ; a half-troop , I think , covering about two miles of ground , and beating it mighty thoroughly as they went ."
"I had awakened just in time ; a little later , and we must have fled in front of them , instead of escaping on one side ."
"Even as it was , the least misfortune might betray us ; and now and again , when a grouse rose out of the heather with a clap of wings , we lay as still as the dead and were afraid to breathe ."
"The aching and faintness of my body , the labouring of my heart , the soreness of my hands , and the smarting of my throat and eyes in the continual smoke of dust and ashes , had soon grown to be so unbearable that I would gladly have given up ."
Nothing but the fear of Alan lent me enough of a false kind of courage to continue .
"As for himself -LRB- and you are to bear in mind that he was cumbered with a great-coat -RRB- he had first turned crimson , but as time went on the redness began to be mingled with patches of white ; his breath cried and whistled as it came ; and his voice , when he whispered his observations in my ear during our halts , sounded like nothing human ."
"Yet he seemed in no way dashed in spirits , nor did he at all abate in his activity , so that I was driven to marvel at the man 's endurance ."
"At length , in the first gloaming of the night , we heard a trumpet sound , and looking back from among the heather , saw the troop beginning to collect ."
"A little after , they had built a fire and camped for the night , about the middle of the waste ."
At this I begged and besought that we might lie down and sleep .
`` There shall be no sleep the night ! ''
said Alan .
"`` From now on , these weary dragoons of yours will keep the crown of the muirland , and none will get out of Appin but winged fowls ."
"We got through in the nick of time , and shall we jeopard what we 've gained ?"
"Na , na , when the day comes , it shall find you and me in a fast place on Ben Alder . ''"
"`` Alan , '' I said , `` it 's not the want of will : it 's the strength that I want ."
"If I could , I would ; but as sure as I 'm alive I can not . ''"
"`` Very well , then , '' said Alan ."
`` I 'll carry ye . ''
"I looked to see if he were jesting ; but no , the little man was in dead earnest ; and the sight of so much resolution shamed me ."
`` Lead away ! ''
said I. `` I 'll follow . ''
"The country round was covered with forests , in which dwelt all kinds of wild beasts , and the young man and his companions used to spend whole days in hunting them , and he was the finest hunter of all the tribe ."
"One morning , when winter was coming on , the youth and his companions set off as usual to bring back some of the mountain goats and deer to be salted down , as he was afraid of a snow-storm ; and if the wind blew and the snow drifted the forest might be impassable for some weeks ."
"The old man and the wife , however , would not go out , but remained in the wigwam making bows and arrows ."
"It soon grew so cold in the forest that at last one of the men declared they could walk no more , unless they could manage to warm themselves ."
"` That is easily done , ' said the leader , giving a kick to a large tree ."
"Flames broke out in the trunk , and before it had burnt up they were as hot as if it had been summer ."
"Then they started off to the place where the goats and deer were to be found in the greatest numbers , and soon had killed as many as they wanted ."
"But the leader killed most , as he was the best shot ."
"` Now we must cut up the game and divide it , ' said he ; and so they did , each one taking his own share ; and , walking one behind the other , set out for the village ."
"But when they reached a great river the young man did not want the trouble of carrying his pack any further , and left it on the bank . '"
"I am going home another way , ' he told his companions ."
And taking another road he reached the village long before they did .
` Have you returned with empty hands ? '
"asked the old man , as his son opened the door ."
"` Have I ever done that , that you put me such a question ? '"
asked the youth .
"` No ; I have slain enough to feast us for many moons , but it was heavy , and I left the pack on the bank of the great river ."
"Give me the arrows , I will finish making them , and you can go to the river and bring home the pack ! '"
"So the old man rose and went , and strapped the meat on his shoulder ; but as he was crossing the ford the strap broke and the pack fell into the river ."
"He stooped to catch it , but it swirled past him ."
"He clutched again ; but in doing so he over-balanced himself and was hurried into some rapids , where he was knocked against some rocks , and he sank and was drowned , and his body was carried down the stream into smoother water when it rose to the surface again ."
"But by this time it had lost all likeness to a man , and was changed into a piece of wood ."
"The wood floated on , and the river got bigger and bigger and entered a new country ."
"There it was borne by the current close to the shore , and a woman who was down there washing her clothes caught it as it passed , and drew it out , saying to herself : ` What a nice smooth plank !"
I will use it as a table to put my food upon . '
And gathering up her clothes she took the plank with her into her hut .
"When her supper time came she stretched the board across two strings which hung from the roof , and set upon it the pot containing a stew that smelt very good ."
"The woman had been working hard all day and was very hungry , so she took her biggest spoon and plunged it into the pot ."
But what was her astonishment and disgust when both pot and food vanished instantly before her !
"` Oh , you horrid plank , you have brought me ill-luck ! '"
she cried .
And taking it up she flung it away from her .
"`` Consider , '' cried Mrs. Finch , `` that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned . ''"
"The thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this , but again he was perplexed ."
"`` Try another drink , '' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly ."
"Kate was her name , and all Kates are saucy ."
"Solomon did try another drink , and it inspired him ."
"`` If , '' said he , `` a finch 's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces , but a thrush 's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan 's back . ''"
How the thrushes applauded !
"Now they knew why they lined their nests with mud , and when Mrs. Finch called out , `` We do n't place our nests on the Serpentine , '' they did what they should have done at first : chased her from the meeting ."
After this it was most orderly .
"What they had been brought together to hear , said Solomon , was this : their young friend , Peter Pan , as they well knew , wanted very much to be able to cross to the Gardens , and he now proposed , with their help , to build a boat ."
"At this the thrushes began to fidget , which made Peter tremble for his scheme ."
Solomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous boats that humans use ; the proposed boat was to be simply a thrush 's nest large enough to hold Peter .
"But still , to Peter 's agony , the thrushes were sulky ."
"`` We are very busy people , '' they grumbled , `` and this would be a big job . ''"
"`` Quite so , '' said Solomon , `` and , of course , Peter would not allow you to work for nothing ."
"You must remember that he is now in comfortable circumstances , and he will pay you such wages as you have never been paid before ."
Peter Pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid sixpence a day . ''
"Then all the thrushes hopped for joy , and that very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat ."
All their ordinary business fell into arrears .
"It was the time of year when they should have been pairing , but not a thrush 's nest was built except this big one , and so Solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland ."
"The stout , rather greedy children , who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk , were all young thrushes once , and ladies often ask specially for them ."
What do you think Solomon did ?
He sent over to the housetops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes ' nests and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes !
"It was known afterward on the island as the Sparrows ' Year , and so , when you meet , as you doubtless sometimes do , grown-up people who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are , very likely they belong to that year ."
You ask them .
"Peter was a just master , and paid his work-people every evening ."
"They stood in rows on the branches , waiting politely while he cut the paper sixpences out of his bank-note , and presently he called the roll , and then each bird , as the names were mentioned , flew down and got sixpence ."
It must have been a fine sight .
"And at last , after months of labor , the boat was finished ."
"Oh , the deportment of Peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrush 's nest !"
"From the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its side , and often woke up to say sweet things to it , and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it ."
"He sleeps in his nest still , and has a fascinating way of curling round in it , for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten ."
You ca n't conceive the effect of it .
"Brownie held out her arms to the Duke and he flung himself into them , the Queen leapt into the arms of the Lord Chamberlain , and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen , for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything ."
"Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place , for if you leap into each other 's arms it is a fairy wedding ."
Of course a clergyman has to be present .
How the crowd cheered and leapt !
"Trumpets brayed , the moon came out , and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring ."
"Most gladsome sight of all , the Cupids plucked the hated fools ' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air ."
And then Maimie went and spoiled everything .
She could n't help it .
"She was crazy with delight over her little friend 's good fortune , so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy , `` Oh , Brownie , how splendid ! ''"
"Everybody stood still , the music ceased , the lights went out , and all in the time you may take to say `` Oh dear ! ''"
"An awful sense of her peril came upon Maimie , too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates , she heard the murmur of an angry multitude , she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood , and she uttered a cry of terror and fled ."
How she ran !
and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head .
"Many times she lay down , and then quickly jumped up and ran on again ."
Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the Gardens .
"The one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run , and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep ."
She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night .
"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket , and tried to pull it over her head ."
And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept .
But it was the fairies .
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her .
When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as `` Slay her ! ''
`` Turn her into something extremely unpleasant ! ''
"and so on , but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front , and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon ."
"Every bride has a right to a boon , and what she asked for was Maimie 's life ."
"`` Anything except that , '' replied Queen Mab sternly , and all the fairies chanted `` Anything except that . ''"
"But when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown , they gave three huzzas for the little human , and set off , like an army , to thank her , the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it ."
They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow .
"But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs , it seemed impossible to thank Maimie , for they could not waken her ."
"They went through the form of thanking her , that is to say , the new King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome , but she heard not a word of it ."
"They also cleared the snow off her , but soon she was covered again , and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold ."
"In the first place , Miranda , in spite of her dress and veil , was such a flat-faced , commonplace , uninteresting little bride ."
"In the second place , Joe cried bitterly all through the ceremony , and this vexed Miranda unreasonably ."
"Long afterwards she told Rilla , `` I just felt like saying to him then and there , ` If you feel so bad over having to marry me you do n't have to . '"
But it was just because he was thinking all the time of how soon he would have to leave me . ''
"In the third place , Jims , who was usually so well-behaved in public , took a fit of shyness and contrariness combined and began to cry at the top of his voice for `` Willa . ''"
"Nobody wanted to take him out , because everybody wanted to see the marriage , so Rilla who was a bridesmaid , had to take him and hold him during the ceremony ."
"In the fourth place , Sir Wilfrid Laurier took a fit ."
Sir Wilfrid was entrenched in a corner of the room behind Miranda 's piano .
"During his seizure he made the weirdest , most unearthly noises ."
"He would begin with a series of choking , spasmodic sounds , continuing into a gruesome gurgle , and ending up with a strangled howl ."
"Nobody could hear a word Mr. Meredith was saying , except now and then , when Sir Wilfrid stopped for breath ."
"Nobody looked at the bride except Susan , who never dragged her fascinated eyes from Miranda 's face -- all the others were gazing at the dog ."
Miranda had been trembling with nervousness but as soon as Sir Wilfrid began his performance she forgot it .
All that she could think of was that her dear dog was dying and she could not go to him .
She never remembered a word of the ceremony .
"Rilla , who in spite of Jims , had been trying her best to look rapt and romantic , as beseemed a war bridesmaid , gave up the hopeless attempt , and devoted her energies to choking down untimely merriment ."
"She dared not look at anybody in the room , especially Mrs. Dead Angus , for fear all her suppressed mirth should suddenly explode in a most un-young-ladylike yell of laughter ."
"But married they were , and then they had a wedding-supper in the dining-room which was so lavish and bountiful that you would have thought it was the product of a month 's labour ."
Everybody had brought something .
"Mrs. Dead Angus had brought a large apple-pie , which she placed on a chair in the dining-room and then absently sat down on it ."
"Neither her temper nor her black silk wedding garment was improved thereby , but the pie was never missed at the gay bridal feast ."
Mrs. Dead Angus eventually took it home with her again .
"Whiskers-on-the-moon 's pacifist pig should not get it , anyhow ."
"That evening Mr. and Mrs. Joe , accompanied by the recovered Sir Wilfrid , departed for the Four Winds Lighthouse , which was kept by Joe 's uncle and in which they meant to spend their brief honeymoon ."
"Una Meredith and Rilla and Susan washed the dishes , tidied up , left a cold supper and Miranda 's pitiful little note on the table for Mr. Pryor , and walked home , while the mystic veil of dreamy , haunted winter twilight wrapped itself over the Glen ."
"`` I would really not have minded being a war-bride myself , '' remarked Susan sentimentally ."
But Rilla felt rather flat -- perhaps as a reaction to all the excitement and rush of the past thirty-six hours .
"She was disappointed somehow -- the whole affair had been so ludicrous , and Miranda and Joe so lachrymose and commonplace ."
"`` If Miranda had n't given that wretched dog such an enormous dinner he would n't have had that fit , '' she said crossly ."
"`` I warned her -- but she said she could n't starve the poor dog -- he would soon be all she had left , etc. ."
I could have shaken her . ''
"`` The best man was more excited than Joe was , '' said Susan ."
"As soon as he saw this proclamation the boy called his sister , and they hastened to the palace ."
"The bird was buttoned inside his tunic , but , as might have been expected , the courtiers barred the way , and told the child that he could not enter ."
"It was in vain that the boy declared that he was only obeying the king 's commands ; the courtiers only replied that his majesty was not yet out of bed , and it was forbidden to wake him ."
"They were still talking , when , suddenly , the bird settled the question by flying upwards through an open window into the king 's own room ."
"Alighting on the pillow , close to the king 's head , she bowed respectfully , and said : ` My lord , I am the Bird of Truth whom you wished to see , and I have been obliged to approach you in the manner because the boy who brought me is kept out of the palace by your courtiers . '"
"` They shall pay for their insolence , ' said the king ."
"And he instantly ordered one of his attendants to conduct the boy at once to his apartments ; and in a moment more the prince entered , holding his sister by the hand ."
` Who are you ? '
asked the king ; ` and what has the Bird of Truth to do with you ? '
"` If it please your majesty , the Bird of Truth will explain that herself , ' answered the boy ."
And the bird did explain ; and the king heard for the first time of the wicked plot that had been successful for so many years .
"He took his children in his arms , with tears in his eyes , and hurried off with them to the tower in the mountains where the queen was shut up ."
"The poor woman was as white as marble , for she had been living almost in darkness ; but when she saw her husband and children , the colour came back to her face , and she was as beautiful as ever ."
"They all returned in state to the city , where great rejoicings were held ."
"The wicked courtiers had their heads cut off , and all their property was taken away ."
"As for the good old couple , they were given riches and honour , and were loved and cherished to the end of their lives ."
"The Mink and the Wolf -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-"
In a big forest in the north of America lived a quantity of wild animals of all sorts .
"They were always very polite when they met ; but , in spite of that , they kept a close watch one upon the other , as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else ."
But their manners were so good that no one would ever had guessed that .
"One day a smart young wolf went out to hunt , promising his grandfather and grandmother that he would be sure to be back before bedtime ."
"He trotted along quite happily through the forest till he came to a favourite place of his , just where the river runs into the sea ."
"There , just as he had hoped , he saw the chief mink fishing in a canoe . '"
"I want to fish too , ' cried the wolf ."
But the mink said nothing and pretended not to hear . '
I wish you would take me into your boat ! '
"shouted the wolf , louder than before , and he continued to beseech the mink so long that at last he grew tired of it , and paddled to the shore close enough for the wolf to jump in ."
"` Sit down quietly at that end or we shall be upset , ' said the mink ; ` and if you care about sea-urchins ' eggs , you will find plenty in that basket ."
"But be sure you eat only the white ones , for the red ones would kill you . '"
"So the wolf , who was always hungry , began to eat the eggs greedily ; and when he had finished he told the mink he thought he would have a nap ."
"` Well , then , stretch yourself out , and rest your head on that piece of wood , ' said the mink ."
"And the wolf did as he was bid , and was soon fast asleep ."
"The land is still far distant , and without my help you would never get there ."
"Climb on my back , and I will take you where you will . '"
"Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice , and thankfully accepted his friend 's help ."
"But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell , when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once , but go under the sea , and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there ."
"Uraschimataro agreed willingly , and in another moment they were deep , deep down , with fathoms of blue water above their heads ."
"Oh , how quickly they darted through the still , warm sea !"
"The young man held tight , and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel , but for three days they rushed on , till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace , shining with gold and silver , crystal and precious stones , and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls ."
"But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside , he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within , which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales ."
` Where have you brought me ? '
he asked his guide in a low voice .
"` To the palace of Ringu , the house of the sea god , whose subjects we all are , ' answered the turtle . '"
"I am the first waiting maid of his daughter , the lovely princess Otohime , whom you will shortly see . '"
"Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him , that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next ."
"But the turtle , who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him , went at once to make known his arrival ."
"And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him , and she begged him to stay with her , and in return promised that he should never grow old , neither should his beauty fade ."
` Is not that reward enough ? '
"she asked , smiling , looking all the while as fair as the sun itself ."
"And Uraschimataro said ` Yes , ' and so he stayed there ."
For how long ?
That he only knew later .
"His life passed by , and each hour seemed happier than the last , when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents ."
"He fought against it hard , knowing how it would grieve the princess , but it grew on him stronger and stronger , till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong ."
"Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home , and that he must see his parents once more ."
"The princess was almost frozen with horror , and implored him to stay with her , or something dreadful would be sure to happen ."
"` You will never come back , and we shall meet again no more , ' she moaned bitterly ."
"But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated , ` Only this once will I leave you , and then will I return to your side for ever . '"
"Sadly the princess shook her head , but she answered slowly , ` One way there is to bring you safely back , but I fear you will never agree to the conditions of the bargain . ' '"
"I will do anything that will bring me back to you , ' exclaimed Uraschimataro , looking at her tenderly , but the princess was silent : she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more ."
"Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box , and gave it to Uraschimataro , praying him to keep it carefully , and above all things never to open it ."
"` If you can do this , ' she said as she bade him farewell , ` your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore , and will carry you back to me . '"
"Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart , and swore solemnly to do her bidding ."
"He hid the box safely in his garments , seated himself on the back of the turtle , and vanished in the ocean path , waving his hand to the princess ."
"It certainly was a pleasant place , airy , clean , and bright ."
"A hop-vine shook its green bells round the open window , the pretty aquarium stood in the middle of the room , with some delicate water plants rising above the water , and gold-fish showing their brightness as they floated to and fro below ."
On either side of the window were rows of shelves ready to receive the curiosities yet to be found .
"Dan 's tall cabinet stood before the great door which was fastened up , while the small door was to be used ."
"On the cabinet stood a queer Indian idol , very ugly , but very interesting ; old Mr. Laurence sent it , as well as a fine Chinese junk in full sail , which had a conspicuous place on the long table in the middle of the room ."
"Above , swinging in a loop , and looking as if she was alive , hung Polly , who died at an advanced age , had been carefully stuffed , and was no presented by Mrs. Jo ."
The walls were decorated with all sorts of things .
"A snake 's skin , a big wasp 's nest , a birch-bark canoe , a string of birds ' eggs , wreaths of gray moss from the South , and a bunch of cotton-pods ."
"The dead bats had a place , also a large turtle-shell , and an ostrich-egg proudly presented by Demi , who volunteered to explain these rare curiosities to guests whenever they liked ."
"There were so many stones that it was impossible to accept them all , so only a few of the best were arranged among the shells on the shelves , the rest were piled up in corners , to be examined by Dan at his leisure ."
"Every one was eager to give something , even Silas , who sent home for a stuffed wild-cat killed in his youth ."
"It was rather moth-eaten and shabby , but on a high bracket and best side foremost the effect was fine , for the yellow glass eyes glared , and the mouth snarled so naturally , that Teddy shook in his little shoes at sight of it , when he came bringing his most cherished treasure , one cocoon , to lay upon the shrine of science ."
`` Is n't it beautiful ?
I 'd no idea we had so many curious things .
I gave that ; do n't it look well ?
We might make a lot by charging something for letting folks see it . ''
Jack added that last suggestion to the general chatter that went on as the family viewed the room .
"`` This is a free museum and if there is any speculating on it I 'll paint out the name over the door , '' said Mr. Laurie , turning so quickly that Jack wished he had held his tongue ."
`` Hear !
hear ! ''
cried Mr. Bhaer .
`` Speech !
speech ! ''
added Mrs. Jo .
"`` Ca n't , I 'm too bashful ."
"You give them a lecture yourself you are used to it , '' Mr. Laurie answered , retreating towards the window , meaning to escape ."
"But she held him fast , and said , laughing as she looked at the dozen pairs of dirty hands about her , `` If I did lecture , it would on the chemical and cleansing properties of soap ."
"Come now , as the founder of the institution , you really ought to give us a few moral remarks , and we will applaud tremendously . ''"
"Seeing that there was no way of escaping , Mr. Laurie looked up at Polly hanging overhead , seemed to find inspiration in the brilliant old bird , and sitting down upon the table , said , in his pleasant way , `` There is one thing I 'd like to suggest , boys , and that is , I want you to get some good as well as much pleasure out of this ."
"Just putting curious or pretty things here wo n't do it ; so suppose you read up about them , so that when anybody asks questions you can answer them , and understand the matter ."
"I used to like these things myself , and should enjoy hearing about them now , for I 've forgotten all I once knew ."
"It was n't much , was it , Jo ?"
Hook -RSB- .
Instant obedience was the only safe thing .
Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings .
"The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy 's suspicions , but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready , which , against her will , she was making for him out of some of Hook 's wickedest garments ."
"It was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook 's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched , all but for the forefinger , which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook ."
"Instead of watching the ship , however , we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago ."
It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time ; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us .
"If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her , she would probably have cried , `` Do n't be silly ; what do I matter ?"
Do go back and keep an eye on the children . ''
So long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them ; and they may lay to -LSB- bet on -RSB- that .
Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home ; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening .
We are no more than servants .
"Why on earth should their beds be properly aired , seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry ?"
Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end in the country ?
It would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them ; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us .
"One thing I should like to do immensely , and that is to tell her , in the way authors have , that the children are coming back , that indeed they will be here on Thursday week ."
This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward .
"They have been planning it out on the ship : mother 's rapture , father 's shout of joy , Nana 's leap through the air to embrace them first , when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding ."
"How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance ; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth , and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly , `` Dash it all , here are those boys again . ''"
"However , we should get no thanks even for this ."
"We are beginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time , and may be sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure ."
"`` But , my dear madam , it is ten days till Thursday week ; so that by telling you what 's what , we can save you ten days of unhappiness . ''"
"`` Yes , but at what a cost !"
By depriving the children of ten minutes of delight . ''
"`` Oh , if you look at it in that way ! ''"
`` What other way is there in which to look at it ? ''
"You see , the woman had no proper spirit ."
"I had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about her ; but I despise her , and not one of them will I say now ."
"She does not really need to be told to have things ready , for they are ready ."
"All the beds are aired , and she never leaves the house , and observe , the window is open ."
"For all the use we are to her , we might well go back to the ship ."
"However , as we are here we may as well stay and look on ."
"It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins , but we were alarmed for his safety ."
"With the men in the temper they were in , it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again ."
We ran on deck .
"The pitch was bubbling in the seams ; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick ; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery , it was in that abominable anchorage ."
"The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each , hard by where the river runs in ."
One of them was whistling `` Lillibullero . ''
"Waiting was a strain , and it was decided that Hunter and I should go ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information ."
"The gigs had leaned to their right , but Hunter and I pulled straight in , in the direction of the stockade upon the chart ."
"The two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance ; `` Lillibullero '' stopped off , and I could see the pair discussing what they ought to do ."
"Had they gone and told Silver , all might have turned out differently ; but they had their orders , I suppose , and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to `` Lillibullero . ''"
"There was a slight bend in the coast , and I steered so as to put it between us ; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs ."
"I jumped out and came as near running as I durst , with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness ' sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety ."
I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade .
This was how it was : a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll .
"Well , on the knoll , and enclosing the spring , they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side ."
"All round this they had cleared a wide space , and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high , without door or opening , too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers ."
The people in the log-house had them in every way ; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges .
"All they wanted was a good watch and food ; for , short of a complete surprise , they might have held the place against a regiment ."
What particularly took my fancy was the spring .
"For though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA , with plenty of arms and ammunition , and things to eat , and excellent wines , there had been one thing overlooked -- we had no water ."
I was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death .
"I was not new to violent death -- I have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland , and got a wound myself at Fontenoy -- but I know my pulse went dot and carry one ."
"`` Jim Hawkins is gone , '' was my first thought ."
"It is something to have been an old soldier , but more still to have been a doctor ."
There is no time to dilly-dally in our work .
"And so now I made up my mind instantly , and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly-boat ."
By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar .
"We made the water fly , and the boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner ."
"I found them all shaken , as was natural ."
"The squire was sitting down , as white as a sheet , thinking of the harm he had led us to , the good soul !"
And one of the six forecastle hands was little better .
"`` There 's a man , '' says Captain Smollett , nodding towards him , `` new to this work ."
"` Oh , heaven , help me ! '"
cried he .
` Cross !
cross ! '
answered a voice .
"The boy leapt for joy as he recognised the note of the owl of which the swallow had spoken , and he said softly in the bird 's language : ` Oh , wise owl , I pray you to protect and guide me , for I have come in search of the Bird of Truth ."
And first I must fill this far with the many-coloured water in the courtyard of the castle . '
"` Do not do that , ' answered the owl , ` but fill the jar from the spring which bubbles close by the fountain with the many-coloured water ."
"Afterwards , go into the aviary opposite the great door , but be careful not to touch any of the bright-plumaged birds contained in it , which will cry to you , each one , that he is the Bird of Truth ."
"Choose only a small white bird that is hidden in a corner , which the others try incessantly to kill , not knowing that it can not die ."
"And , be quick !"
"-- for at this very moment the giant has fallen asleep , and you have only a quarter of an hour to do everything . '"
"The boy ran as fast as he could and entered the courtyard , where he saw the two spring close together ."
"He passed by the many-coloured water without casting a glance at it , and filled the jar from the fountain whose water was clear and pure ."
"He next hastened to the aviary , and was almost deafened by the clamour that rose as he shut the door behind him ."
"Voices of peacocks , voices of ravens , voices of magpies , each claiming to be the Bird of Truth ."
"With steadfast face the boy walked by them all , to the corner , where , hemmed in by a hand of fierce crows , was the small white bird he sought ."
"Putting her safely in his breast , he passed out , followed by the screams of the birds of Bad Faith which he left behind him ."
"Once outside , he ran without stopping to the witch 's tower , and handed to the old woman the jar she had given him ."
` Become a parrot ! '
"cried she , flinging the water over him ."
"But instead of losing his shape , as so many had done before , he only grew ten times handsomer ; for the water was enchanted for good and not ill ."
"Then the creeping multitude around the witch hastened to roll themselves in the water , and stood up , human beings again ."
"When the witch saw what was happening , she took a broomstick and flew away ."
"Who can guess the delight of the sister at the sight of her brother , bearing the Bird of Truth ?"
"But although the boy had accomplished much , something very difficult yet remained , and that was how to carry the Bird of Truth to the king without her being seized by the wicked courtiers , who would be ruined by the discovery of their plot ."
"Soon -- no one knew how -- the news spread abroad that the Bird of Truth was hovering round the palace , and the courtiers made all sorts of preparations to hinder her reaching the king ."
"They got ready weapons that were sharpened , and weapons that were poisoned ; they sent for eagles and falcons to hunt her down , and constructed cages and boxes in which to shut her up if they were not able to kill her ."
They declared that her white plumage was really put on to hide her black feathers -- in fact there was nothing they did not do in order to prevent the king from seeing the bird or from paying attention to her words if he did .
"As often happens in these cases , the courtiers brought about that which they feared ."
"They talked so much about the Bird of Truth that at last the king heard of it , and expressed a wish to see her ."
"The more difficulties that were put in his way the stronger grew his desire , and in the end the king published a proclamation that whoever found the Bird of Truth should bring her to him without delay ."
"There was no way , think , plan , worry as she might ."
And if she could not !
"Marcella remembered Patty 's face and the doctor 's look , and her heart sank like lead ."
"Patty was growing weaker every day instead of stronger , and the weather was getting hotter ."
"Oh , if Patty were to -- to -- but Marcella could not complete the sentence even in thought ."
If they were not so desperately poor !
Marcella 's bitterness overflowed her soul at the thought .
Everywhere around her were evidences of wealth -- wealth often lavishly and foolishly spent -- and she could not get money enough anywhere to save her sister 's life !
"She almost felt that she hated all those smiling , well-dressed people who thronged the streets ."
"By the time she reached the store , poor Marcella 's heart was seething with misery and resentment ."
"Three years before , when Marcella had been sixteen and Patty nine , their parents had died , leaving them absolutely alone in the world except for their father 's half-sister , Miss Gibson , who lived in Canning and earned her livelihood washing and mending for the hands employed in the big factory nearby ."
"She had grudgingly offered the girls a home , which Marcella had accepted because she must ."
"She obtained a position in one of the Canning stores at three dollars a week , out of which she contrived to dress herself and Patty and send the latter to school ."
"Her life for three years was one of absolute drudgery , yet until now she had never lost courage , but had struggled bravely on , hoping for better times in the future when she should get promotion and Patty would be old enough to teach school ."
But now Marcella 's courage and hopefulness had gone out like a spent candle .
"She was late at the store , and that meant a fine ; her head ached , and her feet felt like lead as she climbed the stairs to her department -- a hot , dark , stuffy corner behind the shirtwaist counter ."
"It was warm and close at any time , but today it was stifling , and there was already a crowd of customers , for it was the day of a bargain sale ."
The heat and noise and chatter got on Marcella 's tortured nerves .
"She felt that she wanted to scream , but instead she turned calmly to a waiting customer -- a big , handsome , richly dressed woman ."
Marcella noted with an ever-increasing bitterness that the woman wore a lace collar the price of which would have kept Patty in the country for a year .
She was Mrs. Liddell -- Marcella knew her by sight -- and she was in a very bad temper because she had been kept waiting .
For the next half hour she badgered and worried Marcella to the point of distraction .
Nothing suited her .
"Pile after pile , box after box , of shirtwaists did Marcella take down for her , only to have them flung aside with sarcastic remarks ."
Mrs. Liddell seemed to hold Marcella responsible for the lack of waists that suited her ; her tongue grew sharper and sharper and her comments more trying .
"Then she mislaid her purse , and was disagreeable about that until it turned up ."
Marcella shut her lips so tightly that they turned white to keep back the impatient retort that rose momentarily to her lips .
"The insolence of some customers was always trying to the sensitive , high-spirited girl , but today it seemed unbearable ."
"Her head throbbed fiercely with the pain of the ever-increasing ache , and -- what was the lady on her right saying to a friend ?"
"`` Yes , she had typhoid , you know -- a very bad form ."
"She rallied from it , but she was so exhausted that she could n't really recover , and the doctor said -- '' `` Really , '' interrupted Mrs. Liddell 's sharp voice , `` may I ask you to attend to me , if you please ?"
"No doubt gossip may be very interesting to you , but I am accustomed to having a clerk pay some small attention to my requirements ."
"O , our Crookback is a bold blade and a good warrior ; but , whether in cold blood or in hot , he will have all things done exact to his commandment ."
"If any fail or hinder , they shall die the death . ''"
"`` Now , by the saints ! ''"
"cried Richard , `` is this so ?"
And will men follow such a leader ? ''
"`` Nay , they follow him gleefully , '' replied the other ; `` for if he be exact to punish , he is most open-handed to reward ."
"And if he spare not the blood and sweat of others , he is ever liberal of his own , still in the first front of battle , still the last to sleep ."
"He will go far , will Crookback Dick o ' Gloucester ! ''"
"The young knight , if he had before been brave and vigilant , was now all the more inclined to watchfulness and courage ."
"His sudden favour , he began to perceive , had brought perils in its train ."
"And he turned from the archer , and once more scanned anxiously the market-place ."
It lay empty as before .
"`` I like not this quietude , '' he said ."
`` Doubtless they prepare us some surprise . ''
"And , as if in answer to his remark , the archers began once more to advance against the barricade , and the arrows to fall thick ."
But there was something hesitating in the attack .
"They came not on roundly , but seemed rather to await a further signal ."
"Dick looked uneasily about him , spying for a hidden danger ."
"And sure enough , about half way up the little street , a door was suddenly opened from within , and the house continued , for some seconds , and both by door and window , to disgorge a torrent of Lancastrian archers ."
"These , as they leaped down , hurriedly stood to their ranks , bent their bows , and proceeded to pour upon Dick 's rear a flight of arrows ."
"At the same time , the assailants in the market-place redoubled their shot , and began to close in stoutly upon the barricade ."
"Dick called down his whole command out of the houses , and facing them both ways , and encouraging their valour both by word and gesture , returned as best he could the double shower of shafts that fell about his post ."
"Meanwhile house after house was opened in the street , and the Lancastrians continued to pour out of the doors and leap down from the windows , shouting victory , until the number of enemies upon Dick 's rear was almost equal to the number in his face ."
"It was plain that he could hold the post no longer ; what was worse , even if he could have held it , it had now become useless ; and the whole Yorkist army lay in a posture of helplessness upon the brink of a complete disaster ."
"The men behind him formed the vital flaw in the general defence ; and it was upon these that Dick turned , charging at the head of his men ."
"So vigorous was the attack , that the Lancastrian archers gave ground and staggered , and , at last , breaking their ranks , began to crowd back into the houses from which they had so recently and so vaingloriously sallied ."
"Meanwhile the men from the market-place had swarmed across the undefended barricade , and fell on hotly upon the other side ; and Dick must once again face about , and proceed to drive them back ."
"Once again the spirit of his men prevailed ; they cleared the street in a triumphant style , but even as they did so the others issued again out of the houses , and took them , a third time , upon the rear ."
The Yorkists began to be scattered ; several times Dick found himself alone among his foes and plying his bright sword for life ; several times he was conscious of a hurt .
And meanwhile the fight swayed to and fro in the street without determinate result .
Suddenly Dick was aware of a great trumpeting about the outskirts of the town .
"The war-cry of York began to be rolled up to heaven , as by many and triumphant voices ."
"She stood with her hand on the head of a huge , tawny collie dog ; another dog was sitting on his haunches beside her ."
"She was tall , with a great braid of shining chestnut hair , showing ruddy burnished tints where the sunlight struck it , hanging over her shoulder ."
The plain dark dress she wore emphasized the grace and strength of her supple form .
"Her face was oval and pale , with straight black brows and a finely cut crimson mouth -- a face whose beauty bore the indefinable stamp of race and breeding mingled with a wild sweetness , as of a flower growing in some lonely and inaccessible place ."
None of the Rexton girls looked like that .
"Who , in the name of all that was amazing , could she be ?"
"As the thought crossed Alan 's mind the girl turned , with an air of indifference that might have seemed slightly overdone to a calmer observer than was the young minister at that moment and , with a gesture of command to her dogs , walked quickly away into the scrub spruces ."
"She was so tall that her uncovered head was visible over them as she followed some winding footpath , and Alan stood like a man rooted to the ground until he saw her enter the grey house ."
"Then he went homeward in a maze , all thought of sermons , doctrinal or otherwise , for the moment knocked out of his head ."
"She is the most beautiful woman I ever saw , he thought ."
How is it possible that I have lived in Rexton for six months and never heard of her or of that house ?
"Well , I daresay there 's some simple explanation of it all ."
The place may have been unoccupied until lately -- probably it is the summer residence of people who have only recently come to it .
I 'll ask Mrs. Danby .
She 'll know if anybody will .
That good woman knows everything about everybody in Rexton for three generations back .
Alan found Isabel King with his housekeeper when he got home .
His greeting was tinged with a slight constraint .
"He was not a vain man , but he could not help knowing that Isabel looked upon him with a favour that had in it much more than professional interest ."
Isabel herself showed it with sufficient distinctness .
"Moreover , he felt a certain personal dislike of her and of her hard , insistent beauty , which seemed harder and more insistent than ever contrasted with his recollection of the girl of the lake shore ."
Isabel had a trick of coming to the manse on plausible errands to Mrs. Danby and lingering until it was so dark that Alan was in courtesy bound to see her home .
"The ruse was a little too patent and amused Alan , although he carefully hid his amusement and treated Isabel with the fine unvarying deference which his mother had engrained into him for womanhood -- a deference that flattered Isabel even while it annoyed her with the sense of a barrier which she could not break down or pass ."
"She was the daughter of the richest man in Rexton and inclined to give herself airs on that account , but Alan 's gentle indifference always brought home to her an unwelcome feeling of inferiority ."
"`` You 've been tiring yourself out again tramping that lake shore , I suppose , '' said Mrs. Danby , who had kept house for three bachelor ministers and consequently felt entitled to hector them in a somewhat maternal fashion ."
"`` Not tiring myself -- resting and refreshing myself rather , '' smiled Alan ."
`` I was tired when I went out but now I feel like a strong man rejoicing to run a race .
"By the way , Mrs. Danby , who lives in that quaint old house away down at the very shore ?"
I never knew of its existence before . ''
Alan 's `` by the way '' was not quite so indifferent as he tried to make it .
"Isabel King , leaning back posingly among the cushions of the lounge , sat quickly up as he asked his question ."
"`` Dear me , you do n't mean to say you 've never heard of Captain Anthony -- Captain Anthony Oliver ? ''"
"Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, ""Don't be silly, because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of, unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops."" So they went. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon with acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much of his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very, very long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his tail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, ""Oh, you nice, kind, pretty little Princess."" But deep down in his wicked purple heart he was saying, ""Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like to eat you instead of these silly acid drops."" But of course nobody heard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and accustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade."
"Now, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete Bad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you know from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the Babes in the Wood, or the Norfolk Tragedy, and one James at least was bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone is a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you need not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete Bad and he will come to no good."
"Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the kingdom to himself. He did not like many things a nice kingdom was almost the only thing he cared for but he had never seen his way quite clearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will not work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a duck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance for him because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the island who could stand by each other himself and the dragon. He said nothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and everyone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance except Tom."
"Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent little creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to the table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had given Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant pointed out a date the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday, and looked anxiously at its master."
"""What is it, Fido good little elephant then?"" said Tom, and the sagacious animal repeated its former gesture. Then Tom understood."
"""Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the lookout."" And he was."
"At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who lived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he began to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great rabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long, tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and before they had time to say, ""There he goes,"" his ugly purple head would come poking out from another rabbit-hole perhaps just behind them or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's laugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't know what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing blind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the habit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on people's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you know how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public kingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were nothing much at first a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two, and some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say, but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of the Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then came a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had barked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown quite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly ceased it woke everybody up and they all went out to see what was the matter. And the lapdog was gone!"
"A boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look for him. But the army was gone too! And now the people began to be frightened. Then Uncle James came out onto the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a speech. He said: ""Friends fellow citizens I cannot disguise from myself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a helpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a is no end of a dragon."""
"The people thought of the dragon's tail and said, ""Hear, hear."""
"Uncle James went on: ""Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless member of our community. We don't know what has happened."""
"Everyone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and groaned."
"""The defenses of our country have been swallowed up,"" said Uncle James."
Everyone thought of the poor army.
"""There is only one thing to be done."" Uncle James was warming to his subject. ""Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple precaution we lost more rabbits or even, perhaps, our navy, our police, and our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect nothing, however sacred."""
"Everyone thought of themselves and they said, ""What is the simple precaution?"""
"Then Uncle James said: ""Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is accustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present he will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he will fly off and never come back."""
The crowd cheered wildly and the Princess from her balcony clapped her hands.
"""The present the dragon expects,"" said Uncle James, cheerfully, ""is rather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a grudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a Princess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us to display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess will only show how generous you are."""
"The crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess, though they quite saw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon what it wanted."
"The Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be anybody's birthday present especially a purple dragon's. And Tom began to cry because he was so angry."
He went straight home and told his little elephant; and the elephant cheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a top that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk.
Early in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked out across the downs there were hardly any rabbits playing there now and then he gathered white roses and threw them at the Princess's window till she woke up and looked out.
"""Come up and kiss me,"" she said."
"So Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the Princess through the window, and said: ""Many happy returns of the day."""
"Then Mary Ann began to cry, and said: ""Oh, Tom how can you? When you know quite well """
"""Oh, don't,"" said Tom. ""Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess what do you think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday present? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged everything. You've only got to do as you are told."""
"""Is that all?"" said the Princess. ""Oh that's easy I've often done that!"""
"Then Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed him again and again. ""Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom,"" she said. ""How glad I am that I gave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears!"""
"The next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and hat and the vest with the gold snakes on it he was a magician, and he had a bright taste in vests and he called with a cab to take the Princess out."
"""Come, little birthday present,"" he said tenderly. ""The dragon will be so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child, we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others rather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be selfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon, far from his home and friends."""
The Princess said she would try not to be selfish.
"Presently the cab drew up near the pillar, and there was the dragon, his ugly purple head shining in the sun, and his ugly purple mouth half open."
"Uncle James said: ""Good morning, sir. We have brought you a small present for your birthday. We do not like to let such an anniversary go by without some suitable testimonial, especially to one who is a stranger in our midst. Our means are small, but our hearts are large. We have but one Princess, but we give her freely do we not, my child?"""
"The Princess said she supposed so, and the dragon came a little nearer."
"Suddenly a voice cried: ""Run!"" and there was Tom, and he had brought the Zoological guinea pig and a pair of Belgian hares with him. ""Just to see fair,"" said Tom."
"Uncle James was furious. ""What do you mean, sir,"" he cried, ""by intruding on a State function with your common rabbits and things? Go away, naughty little boy, and play with them somewhere else."""
"But while he was speaking the rabbits had come up one on each side of him, their great sides towering ever so high, and now they pressed him between them so that he was buried in their thick fur and almost choked."
"The Princess, meantime, had run to the other side of the pillar and was peeping around it to see what was going on. A crowd had followed the cab out of the town; now they reached the scene of the ""State Function"" and they all cried out: ""Fair play play fair! We can't go back on our word like this. Give a thing and take a thing? Why, it's never done. Let the poor exiled stranger dragon have his birthday present."" And they tried to get at Tom but the guinea pig stood in the way."
"""Yes,"" Tom cried. ""Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless exile shall have the Princess if he can catch her. Now then, Mary Ann."""
"Mary Ann looked around the big pillar and called to the dragon: ""Bo! you can't catch me,"" and began to run as fast as ever she could, and the dragon ran after her. When the Princess had run a half mile she stopped, dodged around a tree, and ran back to the pillar and around it, and the dragon after her. You see, he was so long he could not turn as quickly as she could. Around and around the pillar ran the Princess. The first time she ran around a long way from the pillar, and then nearer and nearer with the dragon after her all the time; and he was so busy trying to catch her that he never noticed that Tom had tied the very end of his long, tight, whipcordy tail to the rock, so that the more the dragon ran around, the more times he twisted his tail around the pillar."
"It was exactly like winding a top only the peg was the pillar, and the dragon's tail was the string. And the magician was safe between the Belgian hares, and couldn't see anything but darkness, or do anything but choke."
"When the dragon was wound onto the pillar as much as he possibly could be, and as tight like cotton on a reel the Princess stopped running, and though she had very little breath left, she managed to say, ""Yah who's won now?"""
"This annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his strength spread his great purple wings, and tried to fly at her. Of course this pulled his tail, and pulled it very hard, so hard that as he pulled the tail had to come, and the pillar had to come around with the tail, and the island had to come around with the pillar, and in another minute the tail was loose, and the island was spinning around exactly like a top. It spun so fast that everyone fell flat on their faces and held on tight to themselves, because they felt something was going to happen."
"All but the magician, who was choking between the Belgian hares, and felt nothing but fur and fury."
"And something did happen. The dragon had sent the kingdom of Rotundia spinning the way it ought to have gone at the beginning of the world, and as it spun around, all the animals began to change sizes. The guinea pigs got small, and the elephants got big, and the men and women and children would have changed sizes too, if they had not had the sense to hold on to themselves, very tight indeed, with both hands; which, of course, the animals could not be expected to know how to do. And the best of it was that when the small beasts got big and the big beasts got small the dragon got small too, and fell at the Princess's feet a little, crawling, purple newt with wings."
"""Funny little thing,"" said the Princess, when she saw it. ""I will take it for a birthday present."""
"But while all the people were still on their faces, holding on tight to themselves, Uncle James, the magician, never thought of holding tight he only thought of how to punish Belgian hares and the sons of gardeners; so when the big beasts grew small, he grew small with the other beasts, and the little purple dragon, when he fell at the Princess's feet, saw there a very small magician named Uncle James. And the dragon took him because it wanted a birthday present."
"So now all the animals were new sizes and at first it seemed very strange to everyone to have great lumbering elephants and a tiny little dormouse, but they have gotten used to it now, and think no more of it than we do."
"All this happened several years ago, and the other day I saw in the Rotundia Times an account of the wedding of the Princess with Lord Thomas Gardener, K.C.D., and I knew she could not have married anyone but Tom, so I suppose they made him a Lord on purpose for the wedding and K.C.D., of course, means Clever Conqueror of the Dragon."
"If you think that is wrong it is only because you don't know how they spell in Rotundia. The paper said that among the beautiful presents of the bridegroom to the bride was an enormous elephant, on which the bridal pair made their wedding tour. This must have been Fido. You remember Tom promised to give him back to the Princess when they were married. The Rotundia Times called the married couple ""the happy pair."" It was clever of the paper to think of calling them that it is such a pretty and novel expression, and I think it is truer than many of the things you see in papers."
"Because, you see, the Princess and the gardener's son were so fond of each other they could not help being happy and besides, they had an elephant of their very own to ride on. If that is not enough to make people happy, I should like to know what is. Though, of course, I know there are some people who could not be happy unless they had a whale to sail on, and perhaps not even then. But they are greedy, grasping people, the kind who would take four helps of pudding, as likely as not, which neither Tom nor Mary Ann ever did."
III. The Deliverers of Their Country
"It all began with Effie's getting something in her eye. It hurt very much indeed, and it felt something like a red-hot spark only it seemed to have legs as well, and wings like a fly. Effie rubbed and cried not real crying, but the kind your eye does all by itself without your being miserable inside your mind and then she went to her father to have the thing in her eye taken out. Effie's father was a doctor, so of course he knew how to take things out of eyes he did it very cleverly with a soft paintbrush dipped in castor oil."
"When he had gotten the thing out, he said: ""This is very curious."" Effie had often got things in her eye before, and her father had always seemed to think it was natural rather tiresome and naughty perhaps, but still natural. He had never before thought it curious."
"Effie stood holding her handkerchief to her eye, and said: ""I don't believe it's out."" People always say this when they have had something in their eyes."
"""Oh, yes it's out,"" said the doctor. ""Here it is, on the brush. This is very interesting."""
"Effie had never heard her father say that about anything that she had any share in. She said: ""What?"""
"The doctor carried the brush very carefully across the room, and held the point of it under his microscope then he twisted the brass screws of the microscope, and looked through the top with one eye."
"""Dear me,"" he said. ""Dear, dear me! Four well-developed limbs; a long caudal appendage; five toes, unequal in lengths, almost like one of the Lacertidae, yet there are traces of wings."" The creature under his eye wriggled a little in the castor oil, and he went on: ""Yes; a batlike wing. A new specimen, undoubtedly. Effie, run round to the professor and ask him to be kind enough to step in for a few minutes."""
"""You might give me sixpence, Daddy,"" said Effie, ""because I did bring you the new specimen. I took great care of it inside my eye, and my eye does hurt."""
"The doctor was so pleased with the new specimen that he gave Effie a shilling, and presently the professor stepped round. He stayed to lunch, and he and the doctor quarreled very happily all the afternoon about the name and the family of the thing that had come out of Effie's eye."
"They began one nest and had it nearly done, when Mr. Goldfinch said it was not in a good place, and tore it all to pieces. Mrs. Goldfinch felt very badly about this and talked it over with some of her Goldfinch neighbors. They told her not to mind it at all, that their husbands often did the same thing, and that sometimes they came to like the new place much better than the old. At any rate, there was no use in getting cross about it, because that was something she would have to expect."
"Mr. Goldfinch was sure that they had built too near the ground, and he had chosen a crotch above. Toward this he was dragging the bits of grape-vine and cedar-bark which were woven into their first nest. He said they could also use some of the grasses and mosses which they had gotten together, and he even told his wife of some fine thistle-down which he could bring for the inside, where the eggs were to be laid."
"Mrs. Goldfinch watched him tugging with bill and both feet to loosen the bits of bark, and she said to herself: ""Dear fellow! what a helper he is! I won't mind rebuilding if it makes him happy,"" and she went to work with a will."
"When the sun went down in the west the next night the second nest was done, and it was the last thing at which the Goldfinches looked before tucking their heads under their wings and going to sleep. It was the first thing that they saw the next morning, too, and they hopped all around it and twittered with pride, and gave it little tweaks here and little pokes there before they flew away to get breakfast."
"While they were gone, Mrs. Cowbird came walking over the grass and dry leaves to the foot of the tree. She wagged her head at every step, and put on as many airs as though she were showily dressed, instead of wearing, as she always does, a robe of dull brownish gray. She had seen the Goldfinches fly away, and she was looking for their home. She was a lazy creature in spite of her stirring ways, and she wished to find a nice little nest in which to lay an egg. You know Cowbirds never think of building nests. They want all of their time to take care of themselves, which is a very foolish way of living; but then, you could never make a Cowbird think so!"
"""That nest is exactly right,"" said Mrs. Cowbird. ""I will lay my egg there at once, and when Mrs. Goldfinch has laid hers she will have to hatch them all together and take care of my baby for me. What an easy way this is to bring up one's family! It is really no work at all! And I am sure that my children will get along well, because I am always careful to choose the nests of small birds for them. Then they are larger and stronger than the other babies, and can get more than their share of food."""
"So she laid a big white egg with gray and brown spots on it in the Goldfinches' new home, and then she flew off to the Cowbird flock, as gay and careless as you please. When the Goldfinches came back, they saw the egg in their nest and called all their neighbors to talk it over."
"""What shall I ever do?"" said Mrs. Goldfinch. ""I wanted my nest for my own eggs, and I meant to lay them to-morrow. I suppose I shall have to sit on this one too, but it won't be at all comfortable."""
"""I wouldn't,"" said one of her neighbors, a Yellow Warbler. ""I left my nest once when such a thing happened to me, and built a new one for my own eggs."""
"""Oh dear!"" cried Mrs. Goldfinch, ""we have built two already, and I cannot build another."""
"""Well, whatever you do,"" said a Vireo, ""don't hatch the big egg out with your own. I did once, and such a time as I had! The young Cowbird pushed two of my little Vireos out onto the ground, and ate so much that I was quite worn out by the work of hunting for him."""
"""My dear,"" said Mr. Goldfinch, ""I have an excellent plan. We will put another floor in our nest, right over this egg, and then by adding a bit all around the sides we can have plenty of room for our own children. It will be much less work than beginning all over again, and then the Cowbird's egg will be too cool to hatch."""
"Everybody called this a most clever plan, and Mr. Goldfinch was very proud to have thought of it. They went to work once more, and it was not so very long before the new floor was done and the new walls raised."
"Then, oh, wonder of wonders! there were soon four tiny, pearly eggs of their own lying on the thistle-down lining of the nest."
"Mrs. Goldfinch had to stay very closely at home now, but her husband went off with his friends a great deal. He bathed and sang and preened his feathers and talked about his queer nest and his bright little wife, after the manner of Goldfinches everywhere."
"His friends laughed at him for helping so much about the nest, for, you know, Goldfinches do not often help their wives about home. He cocked his handsome head on one side and answered: ""My wife seemed to need me then. She is not so very strong. And I do not know what she would ever have done about the strange egg, if I had not been there to advise her."""
"When he got back to his home that night, Mrs. Goldfinch said: ""I have been wondering why we did not roll the Cowbird's egg out on the ground, instead of going to all that trouble of building around it."""
"And Mr. Goldfinch declared that he believed she was the only bird who had ever thought of such a thing. ""It could have been done just as well as not,"" he said. ""I must tell that to the other birds in the morning."
"How lucky I am to have such a bright wife! It would be dreadful if such a clever fellow as I had a dull mate!"""
MRS. MOURNING DOVE'S HOUSEKEEPING
"Strange as it may seem, there had never been any Mourning Doves in the forest until this year, and when a pair came there to live, the people were much excited. They talked about the Doves' song, so sweet and sad, and about their soft coats of brown and gray, and they wondered very much what kind of home they would build. Would it be a swinging pocket of hairs, strings, and down, like that of the Orioles? Would it be stout and heavy like the nests of the Robins? Or would it be a ball of leaves and grasses on the ground, with a tiny doorway in one side, like that of the Ovenbird?"
"You can see that the forest people were really very much interested in the Mourning Doves, and so, perhaps, it is not strange that, when the new couple built their nest in the lower branches of a spruce tree, everybody watched it and talked about it."
"""Really,"" said one of the Blackbirds, who had flown over from the swamp near by, ""I never should think of calling that thing a nest! It is nothing but a few twigs and sticks laid together. It is just as flat as a maple-leaf, and what is to keep those poor little Doves from tumbling to the ground I can't see."""
"""I wouldn't worry about the little Doves yet,"" said a Warbler. ""I don't think there will ever be any little Doves in that nest. The eggs will roll off of it long before they are ready to hatch, and the nest will blow to pieces in the first storm we have."""
"""Well,"" said the Blackbird, as she started for home, ""I shall want to know how the Mourning Doves get on. If any of you are over my way, stop and tell me the news."""
"Some days after this, a Quail, passing under the Doves' home, happened to look up and see two white eggs in the nest. It was so very thin that she could see them quite plainly through the openings between the twigs."
"Later in the day, she spoke of this to a Grouse, saying, ""I came by the Mourning Doves' nest and saw two white eggs through the bottom."""
"After she went away, the Grouse said to a wild Rabbit: ""The Quail told me that the Mourning Dove's eggs went right through the bottom of her nest, and I don't wonder. It wasn't strong enough to hold anything."""
"At sunset, the Rabbit had a short visit with Mrs. Goldfinch, as she pulled a great thistle-head to pieces and made her supper from its seeds. He told her he had heard that the Mourning Dove's eggs had fallen through the bottom of the nest and broken on the ground, and Mrs."
"Goldfinch said: ""Oh, that poor Mrs. Mourning Dove! I must go to see her in the morning."" Then she fled home to her own four pearly treasures."
"Now, of course the Rabbit was mistaken when he said anybody had told him that those two eggs were broken; just as much mistaken as the Grouse was when she said somebody had told her that the eggs had fallen. They both thought they were right, but they were careless listeners and careless talkers, and so each one had changed it a bit in the telling."
"But at teatime another thing happened. Effie's brother Harry fished something out of his tea, which he thought at first was an earwig. He was just getting ready to drop it on the floor, and end its life in the usual way, when it shook itself in the spoon spread two wet wings, and flopped onto the tablecloth. There it sat, stroking itself with its feet and stretching its wings, and Harry said: ""Why, it's a tiny newt!"""
"The professor leaned forward before the doctor could say a word. ""I'll give you half a crown for it, Harry, my lad,"" he said, speaking very fast; and then he picked it up carefully on his handkerchief."
"""It is a new specimen,"" he said, ""and finer than yours, Doctor."""
"It was a tiny lizard, about half an inch long with scales and wings."
"So now the doctor and the professor each had a specimen, and they were both very pleased. But before long these specimens began to seem less valuable. For the next morning, when the knife-boy was cleaning the doctor's boots, he suddenly dropped the brushes and the boot and the blacking, and screamed out that he was burnt."
"And from inside the boot came crawling a lizard as big as a kitten, with large, shiny wings."
"""Why,"" said Effie, ""I know what it is. It is a dragon like the one St."
"George killed."""
"And Effie was right. That afternoon Towser was bitten in the garden by a dragon about the size of a rabbit, which he had tried to chase, and the next morning all the papers were full of the wonderful ""winged lizards"""
"that were appearing all over the country. The papers would not call them dragons, because, of course, no one believes in dragons nowadays and at any rate the papers were not going to be so silly as to believe in fairy stories. At first there were only a few, but in a week or two the country was simply running alive with dragons of all sizes, and in the air you could sometimes see them as thick as a swarm of bees. They all looked alike except as to size. They were green with scales, and they had four legs and a long tail and great wings like bats' wings, only the wings were a pale, half-transparent yellow, like the gear-boxes on bicycles."
"They breathed fire and smoke, as all proper dragons must, but still the newspapers went on pretending they were lizards, until the editor of the Standard was picked up and carried away by a very large one, and then the other newspaper people had not anyone left to tell them what they ought not to believe. So when the largest elephant in the Zoo was carried off by a dragon, the papers gave up pretending and put ALARMING PLAGUE OF DRAGONS at the top of the paper."
"You have no idea how alarming it was, and at the same time how aggravating. The large-size dragons were terrible certainly, but when once you had found out that the dragons always went to bed early because they were afraid of the chill night air, you had only to stay indoors all day, and you were pretty safe from the big ones. But the smaller sizes were a perfect nuisance. The ones as big as earwigs got in the soap, and they got in the butter. The ones as big as dogs got in the bath, and the fire and smoke inside them made them steam like anything when the cold water tap was turned on, so that careless people were often scalded quite severely. The ones that were as large as pigeons would get into workbaskets or corner drawers and bite you when you were in a hurry to get a needle or a handkerchief. The ones as big as sheep were easier to avoid, because you could see them coming; but when they flew in at the windows and curled up under your eiderdown, and you did not find them till you went to bed, it was always a shock. The ones this size did not eat people, only lettuce, but they always scorched the sheets and pillowcases dreadfully."
"Of course, the County Council and the police did everything that could be done: It was no use offering the hand of the Princess to anyone who killed a dragon. This way was all very well in olden times when there was only one dragon and one Princess; but now there were far more dragons than Princesses although the Royal Family was a large one. And besides, it would have been a mere waste of Princesses to offer rewards for killing dragons, because everybody killed as many dragons as they could quite out of their own heads and without rewards at all, just to get the nasty things out of the way. The County Council undertook to cremate all dragons delivered at their offices between the hours of ten and two, and whole wagonloads and cartloads and truckloads of dead dragons could be seen any day of the week standing in a long line in the street where the County Council had their offices. Boys brought barrowloads of dead dragons, and children on their way home from morning school would call in to leave the handful or two of little dragons they had brought in their satchels, or carried in their knotted pocket handkerchiefs. And yet there seemed to be as many dragons as ever. Then the police stuck up great wood and canvas towers covered with patent glue. When the dragons flew against these towers, they stuck fast, as flies and wasps do on the sticky papers in the kitchen; and when the towers were covered all over with dragons, the police inspector used to set fire to the towers, and burnt them and dragons and all."
"And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever. The shops were full of patent dragon poison and anti-dragon soap, and dragonproof curtains for the windows; and indeed, everything that could be done was done."
And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever.
"It was not very easy to know what would poison a dragon, because, you see, they ate such different things. The largest kind ate elephants as long as there were any, and then went on with horses and cows. Another size ate nothing but lilies of the valley, and a third size ate only Prime Ministers if they were to be had, and, if not, would feed freely on servants in livery. Another size lived on bricks, and three of them ate two thirds of the South Lambeth Infirmary in one afternoon."
"But the size Effie was most afraid of was about as big as your dining room, and that size ate little girls and boys."
"At first Effie and her brother were quite pleased with the change in their lives. It was so amusing to sit up all night instead of going to sleep, and to play in the garden lighted by electric lamps. And it sounded so funny to hear Mother say, when they were going to bed: ""Good night, my darlings, sleep sound all day, and don't get up too soon. You must not get up before it's quite dark. You wouldn't like the nasty dragons to catch you."""
"But after a time they got very tired of it all: They wanted to see the flowers and trees growing in the fields, and to see the pretty sunshine out of doors, and not just through glass windows and patent dragonproof curtains. And they wanted to play on the grass, which they were not allowed to do in the electric lamp-lighted garden because of the night-dew."
"And they wanted so much to get out, just for once, in the beautiful, bright, dangerous daylight, that they began to try and think of some reason why they ought to go out. Only they did not like to disobey their mother."
"But one morning their mother was busy preparing some new dragon poison to lay down in the cellars, and their father was bandaging the hand of the boot boy, which had been scratched by one of the dragons who liked to eat Prime Ministers when they were to be had, so nobody remembered to say to the children: ""Don't get up till it is quite dark!"""
"""Go now,"" said Harry. ""It would not be disobedient to go. And I know exactly what we ought to do, but I don't know how we ought to do it."""
"""What ought we to do?"" said Effie."
"""We ought to wake St. George, of course,"" said Harry. ""He was the only person in his town who knew how to manage dragons; the people in the fairy tales don't count. But St. George is a real person, and he is only asleep, and he is waiting to be waked up. Only nobody believes in St."
"George now. I heard father say so."""
"""We do,"" said Effie."
"""Of course we do. And don't you see, Ef, that's the very reason why we could wake him? You can't wake people if you don't believe in them, can you?"""
"Effie said no, but where could they find St. George?"
"""We must go and look,"" said Harry boldly. ""You shall wear a dragonproof frock, made of stuff like the curtains. And I will smear myself all over with the best dragon poison, and """
"Effie clasped her hands and skipped with joy and cried: ""Oh, Harry! I know where we can find St. George! In St. George's Church, of course."""
"""Um,"" said Harry, wishing he had thought of it for himself, ""you have a little sense sometimes, for a girl."""
"But at that moment a dark shadow fell on them, and they saw that it was a dragon exactly the size of the dining room at home."
"So then they knew that all was lost. The dragon swooped down and caught the two children in his claws; he caught Effie by her green silk sash, and Harry by the little point at the back of his Eton jacket and then, spreading his great yellow wings, he rose into the air, rattling like a third-class carriage when the brake is hard on."
"""Oh, Harry,"" said Effie, ""I wonder when he will eat us!"" The dragon was flying across woods and fields with great flaps of his wings that carried him a quarter of a mile at each flap."
"Harry and Effie could see the country below, hedges and rivers and churches and farmhouses flowing away from under them, much faster than you see them running away from the sides of the fastest express train."
"And still the dragon flew on. The children saw other dragons in the air as they went, but the dragon who was as big as the dining room never stopped to speak to any of them, but just flew on quite steadily."
"""He knows where he wants to go,"" said Harry. ""Oh, if he would only drop us before he gets there!"""
"But the dragon held on tight, and he flew and flew and flew until at last, when the children were quite giddy, he settled down, with a rattling of all his scales, on the top of a mountain. And he lay there on his great green scaly side, panting, and very much out of breath, because he had come such a long way. But his claws were fast in Effie's sash and the little point at the back of Harry's Eton jacket."
"Then Effie took out the knife Harry had given her on her birthday. It had cost only sixpence to begin with, and she had had it a month, and it never could sharpen anything but slate-pencils; but somehow she managed to make that knife cut her sash in front, and crept out of it, leaving the dragon with only a green silk bow in one of his claws. That knife would never have cut Harry's jacket-tail off, though, and when Effie had tried for some time she saw that this was so and gave it up. But with her help Harry managed to wriggle quietly out of his sleeves, so that the dragon had only an Eton jacket in his other claw. Then the children crept on tiptoe to a crack in the rocks and got in. It was much too narrow for the dragon to get in also, so they stayed in there and waited to make faces at the dragon when he felt rested enough to sit up and begin to think about eating them. He was very angry, indeed, when they made faces at him, and blew out fire and smoke at them, but they ran farther into the cave so that he could not reach them, and when he was tired of blowing he went away."
"But they were afraid to come out of the cave, so they went farther in, and presently the cave opened out and grew bigger, and the floor was soft sand, and when they had come to the very end of the cave there was a door, and on it was written: UNIVERSAL TAPROOM. PRIVATE. NO ONE ALLOWED INSIDE."
"So they opened the door at once just to peep in, and then they remembered what St. George had said."
"""We can't be worse off than we are,"" said Harry, ""with a dragon waiting for us outside. Let's go in."""
"They went boldly into the taproom, and shut the door behind them."
"And now they were in a sort of room cut out of the solid rock, and all along one side of the room were taps, and all the taps were labeled with china labels like you see in baths. And as they could both read words of two syllables or even three sometimes, they understood at once that they had gotten to the place where the weather is turned on from. There were six big taps labeled ""Sunshine,"" ""Wind,"" ""Rain,"" ""Snow,"" ""Hail,"" ""Ice,"""
"and a lot of little ones, labeled ""Fair to moderate,"" ""Showery,"" ""South breeze,"" ""Nice growing weather for the crops,"" ""Skating,"" ""Good open weather,"" ""South wind,"" ""East wind,"" and so on. And the big tap labeled ""Sunshine"" was turned full on. They could not see any sunshine the cave was lighted by a skylight of blue glass so they supposed the sunlight was pouring out by some other way, as it does with the tap that washes out the underneath parts of patent sinks in kitchens."
"Then they saw that one side of the room was just a big looking glass, and when you looked in it you could see everything that was going on in the world and all at once, too, which is not like most looking glasses."
"They saw the carts delivering the dead dragons at the County Council offices, and they saw St. George asleep under the dragonproof veil. And they saw their mother at home crying because her children had gone out in the dreadful, dangerous daylight, and she was afraid a dragon had eaten them. And they saw the whole of England, like a great puzzle map green in the field parts and brown in the towns, and black in the places where they make coal and crockery and cutlery and chemicals. All over it, on the black parts, and on the brown, and on the green, there was a network of green dragons. And they could see that it was still broad daylight, and no dragons had gone to bed yet."
"Effie said, ""Dragons do not like cold."" And she tried to turn off the sunshine, but the tap was out of order, and that was why there had been so much hot weather, and why the dragons had been able to be hatched. So they left the sunshine tap alone, and they turned on the snow and left the tap full on while they went to look in the glass. There they saw the dragons running all sorts of ways like ants if you are cruel enough to pour water into an ant-heap, which, of course, you never are. And the snow fell more and more."
"Then Effie turned the rain tap quite full on, and presently the dragons began to wriggle less, and by-and-by some of them lay quite still, so the children knew the water had put out the fires inside them, and they were dead. So then they turned on the hail only half on, for fear of breaking people's windows and after a while there were no more dragons to be seen moving."
Then the children knew that they were indeed the deliverers of their country.
"""They will put up a monument to us,"" said Harry, ""as high as Nelson's!"
"All the dragons are dead."""
"""I hope the one that was waiting outside for us is dead!"" said Effie."
"""And about the monument, Harry, I'm not so sure. What can they do with such a lot of dead dragons? It would take years and years to bury them, and they could never be burnt now they are so soaking wet. I wish the rain would wash them off into the sea."""
"But this did not happen, and the children began to feel that they had not been so frightfully clever after all."
"""I wonder what this old thing's for,"" said Harry. He had found a rusty old tap, which seemed as though it had not been used for ages. Its china label was quite coated over with dirt and cobwebs. When Effie had cleaned it with a bit of her skirt for curiously enough both the children had come out without pocket handkerchiefs she found that the label said ""Waste."""
"""Let's turn it on,"" she said. ""It might carry off the dragons."""
"The tap was very stiff from not having been used for such a long time, but together they managed to turn it on, and then ran to the mirror to see what happened."
"Already a great, round black hole had opened in the very middle of the map of England, and the sides of the map were tilting themselves up, so that the rain ran down toward the hole."
"""Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!"" cried Effie, and she hurried back to the taps and turned on everything that seemed wet. ""Showery,"" ""Good open weather,"" ""Nice growing weather for the crops,"" and even ""South"" and ""South-West,"" because she had heard her father say that those winds brought rain."
"And now the floods of rain were pouring down on the country, and great sheets of water flowed toward the center of the map, and cataracts of water poured into the great round hole in the middle of the map, and the dragons were being washed away and disappearing down the waste pipe in great green masses and scattered green shoals single dragons and dragons by the dozen; of all sizes, from the ones that carry off elephants down to the ones that get in your tea."
"Presently there was not a dragon left. So then they turned off the tap named ""Waste,"" and they half-turned off the one labeled ""Sunshine"" it was broken, so that they could not turn it off altogether and they turned on ""Fair to moderate"" and ""Showery"" and both taps stuck, so that they could not be turned off, which accounts for our climate."
"The drummer did not reflect long; he sprang into the midst of the flames, but they did not hurt him, and could not even singe a hair of his head. He carried the log out, and laid it down. Hardly, however, had the wood touched the earth than it was transformed, and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his need stood before him, and by the silken and shining golden garments which she wore, he knew right well that she was the King’s daughter. But the old woman laughed venomously, and said, “Thou thinkest thou hast her safe, but thou hast not got her yet!” Just as she was about to fall on the maiden and take her away, the youth seized the old woman with both his hands, raised her up on high, and threw her into the jaws of the fire, which closed over her as if it were delighted that an old witch was to be burnt."
"Then the King’s daughter looked at the drummer, and when she saw that he was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked his life to deliver her, she gave him her hand, and said, “Thou hast ventured everything for my sake, but I also will do everything for thine."
"Promise to be true to me, and thou shalt be my husband. We shall not want for riches, we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered together here.” She led him into the house, where there were chests and coffers crammed with the old woman’s treasures. The maiden left the gold and silver where it was, and took only the precious stones. She would not stay any longer on the glass-mountain, so the drummer said to her, “Seat thyself by me on my saddle, and then we will fly down like birds.” “I do not like the old saddle,” said she, “I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home.” “Very well, then,” answered the drummer, “then wish us in front of the town-gate.” In the twinkling of an eye they were there, but the drummer said, “I will just go to my parents and tell them the news, wait for me outside here, I shall soon be back.” “Ah,” said the King’s daughter, “I beg thee to be careful. On thy arrival do not kiss thy parents on the right cheek, or else thou wilt forget everything, and I shall stay behind here outside, alone and deserted.” “How can I forget thee?” said he, and promised her to come back very soon, and gave his hand upon it. When he went into his father’s house, he had changed so much that no one knew who he was, for the three days which he had passed on the glass-mountain had been three years. Then he made himself known, and his parents fell on his neck with joy, and his heart was so moved that he forgot what the maiden had said, and kissed them on both cheeks. But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek, every thought of the King’s daughter vanished from him. He emptied out his pockets, and laid handfuls of the largest jewels on the table. The parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches. Then the father built a magnificent castle all surrounded by gardens, woods, and meadows as if a prince were going to live in it, and when it was ready, the mother said, “I have found a maiden for thee, and the wedding shall be in three days. The son was content to do as his parents desired.”"
"The poor King’s daughter had stood for a long time without the town waiting for the return of the young man. When evening came, she said, “He must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek, and has forgotten me.” Her heart was full of sorrow, she wished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would not return to her father’s court. Every evening she went into the town and passed the young man’s house; he often saw her, but he no longer knew her. At length she heard the people saying, “The wedding will take place to-morrow.” Then she said, “I will try if I can win his heart back.”"
"On the first day of the wedding ceremonies, she turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress as bright as the sun.” Instantly the dress lay before her, and it was as bright as if it had been woven of real sunbeams. When all the guests were assembled, she entered the hall. Every one was amazed at the beautiful dress, and the bride most of all, and as pretty dresses were the things she had most delight in, she went to the stranger and asked if she would sell it to her. “Not for money,” she answered, “but if I may pass the first night outside the door of the room where your betrothed sleeps, I will give it up to you.” The bride could not overcome her desire and consented, but she mixed a sleeping-draught with the wine her betrothed took at night, which made him fall into a deep sleep, When all had become quiet, the King’s daughter crouched down by the door of the bedroom, opened it just a little, and cried,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thou heldest me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"But it was all in vain, the drummer did not awake, and when morning dawned, the King’s daughter was forced to go back again as she came. On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring and said, “A dress as silvery as the moon.” When she appeared at the feast in the dress which was as soft as moonbeams, it again excited the desire of the bride, and the King’s daughter gave it to her for permission to pass the second night also, outside the door of the bedroom. Then in the stillness of the night, she cried,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thy heldest me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"But the drummer, who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught, could not be aroused. Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest."
"But the people in the house had heard the lamentation of the stranger-maiden, and told the bridegroom about it. They told him also that it was impossible that he could hear anything of it, because the maiden he was going to marry had poured a sleeping-draught into his wine."
"On the third evening, the King’s daughter turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress glittering like the stars.” When she showed herself therein at the feast, the bride was quite beside herself with the splendour of the dress, which far surpassed the others, and she said, “I must, and will have it.” The maiden gave it as she had given the others for permission to spend the night outside the bridegroom’s door."
"The bridegroom, however, did not drink the wine which was handed to him before he went to bed, but poured it behind the bed, and when everything was quiet, he heard a sweet voice which called to him,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thou held me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"Suddenly, his memory returned to him. “Ah,” cried he, “how can I have acted so unfaithfully; but the kiss which in the joy of my heart I gave my parents, on the right cheek, that is to blame for it all, that is what stupefied me!” He sprang up, took the King’s daughter by the hand, and led her to his parents’ bed. “This is my true bride,” said he; “if I marry the other, I shall do a great wrong.” The parents, when they heard how everything had happened, gave their consent. Then the lights in the hall were lighted again, drums and trumpets were brought, friends and relations were invited to come, and the real wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. The first bride received the beautiful dresses as a compensation, and declared herself satisfied."
194 The Ear of Corn
"In former times, when God himself still walked the earth, the fruitfulness of the soil was much greater than it is now; then the ears of corn did not bear fifty or sixty, but four or five hundred-fold."
"Then the corn grew from the bottom to the very top o f the stalk, and according to the length of the stalk was the length of the ear. Men however are so made, that when they are too well off they no longer value the blessings which come from God, but grow indifferent and careless. One day a woman was passing by a corn-field when her little child, who was running beside her, fell into a puddle, and dirtied her frock. On this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn, and cleaned the frock with them."
"""Heaven bless and help us! what a stout heart you have got!"" said the old dame. ""Don't you see we have got amongst Trolls?"""
"""Stuff and nonsense!"" said the lad; ""no harm if we have."""
"In a little while, back came the man with an ox so fat and big, the lad had never seen its like, and he gave it one blow with his fist under the ear, and down it fell dead on the floor. When that was done, he took it up by all the four legs and laid it on the glowing embers, and turned it and twisted it about till it was burnt brown outside."
"After that, he went to a cupboard and took out a great silver dish, and laid the ox on it; and the dish was so big that none of the ox hung over on any side. This he put on the table, and then he went down into the cellar and fetched a cask of wine, knocked out the head, and put the cask on the table, together with two knives, which were each six feet long. When this was done he bade them go and sit down to supper and eat. So they went, the lad first and the old dame after, but she began to whimper and wail, and to wonder how she should ever use such knives. But her son seized one, and began to cut slices out of the thigh of the ox, which he placed before his mother. And when they had eaten a bit, he took up the cask with both hands, and lifted it down to the floor; then he told his mother to come and drink, but it was still so high she couldn't reach up to it; so he caught her up, and held her up to the edge of the cask while she drank; as for himself, he clambered up and hung down like a cat inside the cask while he drank. So when he had quenched his thirst, he took up the cask and put it back on the table, and thanked the man for the good meal, and told his mother to come and thank him too, and, a-feared though she was, she dared do nothing else but thank the man. Then the lad sat down again alongside the man and began to gossip, and after they had sat a while the man said:"
"""Well! I must just go and get a bit of supper too;"" and so he went to the table and ate up the whole ox hoofs, and horns, and all and drained the cask to the last drop, and then went back and sat on the bench."
"""As for beds,"" he said, ""I don't know what's to be done. I've only got one bed and a cradle; but we could get on pretty well if you would sleep in the cradle, and then your mother might lie in the bed yonder."""
"""Thank you kindly, that'll do nicely,"" said the lad; and with that he pulled off his clothes and lay down in the cradle; but, to tell you the truth, it was quite as big as a four-poster. As for the old dame, she had to follow the man who showed her to bed, though she was out of her wits for fear."
"""Well!"" thought the lad to himself, ""'twill never do to go to sleep yet. I'd best lie awake and listen how things go as the night wears on."""
"So, after a while, the man began to talk to the old dame, and at last he said:"
"""We two might live here so happily together, could we only be rid of this son of yours."""
"""But do you know how to settle him? Is that what you're thinking of?"""
said she.
"""Nothing easier,"" said he; at any rate he would try. He would just say he wished the old dame would stay and keep house for him a day or two, and then he would take the lad out with him up the hill to quarry corner-stones, and roll down a great rock on him. All this the lad lay and listened to."
"Next day the Troll for it was a Troll as clear as day asked if the old dame would stay and keep house for him a few days; and as the day went on he took a great iron crowbar, and asked the lad if he had a mind to go with him up the hill and quarry a few corner-stones. With all his heart, he said, and went with him; and so, after they had split a few stones, the Troll wanted him to go down below and look after cracks in the rock; and while he was doing this the Troll worked away, and wearied himself with his crowbar till he moved a whole crag out of its bed, which came rolling right down on the place where the lad was; but he held it up till he could get on one side, and then let it roll on."
"""Oh!"" said the lad to the Troll, ""now I see what you mean to do with me. You want to crush me to death; so just go down yourself and look after the cracks and refts in the rock, and I'll stand up above."""
"The Troll did not dare to do otherwise than the lad bade him, and the end of it was that the lad rolled down a great rock, which fell upon the Troll and broke one of his thighs."
"""Well! you are in a sad plight,"" said the lad, as he strode down, lifted up the rock, and set the man free. After that he had to put him on his back and carry him home; so he ran with him as fast as a horse, and shook him so that the Troll screamed and screeched as if a knife were run into him. And when he got home, they had to put the Troll to bed, and there he lay in a sad pickle."
"When the night wore on, the Troll began to talk to the old dame again, and to wonder how ever they could be rid of the lad."
"""Well,"" said the old dame, ""if you can't hit on a plan to get rid of him, I'm sure I can't."""
"""Let me see,"" said the Troll; ""I've got twelve lions in a garden; if they could only get hold of the lad, they'd soon tear him to pieces."""
"So the old dame said it would be easy enough to get him there. She would sham sick, and say she felt so poorly, nothing would do her any good but lion's milk. All that the lad lay and listened to; and when he got up in the morning his mother said she was worse than she looked, and she thought she should never be right again unless she could get some lion's milk."
"""Then I'm afraid you'll be poorly a long time, mother,"" said the lad, ""for I'm sure I don't know where any is to be got."""
"""Oh! if that be all,"" said the Troll, ""there's no lack of lion's milk, if we only had the man to fetch it;"" and then he went on to say how his brother had a garden with twelve lions in it, and how the lad might have the key if he had a mind to milk the lions. So the lad took the key and a milking pail, and strode off; and when he unlocked the gate and got into the garden, there stood all the twelve lions on their hind-paws, rampant and roaring at him. But the lad laid hold of the biggest, and led him about by the fore-paws, and dashed him against stocks and stones till there wasn't a bit of him left but the two paws. So when the rest saw that, they were so afraid that they crept up and lay at his feet like so many curs. After that they followed him about wherever he went, and when he got home, they lay down outside the house, with their fore-paws on the door sill."
"""Now, mother, you'll soon be well,"" said the lad, when he went in, ""for here is the lion's milk."""
He had just milked a drop in the pail.
"But the Troll, as he lay in bed, swore it was all a lie. He was sure the lad was not the man to milk lions."
"When the lad heard that, he forced the Troll to get out of bed, threw open the door, and all the lions rose up and seized the Troll, and at last the lad had to make them leave their hold."
"That night the Troll began to talk to the old dame again. ""I'm sure I can't tell how to put this lad out of the way he is so awfully strong; can't you think of some way?"""
"""No,"" said the old dame, ""if you can't tell, I'm sure I can't."""
"""Well!"" said the Troll, ""I have two brothers in a castle; they are twelve times as strong as I am, and that's why I was turned out and had to put up with this farm. They hold that castle, and round it there is an orchard with apples in it, and whoever eats those apples sleeps for three days and three nights. If we could only get the lad to go for the fruit, he wouldn't be able to keep from tasting the apples, and as soon as ever he fell asleep my brothers would tear him in pieces."""
"The old dame said she would sham sick, and say she could never be herself again unless she tasted those apples; for she had set her heart on them."
All this the lad lay and listened to.
"The forts, now threatened in the rear by Butler's army, surrendered, and Farragut went up to Baton Rouge and took possession of it. General Butler's occupation at New Orleans has been variously commented upon by both friend and foe, but we are only able to learn from this and the entire record of the war, in fact, that it is better to avoid hostilities unless one is ready to accept the unpleasant features of combat. The author, when a boy, learned this after he had acquired the unpleasant features resulting from combat which the artist has cleverly shown on opposite page."
"General Butler said he found it almost impossible to avoid giving offence to the foe, and finally he gave it up in despair."
"The French are said to be the politest people on the face of the earth, but no German will admit it; and though the Germans are known to have big, warm, hospitable hearts, since the Franco-Prussian war you couldn't get a Frenchman to admit this."
"In February Burnside captured Roanoke Island, and the coast of North Carolina fell into the hands of the Union army. Port Royal became the base of operations against Florida, and at the close of the year 1862 every city on the Atlantic coast except Charleston, Wilmington, and Savannah was held by the Union army."
"The Merrimac iron-clad, which had made much trouble for the Union shipping for some time, steamed into Hampton Roads on the 8th of March."
"Hampton Roads is not the Champs-Elysées of the South, but a long wet stretch of track east of Virginia, the Midway Plaisance of the Salted Sea. The Merrimac steered for the Cumberland, rammed her, and the Cumberland sunk like a stove-lid, with all on board. The captain of the Congress, warned by the fate of the Cumberland, ran his vessel on shore and tried to conceal her behind the tall grass, but the Merrimac followed and shelled her till she surrendered."
"The Merrimac then went back to Norfolk, where she boarded, night having come on apace. In the morning she aimed to clear out the balance of the Union fleet. That night, however, the Monitor, a flat little craft with a revolving tower, invented by Captain Ericsson, arrived, and in the morning when the Merrimac started in on her day's work of devastation, beginning with the Minnesota, the insignificant-looking Monitor slid up to the iron monster and gave her two one-hundred-and-sixty-six-and-three-quarter-pound solid shot."
"The Merrimac replied with a style of broadside that generally sunk her adversary, but the balls rolled off the low flat deck and fell with a solemn plunk in the moaning sea, or broke in fragments and lay on the forward deck like the shells of antique eggs on the floor of the House of Parliament after a Home Rule argument."
"Five times the Merrimac tried to ram the little spitz-pup of the navy, but her huge iron beak rode up over the slippery deck of the enemy, and when the big vessel looked over her sides to see its wreck, she discovered that the Monitor was right side up and ready for more."
"The Confederate vessel gave it up at last, and went back to Norfolk defeated, her career suddenly closed by the timely genius of the able Scandinavian."
"The Peninsular campaign was principally addressed toward the capture of Richmond. One hundred thousand men were massed at Fort Monroe April 4, and marched slowly toward Yorktown, where five thousand Confederates under General Magruder stopped the great army under McClellan."
"After a month's siege, and just as McClellan was about to shoot at the town, the garrison took its valise and went away."
"On the 5th of May occurred the battle of Williamsburg, between the forces under ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker and General Johnston. It lasted nine hours, and ended in the routing of the Confederates and their pursuit by Hooker to within seven miles of Richmond. This caused the adjournment of the Confederate Congress."
"But Johnston prevented the junction of McDowell and McClellan after the capture of Hanover Court-House, and Stonewall Jackson, reinforced by Ewell, scared the Union forces almost to death. They crossed the Potomac, having marched thirty-five miles per day. Washington was getting too hot now to hold people who could get away."
It was hard to say which capital had been scared the worst.
"The Governors of the Northern States were asked to send militia to defend the capital, and the front door of the White House was locked every night after ten o'clock."
"But finally the Union generals, instead of calling for more troops, got after General Jackson, and he fled from the Shenandoah Valley, burning the bridges behind him. It is said that as he and his staff were about to cross their last bridge they saw a mounted gun on the opposite side, manned by a Union artilleryman. Jackson rode up and in clarion tones called out, ""Who told you to put that gun there, sir? Bring it over here, sir, and mount it, and report at head-quarters this evening, sir!"""
"The artilleryman unlimbered the gun, and while he was placing it General Jackson and staff crossed over and joined the army."
"One cannot be too careful, during a war, in the matter of obedience to orders. We should always know as nearly as possible whether our orders come from the proper authority or not."
"No one can help admiring this dashing officer's tour in the Shenandoah Valley, where he kept three major-generals and sixty thousand troops awake nights with fifteen thousand men, saved Richmond, scared Washington into fits, and prevented the union of McClellan's and McDowell's forces. Had there been more such men, and a little more confidence in the great volume of typographical errors called Confederate money, the lovely character who pens these lines might have had a different tale to tell."
"May 31 and June 1 occurred the battle of Fair Oaks, where McClellan's men floundering in the mud of the Chickahominy swamps were pounced upon by General Johnston, who was wounded the first day. On the following day, as a result of this accident, Johnston's men were repulsed in disorder."
"General Robert E. Lee, who was now in command of the Confederate forces, desired to make his army even more offensive than it had been, and on June 12 General Stuart led off with his cavalry, made the entire circuit of the Union army, saw how it looked from behind, and returned to Richmond, much improved in health, having had several meals of victuals while absent."
"Hooker now marched to where he could see the dome of the court-house at Richmond, but just then McClellan heard that Jackson had been seen in the neighborhood of Hanover Court-House, and so decided to change his base. General McClellan was a man of great refinement, and would never use the same base over a week at a time."
"He had hardly got the base changed when Lee fell upon his flank at Mechanicsville, June 26, and the Seven Days' battle followed. The Union troops fought and fell back, fought and fell back, until Malvern Hill was reached, where, worn with marching, choked with dust, and broken down by the heat, to which they were unaccustomed, they made their last stand, July 1. Here Lee got such a reception that he did not insist on going any farther."
"But the Union army was cooped up on the James River. The siege of Richmond had been abandoned, and the North felt blue and discouraged."
"Three hundred thousand more men were called for, and it seemed that, as in the South, ""the cradle and the grave were to be robbed"" for more troops."
"Lee now decided to take Washington and butcher Congress to make a Roman holiday. General Pope met the Confederates August 26, and while Lee and Jackson were separated could have whipped the latter had the Army of the Potomac reinforced him as it should, but, full of malaria and foot-sore with marching, it did not reach him in time, and Pope had to fight the entire Confederate army on that historic ground covered with so many unpleasant memories and other things, called Bull Run."
"For the second time the worn and wilted Union army was glad to get back to Washington, where the President was, and where beer was only five cents per glass."
"Oh, how sad everything seemed at that time to the North, and how high cotton cloth was! The bride who hastily married her dear one and bade him good-by as the bugle called him to the war, pointed with pride to her cotton clothes as a mark of wealth; and the middle classes were only too glad to have a little cotton mixed with their woollen clothes."
"Lee invaded Maryland, and McClellan, restored to command of the Army of the Potomac, followed him, and found a copy of his order of march, which revealed the fact that only a portion of the army was before him. So, overtaking the Confederates at South Mountain, he was ready for a victory, but waited one day; and in the mountains Lee got his troops united again, while Jackson also returned. The Union troops had over eighty thousand in their ranks, and nothing could have been more thoughtful or genteel than to wait for the Confederates to get as many together as possible, otherwise the battle might have been brief and unsatisfactory to the tax-payer or newspaper subscriber, who of course wants his money's worth when he pays for a battle."
"He was put in a common jail to await trial. Afterwards he was discharged, but was never again on good terms with the government, and never rose again."
"When he came into town and registered at the hotel the papers did not say anything about it; and so he stopped taking them, thus falling into ignorance and oblivion at the same moment, although at one time he had lacked but a single vote to make him President of the United States."
"England and France still continued at war, and American vessels were in hot water a good deal, as they were liable to be overhauled by both parties. England especially, with the excuse that she was looking for deserters, stopped American vessels and searched them, going through the sleeping-apartments before the work was done up, one of the rudest things known in international affairs."
"An Embargo Act was passed forbidding American vessels to leave port, an act which showed that the bray of the ass had begun to echo through the halls of legislation even at that early day."
"In the mean time, Jefferson had completed his second term, and James Madison, the Republican candidate, had succeeded him at the helm of state, as it was then called."
"His party favored a war with England, especially as the British had begun again to stir up the red brother."
"Madison was a Virginian. He was a man of unblemished character, and was not too haughty to have fun sometimes. This endeared him to the whole nation. Unlike Adams, he never swelled up so that his dignity hurt him under the arms. He died in 1836, genial and sunny to the last."
"It was now thought best to bring on the war of 1812, which began by an Indian attack at Tippecanoe on General Harrison's troops in 1811, when the Indians were defeated. June 19, 1812, war was finally declared."
"The first battle was between the forces under General Hull on our side and the English and Indians on the British side, near Detroit. The troops faced each other, Tecumseh being the Indian leader, and both armies stood ready to have one of the best battles ever given in public or private, when General Hull was suddenly overcome with remorse at the thought of shedding blood, especially among people who were so common, and, shaking a large table-cloth out the window in token of peace, amid the tears of his men, surrendered his entire command in a way that reminded old settlers very much of Cornwallis."
CHAPTER XX.
THE WAR WITH CANADA.
"October 13, General Van Rensselaer crossed the Niagara River and attacked the British at Queenstown Heights. The latter retreated, and General Brock was killed. General Van Rensselaer went back after the rest of his troops, but they refused to cross, on the ground that the general had no right to take them out of the United States, and thus the troops left in charge at the Heights were compelled to surrender."
"These troops who refused to go over and accept a victory already won for them, because they didn't want to cross the Canadian line, would not have shied so at the boundary if they had been boodlers, very likely, in later years."
"August 19 occurred the naval fight between the Constitution and Guerriere, off the Massachusetts coast. The Constitution, called ""Old Ironsides,"" was commanded by Captain Isaac Hull. The Guerriere was first to attack, but got no reply until both vessels were very close together, when into her starboard Captain Hull poured such a load of hardware that the Guerriere was soon down by the head and lop-sided on the off side. She surrendered, but was of no value, being so full of holes that she would not hold a cargo of railroad-trestles."
"The economy used by the early American warriors by land and sea regarding their ammunition, holding their fire until the enemy was at arm's length, was the cause of more than one victory. They were obliged, indeed, to make every bullet count in the days when even lead was not produced here, and powder was imported."
"October 13, the naval fight between the Frolic and Wasp took place, off the North Carolina coast. The Frolic was an English brig, and she wound up as most frolics do, with a severe pain and a five-dollar fine. After the Wasp had called and left her R. S. V. P. cards, the decks of the Frolic were a sight to behold. There were not enough able-bodied men to surrender the ship. She was captured by the boarding-crew, but there was not a man left of her own crew to haul down the colors."
"Other victories followed on the sea, and American privateers had more fun than anybody."
"Madison was re-elected, thus showing that his style of administration suited one and all, and the war was prosecuted at a great rate. It became a sort of fight with Canada, the latter being supported by English arms by land and sea. Of course the Americans would have preferred to fight England direct, and many were in favor of attacking London: but when the commanding officer asked those of the army who had the means to go abroad to please raise their right hands, it was found that the trip must be abandoned. Those who had the means to go did not have suitable clothes for making a respectable appearance, and so it was given up."
"Three divisions were made of the army, all having an attack on Canada as the object in view, viz., the army of the Centre, the army of the North, and the army of the West. The armies of the Centre and North did not do much, aside from the trifling victory at York, and President Madison said afterwards in a letter to the writer's family that the two armies did not accomplish enough to pay the duty on them. The army of the West managed to stand off the British, though the latter still held Michigan and threatened Ohio."
"September 10, Perry's victory on Lake Erie occurred, and was well received. Perry was twenty-seven years old, and was given command of a flotilla on Lake Erie, provided he would cut the timber and build it, meantime boarding himself. The British had long been in possession of Lake Erie, and when Perry got his scows afloat they issued invitations for a general display of carnage. They bore down on Perry and killed all the men on his flag-ship but eight. Then he helped them fire the last gun, and with the flag they jumped into a boat which they paddled for the Niagara under a galling fire. This was the first time that a galling fire had ever been used at sea. Perry passed within pistol-shot of the British, and in less than a quarter of an hour after he trod the poop of the Niagara he was able to write to General Harrison, ""We have met the enemy, and they are ours."""
"Proctor and Tecumseh were at Malden, with English and Indians, preparing to plunder the frontier and kill some more women and children as soon as they felt rested up. At the news of Perry's victory, Harrison decided to go over and stir them up. Arriving at Malden, he found it deserted, and followed the foe to the river Thames, where he charged with his Kentucky horsemen right through the British lines and so on down the valley, where they reformed and started back to charge on their rear, when the whole outfit surrendered except the Indians. Proctor, however, was mounted on a tall fox-hunter which ran away with him. He afterwards wrote back to General Harrison that he made every effort to surrender personally, but that circumstances prevented. He was greatly pained by this."
"The Americans now charged on the Indians, and Johnson, the commander of the Blue Grass Dragoons, fired a shot which took Tecumseh just west of the watch-pocket. He died, he said, tickled to death to know that he had been shot by an American."
"Captain Lawrence, of the Hornet, having taken the British brig Peacock, was given command of the Chesapeake, which he took to Boston to have repaired. While there, he got a challenge from the Shannon. He put to sea with half a crew, and a shot in his chest that is, the arm-chest of the ship burst the whole thing open and annoyed every one on board. The enemy boarded the Chesapeake and captured her, so Captain Lawrence, her brave commander, breathed his last, after begging his men not to give up the ship."
"However, the victories on the Canadian border settled the war once more for the time, and cheered the Americans very much."
"The Indians in 1813 fell upon Fort Mimms and massacred the entire garrison, men, women, and children, not because they felt a personal antipathy towards them, but because they the red brothers had sold their lands too low and their hearts were sad in their bosoms. There is really no fun in trading with an Indian, for he is devoid of business instincts, and reciprocity with the red brother has never been a success."
"General Jackson took some troops and attacked the red brother, killing six hundred of him and capturing the rest of the herd. Jackson did not want to hear the Indians speak pieces and see them smoke the pipe of peace, but buried the dead and went home. He had very little of the romantic complaint which now and then breaks out regarding the Indian, but knew full well that all the Indians ever born on the face of the earth could not compensate for the cruel and violent death of one good, gentle, patient American mother."
Admiral Cockburn now began to pillage the coast of the Southern States and borrow communion services from the churches of Virginia and the Carolinas. He also murdered the sick in their beds.
"""I'm here with a message from your mistress, Betty.  Keep your head;"
"don't look round, but listen to me.  She's at Bury Street and going to"
"stay there; she wants you and baby and the dogs.""  The stout woman's eyes"
grew round and her mouth opened.  Winton put his hand on the
"perambulator.  ""Steady, now!  Go out as usual with this thing.  It's"
about your time; and wait for me at the turning to Regent's Park.  I'll
come on in my cab and pick you all up.  Don't get flurried; don't take
"anything; do exactly as you usually would. Understand?"""
It is not in the nature of stout women with babies in their charge to
"receive such an order without question.  Her colour, and the heaving of"
that billowy bosom made Winton add quickly:
"""Now, Betty, pull yourself together; Gyp wants you.  I'll tell you all"
"about it in the cab."""
"The poor woman, still heaving vaguely, could only stammer:"
"""Yes, sir.  Poor little thing!  What about its night-things?  And Miss"
"Gyp's?"""
"Conscious of that figure still at the window, Winton made some passes"
"with his fingers at the baby, and said:"
"""Never mind them.  As soon as you see me at the drawing-room window, get"
"ready and go.  Eyes front, Betty; don't look round; I'll cover your"
"retreat!  Don't fail Gyp now.  Pull yourself together."""
"With a sigh that could have been heard in Kensington, Betty murmured:"
"""Very well, sir; oh dear!"" and began to adjust the strings of her bonnet."
"With nods, as if he had been the recipient of some sage remarks about the"
"baby, Winton saluted, and began his march again towards the house.  He"
"""Sidney Romley, you're _crazy_!"" cried Aunt Achsa, in a quavering"
"voice. ""Go away! How _can_ he go away when we ain't even the money to"
"go 'sfar as Orleans. And he ain't plannin' to go on anyone's _charity_!"""
"""Oh, I don't mean he's going away _soon_! I shouldn't have told anyway"
for Lav told me as a secret. But I thought maybe it would make you
happier knowing he had great ambitions. And he'll tell you sometime
"himself."""
"When Aunt Achsa spoke it was in a thin, grieved voice."
"""It's what I didn't want him to ever take into his head. Goin' off"
"somewhere--alone. For I'm too old to go with him and he'll need me!"""
"""Oh I wouldn't have told you if I'd thought it would make you unhappy."
"He won't go for a long time, Aunt Achsa. And when he does he'll come"
"back real often."""
Now Aunt Achsa sat so still that Sidney thought she had consoled her.
But Aunt Achsa was facing in her own way this at which Sidney had
"hinted, drawing for it from that courage of hers that had not yet been"
"exhausted. Well, if it was best for Lavender some day to go away she'd"
"send him away with a smile even though the heart that had taken him, a"
"wee baby, from the dying mother did burst with loneliness. Besides,"
even if Lavender went away she could go on praying to the Lord to keep
"him ""happy""--no distance could keep her from doing that!"
"""It's like as not his plans in his head that's makin' him act so quiet"
like and short-spoken. And last night he didn't sleep in his bed at
"all!"""
"""Why, Aunt Achsa, where _was_ he?"" gasped Sidney, really startled."
"""Oh, I don't know,"" Sidney laughed. ""I'm all mixed up. I guess I was"
"trying to say something Mr. Dugald said once to me."""
"""Oh, _Dug_!"" laughed Pola. ""He's nutty about all that! Look at the way"
he lives here on the Cape. But mother says he'll get over it when he
marries. Now I have no intention of getting serious this grand day so
"let's have another piece of that chocolate fudge cake--it's on me, too,"
"remember!"" Which was Pola's pretty way of pretending she did not know"
that Sidney did not have any money with her. The dollar Sidney had
earned for posing had long since been spent.
"Sidney was relieved that Pola had rescued her from the ""deep water."" At"
the same time she suffered from the sense that she had not made Pola
see Mart in another light. She had failed in loyalty. The sparkling
blue of the bay that stretched before them only reminded her that this
"was the hour she usually went swimming. Due to Pola's ""complex"" she had"
not gone swimming for a whole week.
"Even with her mouth full of the fudge cake, she vowed to herself that"
the very next day she would hunt out her chums and her old pastimes.
Pola and Mr. Dugald must plan without her!
She had promised to dine again at the hotel with Pola and her mother
but as soon as she could after dinner she returned to Sunset Lane.
Because of her determination her heart was lighter. And her way was
"made easier, too, for Mrs. Allan had told Pola at dinner that the"
"""Truxtons were at Chatham Bars."" Pola had been as excited over the"
Truxtons as her mother.
"""Can we go and see them right away?"""
"""Not tonight. But I have arranged for a car and Shields will drive us"
"for some word of Lavender, but the words failed in her throat. Cold,"
"forlorn, hungry, she crept to her room, threw off her clothes and"
huddled down into the bed-clothes.
"They would all blame her--Miss Vine and Mr. Dugald, Aunt Achsa, Doctor"
Blackwell. Probably now Pola would have more complexes to suffer;
Pola's mother would be angry and they could never be friends again. And
Mart--Aunt Achsa had said old Mrs. Calkins could be terrible when she
"was ""worked up!"" Even if Lavender lived Aunt Achsa would never forgive"
her and if he _didn't_ live--Mr. Dugald had said he was fighting. Those
boards creaking faintly meant that Doctor Blackwell and Aunt Achsa were
helping Lavender fight. Dear old Lav with his fine dreams!
The desperate longing for Trude shook her. She sobbed into her pillow.
And yet the longing brought only added remorse. Trude would scold her.
Trude would take her home. That meant stinging humiliation. How Vick
would laugh at her when everything was over. A case of rum! Sidney
writhed under the soft covers.
Somewhere boards creaked again--Lavender's fight. Sidney pictured the
doctor and Aunt Achsa bending over him. And outside everything was so
"quiet and gray. That was the way death probably came, Sidney thought."
On the morrow they would send her home--in disgrace. She might not even
"be allowed to see Lavender, or Mart, or Pola--or Mr. Dugald. Someone"
would telegraph to Trude and Trude would meet her back at Middletown.
"She would live a long, sad life of penance behind the crumbing stone"
wall she had so detested.
But the thought of the wall and the shelter of the old house brought
such a surcease of torment that the girl had fallen into a heavy sleep.
When she wakened it was to a consciousness of bright sunshine--and
'Where is Marie?' I cried.
She did not answer. No one answered; and I knew. Steve swore again. I
think he had known from the beginning. I began to tremble. On a sudden
my lady lifted up her voice and cried shrilly--
'Marie! Marie!'
Again no answer. But this time I did not wait to listen. I ran from
"them into the darkness the way we had come, my legs quivering under"
"me, and my mouth full of broken prayers. I remembered a certain"
"solitary tree fronting the poplars, on the other side of the way,"
"which I had marked mechanically at the moment of the fall--an ash,"
whose light upper boughs had come for an instant between my eyes and
"the sky. It stood on a little mound, where the moorland began to rise"
"on that side. I came to it now, and stopped and looked. At first I"
"could see nothing, and I trod forward fearfully. Then, a couple of"
"paces on, I made out a dark figure, lying head and feet across the"
"road. I sprang to it, and kneeling, passed my hands over it. Alas! it"
was a woman's.
"I raised the light form in my arms, crying passionately on her name,"
"while the wind swayed the boughs overhead, and, besides that and my"
"voice, all the countryside was still. She did not answer. She hung"
"limp in my arms. Kneeling in the dust beside her, I felt blindly for a"
"pulse, a heart-beat. I found neither--neither; the woman was dead."
And yet it was not that which made me lay the body down so quickly and
stand up peering round me. No; something else. The blood drummed in my
"ears, my heart beat wildly. The woman was dead; but she was not Marie."
"She was an old woman, sixty years old. When I stooped again, after"
house and garden. Surely you could be happy in—in—appreciating it for a
change. Or you could take up some hobby.”
"And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, “All men ought to have"
hobbies. It makes life impossible if they haven’t.”
"Well, well! He couldn’t help a grim smile as painfully he began to"
climb the hill that led into Harcourt Avenue. Where would Lola and her
"sisters and Charlotte be if he’d gone in for hobbies, he’d like to"
"know? Hobbies couldn’t pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow,"
"and their horses, and their golf, and the sixty-guinea gramophone in"
the music-room for them to dance to. Not that he grudged them these
"things. No, they were smart, good-looking girls, and Charlotte was a"
remarkable woman; it was natural for them to be in the swim. As a
"matter of fact, no other house in the town was as popular as theirs; no"
"other family entertained so much. And how many times old Mr. Neave,"
"pushing the cigar box across the smoking-room table, had listened to"
"praises of his wife, his girls, of himself even."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family. It’s like something one"
reads about or sees on the stage.”
"“That’s all right, my boy,” old Mr. Neave would reply. “Try one of"
those; I think you’ll like them. And if you care to smoke in the
"garden, you’ll find the girls on the lawn, I dare say.”"
"That was why the girls had never married, so people said. They could"
have married anybody. But they had too good a time at home. They were
"too happy together, the girls and Charlotte. H’m, h’m! Well, well."
Perhaps so....
By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue;
get the Marines to teach you--he asked no questions. With one word he
"called the guard to attention, and himself saluted me--me a private! I"
handed him my rifle--there was an inch of blood at the point of the
"bayonet--and hobbled off to the nearest ladder. My word, I could"
"scarcely walk, and as for climbing a ship's ladder--I could never have"
done if some one hadn't given me a boost behind and some one else a
hand at the top. The Commander and the Major of Marines were both in
"the wardroom; I walked in, saluted them as a self-respecting private"
"should do, and told them the whole story."""
"""It was Petty Officer Trehayne,"" said I calmly--and waited for a"
sensation.
"""Of course,"" replied Dawson, greatly to my annoyance. He might have"
"shown some astonishment at my wonderful intuition; but he didn't, not"
"a scrap. Even Cary was at first disappointing, though he warmed up"
"later, and did me full justice. ""Trehayne a spy!"" cried Cary. ""He"
"looked a smart good man."""
"""I am not saying that he wasn't,"" snapped Dawson, whose nerves were"
"very badly on edge. ""He was obeying the orders of his superiors as we"
"all have to do. He gave his life, and it was for his country's"
service. Nobody can do more than that. Don't you go for to slander
"Trehayne. I watched him die--on his feet."""
"Cary turned to me. ""What made you think it was Trehayne?"" he asked."
"This was better. I looked at Dawson, who was brooding in his chair"
with his thoughts far away. He was still seeing those eyes fading out
under the glare of the electrics between the steel decks of the
_Malplaquet_!
"""It was a sheer guess at first,"" said I, preserving a decent show of"
so damned easy?”
"“Tell us why you say that, Stellamaris,” said Herold."
"John rose suddenly and stood by the west window, which was closed."
Stella's high bed had been drawn next to the window open to the south.
"The room was warm, for a great fire blazed in the tall chimneypiece. He"
"rose to hide his eyes from Stella, confounding Herold for a marplot. Was"
this the way to make his task easier? He heard Stella say in her sweet
contralto:
“Do you imagine it 's just for silly foolishness I call you Great High
"Belovedest and Great High Favourite? You see, Walter dear, I gave John"
"his title before I knew you, so I had to make some difference in yours."
"But they mean everything to me. I live in the sky such a lot, and it's"
a beautiful life; but I know there 's another life in the great world--a
"beautiful life, too.” She wrinkled her forehead. “Oh, it 's so difficult"
"to explain! It's so hard to talk about feelings, because the moment you"
"begin to talk about them, the feelings become so vague. It's like trying"
to tell any one the shape of a sunset.” She paused for a moment or two;
Herold smiled at her and nodded encouragingly. Presently she went on:
"“I 'll try to put it this way. Often a gull, you see, comes hovering"
"outside here and looks in at me, oh, for a long time, with his round,"
"yellow eyes; and my heart beats, and I love him, for he tells me all"
"about the sea and sky and clouds, where I'll never go,--not really,--and"
"I live the sky life through him, and more than ever since you sent me"
that poem--I know it by heart--about the sea-gull. Who wrote it?”
"“Swinburne,” said Herold."
“Did he write anything else?”
"returned to their owners. To prevent Searle's doing such things again, he"
"was deprived of his ship's rudder and sails. In 1666, Searle, in company"
"with a Captain Stedman and a party of only eighty men, took the Island of"
"Tobago, near Trinidad, from the Dutch, destroying everything they could"
not carry away.
"SELKIRK, ALEXANDER. The original Robinson Crusoe."
"Born in 1676 at Largo in Fifeshire, he was the seventh son of John"
"Selcraig, a shoemaker. In 1695 he was cited to appear before the Session"
"for ""indecent conduct in church,"" but ran away to sea. In 1701 he was back"
"again in Largo, and was rebuked in the face of the congregation for"
"quarrelling with his brothers. A year later Selkirk sailed to England, and"
in 1703 joined Dampier's expedition to the South Seas. Appointed
"sailing-master to the _Cinque Ports_, commanded by Captain Stradling."
"In September, 1704, he arrived at the uninhabited island of Juan"
"Fernandez, in the South Pacific. Selkirk, having quarrelled with the"
"captain, insisted on being landed on the island with all his belongings."
"He lived alone here for nearly four years, building himself two cabins,"
"hunting the goats which abounded, and taming young goats and cats to be"
his companions.
"On the night of January 31st, 1709, seeing two ships, Selkirk lit a fire,"
and a boat was sent ashore. These ships were the _Duke_ and _Duchess_ of
"Bristol, under the command of Captain Woodes Rogers, while his old friend"
Dampier was acting as pilot. Selkirk was at once appointed sailing-master
"of the _Duchess_, and eventually arrived back in the Thames on October"
"14th, 1711, with booty worth £800, having been away from England for eight"
"years. While in England he met Steele, who described Selkirk as a ""man of"
"good sense, with strong but cheerful expression."" Whether Selkirk ever met"
"Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb"
"things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what _Women_"
like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting
"married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her"
wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.
"Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do"
"with me. I knew what Sis could say to _that_, but at least it was an"
argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.
"I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to"
"the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the"
"movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding"
"off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it"
must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose
"against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,"
Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!
"Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of"
blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the
"wall in glowing red letters were the words, ""Lifeboat 47. Passengers:"
"Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!"""
Another one of those signs.

I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out
the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked
under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get
into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I

"tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than"
"the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to"
"speak of, back in Undersea, but--yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as"
much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure

an uneasy feeling that he had been involved in something that he did not

"Gyp hardly slept at all.  Three times she got up, and, stealing to the"

"""Do your best, Dick,"" I implored.  ""Save her, for my sake."""
"""Rely upon me,"" he answered calmly, adding: ""Run along to Number 18 in"
the boulevard--the corner house on the right--and bring Doctor Trepard
"at once.  He lives au troisieme.  Tell him that I sent you, and that the"
"matter is one of life or death.""  He scribbled some words on a card,"
"and, giving it me, added: ""Tell him to bring this.  Meanwhile, I will"

"""But do you think she will really recover?""  I demanded."
"""I can't tell.  We have already lost so much time.  I had no idea of the"
truth.  It has surprised me just as it has surprised you.  This moment
"is not one for words, but for actions.  Don't lose an instant."""
"Thus urged, I snatched up my hat and tore along the boulevard like a"
"madman.  Without difficulty I found Trepard's appartement, and on being"
"admitted found him a grave-faced, rather stout old Frenchman, who, on"
the instant I mentioned Dick's name and gave him the card with the words
"upon it, naming some drugs he required, went into an adjoining room, and"
"fetched a phial of tiny red pillules, which he held up to the light."
"Then he put on his hat, and descended with me to the street.  A fiacre"
"was passing, which we took, and five minutes later we were standing"
Even Aileen had not been shot at with a pistol. And then Tildy rather
"hoped that he would not shoot at her, for she was always loyal to"
Aileen; and she did not want to overshadow her friend.
At 4 o’clock on the afternoon of the third day Mr. Seeders came in.
There were no customers at the tables. At the back end of the
restaurant Tildy was refilling the mustard pots and Aileen was
quartering pies. Mr. Seeders walked back to where they stood.
"Tildy looked up and saw him, gasped, and pressed the mustard spoon"
against her heart. A red hair-bow was in her hair; she wore Venus’s
"Eighth Avenue badge, the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver"
symbolic heart.
Mr. Seeders was flushed and embarrassed. He plunged one hand into his
hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie.
"“Miss Tildy,” said he, “I want to apologise for what I done the other"
"evenin’. Tell you the truth, I was pretty well tanked up or I wouldn’t"
of done it. I wouldn’t do no lady that a-way when I was sober. So I
"hope, Miss Tildy, you’ll accept my ’pology, and believe that I wouldn’t"
of done it if I’d known what I was doin’ and hadn’t of been drunk.”
"With this handsome plea Mr. Seeders backed away, and departed, feeling"
that reparation had been made.
But behind the convenient screen Tildy had thrown herself flat upon a
"table among the butter chips and the coffee cups, and was sobbing her"
heart out—out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with
blunt noses and hay-coloured hair. From her knot she had torn the red
hair-bow and cast it upon the floor. Seeders she despised utterly; she
had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who
"slow degrees. In the reign of Henry VIII, again, nothing came of"
"the English expeditions of discovery fitted out by him (Schanz,"
"_Englische Handelspolitik_, i, 321), but private voyages were"
"successfully made by traders (_id._ pp. 321, 327)."
"In the seventeenth century, however, and until far on in the"
"eighteenth, all Dutch shipping was more economically managed than"
the English. In all likelihood the Dutch traders knew and improved
upon the systematic control of ship-construction which the
"Venetians and Genoese had first copied from the Byzantines, and in"
"turn developed. (Above, p. 197.) Raleigh was one of the first to"
point out that the broad Dutch boats carried more cargo with fewer
hands than those of any other nation (_Observations touching
"Trade_, in _Works_, ed. 1829, viii, 356). Later in the century"
Petty noted that the Dutch practised freight-economies and
"adaptations of every kind, having different sorts of vessels for"
different kinds of traffic (_Essays in Political Arithmetic_
"[1690], ed. 1699, pp. 179, 180, 182, 183). This again gave them the"
primacy in shipbuilding for the whole of Europe (_Mémoires de Jean
"De Witt_, ptie. i, ch. vi), though they imported all the materials"
"for the purpose. When Colbert began navy-building, his first care"
"was to bring in Dutch shipwrights (Dussieux, _Étude biographique"
"sur Colbert_, 1886, p. 101). Compare, as to the quick sailing of"
"the Dutch, Motley, _United Netherlands_, ed. 1867, iv, 556. In the"
next century the English marine had similar economic advantages
"over the French, which was burdened by royal schemes for"
"multiplying seamen (see Tucker, _Essay on Trade_, 4th ed. p. 37)."
"The frugality which pervaded the whole of Dutch life may, however,"
have had one directly disastrous effect. Sir William Temple noted
that the common people were poorly fed (_Observations upon the
"United Provinces_, ch. iv: Works, ed. 1814, i, 133, 147); and"
"come to her mother's attention, assuring Sidney that she was absolutely"
the only one to whom she confided these deep intrigues. She had worn
Guy Townsend's fraternity pin the whole winter before and not a soul
had known whose pin it was for Guy was tabooed by mothers in general
and Mrs. Allan in particular. Now Pola was simply crazy over a Jack
"Sicard who was playing the lead in ""Hearts Aquiver."" But not even"
"Jack's manly beauty, as described by Pola, failed to draw from Sidney"
"more than a mild: ""He must be cute."" Pola gave way to vexation."
"""You're scarcely listening to me, Sidney Romley, when I'm telling you"
things I haven't told a _soul_! I believe you're still thinking of that
"ridiculous girl we met."""
"""She isn't ridiculous!"" Sidney was prompt enough now in Mart's defense."
"""She looks funny, but you see I've gotten well acquainted with her and"
"she's awfully nice."""
"""Oh, _nice_, of course! But _anyone_ can be nice! You know perfectly"
"well, Sidney, that there's as much class in this country as there is in"
"Europe and being _nice_ does not break down social barriers."""
Sidney had no answer ready for this. Curiously into her mind flashed
what Mr. Dugald had said about the solid aristocracy. But somehow she
knew Pola would not understand this. Pola went on:
"""I'm a dreadful little snob, anyway. But I suppose that is the result"
of my education. It would be funny to go to the most expensive schools
"and have all the culture that Europe can offer and _not_ be a snob."""
"Still Sidney stared into her teacup. She thought Pola was all wrong,"
but she did not know how to say it. Pola herself had told her that she
had gone to Grace Hall because it had no examinations and graduated a
"faculty for absorbing butter. The stomachs of most men, really good at"
"their business, would have revolted at the diet which his superiors"
"shovelled into Dawson, but he visibly expanded and blossomed. Yes,"
"Scotland Yard knew its Dawson, and exactly how to stimulate the best"
that was in him. He never bored me; I enjoyed him too thoroughly.
One day in my club I chanced upon the Admiral.
"""Have you met our friend Dawson lately?"" I asked."
"""Met him?"" shouted he, with a roar of laughter. ""Met him? He is in my"
office every day--he almost lives with me; goodness knows when he does
his work. He has a pocket full of letters which he has read to me till
I know them by heart. If I did not know that he was a first-class man
"I should set him down as a colossal ass. Yet, I rather wish that the"
Admiralty would sometimes write to me as the severe but very human
"Scotland Yard does to Dawson."""
"""Does he ever come to you in disguise?"" I asked."
"""Not that I know of. I see vast numbers of people; some of them may be"
"Dawson in his various incarnations, but he has not given himself"
"away."""
"Then I explained to my naval friend my own experience. ""He tried,"" I"
"said, ""to play the disguise game on me, and clean bowled me the first"
time. While he was laughing over my discomfiture I studied his face
more closely than a lover does that of his mistress. I tried to
penetrate his methods. He never wears a wig or false hair; he is too
wise for that folly. Yet he seems able to change his hair from light
"to dark, to make it lank or curly, short or long. He does it; how I"
"don't know. He alters the shape of his nose, his cheeks, and his chin."
"And then, in great mental agony, I said to myself: ""I _will_ be happy, I"
"_will_ enjoy my leave."" But a number of invisible cobwebs hung between"
"myself and the world around me. I tried to brush them away, but they"
were so impalpable that the movement of my hand did not disturb them at
all.
I gave up the attempt. I would wait until I got home. Then I would talk
and forget myself--only by forgetting myself would I enjoy the present.
Only those who forget themselves are happy. The obsession of self is
the most oppressive of all burdens.
I descended from a 'bus and took a train. A girl sitting opposite me
"stared at my blue chevrons and whispered to her fellow passenger: ""He's"
"just come from the front."" So I too was regarded as a strange kind of"
animal. I got out at my home-station. I showed my leave-warrant to the
ticket collector. He was a benevolent looking old man. He smiled and
wished me good luck. Things began to seem a little less foreign. And
then the thought of being home in a few minutes absorbed me entirely.
"I hurried down the street. I knocked at the door, and it opened. The"
long yearned-for meeting took place at last.
"I threw my pack, equipment and steel helmet contemptuously into a"
"corner. I took an infantile delight in clean, furnished rooms, in the"
"white table-cloth, the shining silver, the cut flowers, and the"
oil-paintings on the wall. And we talked until late into the night.
It was good to wake up the next morning and to know that the first day
of my leave was still before me. I felt encouraged to face my new
surroundings boldly. I would understand them and identify myself with
"them. If the sensation that I was dreaming came upon me again, I would"
would have served Philip well had Philip chosen him and trusted him. But
"as it lay in one thoroughly able man, well placed for prestige in a"
"crisis, to knit and establish a new nation, so it lay in one fanatical"
"dullard[782] to wreck half of his own empire, with the greatest captains"
of his age serving him; and to bring his fabled treasury to ruin while
his despised rebels grew rich.
"As to the vice of the Dutch constitution, the principle of the"
"supremacy of ""State rights,"" see M'Cullagh, p. 215; Motley, _Rise_,"
"pp. 794, 795 (Pt. vi, ch. ii, _end_), and _United Netherlands_, ed."
"1867, iv, 564. Wicquefort (_L'histoire des Provinces-Unies_, La"
"Haye, 1719, pp. 5, 16), following Grotius, laid stress long ago on"
"the fact that the Estates of each province recognised no superior,"
not even the entire body of the Republic. It was only the measure
of central government set up in the Burgundo-Austrian and Spanish
periods that made the Seven Provinces capable of enough united
action to repel Spanish rule during a chronic struggle of eighty
"years. Cp. Van Kampen (i, 304), who points out (p. 306) that the"
"word ""State"" first appears in Holland in the fifteenth century. It"
"arose in Flanders in the thirteenth, and in Brabant in the"
"fourteenth. Only in 1581, after some years of war, did the United"
Provinces set up a General Executive Council. In the same year the
"Prince of Orange was chosen sovereign (Motley, pp. 838, 841)."
§ 3. _The Supremacy of Dutch Commerce_
"The conquest of Flanders by Alexander of Parma, reducing its plains to"
"wolf-haunted wildernesses, and driving the great mass of the remaining"
"artisans from its ruined towns,[783] helped to consummate the prosperity"
"of the United Provinces, who took over the industry of Ghent with the"
commerce of Antwerp.[784] Getting the start of all northern Europe in
damage done to her property.
The two women readily agreed. In the curtailment of their movements
and the absence of normal means of communication their life at Villa
Beau-séjour was belying its name. Their supply of money was coming
to an end; attempts must be made to regularize that position by
drawing on Mrs. Warren's German investments and the capital she
still had in Belgian stock--if that were negotiable at all.
Where should they go? Mrs. Warren still had some lien on the Hotel
"Édouard-Sept (the name, out of deference to the Germans, had been"
changed to Hotel Impérial). With the influence of the Government
Secretary behind her she might turn out some of its occupants and
"regain the use of the old ""appartement."" This would accommodate"
Vivie too. And there was no reason why their friend should not place
"his own lodging and office at the same hotel, which was situated"
conveniently on the Rue Royale not far from the Governor's residence
in the Rue de la Loi.
"So this plan was carried out. And in December, 1914, Mrs. Warren had"
"some brief flicker of happiness once more, and even Vivie felt the"
nightmare had lifted a little. It was life again. Residence at the
Villa Beau-séjour had almost seemed an entombment of the living.
"Here, in the heart of Brussels, at any rate, you got some news every"
"day, even if much of it was false. The food supply was more certain,"
"there were 700,000 people all about you. True, the streets were very"
badly lit at night and fuel was scarce and dear. But you were in
contact with people.
"In January, Vivie tried to get into touch with the American"
"Legation, not only to send news of their condition to England but to"
ascertain whether permission might not be obtained for them to leave
and appeared to have been recently rough-dried and starched. He was too
diffident to aspire to Aileen’s notice; so he usually sat at one of
"Tildy’s tables, where he devoted himself to silence and boiled"
weakfish.
One day when Mr. Seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer.
There were only two or three customers in the restaurant. When Mr.
"Seeders had finished his weakfish he got up, put his arm around Tildy’s"
"waist, kissed her loudly and impudently, walked out upon the street,"
"snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry, and hied himself"
to play pennies in the slot machines at the Amusement Arcade.
For a few moments Tildy stood petrified. Then she was aware of Aileen
"shaking at her an arch forefinger, and saying:"
"“Why, Til, you naughty girl! Ain’t you getting to be awful, Miss"
Slyboots! First thing I know you’ll be stealing some of my fellows. I
"must keep an eye on you, my lady.”"
Another thing dawned upon Tildy’s recovering wits. In a moment she had
"advanced from a hopeless, lowly admirer to be an Eve-sister of the"
"potent Aileen. She herself was now a man-charmer, a mark for Cupid, a"
Sabine who must be coy when the Romans were at their banquet boards.
Man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable. The sudden
"and amatory Seeders had, as it were, performed for her a miraculous"
piece of one-day laundry work. He had taken the sackcloth of her
"uncomeliness, had washed, dried, starched and ironed it, and returned"
it to her sheer embroidered lawn—the robe of Venus herself.
The freckles on Tildy’s cheeks merged into a rosy flush. Now both Circe
and Psyche peeped from her brightened eyes. Not even Aileen herself had
been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant.
"this, and all will be well.'"
"So the woman went forth with a light heart. It was so simple, only a"
"pinch of mustard-seed, and mustard grew in every garden. She would get"
"the seed and be back very quickly, and then the Lord Buddha would give"
her back those she loved who had died. She clothed herself again and
"tied up her hair, and went cheerfully and asked at the first house,"
"'Give me a pinch of mustard-seed,' and it was given readily. So with her"
treasure in her hand she was going forth back to the Buddha full of
"delight, when she remembered."
"'Has ever anyone died in your household?' she asked, looking round"
wistfully.
"The man answered 'Yes,' that death had been with them but recently. Who"
"could this woman be, he thought, to ask such a question? And the woman"
"went forth, the seed dropping from her careless fingers, for it was of"
"no value. So she would try again and again, but it was always the same."
"Death had taken his tribute from all. Father or mother, son or brother,"
"daughter or wife, there was always a gap somewhere, a vacant place"
"beside the meal. From house to house throughout the city she went, till"
"at last the new hope faded away, and she learned from the world, what"
"she had not believed from the Buddha, that death and life are one."
"So she returned, and she became a nun, poor soul! taking on her the two"
"hundred and twenty-seven vows, which are so hard to keep that nowadays"
nuns keep but five of them.[1]
"This is the teaching of the Buddha, that death is inevitable; this is"
"the consolation he offers, that all men must know death; no one can"
escape death; no one can escape the sorrow of the death of those whom he
"from the side she had just left; and, looking round, she saw with terror"
"a great eagle sweep down upon the baby, and carry it off in its claws."
"She turned round and waved her arms and cried out to the eagle, 'He!"
he!' hoping it would be frightened and drop the baby. But it cared
"nothing for her cries or threats, and swept on with long curves over the"
"forest trees, away out of sight."
"Then the mother turned to gain the bank once more, and suddenly she"
missed her son who had been waiting for her. He had seen his mother wave
"her arms; he had heard her shout, and he thought she was calling him to"
"come to her. So the brave little man walked down into the water, and the"
"black current carried him off his feet at once. He was gone, drowned in"
"the deep water below the ford, tossing on the waves towards the sea."
No one can write of the despair of the girl when she threw herself under
a tree in the forest. The song says it was very terrible.
"At last she said to herself, 'I will get up now and return to my father"
in Thawatti; he is all I have left. Though I have forsaken him all these
"years, yet now that my husband and his children are dead, my father will"
"take me back again. Surely he will have pity on me, for I am much to be"
pitied.'
"So she went on, and at length, after many days, she came to the gates of"
the great city where her father lived.
"At the entering of the gates she met a large company of people,"
"mourners, returning from a funeral, and she spoke to them and asked"
them:
'Who is it that you have been burying to-day so grandly with so many
mourners?'
discovered in him by the patient searcher. She insisted upon sitting
next to him and in holding his hand when it was not employed in
conveying food to his mouth. She was startled at first by the
"discussion upon the prisons most suitable for me, but quickly became"
reconciled to the idea of a temporary separation.
"""Colonel Dawson,"" she asked. ""When daddy is in prison, may I come and"
"see him sometimes. Mother and me?"" Dawson gripped his hair--we were"
"the maddest crew!--and replied. ""Of course you shall, Miss Jane, as"
"often as you like."""
"""Thank you, Colonel Dawson; you are a nice man. I love you. Now show"
"me the handcuffs in your pocket."""
For the second time that day poor Dawson blushed. He must have
regretted many times that he had mentioned to me those unfortunate
darbies. Now amid much laughter he was compelled to draw forth a
pretty shining pair of steel wristlets and permit Jane to put them on.
They were much too large for her; she could slip them on and off
"without unlocking; but as toys they were a delight. ""I shouldn't mind"
"being a prisoner,"" she declared, ""if dear Colonel Dawson took me up."""
"We were sitting upon the fire-guard after luncheon, dallying over our"
"coffee, when Jane demanded to be shown a real arrest. ""Show me how you"
"take up a great big man like Daddy."""
"Then came a surprise, which for a moment had so much in it of bitter"
realism that it drove the blood from my wife's cheeks. I could not
follow Dawson's movements; his hands flickered like those of a
"conjurer, there came a sharp click, and the handcuffs were upon my"
"wrists! I stared at them speechless, wondering how they got there,"
"and, looking up, met the coldly triumphant eyes of the detective. I"
and I can’t for the life of me see an earthly way of scraping the
money together. Last of all--and worst of all--I haven’t been able to
make a single sale of lumber for the simple reason that the trust has
cut prices below cost and has taken every customer from us. If I cut
to meet them they go lower. You can see that. They’ve got the stock
"and the resources. Crane’s set out to ruin us at any cost, and he’s"
"succeeded. It hurts like sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left"
to do but give in and make the best terms we can. Let me hear from you
"at once. Yours ever, John Tweedy."
CHAPTER XI. NO QUITTER
"The letter dropped into Bob’s lap, and for a long minute he sat staring"
"into the yellow, dancing flames. His face was blank, and just a little"
"white, for the blow had been a heavy one, and totally unexpected. He"
"could not seem to understand it. It was unbelievable that he and Tweedy,"
"who had been fair and square in every one of their business dealings,"
could be forced to the wall by such a monster of corruption as Elihu
Crane.
There must be some mistake. Tweedy must have been thrown into one of his
"unjustifiable panics. That was it, of course."
Bob picked up the letter to read it carefully again.
"He perused it to the last word, and then leaned back against the"
"sapling, his face drawn and somber. It really did not sound like a"
"mistake. It was all clear and logical, and singularly cohesive. It was"
the sort of thing Crane would delight in planning and putting into
execution--the cutting of prices on a competitor. Tweedy had written
"that if they attempted to cut under the trust’s present rates, there"
"""The law is on my side...  I can even demand two thousand.  I can"
insist on your pulling down the building ... and enforce it too.  That
"is why my claim is so small. I demand that you should pull it down!"""
"""Very well.  Probably we shall do so ... after three years, and after"
"having dragged you into enormous law expenses.  And then, having paid"
"up, we shall open our public-house and you will be ruined ..."
annihilated like the Swedes at Poltava.  We shall see that you are
ruined ... we will take good care of that.  We could have begun to
"arrange about a public-house now, but you see our time is valuable, and"
besides we are sorry for you.  Why should we take the bread out of your
"mouth without any reason?"""
"Egor Terentievitch looked at his guest, clenching his teeth, and felt"
"that he was master of the situation, and held his fate in his hands."
"Vaviloff was full of pity for himself at having to deal with this calm,"
cruel figure in the checked suit.
"""And being such a near neighbour you might have gained a good deal by"
"helping us, and we should have remembered it too.  Even now, for"
"instance, I should advise you to open a small shop for tobacco, you"
"know, bread, cucumbers, and so on...  All these are sure to be in great"
"demand."""
"Vaviloff listened, and being a clever man, knew that to throw himself"
upon the enemy's generosity was the better plan.  It was as well to
"begin from the beginning, and, not knowing what else to do to relieve"
"his mind, the soldier began to swear at Kuvalda."
"""Curses be upon your head, you drunken rascal!  May the Devil take you!"""
"""Do you mean the lawyer who composed your petition?"" asked Petunikoff,"
the Government regulations as to curricula. A good teacher was not
troubled by such matters.
"83,660. (Mr. Sly). There was no scope for the employment of non-Indians"
in the high schools as apart from the colleges. It was in the
professorial line that more help from the West was required.
"83,661. (Mr. Gokhale). The witness knew of three instances in which the"
colonies had secured distinguished men on salaries which were lower than
these given to officers of the Indian Educational Service. One was at
"Toronto, another was in New Zealand and the third at Yale university."
The salaries on the two latter cases were £600 and £500 a year. The same
held good as regards Japan. The facts there had been stated in a
"Government of India publication as follows: ""Subsequent to 1895 there"
"were 67 Professors recruited in Europe and America, of those, 20 came"
"from Germany, 16 from England and 16 from the United States. The average"
pay was £384. In the highest Imperial University the average pay is
"£684. As soon as Japanese could be found to do the work, even tolerably"
"well, the foreigner was dropped."""
"83,662. When the witness first started work in India, he found that"
"there was no physical laboratory, or any grant made for a practical"
experimental course. He had to construct instruments with the help of
"local mechanics, whom he had to train. All this took him ten years. He"
then undertook original investigation at his own expense. The Royal
Society became specially interested in his work and desired to give him
a Parliamentary grant for its continuation. It was after this that the
Government of Bengal came forward and offered him facilities for
research.
"83,663. In the Educational Service he would take men of achievement from"
anywhere; but men of promise he would take from his own country.
realised then exactly how the professional manhunter glares at the
"prey into whom, after many days, he has set his claws. My wife gasped"
"and clutched at my elbow, little Jane screamed, and for a few seconds"
even I thought that the game had been played and that serious business
"was about to begin. Dawson gave us a few seconds of apprehension, and"
"then laughed grimly. From his waistcoat pocket he drew a key, and the"
fetters were removed almost as quickly as they had been clapped on.
"""Tit for tat,"" said he. ""You have had your fun with me. Fair play is a"
"jewel."""
"Little Jane was the first to recover speech. ""I knew that dear Colonel"
"Dawson was only playing,"" she cried. ""He only did it to please me."
"Thank you, Colonel, though you did frighten me just a weeny bit at"
"first."" And pulling him down towards her she kissed him heartily upon"
his prickly cheek. It was a queer scene.
"The door bell rang loudly, and we were informed that a policeman stood"
"without who was inquiring for Chief Inspector Dawson. ""Show him in"
"here,"" said I. The constable entered, and his manner of addressing my"
guest--that of a raw second lieutenant towards a general of
division--shed a new light upon Dawson's pre-eminence in his Service.
"""A telegram for you, sir."" Dawson seized it, was about to tear it"
"open, remembered suddenly his hostess, and bowed towards her. ""Have I"
"your permission, madam?"" he asked. She smiled and nodded; I turned"
"away to conceal a laugh. ""Good,"" cried Dawson, poring over the"
"message. ""I think, Mr. Copplestone, that you had better telephone to"
"your office and say that you are unavoidably detained."""
"""What--what is it?"" cried my wife, who had again become white with"
sudden fear.
"""Something which will occupy the attention of your husband and myself"
"'Can you do anything,' I asked, 'to cheer him? Do you speak to him of"
"what may happen after death, of hopes of another life?'"
"'No one can tell,' said my friend, 'what will happen after death. It"
"depends on a man's life, if he has done good or evil, what his next"
"existence will be, whether he will go a step nearer to the Peace. When"
"the man is dying no monks will come, truly; but an old man, an old"
"friend, father, perhaps, or an elder of the village, and he will talk to"
"the dying man. He will say, ""Think of your good deeds; think of all that"
"you have done well in this life. Think of your good deeds.""'"
'What is the use of that?' I asked. 'Suppose you think of your good
"deeds, what then? Will that bring peace?'"
The Burman seemed to think that it would.
"'Nothing,' he said, 'was so calming to a man's soul as to think of even"
one deed he had done well in his life.'
"Think of the man dying. The little house built of bamboo and thatch,"
"with an outer veranda, where the friends are sitting, and the inner"
"room, behind a wall of bamboo matting, where the man is lying. A pot of"
"flowers is standing on a shelf on one side, and a few cloths are hung"
here and there beneath the brown rafters. The sun comes in through
"little chinks in roof and wall, making curious lights in the"
"semi-darkness of the room, and it is very hot."
"From outside come the noises of the village, cries of children playing,"
"grunts of cattle, voices of men and women clearly heard through the"
still clear air of the afternoon. There is a woman pounding rice near
"by with a steady thud, thud of the lever, and there is a clink of a loom"
During this interview Rollo had stood absent-mindedly with his hand
"pressed on Concha's, as he listened to the strange speech of La Giralda."
Even his acquaintance with the language of the gipsies of Granada had
only enabled him to understand a word here and there. The girl's colour
"slowly returned, but the fear of the plague still ran like ice in her"
"veins. She who feared nothing else on earth, was shaken as with a palsy"
"by the terror of the Black Death, so paralysing was the fear that the"
very name of cholera laid upon insanitary Spain.
"""Well?"" said Rollo, turning to La Giralda, who stood considering with"
"her eyes upon the ground, after her interview with the crook-backed"
dwarf.
"""You must give me time to think,"" she said; ""this boy is one of our"
"people--a Gitano of Baza. He is not of this place, and he tells me"
strange things. He swears that the Queen and the court are plague-stayed
at La Granja by fear of the cholera. They dare not return to Madrid.
They cannot supply themselves with victuals where they are. The very
guards forsake them. And the Gitanos of the hills--but I have no right
"to tell that to the foreigner--the Gorgio. For am not I also a Gitana?"""
*       *       *       *       *
The village where Rollo's command first stumbled upon this dreadful fact
"was called Frias, in the district of La Perla, and lies upon the eastern"
"spurs of the Guadarrama. It was, therefore, likely enough then that the"
"boy spoke truth, and that within a few miles of them the Court of Spain"
was enduring privations in its aerial palace of La Granja.
But even when interrogated by El Sarria the old woman remained
obstinately silent as to the news concerning her kinsfolk which she had
from a German mercantile sub-marine. So he says. Fifty francs a
"metre--very, very wide. But they are too much trouble to carry in a"
"knapsack, though their brilliance fascinates."
*       *       *       *       *
"So we stroll and look at the shops, at the filigree gold jewelling of"
"the peasants, at a good bookshop. But there is little to see and"
"therefore the question is, shall we go on? Shall we go forward?"
There are two ways of leaving Cagliari for the north: the State railway
"that runs up the west side of the island, and the narrow-gauge secondary"
railway that pierces the centre. But we are too late for the big trains.
"So we will go by the secondary railway, wherever it goes."
"There is a train at 2.30, and we can get as far as Mandas, some fifty"
miles in the interior. When we tell the queer little waiter at the
"hotel, he says he comes from Mandas, and there are two inns. So after"
lunch--a strictly fish menu--we pay our bill. It comes to sixty odd
"francs--for three good meals each, with wine, and the night's lodging,"
"this is cheap, as prices now are in Italy."
"Pleased with the simple and friendly Scala di Ferre, I shoulder my sack"
and we walk off to the second station. The sun is shining hot this
"afternoon--burning hot, by the sea. The road and the buildings look dry"
"and desiccated, the harbour rather weary and end of the world."
There is a great crowd of peasants at the little station. And almost
every man has a pair of woven saddle-bags--a great flat strip of
"coarse-woven wool, with flat pockets at either end, stuffed with"
purchases. These are almost the only carrying bags. The men sling them
"over their shoulder, so that one great pocket hangs in front, one"
announced that the prisoner had been placed in cell No. 2. Dawson
"sprang up. ""We will have a look at him through the peephole, and if it"
"is our man--"" One glance was enough. Before me I saw him whom I had"
expected to see. He and his cargo of whisky bottles had reached the
"last stage of their long journey; at one end had been peace, reasonable"
"prosperity, and a happy home; at the other was, perhaps, a rope or a"
bullet.
"Dawson began once more to descant upon his own astuteness, but I was"
too sick at heart to listen. I remembered only the visit years before
"which that man's wife had paid to me. ""Will you not open the parcel?"""
"I interposed. He fell upon it, exposed its contents of bread,"
"chocolate, and sardine tins, and called for a can opener. He shook the"
"tins one by one beside his ear, and then, selecting that which gave"
"out no ""flop"" of oil, stripped it open, plunged his fingers inside,"
and pulled forth a clammy mess of putty and sawdust. In a moment he
had come upon a paper which after reading he handed to me. It bore the
"words in English, ""Informant arrested: dare not send more."""
"""What a fool!"" cried Dawson. ""As if the evidence against him were not"
"sufficient already he must give us this."""
"""You will let that poor devil of a draughtsman down easily?"" I"
murmured.
"""We want him as a witness,"" replied Dawson. ""Tit for tat. If he helps"
"us, we will help him. And now we will cut along to the Admiral. He is"
"eager for news."""
"We broke in upon the Admiral in his office near the shipyards, and he"
"greeted me with cheerful badinage. ""So you are in the hands of the"
"police at last, Copplestone. I always told you what would be the end"
"fain hope that some day I may see him again."""
"""You had speech with him?  You saw his manner and his port?  Tell"
"me—show me—how did he carry himself?"""
"Grey rose to his feet, laughing.  He humoured the whim of the old actor."
"He was not lacking in the histrionic gift, and threw himself into his"
"part with good will.  He uttered quick commands, as though to his"
"officers; he threw out his arms, as though directing one man here,"
"another there.  He recalled numbers of words spoken by the General, and"
these he reproduced faithfully and with an excellent imitation of
"Marlborough’s polished, courteous, yet commanding air.  Then he let his"
"face soften, and addressed the old man as he himself had been addressed,"
"with words of thanks and with promises of friendship.  Finally, throwing"
"off the mask, he broke into a laugh, and was astonished at the eager"
change which had come upon the Old Lion.
"""Boy!"" he cried, with a new access of energy, ""I trow I see for both of"
"us a way to fame and fortune."""
Grey’s eyes lighted as he eagerly asked his meaning.
"""That is soon told.  Have you heard how, after the victory of Blenheim,"
none could be found to hymn the praises of the great General till the
"poet Addison was introduced to notice, and penned his immortal lines?"
"Now, since the victory of Ramillies, I have burned with desire to show"
the world by somewhat more than verse alone the power and genius of
"England’s mighty soldier.  See here!"""
"The old man rose and crossed to his table, where he fetched from a"
"drawer a scroll covered with writing, which he put in the hands of his"
"companion.  Grey saw that it was a dialogue cast in dramatic form, and"
Our talk began over Mr. Bruce Smith's notice of motion in the Australian
Parliament.
"'Yes, I have seen the proposal,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'and I am very"
glad an Australian representative has taken up the question. He proposes
to amend the Immigration Restriction Act so as to permit Japanese to
enter the Commonwealth. The reason given is that Japan has placed
"herself in the front rank of nations, has granted religious freedom, has"
"established consulates, and become the honoured ally of Great Britain. I"
understand that Australian papers are saying there is no chance of the
motion being carried. I care not whether the motion is carried or not
this time. Of one thing I am certain--it will be carried eventually.
'What reason has Australia for shutting out the Japanese?'
"'The dread of cheaper labour and of the ""Yellow Peril,"" as it is called."
"Whatever there be in that, it certainly does not apply to the Japanese."
"This is already being realised in Australia, as Mr. Bruce Smith's motion"
shows. The Japanese are making it clear that they have to be regarded by
Europeans in a different light from the rest of Asiatics. Europeans
consider themselves superior to all other races. I do not blame them for
"thinking that, for of modern civilisations theirs is certainly the best."
"But with the exception of the British people, Europeans have not yet"
realised that modern Japan is built up on European methods. She has no
"more to do with the so-called ""Yellow Peril"" than America has. She takes"
"her place by the side of the other powers, with very much the same"
civilisation as theirs. England having been the first to recognise the
"new Japan, I am certain her colonies will soon follow. That is why I"
feel it is only a question of time before Australia excludes Japan from
its Restriction Act.'
to prevent me. I had only to lie close among the rocks until Count
"Hugo left, and then I might plod back on foot and search as I pleased."
"In a flash I saw the poplars, and the road running beneath the"
"ash-tree, and the woman's body lying stiff and stark on the sward. And"
I burned to be there.
Left to myself I should have gone too. But the plan was no sooner
"formed than shattered. While I stood, hotfoot to be about it, and"
"pausing only to consider which way I could steal off most safely, a"
"rustling warned me that some one was coming, and before I could stir,"
a burly trooper broke through the bushes and confronted me. He saluted
me stolidly.
"'Sergeant,' he said, 'the general is waiting for you.'"
'The general?' I said.
"'The Count, if you like it better,' he answered. 'Come, if you"
please.'
"I followed him, full of vexation. It was but a step into the road. The"
"moment I appeared, some one gave the word 'Mount!' A horse was thrust"
"in front of me, two or three troopers who still remained afoot swung"
themselves into the saddle; and I followed their example. In a trice
"we were moving down the valley at a dull, steady pace--southwards,"
"southwards. I looked back, and saw the fir trees and rocks where we"
"had lain hidden, and then we turned a corner, and they were gone."
"Gone, and all round me I heard the measured tramp of the troop-horses,"
"the swinging tones of the men, and the clink and jingle of sword and"
"spur. I called myself a cur, but I went on, swept away by the force of"
"numbers, as the straw by the current. Once I caught Count Hugo's eye"
"fixed on me, and I fancied he had a message for me, but I failed to"
"to Slyne's; both of whom met it without winking, although Captain Dove"
was no doubt glad of the protection of his smoked glasses.
"""I'll have to go through the proofs, of course,"" said his lordship"
"reflectively and let his gaze rest on Sallie again. ""But--if"
"everything's as you say, I don't think it will be long before Lady"
Josceline finds herself in full enjoyment of all her rights and
"privileges. If everything's as you say, I'll do whatever lies in my"
power to expedite matters; I think I can promise you that the case will
"be called immediately the vacation is over. Meanwhile, however, and till"
"I have looked through the proofs, I can make no further order."""
"He rose, and they also got up from their chairs as he came round from"
"behind his desk and confronted Sallie, a tall, stooping old man with a"
wrinkled face and tired but kindly eyes.
"She looked up into them frankly, and he laid a hand on her shoulder."
"""Yours has been a very sad history so far, my dear young lady,"" he said,"
"his head on one side, still studying her. ""I hope it will be all the"
brighter henceforth. I knew--the last Earl of Jura--when we were both
"young men--before he married. You remind me of him, as he was then, in"
"many respects. Good day to you now; my time here is not my own, you"
"know. But some day, perhaps you will allow me to pay my respects to"
"you--at Justicehall, since we're to be neighbours; my own home isn't"
"very far from yours."""
"Outside in the corridor, Mr. Jobling shook hands rapturously with every"
"one, even with Captain Dove."
"""We've turned the trick already,"" he declared. ""You heard what his"
"lordship said. With him on our side, the whole thing's as good as"
and waited in the field. But this time there were several further
shell-bursts. No dull boom in the distance followed by a long-drawn
"whine, but only the earth and smoke thrown darkly up and then the"
deafening double detonation.
"The next day more shells came over, and the next day also."
The big holes with their earthen rims began to dot the fields in many
"places. No damage of ""military importance"" had been done. Not even a"
"soldier had been killed, but only an inoffensive cow."
"At night the sky was alive with the whirr of propellers, and shells"
whistled overhead and burst a long way off.
"One Sunday, toward the end of March, when we had a half-holiday, I"
walked up the hill that was crowned by a large monastery and sat down
on the slope by a group of sallows. They were in full bloom. A swarm of
bees and flies were buzzing round. Peacock and Tortoiseshell butterflies
were flitting to and fro. The sunlight filtered down through the bluish
haze. I rested and let an hour or two slip by. Then I got up and crossed
a little brook and strolled along a narrow path that wound its way
"through a copse. The ground was starred with wood-anemones, oxlips,"
"violets, cuckoo-flowers, and in damp places with green-golden saxifrage."
I came to a small cottage that had pots of flowers in every window. I
sat down while a hospitable old woman made coffee and chattered volubly
in Flemish. Another soldier arrived soon after. Had I heard the news?
The Germans had broken through on the Somme and had captured Bapaume. I
"asked him if he had seen it in print. No, he had heard it from an A.S.C."
"driver. He hoped it wasn't true, but he feared it was."
I returned to camp full of suppressed excitement.
"business puzzles me, though you and your friends here seem to find it"
"devilish amusing. When I told the Chief Constable, the manager of the"
"shipyard, and the Admiral Superintendent of Naval Work that you were"
"the guilty party, they all roared. For some reason the Admiral and the"
shipyard manager kept winking at one another and gurgling till I
"thought they would have choked. What _is_ the joke?"""
"""If you are good, Dawson, I will tell you some day. This is November,"
and the _Rampagious_--the ship described on your paper--left for
"Portsmouth in August. In July--"" I broke off hurriedly, lest I should"
"tell my visitor too much. ""It has taken our friend who put the paper"
in the sardine tin three months to find out details of her. I could
"have done better than that, Dawson."""
"""That is just what the Admiral said, though he wouldn't explain why."""
"""The truth is, Dawson, that the Admiral and I both come from Devon,"
"the land of pirates, smugglers, and buccaneers. We are law breakers by"
instinct and family tradition. When we get an officer of the law on
"toast, we like to make the most of him. It is a playful little way of"
"ours which I am sure you will understand and pardon."""
"""You know, of course, that I am justified in arresting you. I have a"
"warrant and handcuffs in my pocket."""
"""Admirable man!"" I cried, with enthusiasm. ""You are, Dawson, the"
perfect detective. As a criminal I should be mightily afraid of you.
"But, as in my buttonhole I always wear the white flower which"
"proclaims to the world my blameless life, I am thoroughly enjoying"
this visit and our cosy chat beside the fire. Shall I telephone to my
office and say that I shall be unavoidably detained from duty for an
indefinite time? 'Detained' would be the strict truth and the _mot
they had nothing to fear. He was sorry the soldiers had helped
themselves so freely to the livestock; but everything had now
"settled down. Henceforth they would be sure of something to eat, as"
he himself had got to be fed. And all he asked of them was their
agreeable society.
"Two months went by of this strange life. Two months, in which Vivie"
only saw German newspapers--which she read with the aid of von
Giesselin. Their contents filled her with despair. They made very
"little of the Marne rebuff, much of the capture of Antwerp and"
"Ostende, and the occupation of all Belgium (as they put it). Vivie"
noted that the German Emperor's heart had bled for the punishment
"inflicted on Louvain. (She wondered how that strange personality,"
"her father, had fared in the destruction of monastic buildings.) But"
"she had then no true idea of what had taken place, and the"
far-reaching harm this crime had done to the German reputation. She
noted that the German Press expressed disappointment that the cause
"of Germany, the crusade against Albion, had received no support from"
"the Irish Nationalists, or from the ""revolting"" women, the"
"Suffragettes, who had been so cruelly maltreated by the"
administration of Asquith and Sir Grey.
"This point was discussed by the Colonel, but Vivie found herself"
speaking as a patriot. How _could_ the Germans expect British women
to turn against their own country in its hour of danger?
"""Then you would not,"" said von Giesselin, ""consent to write some"
"letters to your friends, if I said I could have them sent safely to"
"their destination?--only letters,"" he added hastily, seeing her"
"nostrils quiver and a look come into her eyes--""to ask your Suffrage"
friends to bring pressure to bear on their Government to bring this
"d-r-r-eadful War to a just peace. That is all we ask."" But Vivie"

In the meantime he received the news of the papal absolution. In
"connection with this he had, once more, to visit England, little"
dreaming that it would be the last time he should set foot on British
soil. In Ammonius's house of Saint Stephen's Chapel at Westminster on 9
"April 1517, the ceremony of absolution took place, ridding Erasmus for"
good of the nightmare which had oppressed him since his youth. At last
he was free!
Invitations and specious promises now came to him from all sides.
Mountjoy and Wolsey spoke of high ecclesiastical honours which awaited
him in England. Budaeus kept pressing him to remove to France. Cardinal
"Ximenes wanted to attach him to the University of Alcalá, in Spain. The"
Duke of Saxony offered him a chair at Leipzig. Pirckheimer boasted of
"the perfections of the free imperial city of Nuremberg. Erasmus,"
"meanwhile, overwhelmed again with the labour of writing and editing,"
"according to his wont, did not definitely decline any of these offers;"
neither did he accept any. He always wanted to keep all his strings on
his bow at the same time. In the early summer of 1517 he was asked to
"accompany the court of the youthful Charles, who was on the point of"
leaving the Netherlands for Spain. But he declined. His departure to
Spain would have meant a long interruption of immediate contact with the
"great publishing centres, Basle, Louvain, Strassburg, Paris, and that,"
"in turn, would have meant postponement of his life-work. When, in the"
"beginning of July, the prince set out for Middelburg, there to take ship"
"for Spain, Erasmus started for Louvain."
"He was thus destined to go to this university environment, although it"
"displeased him in so many respects. There he would have academic duties,"
young latinists would follow him about to get their poems and letters
were moving in and out amongst them. The French had arrived.
"The next morning, about breakfast time, the first shell burst near the"
camp--a short rapid squeal followed by a sharp report. The second shell
"burst a few minutes after, throwing up earth and smoke. A steel fragment"
came sailing over in a wide parabola and struck the foot of a man
"standing in the breakfast queue. He limped to the first-aid hut, looking"
"very pale. When he got there, he had some difficulty in finding his"
"wound, it was so slight."
We paraded and marched off. Several shells burst in the neighbouring
fields. We reached the ration dump and began to load the train. A
civilian arrived with the newspapers. Our N.C.O.'s were powerless to
stop the general stampede that surged towards the paper-vendor.
The Germans had advanced on a wide front ... Armentières had fallen. The
news was several days old and much might have happened since.
We went back to our work and discussed events. We were bullied and
"threatened with arrest, but we talked in groups while we carried cases"
of rations. Would we be involved in the advance? We might even be
captured--that would at least be an experience and a change.
In the evening a few of us went to the St. Martin to see if the old
woman and her daughter had been able to fetch their property away. We
"observed that the windows, where tinned fruit, chocolate, cakes, soap,"
"postcards, and other articles used to be exhibited, had been cleared"
completely. We entered and found one of the girls in tears:
"""All gone--all gone--I show you--you come into de cellar--all de wine"
"gone--bottles all, all broken. English soldiers come in de night and"
take everysing 'vay--ve nussing left--it's de soldiers in de camp over
"And, if I do give you another, you needn't suppose--"""
"""Come on inside,"" begged Captain Dove, shivering, in no case to listen"
"to any lecture. ""Come on, and we'll talk sense. Don't waste any more"
"good time."""
"Slyne followed him in again, congratulating himself on his firmness. He"
"felt that he had gained the whip-hand of the old man, and he meant to"
keep it. He curtly refused again Captain Dove's more hospitable offer of
"some refreshment, and, while his aggrieved host was clumsily getting"
"into some warmer clothing, talked to him from the saloon through the"
open doorway of his cramped sleeping-quarters. It was easier to arrange
matters so than under Captain Dove's direct observation.
"""You'll pay me cash, of course,"" Captain Dove stipulated, as though he"
had been bargaining about a charter-party.
"""I'll pay you cash,"" Slyne agreed, ""the day Sallie marries me. And"
"meantime I'll give you my note of hand at thirty days for the money."" He"
"listened intently, but Captain Dove, struggling fretfully with"
"refractory buttons, maintained an ominous silence."
"""I'll have it backed by a London lawyer, to keep you safe,"" said Slyne."
"""And listen! I'm not asking you to risk anything, or even to take my"
note at its face value. I want you to come ashore with me and find out
for yourself from my lawyer that you can depend on the money. If you
"don't feel satisfied about that after you've seen him, you needn't go"
"any farther, we'll call the bargain off; you can get back on board your"
ship at once and no harm done.
"""And, even as regards Sallie, I'm going out of my way to keep you right."
"I'd give a great deal to get married at once, but--I'm willing to wait"
Madame Gilbert the stranger stared openly at her cheek and ear and the
"coils of bright copper hair. Madame knew that he was watching her, and"
"rather liked the scrutiny. She had recognized him at once, and would"
have been slightly humiliated if he had failed to be interested in her.
"It is true that she had met him but once before in her life, and that"
"some four years since, but as Madame had condescended to recollect"
him--I have said that her memory for faces was royal--a failure on his
part to remember her would have been an offence unpardonable.
"Madame continued to munch sweet stuff, and the man, his tea completed,"
"rose, paid his bill, and then passed slowly in front of her. He needed"
"encouragement before he would speak. So Madame gave it, a quick look and"
a smile of invitation. He bowed.
"""Have I not the honour to meet again the Signora Guilberti?"" said he."
"""The Signora Guilberti,"" assented Madame, ""or Madame Guilbert, or Madame"
"Gilbert, as rendered by the rough English tongue. I have stooped to"
"anglicise my name,"" she went on, ""though I hate the clipped English"
"version."" She indicated a chair, and the lawyer--he was a lawyer--sat"
down.
"""Is it possible that Madame honours me with remembrance?"""
"""Let me place you,"" said she, happy in the display of her"
"accomplishments, ""and don't seek to guide my memory. It was in the"
"Spring of 1915, at a reception in the garden of Devonshire House. You"
were in attendance upon Her Majesty the Queen-Mother of Portugal. There
"were present representatives of the Italian Red Cross, for Italy, the"
"land of my late husband, had ranged herself with the Allies. You are a"
"lawyer of the _haute noblesse_. Your clients are peers and princes, of"
old princes in exile and of new peers in possession. I recall you most
"is how to keep sober. And I want it to be understood from the start--"""
"""Not so much of it now!"" snarled Captain Dove from his cabin. ""You"
attend to your own business--and I'll attend to mine. I know how to
"behave myself--among gentlemen. And, don't you forget, either, that I'm"
"going ashore to play my own hand. I've a card or two up my sleeve,"
"Mister Slyne, that will maybe euchre your game for you--if you try to"
"bluff too high."""
"Slyne swore hotly, under his breath. He would have given a great deal to"
"know exactly what the old man meant by that mysterious threat, and only"
knew that it would be useless to ask him. There was nothing for it but
"to put up with his capricious humours, as patiently as might"
be--although Slyne shivered in anticipation of the strain that might
entail--till he could be dispensed with or got rid of altogether.
"Nor, as it presently appeared, were his fears at all ill-founded. For"
Captain Dove emerged from his cabin got up for shore-going in a guise at
sight of which Slyne could by no means suppress an involuntary groan.
"""I'm all ready now,"" Captain Dove announced. ""Will you pay for a cab if"
"I call one?"""
"""My car's waiting,"" Slyne returned, and, as the old man whistled"
amazedly over that further and unexpected proof that his former
"accomplice's fortunes had changed for the better, ""You look like a fool"
"in that outfit,"" said Slyne. ""The right rig-out for motoring is a tweed"
"suit and a soft cap."""
Captain Dove was very visibly annoyed. He had been at particular pains
"to array himself properly. ""You want to be the only swell in the party,"
"of course!"" he grunted. ""You're jealous, that's what's the matter with"
patriotic politician.
"""I know to whom you refer,"" I said, with bowed head, after a moment's"
"pause.  ""It is currently reported that I love her.  I have loved her.  I"
do not seek to deny it.  When a man sustains such a blow as I sustained
"before we parted, he often rushes to another woman for consolation.  The"
influence of that second woman often prevents him from going to the bad
"altogether.  It has been so in my case."""
"""And you love her now?"" she cried, the fire of fierce jealousy in her"
"eyes.  ""You cannot deny it!"""
"""I do deny it,"" I cried.  ""True, until yesterday I held her in esteem,"
"even in affection; but it is not so now.  All my love for you, Yolande,"
has returned to me.  Our parting has rendered you dearer and sweeter to
"me than ever."""
"""I cannot believe it,"" she exclaimed falteringly."
"""I swear that it is so.  In all my life, although am compelled to treat"
"women with courtesy and sometimes to affect flirtation, because of my"
"profession as a diplomatist, I have loved only one woman--yourself;"" and"
"I raised her chilly hand to my lips, kissing it fervently."
Mine was no mere caprice at that moment.  With an all-consuming passion
"I loved her, and was prepared on her account to make any sacrifice she"
"demanded.  Let the reader remember what had already been told me, and"
"reflect that, like many another man, I loved madly, and was heedless of"
any consequences that might follow.  In this particular I was not alone.
"Thousands before me had been allured to their ruin by a woman's eyes,"
just as thousands of brave women's hearts have been broken and their
lives wrecked by men's false oaths of fidelity.  I have heard wiseacres
"Eilert's house, they looked at their watches and swore because so many"
minutes were being wasted. Where the devil was the car? The populace
"followed at some distance, gazing with reverence on these dressed-up"
fools.
I remember a couple of them: an old man--the one with the loud voice--who
wore a pleated kilt on each thigh and a jacket of green canvas with braid
"and buckles and straps and innumerable pockets all over it. What a man,"
"what a power! His beard, streaming out from under his nose like the"
"northern lights, was greenish-white, and he swore like a madman. Another"
"of the party was tall and bent, a flagpole of sorts, astonishing,"
"stupendous, with sloping shoulders, a tiny cap perched above extravagantly"
"arched eyebrows; he was an upended Roman battering ram, a man on stilts. I"
"measured him with my eyes, and still there was something left over. Yet he"
"was bent and broken, old before his time, quite bald; but his mouth was"
"tight as a tiger's, and he had a madness in his head that kept him on the"
move.
"""Stordalen!"" he cried."
England will soon have to open old people's homes for her sons. She
desexes her people with sport and obsessive ideas: were not other
"countries keeping her in perpetual unrest, she would in a couple of"
generations be converted to pederasty....
"Then the horn of the car was heard tooting in the woods, and everyone"
raced to meet it.
Of course Olaus's two boys had done an honest day's work in meeting the
"car so far up the road, and urging the driver to hurry; were they not to"
"get any reward? True, they were allowed to sit in the back seat for their"
return journey and thus enjoyed the drive of a lifetime; but money! They
official reception at the Elysee the appearance of a bal travesti--I
"passed Monsieur Casimir Perrier, former President of the Republic;"
"Monsieur Paul Deschanel, the lion of the hour; Monsieur"
"Benjamin-Constant, always a prominent figure; Prince Roland Bonaparte,"
"smiling and bowing; the Duchess d'Auerstadt, with her magnificent"
"jewels; and Damat, the dapper Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour."
"All diplomatic Paris was there, chattering, laughing, whispering, and"
"plotting.  Around me sounded a veritable babel of tongues, but no part"
of the function interested me.
"From time to time I saluted a man I knew, or bent over a woman's hand;"
but my thoughts were of the one woman who had so suddenly and so
forcibly returned into my life.  The representatives of the Powers of
"Europe were all present, and as they passed me by, each in his bright"
"uniform, his orders flashing on his breast and a woman on his arm, I"
asked myself which of them was actually the employer of my well-beloved.
The startling events of the day had upset me.  Had it been possible I
would have left and returned to my rooms for a quiet smoke and for calm
"reflection.  But my duty required my presence there; hence I remained,"
strolling slowly around the great crowded salon with its myriad lights
"and profuse floral decorations, until I suddenly encountered the"
"wizen-faced, toothless old Baronne de Chalencon, whose salon was one of"
"the most popular in Paris, and with whom I was on excellent terms."
"""Ah! my dear M'sieur Ingram!"" she cried, holding forth her thin, bony"
"hand laden with jewels.  ""You look tired.  Why?  No one here to-night"
"who interests you--eh?"""
"""No one save yourself, Baronne,"" I responded, bending over her hand."
"""Flatterer!"" she laughed.  ""If I were forty years younger I might accept"
"covered with fairy-like toilet-articles, its blue delft bowls full of"
"flowers, its atmosphere so dearly English, yet English of the days when"
Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the mere. In no other spot on the
"globe could be found such a sea-chamber, with its high bed, on which lay"
"the sweet, elfin face, half child's, half woman's, framed in the soft,"
brown hair.
"Risca smoked on, and Stellamaris, seeing him disinclined to talk, gazed"
"happily out to her beloved Channel, and dreamed her dreams. They had"
"often sat like this for an hour together, both feeling that they were"
talking to each other all the time; and often Stella would break the
"silence by telling him to listen. At such times, so people said,"
"an angel was passing. And he would listen, but could not hear. He"
"remembered Walter Herold once agreeing with her, and saying:"
“There's a special little angel told off to come here every day and
beat his wings about the room so as to clear the air of all troubling
things.”
"In no other spot on the globe could be found such a sea-chamber,"
"wing-swept, spirit-haunted, where pain ceased magically and the burden"
of intolerable suffering grew light. No other haven along all the coasts
of the earth was a haven of rest such as this.
And the Furies were driving him from it! But here the Furies ceased from
driving. Here he had delicious ease. Here a pair of ridiculously frail
hands held him a lotus-fed prisoner. He smoked on. At last he resisted
"the spell. The whole thing was nonsensical. His pipe, only lightly"
"packed by the frail hands, went out. He stuffed it in his pocket, and"
cleared his throat. He would say then and there what he had come to say.
"Stellamaris turned her head and laughed; and when Stellamaris laughed,"

"He took the drop easily, riding the log with that perfect balance which"
is second nature to the seasoned riverman. When the timber bumped
"against the rapidly forming jam, Curly leaped again, thrusting the log"
"down as he did so, and landed on the solid barrier. Scrambling lightly"
"over to the face of this, he thrust deftly with his peavey into the"
"mass, and began to work desperately to loosen the key log--that first"
"upended stick of pine which had started the whole trouble, and which"
must be started before the rest of the barrier would give.
"He got a good hold on it, but the thing defied his efforts to tear it"
"loose. It was wedged too tightly for even his great strength, and,"
"though he seemed to feel it move slightly, he strained his muscles to"
the utmost in vain to accomplish anything further. Presently he
"realized, with a thrill, that the jam was piling up behind him faster"
"and faster. He ceased his efforts, and clamping the peavey on timber"
"above the key log, pried it free, and sent it bobbing downstream."
"Another followed, and another still. Sweat poured in streams from him,"
"trickling blindingly into his eyes, but he did not stop to wipe it away."
"There was no time. He must go on doing his best till help came, or"
else----
A faint jar shook the jam. A second later Curly felt a hand lightly
touch his shoulder. A familiar voice sounded in his ear:
"“Good work, son! Where’s that trouble maker? Oh, I see. Let me drop down"
"to that ledge, where I can get a good hold. That’s the idea. Now grip"
"her above me. Fine! Ready, now? Yank away!”"
"It was Bainbridge--swift, agile, incredibly fresh considering what he"
had accomplished that day. For a moment or two Curly did not realize
"to mystify the ruffian as much as I do."""
"""I will watch for his ears when he next calls, which, I expect, will"
"be to-morrow. Thank you very much. I won't sneak."""
"""Remember that nothing else in the way of identification is of any"
"use, for I doubt if either of us has ever seen the real, undisguised"
Dawson as he is known to God. We know a man whom we think is the
genuine article--but is he? Cary's description of him is most unlike
the man whom we see here. I expect that he has a different identity
for every place which he visits. If he told me that at any moment he
"was wholly undisguised, I should be quite sure that he was lying. The"
man wallows in deception for the very sport of the thing. But he can't
"change his ears. Study them, and you will be safe."""
Our club was the only place in which we could be sure that Dawson did
"not penetrate, though I should not have been surprised to learn that"
one or two of the waitresses were in his pay. Dawson is an ardent
feminist; he says that as secret agents women beat men to a frazzle.
Shortly before Dawson left for his headquarters on the north-east
"coast he dropped in upon me. He had finished his researches, and"
revealed the results to me with immense satisfaction.
"""I have fixed up Menteith,"" he began, ""and know exactly how he came"
"into communication with the German Secret Service."" The contemptuous"
"emphasis which he laid on the word ""Secret"" would have annoyed the"
Central Office at Potsdam. I have given the detected British spy the
name of Menteith after that of the most famous traitor in Scottish
"history; if I called him, say, Campbell or Macdonald, nothing could"
save me from the righteous vengeance of the outraged Clans.
"""'Anything that I should ask,' I replied."
"""'Ah, I see, I see! Should ask? I take it there are certain sacrifices"
"you would not ask,' returned the king. 'We here in France would say that"
"your position was Quixotic. However, your King Charles is a weak fool,"
"easily imposed upon. Is the lady quick and resourceful in expedients,"
"calm and thoughtful in emergencies, and silent on great occasions?'"
"""To all of which I answered, 'Yes.'"
"""'Surely the lady is not La Belle Jennings?' asked the king."
"""'Yes,' I replied."
"""'In that case you are the very man I want, and your lady-love can help"
"me buy Dunkirk. It is easy to lead a fool to do the wrong thing, and I'm"
"sure La Belle Jennings will find a way to gain her end and ours. If,"
"through her, you induce King Charles to sell Dunkirk to me on my own"
"terms, I'll make you its governor and a rich man. I'll put you in a"
"position to marry this paragon, Mam'selle Jennings, if, as I take it,"
lack of fortune is all that stands between you. I do not mind telling you
now that De Grammont had given me full information concerning the king's
view of La Belle Jennings and your relations to her before I wrote my
"first letter, inviting you to visit me.'"
"""I am loath to undertake so mean an office as that of inducing King"
"Charles to sell an English city, but I cannot save Dunkirk, and I may"
profit by helping what I cannot prevent. So I beg you broach the subject
"to Frances, cautioning her for me to take no risk, and if she is willing"
"to use and to hoodwink the man who would not hesitate to take her life,"
"let me know, and I shall write to you again with further instructions."
girl anyway--so much for Pola's education. And culture--what benefited
all the culture of Europe if Pola found enjoyment only in the company
of youths her mother would not permit in the house?
"Pola mistook Sidney's silence for hurt. ""You goose, I'm not saying I"
think I'm any better than _you_ are! But you must see that neither of
"us are a bit like that native girl!"" Which admission Pola considered"
most generous.
"""I wasn't thinking about whether you are any better than I am or not."
"I've been brought up, you see,"" with a rueful laugh, ""to believe that"
my father being a poet set _me_ a little apart from everyone else. And
I've hated it. What I was thinking was that there really isn't any
"class difference in people--except what we make ourselves, like the"
League building a barrier around me and you thinking you're in another
class from Mart because you're rich. Maybe it isn't really the outside
"things that count, maybe it's the big things we have got or haven't got"
"inside us--"""
"""Like what?"" demanded Pola."
Sidney was thinking of Lav's self-effacing ambition to serve the world
"from the seclusion of a laboratory, of Mart's cheerfulness in the face"
of her lot and her loyal affection for her exacting and rheumatic
"grandmother; of the courage of Mart's grandfather, Ambrose Calkins, who"
had lost his own life in going back to his sinking schooner for the
"cook who could not swim; of her own ancestor, Priscilla Ellis. _Those_"
"were the things which set people apart from their fellows, Sidney"
"thought, but the understanding was too new in her own heart for her to"
"find words in which she could tell Pola of it. ""Like what?"" Pola"
demanded again and this time her voice was a little haughty.
"Charing Cross, and he surprised me with an invitation to his house"
that night to meet Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise at supper.
"""The king and a dozen other gentlemen will be present,"" he said, ""but"
"there will be no ladies. Monsieur l'Abbé, being of the church, is not a"
"ladies' man, and besides, ladies have sharper eyes than men, and might"
"see much that is intended to remain unseen."""
"The count's remark seemed to settle the question of the Abbé's identity,"
and I hastened to Frances with the news. She assured me that she was
"ready to die of fright, but showed no outward sign of dissolution, and"
"when I complimented her on her power of self-control, said:--"
"""Fortunately, I am part hypocrite, and can easily act a part."""
"""You have a hard one ahead of you,"" I returned, ""and will need all your"
"strength before it is played to the end."""

"I was on hand early at De Grammont's supper, but found several gentlemen"
"ahead of me, awaiting, with the count in his parlor, the arrival of the"
"king. Soon after I entered the room, De Grammont presented me to the"
"Abbé. I was convinced at once that he was not George Hamilton. His beard,"
"worn à la Richelieu,--a mustache and a tuft on the chin,--was snow white,"
"and his hair, which was thin, hung in long white waves almost to his"
"shoulders. He walked with a stoop and wore spectacles, the glasses of"
"which were slightly colored. Being an ecclesiastic, though not a priest,"
"he wore no wig; but he was of the Order of the Cordon Bleu, and wore, in"
"addition to his badge and blue ribbon, a sword beneath his long coat. It"
"was the first time I had ever seen an ecclesiastic wearing a sword,"
"though it has since become common in France, where there are many ""Abbés"""
were on the other side of the invisible screen.
"Determined however, to remove this invisible screen, I said"
"Good-evening, and it was very cold. They muttered Good-evening, and yes,"
it was fresh. An Italian never says it is cold: it is never more than
_fresco_. But this hint that it was cold they took as a hint at their
"caps, and they became very silent, till the woman came in with the"
"soup-bowl. Then they clamoured at her, particularly the _maialino_, what"
was there to eat. She told them--beef-steaks of pork. Whereat they
"pulled faces. Or bits of boiled pork. They sighed, looked gloomy,"
"cheered up, and said beef-steaks, then."
"And they fell on their soup. And never, from among the steam, have I"
heard a more joyful trio of soup-swilkering. They sucked it in from
"their spoons with long, gusto-rich sucks. The _maialino_ was the"
"treble--he trilled his soup into his mouth with a swift, sucking"
"vibration, interrupted by bits of cabbage, which made the lamp start to"
"dither again. Black-cap was the baritone; good, rolling spoon-sucks. And"
the one in spectacles was the bass: he gave sudden deep gulps. All was
"led by the long trilling of the _maialino_. Then suddenly, to vary"
"matters, he cocked up his spoon in one hand, chewed a huge mouthful of"
"bread, and swallowed it down with a smack-smack-smack! of his tongue"
"against his palate. As children we used to call this ""clapping""."
"""Mother, she's clapping!"" I would yell with anger, against my sister."
The German word is schmatzen.
"So the _maialino_ clapped like a pair of cymbals, while baritone and"
bass rolled on. Then in chimed the swift bright treble.
"At this rate however, the soup did not last long. Arrived the"
beef-steaks of pork. And now the trio was a trio of castanet smacks and
"I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on"
the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the
"ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like"
the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in
case of emergency. I looked for the _important_ things.
"As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't"
"decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,"
I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity
underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf
"of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make"
"faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do."
"Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the"
wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block
the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed
into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits
"standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the"
Middle Ages.
"""In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of"
"companionway,"" they had the words etched into the glass, ""break glass"
"with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the"
"following fashion."""
"I read the ""following fashion"" until I knew it by heart. _Boy_, I said"
"to myself, _I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get"
into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits
back in Undersea!_
And all the time I was alone. That was the best part.
older note: before the soul became self-conscious: before the mentality
"of Greece appeared in the world. Remote, always remote, as if the"
"intelligence lay deep within the cave, and never came forward. One"
"searches into the gloom for one second, while the glance lasts. But"
"without being able to penetrate to the reality. It recedes, like some"

potent. But what?

The q-b spies some of the blue-and-red stripe-and-line cotton stuff of
which the peasants make their dress: a large roll in the doorway of a
"dark shop. In we go, and begin to feel it. It is just soft, thickish"
"cotton stuff--twelve francs a metre. Like most peasant patterns, it is"
much more complicated and subtle than appears: the curious placing of
"the stripes, the subtle proportion, and a white thread left down one"
"side only of each broad blue block. The stripes, moreover, run _across_"
"the cloth, not lengthwise with it. But the width would be just long"
enough for a skirt--though the peasant skirts have almost all a band at
the bottom with the stripes running round-ways.
"The man--he is the esquimo type, simple, frank and aimiable--says the"
"stuff is made in France, and this the first roll since the war. It is"
"the old, old pattern, quite correct--but the material not _quite_ so"
good. The q-b takes enough for a dress.
"He shows us also cashmeres, orange, scarlet, sky-blue, royal blue: good,"
"pure-wool cashmeres that were being sent to India, and were captured"
"ago, eyed his profile, without daring to ask questions. Before he reached"
"home, Winton stopped at a post-office, and sent this telegram:"
"""Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.--WINTON."""
It salved a conscience on which that fellow's figure in the doorway
"weighed; besides, it was necessary, lest Fiorsen should go to the police."
The rest must wait till he had talked with Gyp.
"There was much to do, and it was late before they dined, and not till"
Markey had withdrawn could they begin their talk.
Close to the open windows where Markey had placed two hydrangea
"plants--just bought on his own responsibility, in token of silent"
"satisfaction--Gyp began.  She kept nothing back, recounting the whole"
miserable fiasco of her marriage.  When she came to Daphne Wing and her
"discovery in the music-room, she could see the glowing end of her"
father's cigar move convulsively.  That insult to his adored one seemed
"to Winton so inconceivable that, for a moment, he stopped her recital by"
getting up to pace the room.  In her own house--her own house!
"And--after that, she had gone on with him! He came back to his chair and"
"did not interrupt again, but his stillness almost frightened her."
"Coming to the incidents of the day itself, she hesitated.  Must she tell"
"him, too, of Rosek--was it wise, or necessary?  The all-or-nothing"
"candour that was part of her nature prevailed, and she went straight on,"
"and, save for the feverish jerking of his evening shoe, Winton made no"
"sign.  When she had finished, he got up and slowly extinguished the end"
of his cigar against the window-sill; then looking at her lying back in
"her chair as if exhausted, he said: ""By God!"" and turned his face away to"
the window.
that he would come to her--that his soul would enter the body of the
"little baby soon about to be born, so that they two might be together in"
life once more.
"And in the dream the lover consented. He would come, he said, into the"
child of the woman he loved.
"When the woman awoke she remembered it all, and the desire of life"
"returned to her again, and all the world was changed because of the new"
life she felt within her. But she told no one then of the dream or of
what was to happen.
"Only she took the greatest care of herself; she ate well, and went"
"frequently to the pagoda with flowers, praying that the body in which"
"her lover was about to dwell might be fair and strong, worthy of him who"
"took it, worthy of her who gave it."
In due time the baby was born. But alas and alas for all her hopes! The
"baby came but for a moment, to breathe a few short breaths, to cry, and"
to die; and a few hours later the woman died also. But before she went
"she told someone all about it, all about the dream and the baby, and"
that she was glad to go and follow her lover. She said that her baby's
"soul was her lover's soul, and that as he could not stay, neither would"
she; and with these words on her lips she followed him out into the
void.
"The story was kept a secret until the husband died, not long"
afterwards; but when I came to the village all the people knew it.
"I must confess that this story is to me full of the deepest reality,"
full of pathos. It seems to me to be the unconscious protestation of
humanity against the dogmas of religion and of the learned. However it
"""Mistakes be blowed--'e knows what's what, you take my word for it ..."""
"We gathered idly round the disputants, glad of a distraction that would"
help to pass the time. A third person joined in the argument:
"""If 'e bombs 'orspitals an' C.C.S.'s it's our own bloody fault. Look at"
our C.C.S. 'ere. There's a ordnance park and a R.E. dump up the road.
There's a railway in front an' a sidin' where troops is always
detrainin'. Then there's a gas dump over yonder. An' if we're bloody
"fools an' leave the lights on at night, 'ow can 'e tell what's what when"
everything's mixed up together? Why the bloody 'ell don't they put
C.C.S.'s away from dumps an' railways? Why don't they stick 'em right in
"the fields somewhere? I bet we'll cop it one o' these nights, an' serve"
"us right too."""
German aeroplanes had passed overhead almost every clear windless
"night, but the buzz of propellers, that often went on for hours, and the"
dull boom of bombs exploding far away had never caused anything more
than slight uneasiness and apprehension.
"One night, after we had been at the C.C.S. for about a month, we heard"
the uproar of a distant air-raid. Early the next morning a number of
"motor-ambulances arrived with their loads of wounded men. A camp, a mile"
"or two from the station, had been bombed and fifty men had been killed"
"and many more wounded. One of the ""cases"" brought into the theatre had"
been hit on the forehead. The bomb-fragment had not penetrated the
"skull, but had passed along its surface. The scalp hung over the"
"forehead loosely like an enormous flap, the red, jagged edge nearly"
touching the eyebrows. Since then I thought of this man every time there
was an air-raid.
And on Mrs. James Williams’s face was recorded a little library of the
world’s best thoughts in three volumes. Volume No. 1 contained the
belief that James Williams was about the right sort of thing. Volume
"No. 2 was an essay on the world, declaring it to be a very excellent"
place. Volume No. 3 disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest
seat in a Rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all
understanding.
"James Williams, you would have guessed, was about twenty-four. It will"
gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate. He was exactly
"twenty-three years, eleven months and twenty-nine days old. He was well"
"built, active, strong-jawed, good-natured and rising. He was on his"
wedding trip.
"Dear kind fairy, please cut out those orders for money and 40 H. P."
touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of
"the boat club. Instead of any of them turn backward—oh, turn backward"
and give us just a teeny-weeny bit of our wedding trip over again. Just
"an hour, dear fairy, so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees"
"looked, and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin—even"
if it was the hatpins that did the work. Can’t do it? Very well; hurry
"up with that touring car and the oil stock, then."
Just in front of Mrs. James Williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket
and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses. Only in dreams and
"milliners’ shops do we, alas! gather grapes and roses at one swipe."
"This girl gazed with large blue eyes, credulous, when the megaphone man"
roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should
be concerned. Between blasts she resorted to Epictetian philosophy in
the form of pepsin chewing gum.
"out and maroon Captain England, and elect himself in his place. He was a"
"villain of the deepest dye, and burnt ships and houses and tortured his"
prisoners.
"The pirates sailed down the West Coast of India from Goa to Cochin, and"
returned to Mauritius. Thence sailing to the Island of Mascarine they
"found a big Portuguese ship, which they took. In her they discovered the"
"Conde de Eviceira, Viceroy of Goa, and, even better, four million dollars"
worth of diamonds.
"Taylor, now sailing in the _Cassandra_, heard that there were four"
"men-of-war on his tracks, so he sailed to Delagoa Bay and spent the"
winter of the year 1722 there. It was now decided that as they had a huge
"amount of plunder they had better give up piracy, so they sailed away to"
the West Indies and surrendered themselves to the Governor of Porto Bello.
"The crew broke up and each man, with a bag of diamonds, went whither he"
"would; but Captain Taylor joined the Spanish service, and was put in"
"command of a man-of-war, which was sent to attack the English logwood"
cutters in the Bay of Honduras.
"TAYLOR, WILLIAM."
One of Captain Phillips's crew. Wounded in the leg while attempting to
"desert. There being no surgeon on board, a consultation was held over the"
"patient by the whole crew, and these learned men were unanimous in"
agreeing that the leg should be amputated. Some dispute then arose as to
"who should act the part of surgeon, and at length the carpenter was chosen"
"as the most proper person. ""Upon which he fetch'd up the biggest saw, and"
"taking the limb under his Arm, fell to Work, and separated it from the"
Body of the Patient in as little Time as he could have cut a Deal Board in
"two."" This surgeon-carpenter evidently appreciated the importance of"
"standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park, and spoke into the"
transmitter:
“Tell the gentleman that I need not repeat to him a description of my
ideals. He knows what they have been and what they still are. So far as
"they touch on this case, absolute loyalty and truth are the ones"
paramount. Tell him that I have studied my own heart as well as one
"can, and I know its weakness as well as I do its needs. That is why I"
"decline to hear his pleas, whatever they may be. I did not condemn him"
"through hearsay or doubtful evidence, and that is why I made no charge."
"But, since he persists in hearing what he already well knows, you may"
convey the matter.
"“Tell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear,"
to cut a rose for my mother. Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton
"beneath the pink oleander. The tableau was pretty, but the pose and"
juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation. I
"left the conservatory, and, at the same time, the rose and my ideal."
You may carry that song and dance to your impresario.”
"“I’m shy on one word, lady. Jux—jux—put me wise on dat, will yer?”"
"“Juxtaposition—or you may call it propinquity—or, if you like, being"
rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal.”
The gravel spun from beneath the boy’s feet. He stood by the other
"bench. The man’s eyes interrogated him, hungrily. The boy’s were"
shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator.
“De lady says dat she’s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a
"feller comes spielin’ ghost stories and tryin’ to make up, and dat’s"
why she won’t listen to no soft-soap. She says she caught yer dead to
"multifariousness is at hand. Hasten the day, and save us from"
proletarian homogeneity and khaki all-alikeness.
"I love my indomitable coarse men from mountain Sardinia, for their"
"stocking-caps and their splendid, animal-bright stupidity. If only the"
"last wave of all-alikeness won't wash those superb crests, those caps,"
away.
And it seemed to her as though she knew all the people who were there;
"they were the women of the village, and the girls of her own age. But"
the dog was well aware that there was something uncanny about it all.
"He made his way down to Melbustad in flying leaps, and howled and barked"
"in the most lamentable manner, and gave the people no rest until they"
"followed him. The young fellow who was to marry the girl took his gun,"
"and climbed the hills; and when he drew near, there stood a number of"
"horses around the hut, saddled and bridled. He crept up to the hut,"
"looked through a loop-hole in the wall, and saw a whole company sitting"
"together inside. It was quite evident that they were trolls, the people"
"from underground, and therefore he discharged his gun over the roof. At"
"that moment the doors flew open, and a number of balls of gray yarn, one"
"larger than the other, came shooting out about his legs. When he went"
"in, there sat the maiden in her bridal finery, and nothing was missing"
"but the ring on her little finger, then all would have been complete."
"""In heaven's name, what has happened here?"" he asked, as he looked"
"around. All the silverware was still on the table, but all the tasty"
"dishes had turned to moss and toadstools, and frogs and toads and the"
like.
"""What does it all mean?"" said he. ""You are sitting here in all your"
"glory, just like a bride?"""
"however, when he was asleep, an incident happened that warned the Girl"
that it was necessary to get her lover away just as soon as he was able
to ride a horse.
"Lying on the rug in front of the fire she had been thinking of him when,"
"suddenly, her quick ear, more than ever alert in these days, caught the"
sound of a stealthy footstep outside the cabin. With no fear whatever
"except in relation to the discovery of her lover, the Girl went"
noiselessly to the window and peered out into the darkness. A man was
making signs that he wished to speak with her. For a moment she stood
"watching in perplexity, but almost instantly her instinct told her that"
"one of that race, for she believed the man to be a Mexican, would never"
dare to come to her cabin at that time of night unless it was on a
friendly errand. So putting her face close to the pane to reassure
"herself that she had not been mistaken in regard to his nationality, she"
"then went to the door and held it wide open for the man to enter, at the"
same time putting her finger to her lips as a sign that he should be
very still.
"""What are you doin' here? What do you want?"" she asked in a low voice,"
at the same time leading him to the side of the room further away from
her lover.
"Jose Castro's first words were in Spanish, but immediately perceiving"
"that he failed to make her understand, he nodded comprehendingly, and"
said:
"""All righta--I espeak Engleesh--I am Jose Castro too well known to the"
"_Maestro_. I want to see 'im."""
The Girl's intuition told her that a member of the band stood before
"her, and she regarded him suspiciously. Not that she believed that he"
"end reached, he let the paper fall on his knees, lay back, and took a"
"long pull at his cigar. He was shocked--yes, he supposed he was"
"shocked. He had known the man, and it was shocking to think of his"
"throat being cut; yes, he had known him, and he didn't like to think of"
that. But--The Premier gave a long-drawn sigh of relief. That unknown
murderer's hand had done great things for him. His daughter was safe
"now--anyhow, she was safe. She could never be subject to the degradation"
the dead man had once hinted at; and when he thought of what the man had
"threatened, pity for him died out of Medland's heart. More--although"
Kilshaw no doubt knew something--there was a chance that Benham had kept
"his own counsel, and that his employer would be helpless without his"
"aid. Medland's sanguine mind caught eagerly at the chance, and in a"
moment turned it into a hope--almost a conviction. Then the whole thing
"would go down to the grave with the unlucky man, and not even its"
"spectre survive to trouble him. For if no one had certain knowledge, if"
"there were never more than gossip, growing, as time passed, fainter and"
"fainter from having no food to feed on, would not utter silence follow"
"at last, so that the things that had been might be as if they had never"
been?
"""Well, what do they say about us?"" asked the Treasurer."
"""Oh, nothing much,"" he answered, thrusting the paper behind him with a"
careless air. He did not want to discuss what the paper had told him.
"""What's happened to-day,"" said Daisy, ""ought to make all the difference,"
"oughtn't it, father?"""
"""I hope it will,"" replied the Premier; but, for once in his life, he was"
not thinking most about political affairs.
"followed Tilly were, beside these, gentle and kindly men."
'God help us!' my lady cried fervently. 'God help this great city! God
help the North! Never was such a battle fought as must be fought
here!'
"We went down very much sobered, filled with awe and wonder and"
"great thoughts, the dullest of us feeling the air heavy with portents,"
the more clerkly considering of Armageddon and the Last Fight.
Briefly--for thirteen years the Emperor and the Papists had hustled
"and harried the Protestants; had dragooned Donauwörth, and held down"
"Bohemia, and plundered the Palatinate, and crushed the King of"
"Denmark, and wherever there was a weak Protestant state had pressed"
sorely on it. Then one short year before I stood on the Burg above the
"Pegnitz, the Protestant king had come out of the North like a"
"thunderbolt, had shattered in a month the Papist armies, had run like"
"a devouring fire down the Priests' Lane, rushed over Bohemia, shaken"
the Emperor on his throne!
But could he maintain himself? That was now to be seen. To the
"Emperor's help had come all who loved the old system, and would have"
it that the south was Germany; all who wished to chain men's minds and
saw their profit in the shadow of the imperial throne; all who lived
"by license and plunder, and reckoned a mass to-day against a murder"
"to-morrow. All these had come, from the great Duke of Friedland"
"grasping at empire, to the meanest freebooter with peasant's blood on"
"his hands and in his veins; and there they lay opposite us,"
"impregnably placed on the Burgstall, waiting patiently until famine"
"and the sword should weaken the fair city, and enable them to plunge"
their vulture's talons into its vitals.
No wonder that in Nuremberg the citizens could be distinguished from
"""And so on it goes,"" he said, ""indicating that at some devilish"
distance--I've forgotten the figure but we had the master computer chew
it out on the big machine at Radiation once--an additional kilowatt
just shoves the signal coverage distance out by a micron. But if you
"don't put in your honest kilowatt, you don't excite the infraspace that"
"carries infrawaves. And if you put in a kilowatt and a half, you have"
"to dissipate the half."""
"Wilson grunted. ""Nice to have things come out even. Who'd have thunk"
that the Creator wanted the Terran kilowatt to equal one quanta of
"infrawave distance?"""
"Allison laughed. ""Poor argument, Commodore Wilson. Actually, the figure"
"is point nine, eight three four plus. Close, but no cigar. We've"
"just come to accept the figure as a kilowatt, just as for everyday"
"calculation we accept the less refined figure of two point, one eight"
"parsecs, or even two point, two. At any rate--"""
"There was a puff of something, and a sound like the puncture of a tire."
The green speckles on the dome merged with one another and became
a riot of flaming green. There were shouts and cries and a lot of
haphazard orders and several techs scrambled to snap toggle switches.
Down the room one of the techs went head-first into a rack with a pair
of pliers and a soldering iron. He backed out carrying a smoking little
shapeless thing that had lost any character it once possessed. The tech
"picked up a nice, shiny new doodad from a small box and went into the"
rack again. When he came out this time he gave a hoarse cheer. Toggles
were snapped back and the spreckles reappeared.
"One of the techs came up to Allison and said, ""See that spot up there,"
"sir? The one just this side of the eighty-one degree longitude circle,"
"with willows growing round it. In the field beyond, a cow was grazing"
peacefully. The sky seemed a deeper blue through the willow-branches.
The tender green of the grass was wonderfully refreshing to the eyes.
The cow had a beautiful coat of glossy brown that shone in the sunlight.
I abandoned myself to the charm of the little idyll that was spread out
before me and forgot the war once again.
"And then all at once a gigantic, plume-shaped, sepia coloured mass rose"
"towering out of the ground. There was a rending, deafening, double"
thunder-clap that seemed to split my head. For a moment I was dazed and
my ears sang. Then I looked up--the black mass was thinning and
collapsing. The cow had disappeared.
I walked into the yard full of rage and bitterness. All the men had left
the sheds and were flocking into the road. Some were strolling along in
"leisurely fashion, some were walking with hurried steps, some were"
"running, some were laughing and talking, some looked startled, some"
"looked anxious, and some were very pale."
"We crossed the road and the railway. Then, traversing several fields, we"
"came to a halt and waited. We waited for nearly an hour, but nothing"
happened and we gradually straggled back to the yard.
Some of us walked to the spot where the shell had burst. There was a
"huge hole, edged by a ring of heaped-up earth, and loose mould and"
grassy sods lay scattered all round. Here and there lay big lumps of
bleeding flesh. The cow had been blown to bits. The larger pieces had
"already been collected by the farmer, who had covered them with a"
tarpaulin sheet from which a hoof protruded.
"The next day, at about the same hour, the dark cloud again rose from the"
ground and the double explosion followed. We again abandoned the yard
"the German occupation lasted, or during that time receive a penny in"
compensation for the sequestration of the property.
The notes for the hundred thousand francs therefore were carefully
concealed in Mrs. Warren's bedroom at the Hotel Impérial and Vivie
for a few months afterwards felt slightly easier in her mind as to
"the immediate future; for, as a further resource, there were also"
the jewels and plate at the bank.
"They dared hope for nothing from Villa Beau-séjour. Von Giesselin,"
"after more entreaty than Vivie cared to make, had allowed them with"
a special pass and his orderly as escort to go in a military motor
to the Villa in the month of April in order that they might bring
away the rest of their clothes and personal effects of an easily
transportable nature. But the visit was a heart-breaking
disappointment. Their reception was surly; the place was little else
than a barrack of disorderly soldiers and insolent officers. Any
search for clothes or books was a mockery. Nothing was to be found
in the chests of drawers that belonged to them; only stale food and
unnameable horrors or military equipment articles. The garden was
trampled out of recognition. There had been a beautiful vine in the
"greenhouse. It was still there, but the first foliage of spring hung"
"withered and russet coloured. The soldiers, grinning when Vivie"
"noticed this, pointed to the base of the far spreading branches. It"
"had been sawn through, and much of the glass of the greenhouse"
deliberately smashed.
"On their way back, Mrs. Warren, who was constantly in tears,"
descried waiting by the side of the road the widow of their
"farmer-neighbour, Madame Oudekens. She asked the orderly that they"
might stop and greet her. She approached. Mrs. Warren got out of the
car so that she might more privately talk to her in Flemish. Since
"pronounced it to be first-class petrol. There were seven drums, each"
containing four gallons.
"""This means we'll motor, not walk into Robat after all, sir,"" said"
"Allan, with a grin and sigh of relief. The thought of those miles of"
desert--nearly two hundred of them--which confronted us after the
mishap had been haunting us both like a nightmare.
"At this moment the _chokidar_ returned, in great trepidation, fearing"
a dressing-down for being absent from duty. But I was far too elated
at the turn of events to want to swear at anyone.
"I asked him where the petrol had come from, and whose it was. He"
"shook his head, and said he had no idea. It had always been there. It"
"belonged to no one, and no one had put it there, so far as he knew."
"He had never seen a car there before; in fact, he had never seen a"
"car anywhere before, and could not understand how it was that men"
"could travel on a thing which was not alive, which was not like any"
horse or camel he had ever seen.
"This was all very good hearing, so I proceeded to tell him that the"
"petrol belonged to me, and, as he quite cheerfully acquiesced, I gave"
him a receipt which he could show to any Government official in case
of needed absolution in the future. As we now had means to finish our
"journey by car, I decided to spend the night at the rest-house."
"After a simple camp meal Allan, worn out with the strenuous work of"
"the past two days and night, was quickly snoring in the deep sleep of"
"exhaustion, so I went for a stroll."
As I paced up and down I tried to draw up some preliminary plan
"for the coming campaign. But such occupation was somewhat futile,"
one hand and a dart in the Heart with three drops of Blood proceeding from
"it in the other."" They took nine Portuguese vessels off the coast of"
"Brazil, out of which they took plunder of very great value."
"Quelch now had the audacity to sail back to Marblehead, where his crew"
landed and quickly scattered with their plunder. Within a week Quelch was
"in gaol, and was taken to Boston, where his trial began on June 17th,"
"1704, and he was found guilty. The days between the sentence and the"
"execution must have, indeed, been trying for the prisoner. We read in a"
"pamphlet published at the time: ""The Ministers of the Town used more than"
ordinary Endeavours to Instruct the Prisoners and bring them to
"Repentance. There were Sermons Preached in their hearing Every Day, and"
"Prayer daily made with them. And they were Catechised, and they had many"
occasional Exhortations. And nothing was left that could be done for their
"Good."""
"On Friday, June 30th, 1704, Quelch and his companions marched on foot"
through the town of Boston to Scarlil's Wharf with a strong armed guard of
"musketeers, accompanied by various officials and two ministers, while in"
"front was carried a silver oar, the emblem of a pirate's execution. Before"
the last act the minister gave a long and fervent harangue to the wretched
"culprits, in all of whom were observed suitable signs of repentance except"
"Quelch, who, stepping forward on the platform, his hat in his hand, and"
"bowing left and right to the spectators, gave a short address, in which he"
"warned them ""They should take care how they brought Money into New England"
"to be Hanged for it."""
"QUITTANCE, JOHN."
One of Captain Quelch's crew of the brigantine _Charles_. Tried with the
"rest of that crew at the Star Tavern at Boston in June, 1704."
"eternal _à propos_. What he writes is never vague, never dark--it is"
always plausible. Everything seemingly flows of itself like a fountain.
"It always rings true as to tone, turn of phrase and accent. It has"
"almost the light harmony of Ariosto. And it is, like Ariosto, never"
"tragic, never truly heroic. It carries us away, indeed, but it is never"
itself truly enraptured.
The more artistic aspects of Erasmus's talent come out most
clearly--though they are everywhere in evidence--in those two
"recreations after more serious labour, the _Moriae Encomium_ and the"
_Colloquia_. But just those two have been of enormous importance for his
influence upon his times. For while Jerome reached tens of readers and
"the New Testament hundreds, the _Moria_ and _Colloquies_ went out to"
thousands. And their importance is heightened in that Erasmus has
nowhere else expressed himself so spontaneously.
"In each of the Colloquies, even in the first purely formulary ones,"
"there is the sketch for a comedy, a novelette or a satire. There is"
"hardly a sentence without its 'point', an expression without a vivid"
fancy. There are unrivalled niceties. The abbot of the _Abbatis et
eruditae colloquium_ is a Molière character. It should be noticed how
"well Erasmus always sustains his characters and his scenes, because he"
_sees_ them. In 'The woman in childbed' he never forgets for a moment
"that Eutrapelus is an artist. At the end of 'The game of knucklebones',"
"when the interlocutors, after having elucidated the whole nomenclature"
"of the Latin game of knuckle-bones, are going to play themselves,"
"Carolus says: 'but shut the door first, lest the cook should see us"
playing like two boys'.
"As Holbein illustrated the _Moria_, we should wish to possess the"
"_Colloquia_ with illustrations by Brueghel, so closely allied is"
Erasmus's witty clear vision of incidents to that of this great master.
Everybody understood what he hinted. Sir Robert did not care to depend
on the will of Coxon and his seceders.
"""And what about Coxon and Puttock?"" was the next question."
"""Haven't I been indiscreet enough?"""
"""Well, what are you going to do yourself?"""
"""My duty,"" answered Mr. Kilshaw, with a smile, and the throng, failing"
"to extract any more from him, did at last set about the task of getting"
home to bed in good earnest.
They could rest sooner than the man who occupied so much of their
interest. It had been a busy evening for the defeated Minister; he had
"colleagues to see, letters to write, messages to send, conferences to"
"hold. No doubt there was much to do, and yet Norburn, who watched him"
"closely, doubted whether he did not make work for himself, perhaps as a"
"means of distraction, perhaps as a device for postponing an interview"
"with his daughter. He had seen her for a minute when he came in, and"
told her he would tell her all there was to tell some time that night;
but the moment for it was slow in coming. Norburn had been struck with
"Daisy's composure. She had seen the _Evening Mail_, and, without"
"attempting to discuss the matter with him, she expressed her conviction"
that there could be nothing distressing behind the mysterious paragraph.
Norburn did not know what to say to her. He felt that in a case of this
"sort a girl's mind was a closed book to him. He had himself, on the way"
"back from the House, heard a brief account of the whole matter from the"
"Premier's lips; it seemed to him, in the light of his ideas and"
"theories, a matter of very little moment. He was of course aware how"
"widely the judgment of many would differ from his, and when his mind was"
"""I did not express that opinion,"" he hastened to protest.  ""Before we"
discuss the matter further it will be best for me to see her.  Death may
"have been due to natural causes, for aught we know."""
I stood motionless.  His suggestion that my sweetheart of the old days
had committed suicide because I had forsaken her was a startling one.
Surely that could not be so?
"""Come,"" my friend said, ""let us lose no time.  Which is the room?"""
"I led him along the corridor, and opened the door of the chamber in"
which she was lying so cold and still.  The light of the afterglow fell
"full upon her, tipping her auburn hair with crimson and illuminating her"
face with a warm radiance that gave her back the appearance of life.
"But it was only for a few moments.  The slanting ray was lost, and the"
pallor of that beautiful countenance became marked against the gold of
her wondrous hair.
"In silence I stood at the foot of the bed watching my friend, who was"
now busy with his examination.  He opened her eyes and closed them
"again, felt her heart, raised her arms, and examined her mouth, uttering"
no word.  His serious face wore a look as though he were infinitely
puzzled.
One after the other he examined the palms of her hands long and
"carefully, then, bending until his eyes were close to her face, he"
"examined her lips, brow, and the whole surface of her cheeks.  Upon her"
"neck, below the left ear, was a mark to which he returned time after"
"time, as though not satisfied as to its cause.  Upon her lower lip, too,"
"was a slight yellow discoloration, which he examined several times,"
comparing it with the mark upon the neck.  He was unable to account for
"""I fancy,--I think,--we have met,--before! May I, . . dare I, . . ask"
"your name?"""
"Slowly she unclasped her gently folded hands; slowly, very slowly, she"
"lifted her bent head, and smiled at him! Oh, the lovely light upon her"
"face! Oh, the angel glory of those strange, sweet eyes!"
"""My name is EDRIS!""--she said, and as the pure bell-like tone of her"
"voice smote the air with its silvery sound, the mysterious music of the"
"organ and the invisible singers throbbed away,--away,--away,--into"
"softer and softer echoes, that died at last tremulously and with a"
"sigh, as of farewell, into the deepest silence."
"""EDRIS!""--In a trance of passionate awe and rapture he caught her"
"hand,--the warm, delicate hand that yielded to his strong clasp in"
"submissive tenderness,--pulsations of terror, pain, and wild joy, all"
"commingled, rushed through him,--with adoring, wistful gaze he scanned"
"every feature of that love-smiling countenance,--a countenance no"
"longer lustrous with Heaven's blinding glory, but only most maiden-like"
"and innocently fair,--dazzled, perplexed, and half afraid, he could not"
at once grasp the true comprehension of his ineffable delight! He had
no doubt of her identity--he knew her well! she was his own
"heartworshipped Angel,--but on what errand had she wandered out of"
"paradise? Had she come once more, as on the Field of Ardath, to comfort"
"him for a brief space with the beauty of her visible existence, or did"
she bring from Heaven the warrant for his death?
"""Edris!"" he said, as softly as one may murmur a prayer, ""Edris, my"
"life, my love! Speak to me again! make me sure that I am not dreaming!"
Tell me where I have failed in my sworn faith since we parted; teach me
how I must still further atone! Is this the hour appointed for my
"spirit's ransom?--has this dear and sacred hand I hold, brought me my"
And so it was that Johnson decided to pass the night in the Girl's
"canopied bed while she herself, rolled up in a blanket rug before the"
"fire, slept on the floor."
"""This beats a bed any time,"" remarked the Girl, spreading out the rug"
"smoothly; and then, reaching up for the old patchwork, silk quilt that"
"hung from the loft, she added: ""There's one thing--you don't have to"
"make it up in the mornin'."""
"""You're splendid, Girl!"" laughed Johnson. Presently, he saw her quietly"
"closet herself in the cupboard, only to emerge a few minutes later"
dressed for the night. Over her white cambric gown with its coarse lace
"trimming showing at the throat, she wore a red woollen blanket robe held"
"in at the waist by a heavy, twisted, red cord which, to the man who got"
"a glimpse of her as she crossed the room, made her prettier, even, than"
she had seemed at any time yet.
"Quietly, now, the Girl began to put her house in order. All the lights,"
"save the quaintly-shaded lamp that was suspended over the table, were"
"extinguished; that one, after many unsuccessful attempts, was turned"
down so as to give the right minimum of light which would not interfere
with her lover's sleep. Then she went over to the door to make sure that
it was bolted. Outside the wind howled and shrieked and moaned; but
inside the cabin it had never seemed more cosey and secure and peaceful
to her.
"""Now you can talk to me from your bunk an' I'll talk to you from mine,"""
"she said in a sleepy, lazy voice."
Except for a prodigious yawn which came from the Girl there was an
ominous quiet hanging over the place that chilled the man. Sudden sounds
"startled him, and he found it impossible to make any progress with his"
"and may you not sell that which is your property? Are not these dogs,"
"the people, your slaves, your property? Yet you stand in cowardly fear"
of a rabble which quakes if you but crook your finger. A like fear of his
subjects cost your father his head. The people will crawl before you if
"you kick them, but let them see that you fear them, and you will learn"
"that there is no cruelty like that of the good people."""
"De Grammont, the French exile, called attention to the French king's"
"successful tyranny, declaring that his master would sell Paris if he"
chose. De Grammont was acting secretly in the French king's interest.
"A weak man easily finds logic to justify the course he desires to take,"
"so Charles turned a deaf ear to Clarendon, and, listening to Castlemain,"
"announced that Dunkirk was for sale. As expected, a strong protest came"
"from the people, but no one is so stubborn as a fool in the wrong, so"
Charles remained firm in his determination.
"Finding that protest would avail nothing, the people of London offered to"
"buy Dunkirk, and began to bid for it against the French king. Louis,"
"knowing that London was a rich city, and believing that its people would"
"run up the price of Dunkirk to an exorbitant figure, took counsel with"
himself--his only adviser--and determined to employ other means than gold
alone to obtain the coveted city.
My first definite knowledge of the French king's new plan to buy Dunkirk
"at his own price came in a letter from Hamilton, which reached me at"
Lilly's house two or three weeks after my return from Dover. Like the
"others, it was written in cipher, but, translated, was as follows:--"
DEAR FRIEND:
"""Your warning letter reached me nearly a week ago, and I thank you for"
the lieutenant had appeared in his room with a revolver and had
threatened to shoot him unless he produced a suit of civilian
clothes. Thus coerced he had given him his eldest son's Sunday
clothes left behind when the said son went off to join the Belgian
"army. The lieutenant, grateful for the assistance, had given him as"
a present his watch and chain.
On the other hand the German non-commissioned officers insisted
their lieutenant had been made away with in the night. The farmer's
allegation that he had deserted (as in fact he had) only enhanced
his crime. The finding of the court after a very summary trial was
"""guilty,"" and despite the frantic appeals of the wife, reinforced"
"later on by Mrs. Warren, the farmer had been taken out and shot."
The evening meal consequently was one of strained relations. Colonel
von Giesselin came to supper punctually and was very spruce in
appearance. But he was gravely polite and uncommunicative. And after
dessert the two ladies asked permission to retire. They lay long
"awake afterwards, debating in whispers what terror might be in store"
for them. Mrs. Warren cried a good deal and lamented futilely her
"indolent languor of a few days previously. _Why_ had she not, while"
"there was yet time, cleared out of Brussels, gone to Holland, and"
"thence regained England with Vivie, and from England the south of"
"France? Vivie, more stoical, pointed out it was no use crying over"
"lost opportunities. Here they were, and they must sharpen their wits"
to get away at the first opportunity. Perhaps the American Consul
might help them?
"The next morning, however, their guest, who had insensibly turned"
"host, told Vivie the tram service to Brussels, like the train"
"service, was suspended indefinitely, and that he feared they must"
resign themselves to staying where they were. Under his protection
"softly crooning in an unknown tongue over the poor dead babe, she"
"lovingly closed its eyes, and taking a sheet from a wall-press that"
"stood partially open, she began to enwrap the little girl in its crisp"
"white folds. The Spaniards are like the Scottish folk in this, that they"
have universally stores of the best and finest linen.
La Giralda was about to lay the wooden puppet aside as a thing of little
"worth, but something in the clutch of the small dead hands touched and"
troubled her. She altered her intention.
"""No, you shall not be parted!"" she said, ""and if there be a resurrection"
"as the priests prate of--why, you shall e'en wake with the doll in your"
"arms!"""
"So the pair, in death not divided, were wrapt up together, and the gipsy"
woman prepared to carry her light burden afield. But before doing so she
"went to the bed. It was an ancient woman who lay thereon, clutching the"
"bed-clothes, and drawn together with the last agony. La Giralda gazed at"
her a moment.
"""You I cannot carry--it is impossible,"" she muttered; ""you must take"
"your chance--even as I, if so be that the plague comes to me from this"
"innocent!"""
"Nevertheless, she cast another coverlet over the dead woman's face, and"
"went down the broad stairs of red brick, carrying her burden like a"
"precious thing. La Giralda might be no good Catholic, no fervent"
"Protestant, but I doubt not the First Martyr of the faith, the Preacher"
"of the Mount, would have admitted her to be a very fair Christian. On"
the whole I cannot think her chances in the life to come inferior to
"those of the astute Don Baltasar Varela, Prior of the Abbey of"
"Montblanch, or those of many a shining light of orthodoxy in a world"
"nonchalantly. ""And--we're in lots of time."""
"Mr. Jobling looked cross. ""Five minutes more would have lost you the"
"train,"" he remarked somewhat sourly. ""And where would Captain Dove and I"
"have been then!"""
"As it was, however, they found Captain Dove in his berth, sound asleep,"
"although still fully dressed. And, as Slyne ushered Sallie into the"
"double compartment reserved for her and Ambrizette, ""Don't go to bed"
"just yet,"" he begged. ""I want to show you something by and by. You'll"
"have lots of time for a long sleep before we arrive."""
"""All right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""I'll wait up till you come for me."""
"When he at length knocked at her door again, Mr. Jobling was still with"
her. She came out between them into the narrow corridor. Slyne rubbed
clear one steamy window to let her see the wintry landscape through
which they were travelling at express speed. And Sallie looked out
"delighted, at the sleeping English countryside as its broad grass-lands"
"and bare brown acres, coverts and coppices, hedgerows and lanes, with"
"here and there a grange or a group of cottages, all still and silent,"
"flashed into sight and so disappeared; until, overlooking them all from"
"a knoll on the near bank of a broad, winding river, there loomed up a"
"most magnificent mansion, embedded, in lordly seclusion, among many"
"gnarled and age-old oaks, with gardens terrace on terrace about it, tall"
"fountains among their empty flower-beds, a moss-grown sun-dial at the"
"edge of a quiet, silver lake."
"The moon was shining full on its innumerable windows, so that it seemed"
"to be lighted up from within, although, in reality, all were shuttered"
"and dark. Aloof and very stately it stood on that windless night, an"
"empty palace which came and went in a few moments, wing after wing, with"
"the foliage, still flashes and dominates the landscape. Ha-ha! proud"
"mankind! There you ride! But alas, most of the men are still"
"khaki-muffled, rabbit-indistinguishable, ignominious. The Italians look"
curiously rabbity in the grey-green uniform: just as our sand-colored
"khaki men look doggy. They seem to scuffle rather abased, ignominious"
"on the earth. Give us back the scarlet and gold, and devil take the"
hindmost.
*       *       *       *       *
The landscape really begins to change. The hillsides tilt sharper and
"sharper. A man is ploughing with two small red cattle on a craggy,"
tree-hanging slope as sharp as a roof-side. He stoops at the small
"wooden plough, and jerks the ploughlines. The oxen lift their noses to"
"heaven, with a strange and beseeching snake-like movement, and taking"
"tiny little steps with their frail feet, move slantingly across the"
"slope-face, between rocks and tree-roots. Little, frail, jerky steps the"
"bullocks take, and again they put their horns back and lift their"
"muzzles snakily to heaven, as the man pulls the line. And he skids his"
wooden plough round another scoop of earth. It is marvellous how they
"hang upon that steep, craggy slope. An English labourer's eyes would"
bolt out of his head at the sight.
There is a stream: actually a long tress of a water-fall pouring into a
"little gorge, and a stream-bed that opens a little, and shows a"
marvellous cluster of naked poplars away below. They are like ghosts.
"They have a ghostly, almost phosphorescent luminousness in the shadow of"
"the valley, by the stream of water. If not phosphorescent, then"
"incandescent: a grey, goldish-pale incandescence of naked limbs and"
"myriad cold-glowing twigs, gleaming strangely. If I were a painter I"
"would paint them: for they seem to have living, sentient flesh. And the"
shadow envelopes them.
will trade them with the Sinaketans. Thus the hosts from the Kula
community act as intermediaries in any trading relations between the
Sinaketans and the inhabitants of more remote districts.
"To sum up the sociology of these transactions, we may say that"
the visitor enters into a threefold relation with the Dobuan
"natives. First, there is his partner, with whom he exchanges general"
"gifts on the basis of free give and take, a type of transaction,"
running side by side with the Kula proper. Then there is the local
"resident, not his personal Kula partner, with whom he carries on"
gimwali. Finally there is the stranger with whom an indirect exchange
is carried on through the intermediation of the local men. With
"all this, it must not be imagined that the commercial aspect of"
the gathering is at all conspicuous. The concourse of the natives
"is great, mainly owing to their curiosity, to see the ceremonial"
reception of the uvalaku party. But if I say that every visitor from
"Boyowa, brings and carries away about half-a-dozen articles, I do"
not under-state the case. Some of these articles the Sinaketan has
acquired in the industrial districts of Boyowa during his preliminary
"trading expedition (see Chapter VI, Division III). On these he scores"
a definite gain. A few samples of the prices paid in Boyowa and those
received in Dobu will indicate the amount of this gain.

saluted and stood at attention. There was a moment's silence in the
"room, but before Rollo had time to speak the Queen-Regent recovered her"
self-possession. The daughter of the Bourbons stood erect. Her long hair
streamed in dark glossy waves over her shoulders. Her bosom heaved
visibly under the thin pink wrapper. Anger struggled with fear in her
eyes. Verily Maria Cristina of Naples had plenty of courage.
"""Who are you,"" she cried, ""that dare thus to break in upon the privacy"
"of the Regent Queen of Spain? Duke, call the guard!"""
But her husband only shrugged his shoulders and continued to gaze upon
the pair of intruders with a calm exterior.
"""Your Majesty,"" said Rollo, courteously, naturally resuming the"
leadership when anything requiring contact with gentlefolk came in the
"way, ""I am here to inform you that you are in great danger--greater than"
"I can for the moment make clear to you. The palace is, as I understand,"
absolutely without defence--the town is in the same position. It is
within our knowledge that a band of two hundred gipsies are on the march
"to attack you this night in order to plunder the château, and put to"
"death every soul within its walls. We have come, therefore, together"
"with our companions outside, to offer our best services in your"
"Majesty's defence!"""
"""But,"" cried the Queen-Regent, ""all this may very well be, but you have"
"not yet told me who you are and what you are doing here!"""
"""For myself,"" answered Rollo, ""I am a Scottish gentleman, trained from"
my youth to the profession of arms. Those who wait without are for the
"present comrades and companions, whom, with your Majesty's permission, I"
"shall bid to enter. For to be plain, every moment is of the utmost"
"importance, that we may lose no time in putting the château into such a"
"and the little Queen of Spain!"""
"She subsided on a stone, dropped her head into her hands, and took no"
"further notice of the Sergeant, who stood awhile with his hand resting"
"on her shoulder in deep meditation. There was, he thought, no more to be"
said or done. He knew all there was to know. The men had not asked him
"to join them, so he would venture no further questions as to the time"
and the manner of attack. They were still jealous of him with that
easily aroused jealousy of south and north which in Spain divides even
the clannish gipsy.
Nevertheless he went the round of the men. They were mostly busy with
"their games, and some of them even snatched the stakes in to them, lest"
he should demand a percentage of the winnings after the manner of
Sevilla. The Sergeant smiled at the reputation which distance and many
"tongues had given him. Then, with a few words of good fellowship and"
"the expression of a wish for success and abundant plunder, he bade them"
farewell. It was a great deed which they designed and one worthy of his
"best days. He was now old, he said, and must needs choose easier"
courses. He did not desire twice to feel the grip of the collar of iron.
"But young blood--oh, it would have its way and run its risks!"
Here the Sergeant smiled and raised his Montera cap. The men as
"courteously bade him good-day, preserving, however, a certain respectful"
"distance, and adding nothing to the information he had already obtained."
"But Chica, seated on her stone, with her scarlet-bound head on her hand,"
neither looked up nor gave him any greeting as his feet went slowly down
the rocky glen and crunched over the begrimed patches of last year's
"snow, now wide-pored and heavy with the heat of noonday."
"manners, tasteful in dress, speaking English marvellously well,"
"highly accomplished in music or with some other art, advocates of"
the enfranchisement of women. The War came just too soon. Had Heaven
"struck down that epilept Emperor and a few of his ministers, had"
time been given for the New German Woman to assert herself in
"politics, there would have been no invasion of Belgium, no"
maltreatment of Servia. Germany would have ranged herself with the
Western powers and Western culture.
Minna von Stachelberg read her cousin's note and received the worn
"and anxious-looking Vivie like a sister ... like a comrade, she"
"said, in the War for the Vote ... ""which we will resume, my dear, as"
"soon as this dreadful Man's war is over, only we won't fight with"
"the same weapons."""
"But though kind, she was not gushing and she soon told Vivie that in"
nursing she was a novice and had much to learn. She introduced her
"to the German and Belgian surgeons, and then put her to a series of"
entirely menial tasks from which she was to work her way up by
"degrees. But if any English soldier were there and wanted sympathy,"
she should be called in to his ward ... From that interview Vivie
returned almost happy.
In the hot summer months she would sometimes be allowed to accompany
"Red Cross surgeons and nurses to the station, when convoys of"
"wounded were expected, if there was likelihood that British soldiers"
would be amongst them. These would cheer up at the sound of her
pleasant voice speaking their tongue. Yet she would witness on such
occasions incongruous incidents of German brutality. Once there came
"out of the train an English and a French soldier, great friends"
evidently. They were only slightly wounded and the English soldier
stretched his limbs cautiously to relieve himself of cramp. At that
"brown. Meanwhile, the abdomen was somewhat painful. When seen"
on the third day he had ceased to vomit for three hours. The
"face was slightly anxious, and the patient lay on the ground"
"with the lower extremities extended. Temperature 99°, pulse 72,"
"fair strength. Respirations 32, shallow. Tongue moist, lightly"
"furred, bowels not open for four days. He slept fairly last"
"night. Abdomen soft, moving well with respiration, no"
"distension, slight tenderness below and to the right of the"
"umbilicus, and local dulness in right flank."
"The next day the pulse fell to 60 and the bowels acted, but"
there was no change in the local condition. The man looked
"somewhat ill until the end of a week, but was then sent to the"
"Base, and at the expiration of a month was sent home well."
(177*) Wounded at Modder River. Two apertures of _entry_
(Mauser); (_a_) below cartilage of eighth rib in left nipple
line; (_b_) 2 inches below and 4-1/2 inches to the left of the
"median line. No exit wound discovered, and no track could be"
"palpated between the two openings, which were both circular and"
depressed. When seen on fourth day there was tenderness in the
"lower half of the abdomen, and the left thigh was held in a"
"flexed position. Respirations 20, respiratory movement confined"
"to upper half of abdominal wall. Pulse 70, temperature 99°."
"Tongue moist, covered with white fur; bowels confined since the"
accident; no sickness. The patient remained under observation
"thirteen days, during which time pain and difficulty in"
"movement of the left thigh persisted, also slight tenderness in"
the lower part of the abdomen; but at the end of a month he was
"sent to England well, but unfit to take further part in the"
"campaign. I thought the bullet might be in the left psoas, but"
it was not localised.
"have gained admission by some secret passage!"""
With Rollo Blair to think was to act. So in another moment he had
"slipped off his shoes, and treading noiselessly on his stocking soles"
and with a naked sword in his hand he made his way swiftly and carefully
down towards the place whence he had heard the noise.
Descending by the grand _escalier_ he found himself in one of the narrow
corridors which communicated by private staircases with the left wing of
the palace. Rollo stood still in the deepest shadow. He was sure that he
"could hear persons moving near him, and once he thought that he could"
distinguish the sound of a muttered word.
The Egyptian darkness about him grew more and more instinct with noises.
"There was a scuffling rustle, as of birds in a chimney, all over the"
basement of the house. A door creaked as if a slight wind had blown it.
"Then a latch clicked, and the wind, unaided, does not click latches."
Rollo withdrew himself deeper into a niche at the foot of the narrow
winding-stair which girdled a tower in the thickness of the wall.
"The young man had almost resolved to summon his whole force from above,"
so convinced was he that the enemy had gained a footing within the tower
"and were creeping up to take them in the rear, when a sound altered his"
intention. There is nothing more unmistakable to the ear than the
rebellious whimper of an angry child compelled to do something against
its will.
Rollo instantly comprehended the whole chain of circumstances. The
treachery touched him more nearly than he had imagined possible. Those
for whom he and his party were imperilling their lives were in fact to
leave them to perish as best they might in the empty shell of the
palace. The royal birds were on the point of flying.
"suddenly turned back, with a quick warning cry to her cavalcade. The"
"donkey instantly stood still, patient amid its fagots as an image in a"
"church. The goats scattered like water poured on flat ground, and began"
"to crop stray blades of grass, invisible to any eyes but their own, amid"
wastes of cracked earth and deserts of grey water-worn pebbles.
"As she looked back, Sergeant Cardono was disappearing up among the"
"tumbled foot-hills and dry beds of winter torrents, which render the"
"lower spurs of the Guadarrama such a puzzle to the stranger, and such a"
paradise for the smuggler and _guerrillero_. In another moment he had
disappeared. With a long quiet sigh La Giralda stole back to the
"farmhouse. In spite of her race, and heathenish lack of creed, the spark"
of humanity was far from dead in her bosom. The thought of the open eyes
"of the little girl, which gazed even in death with fixed rapture upon"
"her wooden treasure, remained with her."
"""The woman is as old as I--she can bide her time!"" she muttered to"
"herself. ""But the child--these arms are not yet so shrunken that they"
"cannot dig up a little earth to lay the babe thereunder."""
"And at the chamber door La Giralda paused. Like her people, she was"
neither a good nor yet a bad Catholic. Consciously or unconsciously she
"held a more ancient faith, though she worshipped at no shrine, told no"
"beads, and uttered no prayers."
"""They have not been long dead,"" she said to herself, as she entered;"
"""the window is open and the air is sweet. Yet the plague, which snatches"
"away the young and strong, may look askance at old Giralda's hold on"
"life, which at the best is no stronger than the strength of a"
"basting-thread!"""
"Having said these words she advanced to the low trundle-bed, and,"
"""Bien, m'sieur,"" answered the woman, disappearing and closing the door"
after her.
My object in dismissing her was to make a thorough search of the
"apartment, in order to discover whether any of Yolande's private"
possessions were there.  She had been denounced by Kaye and Anderson as
"a spy, and it occurred to me that I might possibly discover the truth."
But she was dead.  The painful fact seemed absolutely incredible.
"The room was not a large one, but well furnished, with considerable"
"taste and elegance.  There was the broad, silk-covered couch, upon which"
Yolande had sat in the full possession of health and spirits only a
"couple of hours before; the skin rug, upon which her tiny foot had been"
"stretched so coquettishly; the small table, by which she had stood"
supporting herself after I had made the fatal announcement that Wolf was
in Paris.
As I stood there the whole of that strangely dramatic scene occurred to
me.  Yet she was dead--dead!  She had died with her secret in her heart.
"At any moment Dick Deane might arrive, but I desired to be the first to"
"make an examination of the room, and with that object crossed to the"
"little escritoire of inlaid olive-wood, one of those rather gimcrack"
pieces of furniture manufactured along the Ligurian coast for
unsuspecting winter visitors.  It was the only piece of incongruous
"furniture in the room, all the rest being genuine Louis Quatorze."
"One or two letters bearing conspicuous coats-of-arms were lying there,"
but all were notes of a private nature from one or other of her friends.
"One was an invitation to Vichy from the Baronne Deland, wife of the"
"great Paris financier; another, signed ""Rose,"" spoke of the gaiety of"
Cairo and the dances at Shepheard's during the past winter; while a
"was a reinforcement of foot from Fulda, rank upon rank of shambling"
"men trailing long pikes, and footsore, and parched as they were,"
getting over the ground in a wonderful fashion. After them would come
"a long string of waggons, bearing corn, and hay, and malt, and wines;"
"all lurching slowly forward, slowly southward; often delayed, for"
"every quarter of a mile a horse fell or an axle broke, yet getting"
forward.
"And then the most wonderful sight of all, a regiment of Swedish horse"
"passed us, marching from Erfurt. All their horses were grey, and all"
"their head-pieces, backs and breasts of black metal, matched one"
another. As they came on through the dust with a tramp which shook the
"ground, they sang, company by company, to the music of drums and"
"trumpets, a hymn, 'Versage nicht, du Häuflein klein!' Behind them a"
"line of light waggons carried their wives and children, also singing."
"And so they went by us, eight hundred swords, and I thought it a"
marvel I should never see beaten.
"When they were gone out of sight, there were still droves of horses"
"and mighty flocks of sheep to come, and cargoes of pork, and more foot"
and horse and guns. Some companies wore buff coats and small steel
"caps, and carried arquebuses; and some marched smothered in huge"
headpieces with backs and breasts to match. And besides all the
things I have mentioned and the crowds of sutlers and horse-boys that
"went with them, there were munition waggons closely guarded, and"
"pack-horses laden with powder, and always and always waggons of corn"
and hay.
"And all hurrying, jostling, crawling southwards. It seemed to me that"
the world was marching southwards; that if we went on we must fall in
at the end of this with every one we knew. And the thought comforted
me.
"his family and friends, but, finding a certain demand for the fruit,"
later began to import it systematically. From this casual start the
United Fruit Company and its hustling competitors have grown. The whole
business is the development of a few decades and people still young can
"remember when bananas were sold, each wrapped in tissue paper, for five"
"or ten cents, while today ten or fifteen cents a dozen is a fair price."
"The fruit can be prepared in a multitude of fashions, particularly the"
"coarser varieties of plantains, and the Fruit Company has compiled a"
"banana cook book but has taken little pains to circulate it, the demand"
for the fruit being at times still in excess of the supply. There seems
every indication that the demand is constant and new banana territory is
being steadily developed.
[Illustration: DRYING THE COFFEE BEANS]
Several companies share with the United Fruit Company the Panama market.
The methods of gathering and marketing the crop employed by all are
"practically the same, but the United Fruit Company is used as an"
illustration here because its business is the largest and because it has
so closely followed the Isthmian Canal Commission in its welfare work.
The banana country lies close to the ocean and mainly on the Atlantic
"side of the Isthmus. The lumber industry nestles close to the rivers,"
mainly in the Bayano region. Cocoanuts need the beaches and the sea
"breezes. Native rubber is found in every part of the Republic, though at"
"present it is collected mainly in the Darien, which is true also of"
vegetable ivory. The only gold which is mined on a large scale is taken
from the neighborhood of the Tuyra River in the Darien. But for products
requiring cultivation like cacao and coffee the high lands in the
Chiriqui province offer the best opportunity.

"fully what were the Girl's feelings, did not dare to whisper even a word"
"of encouragement to her. At last, she ordered the Indian to lead the"
"way, and they started."
"The trail curved and twisted around the mountain, and in places they had"
to use the greatest care lest a misstep should carry them over a
"precipice with a drop of hundreds of feet. It was a perilous descent,"
"inasmuch as the path was covered with snow. Moreover, it was necessary"
that as little noise as possible should be made while they were making
"their way past the buildings of the camp below, for the Mexican had not"
"been wrong when he stated that Ashby's men were quartered at, or in the"
"immediate vicinity of, The Palmetto. Fortunately, they passed through"
"without meeting anyone, and before long they came to the edge of the"
plateau beneath which was the ravine which Johnson had to cross to reach
the spot where it had been agreed that Castro should be waiting with
horses for his master. It was also the place where the Girl was to leave
"her lover to go on alone, and so they halted. A few moments passed"
"without either of them speaking; at length, the man said in as cheery a"
voice as he could summon:
"""I must leave you here. I remember the way well. All danger is past."""
The Girl's lips were quivering; she asked:
"""An' when will you be back?"""
"The man noted her emotion, and though he himself was conscious of a"
choking sensation he contrived to say in a most optimistic tone:
"""In two weeks--not more than two weeks. It will take all that time to"
"arrange things at the rancho. As it is, I hardly see my way clear to"
"dismissing my men--you see, they belong to me, almost, and--but I'll do"
"I had no authority to compel him to go on, so gave up the struggle."
But I realised more than ever how imperative it was to endeavour
"to reach Robat without a moment's unnecessary delay, and start"
"conclusions with the Raiders, whose menace was growing more dangerous"
every day.
"We were, therefore, on the road very early next morning, for I hoped"
"to make Saindak that night. I had intended to go by Borgar, but now"
"that I knew--for I had verified the contractor's statements, and"
believed them to be correct--that that place was in the hands of

"_Webb-Ware_ route, which is practically out of use nowadays, hoping,"
"thereby, to avoid the enemy."
It was still dark when we set off on the most strenuous part of our
"journey; climbing, making détours, digging the car out again and"
again till we were all three worn out in body and temper. We hardly
"halted that day, for the necessity for speed was as fully realised by"
Allan as by myself.
"When night fell we had not yet sighted Saindak, but I knew we could"
"not be very far off, and cursed the coming of the night which made"
it impossible to see where we were. I knew we had got off the camel
"track somehow, for the ground was even more bumpy than it had been,"
"and was frequently intersected by nullahs or rocky ravines, which"
made the going positively dangerous. If the car were knocked right
out of action our difficulties would reach the last stage of disaster.
"At last, in despair, Allan stopped, saying it was useless going on"
any further. We might overturn the car at any moment and smash it as
well as ourselves. He submitted that the only sane thing would be to
time comes--after I've done my part.

"busy week ahead of us."""
"She saw that he did not intend to tell her any more in the meantime, and"
"was glad to see him go. Then she called Ambrizette in for company, and"
"sat down by the window again, to try to sort out for herself the"
bewildering tangle that life had once more become within a few hours.
"Gazing out across the familiar sea with wistful, far-away eyes, she"
mused for a time over what Captain Dove had told Mr. Jobling of her
"history, and strove to piece together with that all she herself could"
recall of that dim and always more mysterious past out of which she had
"come to be Captain Dove's property, bought and paid for, at a high"
"price, as he had repeated several times."
"Her own earliest vague, disconnected, ineffectual memories were all of"
"some dark, savage mountain-country; of endless days of travel; of"
"camp-fires in the cold, and hungry camels squealing for fodder; of the"
fragrant cinnamon-smell of the steam that came from the cooking-pots.
"Before, or, it might have been, after that, she had surely lived on some"

"anyway. Newton, the good old egg, knows what you fellows are up against"
"and is going to do something about it, if he has to lick all the rest of"
the directors to do it. He knew that I was loose for a couple of weeks
and asked me to come along this trip to see what I could see. I'm to
check the observatory data--they don't know I'm aboard--take the peaks
"and valleys off your acceleration curve, if possible, and report to"
Newton just what I find out and what I think should be done about it.
"How early am I?"" While the newcomer was talking, he had stripped the"
covers from a precise scale model of the solar system and from a large
and complicated calculating machine and had set to work without a wasted
motion or instant--scaling off upon the model the positions of the
various check-stations and setting up long and involved integrals and
equations upon the calculator.
"The older man studied the broad back of the younger, bent over his"
"computations, and a tender, almost fatherly smile came over his careworn"
face as he replied:
"""Early? You? Just like you always were--plus fifteen seconds on the"
"deadline. The final dope is due right now."" He plugged the automatic"
"recorder and speaker into a circuit marked ""Observatory,"" waited until"

"""What sort of news is it?"" asked Sallie, no less dubious than her maid"
"had been; and called her maid in, notwithstanding her well-founded"
doubts as to the nature of any news he could bring. For Slyne had held
"out to her the same lure that the serpent offered to Eve, and her"
womanly curiosity would not allow her to order him at once from her
domain.
"Slyne smiled slightly as he sat down in a basket-chair, to look about"
him while she was still busy within. The little after-saloon which had
"been her home for so long was finely furnished; more so, perhaps, than"
"was apparent to Slyne, whose taste in that respect inclined to the"
florid. But he could not help noticing how dainty and neat and feminine
"was its entire effect, with its cushioned cosy corners, snow-white"
curtains and draperies. Its purely fragrant atmosphere stirred even
Slyne's conscience a little.
"He lay back in his seat, and, gazing about him, recalled to mind all he"
had been able to learn as to Sallie's strange past. It all fitted in so
perfectly with the fabric of his wonderful new plans that he could find
no possible flaw in them. And when Sallie herself at length came out to
"him from her cabin, he was optimistically disposed to be very generous"
in his dealings with her.
"Fresh from her bath and doubly bewitching in her clinging, intimate"
"draperies, she met Slyne's glad, eager glance with grave, doubtful eyes,"
and ignored entirely the hand he held out to her as he sprang from his
"chair. But he affected not to notice her attitude of distrust, and,"
"greeting her gaily, saved his face by laying his outstretched hand on"
"another chair, which he set a little nearer his own."
ship was taken by the Welsh pirate Howel Davis. At first Roberts was
"disinclined for the pirate life, but soon changed his mind."
On the death of Davis there were several candidates for the post of
"commander, all brisk and lively men, distinguished by the title of"
"""Lords,"" such as Sympson, Ashplant, Anstis, and others. One of these"
"""Lords,"" Dennis, concluded an eloquent harangue over a bowl of punch with"
a strong appeal for Roberts to be the new chief. This proposal was
"acclaimed with but one dissenting voice, that of ""Lord"" Sympson, who had"
"hopes of being elected himself, and who sullenly left the meeting swearing"
"""he did not care who they chose captain so it was not a papist."" So"
Roberts was elected after being a pirate only six weeks; thus was true
merit quickly appreciated and rewarded amongst them.
[Illustration: CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW ROBERTS.
To face p. 262.]
"Roberts's speech to his fellow-pirates was short but to the point, saying"
"""that since he had dipped his hands in muddy water, and must be a pyrate,"
"it was better being a commander than a common man,"" not perhaps a graceful"
"nor grateful way of expressing his thanks, but one which was no doubt"
understood by his audience.
"Roberts began his career in a bright manner, for to revenge the perfectly"
"justifiable death of their late captain he seized and razed the fort,"
"bombarded the town, and setting on fire two Portuguese ships so as to act"
"as torches, sailed away the same night. Sailing to Brazil they found in"
the Bay of Bahia a fleet of forty-two Portuguese ships ready laden and on
"the point of leaving for Lisbon, and Roberts, with the most astounding"
"boldness, sailed right in amongst them until he found the deepest laden,"
"which he attacked and boarded, although his was a much smaller ship. He"
"by Russia and France, to come out to the Far East, especially because"
the Russian fleets have ceased to exist. I admit that the German fleet
"is strong, but I do not believe it is powerful enough for one to say"
"with certainty that it can easily crush Japan. At all events, what"
pretext has Germany to enter into war in the Far East? Among other
things also she would have to count on the opinion and sentiments of two
"countries at least, I mean England and the United States. I do not,"
"therefore, consider a new combination possible. Japan cannot be"
intimidated by mere barking.
"If, however, Europe should choose to take such a course, we should"
gravely reflect. I do not believe your country for example would ever
undertake an expedition against Japan. You have disapproved a small
expedition to Tonkin and we are a little more serious than the
"Tonkinese. France might no doubt, if her honour demanded it, judge it"
"worth the pain to engage in a war with Japan, but under no other"
circumstance do I believe her disposed to take such a part.
Japan will always continue to advance on the lines of occidental
civilisation. I do not see the reason which will prevent Japan from
"acting in concert with France or Germany, provided of course these"
powers do not enter upon an action which may appear to her altogether
"unjust or iniquitous, in which case she may not be able to march with"
them hand-in-hand.
Would Japan be offended by France introducing civilisation into
Indo-China?
We are not at all opposed to your introducing Western civilisation into
"your colonies. On the contrary we shall be quite contented, but in"
introducing your civilisation into your colonies you have to be prepared
that it signifies an amelioration of the condition of the natives. If it

"and when we left the next morning, curiosity prompted them to pass near"
"the garter rack in the tap-room, where garters were hanging which had"
been taken from maids whose great granddaughters had become great
"grandmothers. The garters that had belonged to Frances and Bettina, being"
"the latest contributions, hung at the bottom of the rack, neatly dated"
"and labelled, and, as I left the room, I overheard Bettina whisper to"
Frances:--
"""I'm glad mine was of silk."""
"We made a short drive to Maidstone, where we stopped over night. The next"
"day a longer journey brought us to Canterbury, where we spent two nights"
"and a day, visiting the cathedral both by sunlight and moonlight; the"
combination of moonlight and Bettina being very trying to me.
"From Canterbury we drove in the rain to Dover, where we lodged at that"
"good inn, the Three Anchors, to await a fair wind for Calais."
"During the next three days the wind was fair, but it was blowing half a"
"gale, and therefore the passage was not to be attempted. Though I was"
"enjoying myself, I was anxious to post our letters, as mine gave a full"
account of several matters at court concerning which I knew George ought
to be informed.
"Among other news, I told him that King Charles had sent a messenger"
"into France carrying a personal letter to King Louis, asking his help"
"in finding the man Hamilton, who had threatened Charles's life. I also"
suggested in my letter that the king of France was trying to buy the
"city of Dunkirk from King Charles, and that because of the friendly"
"negotiations then pending, Louis might give heed to our king's request."
"In that case, it might be well, I thought, for Hamilton to leave France"
"Europe, we had seen crowns which far surpassed this one in costliness"
"and beauty, but none of which, nor all of which combined, had ever"
excited a thousandth part of the interest attaching to this old crown
in Monza.
[Sidenote: Why the Crown is so Sacred.]
The explanation is this: within that ring of jointed plates of gold
"runs a thin band of iron, which priestly tradition says was made of one"
of the spikes that fastened the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ to the
"cross. It was this band of iron that we tiptoed to see, hardly noticing"
the bejewelled rim of gold around it. It was on account of this band of
iron that the priest and his attendant swung their censer and performed
their ceremony as we entered. It was this band of iron that gave to the
crown its sacred place above the altar. It was for the safe keeping of
"this band of iron that the steel case, with its numerous locks, was"
"made. It was from this band of iron that the diadem received its name,"
the Iron Crown of Lombardy.
[Sidenote: How it was Used by Charlemagne and Napoleon.]
"And what were the historical uses of it, referred to above, which made"
it so much more interesting to us than the many other so-called nails
"of the true cross elsewhere? Well, this among others: on the last"
"Christmas day of the eighth century, while Charlemagne was kneeling"
"with uncovered head before the high altar of St. Peter's in Rome,"
"the Pope approached him from behind, and, placing the Iron Crown of"
"Lombardy on his head, hailed him as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire."
"A thousand years later on the 26th of May, 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte,"
"""watched by an apparently invincible army which adored him and a world"
"which feared him,"" standing in the vast marble cathedral at Milan,"
The Pope is the torch of war.
Christ was meekness:
The Pope is pride personified.
Christ promulgated the laws that the Pope tramples under foot.
[Sidenote: What the Italians now Think about it.]
"""But,"" some one may say, ""the pasquinades were written long ago, and,"
"while they are doubtless true descriptions of the papacy of the past,"
"surely no one would take the same view now."" For answer I may quote"
"the statement of Dr. Raffaelle Mariano, Professor of Philosophy in the"
"University of Naples, who is not a Protestant, but, as he tells us, was"
"""born in the Roman Catholic Church,"" and was ""a fervent Catholic from"
"infancy."" Speaking of the vast difference which he found between the"
teachings of the church and those of the New Testament as to what is
"necessary to salvation, he says, ""Therefore, Roman Catholicism is not"
"only not Christianity, but it is the very antithesis of Christianity,"""
a statement every whit as strong as Pasquino's. Some American
"Protestants, especially those who have personal friends in the Roman"
Catholic Church whom they honor and love--and there are many people in
"that church who are richly worthy of honor and love, and who do not"
approve of the evils we have been describing any more than we do--are
sometimes disposed to think that Protestant writers are too severe in
"their condemnation of the Romish Church as a system. A visit to Italy,"
"the centre of Romanism, would quickly disabuse these overcharitable"
Protestants of that impression. We have all read of such things as
"are described above in connection with the relics and legends, but"
"they seem far away and unreal, and almost impossible, until we come"
to the home of Romanism and find them all around us. Then it ceases
to surprise us that so large a proportion of the most intelligent men
"Thus there is no escape, no loophole for a delusive hope, only the"
cultivation of the courage of sorrow.
There are never any exceptions to the laws of the Buddha. If a law is a
"law, that is the end of it. Just as we know of no exceptions to the law"
"of gravitation, so there are no exceptions to the law of death."
"But although this may seem to be a religion of despair, it is not really"
so. This sorrow to which there is no relief is the selfishness of
"sorrow, the grief for our own loneliness; for of sorrow, of fear, of"
"pity for the dead, there is no need. We know that in time all will be"
"well with them. We know that, though there may be before them vast"
"periods of suffering, yet that they will all at last be in Nebhan with"
"us. And if we shall not know them there, still we shall know that they"
"are there, all of them--not one will be wanting. Purified from the lust"
"of life, white souls steeped in the Great Peace, all living things will"
attain rest at last.
"There is this remarkable fact in Buddhism, that nowhere is any fear"
"expressed of death itself, nowhere any apprehension of what may happen"
"to the dead. It is the sorrow of separation, the terror of death to the"
"survivors, that is always dwelt upon with compassion, and the agony of"
which it is sought to soothe.
That the dying man himself should require strengthening to face the King
of Terrors is hardly ever mentioned. It seems to be taken for granted
that men should have courage in themselves to take leave of life
"becomingly, without undue fears. Buddhism is the way to show us the"
"escape from the miseries of life, not to give us hope in the hour of"
death.
distinguished; it was all a question of genius. The Educational Service
"ought to be regarded not as a profession, but as a calling. Some men"
"were born to be teachers. It was not a question of race, of course; in"
"order to have an efficient educational system, there must be an"
"efficient organisation, but this should not be allowed to become"
"fossilised, and thus stand in the way of healthy growth."
"83,639. In the Presidency College a young man fresh from an English"
university was at once appointed a Professor regardless of his lack of
"experience, whereas an Indian who passed in highest examination with"
honours in India was appointed as an Assistant Professor. This grounding
often made him more efficient as a teacher than the Professor recruited
"from England. There were now several Professors in the college, in the"
"Provincial Service, who were highly qualified, and who lectured to the"
highest classes with very great success.
"83,640. In the Physics Department he had under his direction several"
Assistants who were so well qualified that they were allowed to give
"lectures to several classes. These Assistants, after their experience at"
"the Presidency College, would be best fitted to become Professors in the"
mofussil at Colleges. He would like to see them promoted to the higher
service after they had had experience. But before he gave them the
"highest positions, he would make it compulsory for them to go to Europe."
"83,641. A proportion of Europeans in the service was needed, but only as"
experts and not as ordinary teachers. Only the very best men should be
"obtained from Europe, and for exceptional cases. The general educational"
"work should be done entirely by Indians, who understood the difficulties"
of the country much better than any outsider.
"83,642. He advocated the direct recruitment of Indians in India by the"
"local government in consultation with the Secretary of State, rather"
The man who was chosen by Cabrera to accompany them on their mission was
"of a most remarkable appearance. Tall, almost as tall as El Sarria, he"
was yet distinguished from his fellows by a notable gauntness and
angularity of figure.
"""A step-ladder with the bottom bars missing!"" was Rollo's mental"
"description of him, as he stood before them in a uniform jacket much too"
"tight for him, through which his ribs showed not unlike the spars of a"
ladder.
But in other respects Sergeant Cardono was a remarkable man. The iron
"gravity of his countenance, seamed on the right-hand side by a deep"
"scar, took no new expression when he found himself detailed by his"
general for this new and dangerous mission.
With a single salute he fell out and instantly attached himself to
"Rollo, whom he relieved of his knapsack and waterbottle on the spot."
"Sergeant Cardono paid no attention whatever to the other three, whom he"
evidently regarded as very subordinate members of the expedition.
As soon as they arrived at the village where they were to part from the
"command of Cabrera, Sergeant Cardono promptly disappeared. He was not"
"seen for several hours, during which Rollo and El Sarria wandered here"
and there endeavouring in that poor place to pick up some sustenance
which would serve them in lieu of a dinner. They had but poor success. A
"round of black bread, a fowl of amazing age, vitality, and muscular"
"development, with a few snails, were all that they could obtain by their"
"best persuasions, aided by the money with which Rollo was plentifully"
supplied. John Mortimer looked disconsolately on. He had added a little
"ham on his own account, which last he had brought in his saddle-bags"
"from the venta of Sarria. But everything pointed to a sparse meal, and"
even the philosophic Etienne shrugged his shoulders and departed to
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The physical history of the period is recorded
in the succession of its formations. The sandstones of the Upper
"Cambrian, as we have learned, tell of a transgressing sea which"
gradually came to occupy the Mississippi valley and the interior
of North America. The limestones of the early and middle
Ordovician show that now the shore had become remote and the lands
had become more low. The waters now had cleared. Colonies of
brachiopods and other lime-secreting animals occupied the sea
"bottom, and their debris mantled it with sheets of limy ooze. The"
sandy limestones of the Calciferous record the transition stage
from the Cambrian when some sand was still brought in from shore.
The highly fossiliferous limestones of the Trenton tell of clear
water and abundant life. We need not regard this epicontinental
"sea as deep. No abysmal deposits have been found, and the"
"limestones of the period are those which would be laid in clear,"
warm water of moderate depth like that of modern coral seas.
The shales of the Utica and Hudson show that the waters of the sea
now became clouded with mud washed in from land. Either the land
"was gradually uplifted, or perhaps there had arrived one of those"
"periodic crises which, as we may imagine, have taken place"
whenever the crust of the shrinking earth has slowly given way
"over its great depressions, and the ocean has withdrawn its waters"
into deepening abysses. The land was thus left relatively higher
and bordered with new coastal plains. The epicontinental sea was
"shoaled and narrowed, and muds were washed in from the adjacent"
lands.
THE TACONIC DEFORMATION. The Ordovician was closed by a
deformation whose extent and severity are not yet known. From the
"St. Lawrence River to New York Bay, along the northwestern and"
"western border of New England, lies a belt of Cambrian-Ordovician"
"pistol from his belt, looked carefully to the priming, and with the"
greatest coolness in the world pointed it at the misshapen brat.
"""Now listen,"" he said, ""you are old enough to know the meaning of words;"
I give you one minute to betake yourself to your own place and leave us
"alone! There is no contagion in a pistol bullet, my fine lad, but it is"
quite as deadly as any plague. So be off before a charge of powder
"catches you up!"""
"The sound of the angry voices had attracted La Giralda, who, looking up"
hastily from her task of building the fire beneath the gipsy tripod at
"which she and the Sergeant were cooking, advanced hastily with a long"
wand in her hand.
"The imp wheeled about as on a pivot, and positively appeared to shrink"
"into his clothing at the sight of her. He stood motionless, however,"
while La Giralda advanced threateningly towards him with the wand in her
hand as if for the purpose of castigation. As she approached he emitted
"a cry of purely animal terror, and hastily whipping his crutch under his"
"arm, betook himself, in a series of long hops, to a spot twenty yards"
higher up the bank. But La Giralda stopped him by a word or two spoken
"in an unknown tongue, harsh-sounding as Catalan, but curt and brief as a"
military order.
"The boy stood still and answered in the same speech, at first gruffly"
"and unwillingly, with downcast looks and his bare great toe scrabbling"
in the dust of the hillside.
"The dialogue lasted for some time, till at last with a scornful gesture"
"La Giralda released him, pointing to the upper edge of the _barranco_ as"
the place by which he was to disappear: the which he was now as eager to
"do, as he had formerly been insolently determined to remain."
"Hurrying on, Bob presently caught up with a throng of his own men, who"
"had apparently just landed from the dangerous, constantly shifting"
"surface of the river. They looked at him with a frank curiosity, as if"
wondering what he meant to do in this emergency. On the faces of a few
"were expressions of grim, anticipatory amusement, but Bainbridge heeded"
these no more than he had the others. Without pausing even glancing to
"right or left, he strode on, and reached the scene of action."
"On the same bank, a little way back from the water, stood a small"
"building, so hastily thrown together that the roof was not yet"
"completed. One or two men were standing near it, staring interestedly at"
the crowd gathered about something at the water’s edge which Bob at once
"saw to be one end of a massive, well-constructed log boom. The other"
"end, out beyond the middle of the river, was supported by some stout"
"spiles, and the whole affair took up so much of the stream’s width that"
Bainbridge’s drive had jammed against it hard and fast.
All this Bob took in without slackening his pace. Reaching the outer
"edge of the circle, he pushed through to where Jack Peters, his jam"
"boss, stood facing a compact group of six or eight strangers, gathered"
"closely about the end of the boom, Jack was florid with rage, and"
choking with impotent fury. The strangers composing the little group
instantly struck Bob as being singularly strong and rugged. They looked
as if they had been picked for their physical efficiency. Each one was
"armed with rifle or pistol, while their leader, a competent-looking"
"person with red hair and whiskers, held in one hand a snub-nosed,"
businesslike automatic.
"“Well, Jack,” Bainbridge said curtly, as he reached the foreman’s side,"
“what’s the trouble?”
"Generally the great park-gates stood hospitably open, and the little"
"town of San Ildefonso, with its lodgings and hostels, was at this season"
crowded with courtiers and hangers-on of the court. Guards circulated
"here and there, or clattered after the Queen-Regent as she drove out on"
the magnificent King's highway which stretched upwards over the
"Guadarrama towards Madrid, or whirled down towards Segovia and the"
plains of Old Castile. Bugles were never long silent in _plaza_ or
"barrack yard. Drums beat, fifes shrilled, and there was a continuous"
trampling of horses as this ambassador or that was escorted to the
"presence of Queen Cristina, widow of Fernando VII., mother of Isabel the"
"Second, and Regent of Spain."
"A word of historical introduction is here necessary, and it shall be but"
"a word. For nearly a quarter of a century Fernando, since he had been"
"restored to a forfeited throne by British bayonets, had acted on the"
ancient Bourbon principle of learning nothing and forgetting nothing.
"His tyrannies became ever more tyrannical, his exactions more shameless,"
his indolent arrogance more oppressive. Twice he had to invoke the aid
"of foreign troops, and once indeed a French army marched from one end of"
Spain to the other.
"But with the coming of his third wife, young Maria Cristina of Naples,"
all this was changed. Under her influence Fernando promptly became meek
and uxorious. Then he revoked the ordinance of a former King which
ordained that no woman should reign in Spain. He recalled his
"revocation, and again promulgated it according as his hope of offspring"
waxed or waned.
"Finally a daughter was born to the ill-mated pair, and Don Carlos, the"
"King's brother and former heir-apparent, left the country. Immediately"
upon the King's death civil war divided the state. The stricter
legitimists who stood for Don Carlos included the church generally and
"not seem to remember, for he looked at them all, was silent and smiled"
... in a guilty way. Those men spoke very little to each other about
"their past, and they recalled it very seldom and then only its general"
"outlines.  When they did mention it, it was in a cynical tone."
"Probably, this was just as well, since, in many people, remembrance of"
the past kills all present energy and deadens all hope for the future.

"On rainy, cold, or dull days in the late autumn, these ""creatures that"
"once were men"" gathered in the eatinghouse of Vaviloff. They were well"
"known there, where some feared them as thieves and rogues, and some"
"looked upon them contemptuously as hard drinkers, although they"
"respected them, thinking that they were clever."
"The eating-house of Vaviloff was the club of the main street, and the"
"""creatures that once were men"" were its most intellectual members.  On"
"Saturday evenings or Sunday mornings, when the eating-house was packed,"
"the ""creatures that once were men"" were only too welcome guests.  They"
"brought with them, besides the forgotten and poverty-stricken"
"inhabitants of the street, their own spirit, in which there was"
something that brightened the lives of men exhausted and worn out in
"the struggle for existence, as great drunkards as the inhabitants of"
"Kuvalda's shelter, and, like them, outcasts from the town.  Their"
"ability to speak on all subjects, their freedom of opinion, skill in"
"repartee, courage in the presence of those of whom the whole street was"
"in terror, together with their daring demeanour, could not but be"
"pleasing to their companions.  Then, too, they were well versed in law,"
"and could advise, write petitions, and help to swindle without"
incurring the risk of punishment.  For all this they were paid with
vodki and flattering admiration of their talents.
That is part of our belief; that is the strongest part of our belief;
"and that is the hope that all fervent Christians have, that those they"
love may be saved even at the end.
I think it may truly be said that our Western creeds are all directed at
"the hour of death, as the great and final test of that creed."
And now think of Buddhism; it is a creed of life. In life you must win
"your way to salvation by urgent effort, by suffering, by endurance. On"
"your death-bed you can do nothing. If you have done well, then it is"
"well; if ill, then you must in future life try again and again till you"
"succeed. A life is not washed, a soul is not made fit for the dwelling"
"of eternity, in a moment."
Repentance to a Buddhist is but the opening of the eyes to see the path
to righteousness; it has no virtue in itself. To have seen that we are
sinners is but the first step to cleansing our sin; in itself it cannot
purify.
"As well ask a robber of the poor to repent, and suppose thereby that"
those who have suffered from his guilt are compensated for the evil done
"to them by his repentance, as to ask a Buddhist to believe that a sinner"
can at the last moment make good to his own soul all the injuries caused
to that soul by the wickedness of his life.
Or suppose a man who has destroyed his constitution by excess to be by
the very fact of acknowledging that excess restored to health.
The Buddhist will not have that at all. A man is what he makes himself;
"and that making is a matter of terrible effort, of unceasing endeavour"
"towards the right, of constant suppression of sin, till sin be at last"
did not deserve to suffer suffered. And that was why the war went on.
Most people were so indifferent that it was impossible to talk to them
without anger. I could think of nothing else but the war. I could not
escape from its invisible presence. The streets and houses seemed the
"immaterial creations of some dream, and somewhere behind them the"
"slaughter was going on, and amid the noise of the traffic the throbbing"
of the bombardment was plainly audible.
Sometimes I felt an impulse to shout from the house-tops like a Hebrew
prophet and denounce this most wicked of generations. But the very
futility of the idea filled me with mortification.
Our enlightened twentieth century has no use for prophets. Christ
Himself would have been arrested as a pacifist or a lunatic if He had
spoken His mind in the streets of London. And the clergy would have
"applauded the imprisonment of a dangerous ""pro-German."" The scribes and"
Pharisees were more numerous and more powerful than ever before.
Particularly the scribes.
There never was in all the world an infamy as great as the infamy of our
war-time Press. A horde of unscrupulous liars and hirelings spat hatred
and malice from safe and comfortable positions. They played the hero
when no danger threatened. They defied an enemy who could not reach
them. They boasted of the deeds they had not done. They gloried in the
victories they did not win. They mouthed frantic protestations of
injured innocence when they should have felt the burden of guilty shame.
They were mawkishly sentimental when they should have felt keen grief
and horror. They denounced murder and they urged others to commit
murder. They spewed their venomous slime into every spring of healing
water. At a time when clear thinking and balanced judgments were needed
"more desperately than ever before, they squirted into the air thick"
"legend in the same style as the one current in novels, which tells"
us that the aristocrats of old families close their doors to rich
"Americans, or like that other story Mrs. Marchmont was talking to us of,"
about the Jewish ladies who were crazy to become Catholics.”
"“I don’t see what you are trying to prove by all this,” said Laura."
“I am trying to prove that all there is underneath distinguished society
"is money, for which reason it doesn’t matter if it is destroyed. The"
"cleverest and finest man, if he has no money, will die of hunger in a"
"corner. Smart society, which thinks itself superior, will never receive"
"him, because being really superior and intelligent is of no value on"
"the market. On the other hand, when it is a question of some very rich"
"brute, he will succeed in being accepted and fêted by the aristocrats,"
"because money has a real value, a quotable value, or I’d better say, it"
is the only thing that has a quotable value.”
“What you are saying isn’t true. A man doesn’t go with the best people
merely because he is rich.”
"“No, certainly; not immediately. There is a preparatory process. He"
"begins by robbing people in some miserable little shop, and feels"
"himself democratic. Then he robs in a bank, and at that period he feels"
that he is a Liberal and begins to experience vaguely aristocratic
"ideas. If business goes splendidly, the aristocratic ideas get"
crystallized. Then he can come to Rome and go into ecstasies over
"all the humbugs of Catholicism; and after that, one is authorized to"
"acknowledge that the religion of our fathers is a beautiful religion,"
"and one finishes by giving a tip to the Pope, and another to Cardinal"
"Verry, so that they will make him Prince of the Ecumenical Council or"
Marquis of the Holy Crusade.”
"""And I,"" retorted Concha, ""am as strictly forbidden to reveal mine to"
"General Cabrera or even to that notable young officer, Colonel Don Rollo"
"of the surname which resembles so much a _borrico's_ serenade!"""
That speech would have been undoubtedly rude save for the glance which
"accompanied it, given softly yet daringly from beneath a jetty fringe of"
eyelash.
Nevertheless all Rollo Blair's pride of ancestry rose insurgent within
him. Who was this Andalucian waiting-maid that she should speak lightly
of the descendant of that Blair of Blair Castle who had stood for Bruce
"and freedom on the field of Bannockburn? It was unbearable--and yet,"
"well, there was something uncommon about this girl. And after all, was"
it not the mark of a gentleman to pay no heed to the babbling of women's
"tongues? If they did not say one thing, they would another. Besides, he"
cared nothing what this girl might say. A parrot prattling in a cage
would affect him as much.
So they rode on together over the great tawny brick-dusty wastes of Old
"Castile, silent mostly, but the silence occasionally broken by speech,"
"friendly enough on either side. Behind them pounded La Giralda, gaunt as"
"the sergeant himself, leather-legginged, booted and spurred, watching"
"them keenly out of her ancient, unfathomable gipsy eyes."
And ever as they rode the Guadarrama mountains rose higher and whiter
"out of the vast and hideous plain, the only interruption to the circling"
horizon of brown and parched corn lands. But at this season scrub-oak
"and juniper were the only shrubs to be seen, and had there been a"
"Cristino outpost anywhere within miles, the party must have been"
discerned riding steadily towards the northern slopes of the mountains.
"But neither man nor beast took notice of them, and a certain large"
uncanny silence brooded over the plain.
The thoughtful traveler will concede to the Republic of Panama great
natural resources and a most happy entrance to the family of nations. It
is the especial protégé of the United States and under the watchful care
"of its patron will be free from the apprehension of misuse, revolution"
or invasion from without which has kept other Central American
governments in a constant state of unrest. About the international
morality of the proceedings which created the relations now existing
between the United States and Panama perhaps the least said the better.
"But even if we reprobate the sale of Joseph by his brethren, in the"
"scripture story, we must at least admit that he did better in Egypt than"
in his father’s house and that the protection and favor of the mighty
"Pharaoh was of the highest advantage to him, and in time to his"
unnatural brethren as well.

"At present the Republic suffers not only from its own checkered past,"
but from the varied failings of its neighbors. Its monetary system
"affords one illustration. The highest coin of the land is the peso, a"
piece the size of our silver dollar but circulating at a value of fifty
cents. If a man should want to pay a debt of $500 he would have to
deliver 1000 pesos unless he was possessed of a bank account and could
settle by check. No paper money is issued. “Who would take paper money
issued by a Central American republic?” ask the knowing ones scornfully
when you inquire about this seeming lack in the monetary system. Yet the
"Republic of Panama is the most solvent of nations, having no national"
debt and with money in bank.

Probably the one obstacle to the progress of the Republic to greatness
“This would be lessening the joy of the world and taking from
"generations yet unborn the capacity for wonder, the power to take a"
"large unselfish interest in the spectacle of things, and putting them"
forever at the mercy of small private cares.
"A Nursery Rhyme is the most sane, the most unselfish thing in the"
"world. It calls up some delightful image,--a little nut-tree with a"
silver walnut and a golden pear; some romantic adventure only for the
child's delight and liberation from the bondage of unseeing dulness: it
brings before the mind the quintessence of some good thing:
'The little dog laughed to see such sport'--there is the soul of
"good humour, of sanity, of health in the laughter of that innocently"
wicked little dog. It is the laughter of pure frolic without
unkindness. To have laughed with the little dog as a child is the best
preservative against mirthless laughter in later years--the horse
"laughter of brutality, the ugly laughter of spite, the acrid laughter"
"of fanaticism. The world of Nursery Rhymes, the old world of Mrs."
"Slipper-Slopper, is the world of natural things, of quick, healthy"
"motion, of the joy of living."
In Nursery Rhymes the child is entertained with all the pageant of
"the world. It walks in Fairy Gardens, and for it the singing birds"
pass. All the King's horses and all the King's men pass before it in
"their glorious array. Craftsmen of all sorts, bakers, confectioners,"
"silversmiths, blacksmiths are busy for it with all their arts and"
"mysteries, as at the court of an Eastern King.”"
"In insisting on the value of this escape from the commonplace, I cannot"
prove the importance of it more clearly than by showing what may happen
to a child who is deprived of his birthright by having none of the
"appeared before us in a vital form, nothing can really destroy it; it"
"is because things are often given in a blurred, faint light that they"
gradually fade out of our memory. A very keen scientist was deploring
"to me, on one occasion, the fact that stories were told so much in the"
"schools, to the detriment of science, for which she claimed the same"
indestructible element that I recognise in the best-told stories.
"Being very much interested in her point of view, I asked her to tell"
"me, looking back on her school days, what she could remember as"
standing out from other less clear information. After thinking some
"little time over the matter, she said with some embarrassment, but with"
a candour that did her much honour:
"“Well, now I come to think of it, it was the story of Cinderella.”"
"Now, I am not holding any brief for this story in particular. I think"
the reason it was remembered was because of the dramatic form in which
"it was presented to her, which fired her imagination and kept the"
memory alight. I quite realise that a scientific fact might also have
been easily remembered if it was presented in the form of a successful
chemical experiment: but this also has something of the dramatic appeal
and will be remembered on that account.
Sully says: “We cannot understand the fascination of a story for
"children save in remembering that for their young minds, quick to"
"imagine, and unversed in abstract reflection, words are not dead things"
"but _winged_, as the old Greeks called them.”[37]"
The Red Queen (in “Through the Looking-Glass”) was more psychological
than she knew when she made the memorable statement: “When once you've
"_said_ a thing that _fixes_ it, and you must take the consequences.”"

in _Shadowings_) also gives a vivid account of his own childish

"[Footnote 89: It has not, I believe, been pointed out that such dreams"
might be invoked in support of the James-Lange or physiological theory of
"emotion, according to which the element of bodily change in emotion is the"
cause and not the result of the emotion.]
[Footnote 90: This physiological symbolism was clearly apprehended long
ago by Hobbes: 'As anger causeth heat in some parts of the body when we
are awake; so when we sleep the overheating of the same parts causeth
"anger, and raiseth up in the brain the imagination of an enemy. In the"
"same manner as natural kindness, when we are awake, causeth desire and"
"desire makes heat in certain other parts of the body; so also, too much"
"heat in those parts, while we sleep, raiseth in the brain an imagination"
"of some kindness shown. In sum, our dreams are the reverse of our waking"
"imaginations; the motion, when we are awake, beginning at one end, and"
"when we dream at another' (_Leviathan_, Part 1. ch. 2).]"
"[Footnote 91: 'The pains of disappointment, of anxiety, of unsuccess, of"
"all displeasing emotions,' remarks Mercier (art. 'Consciousness,' Tuke's"

feeling of misery which is referred in every case to the epigastrium.' He
"adds that the pleasures of success and good repute, aesthetic enjoyment,"
"etc., are also attended by a definite feeling in the same region. This"
fact indicates the extreme vagueness of organic sensation. There is in
"fact much uncertainty and great difference of opinion as to the nature,"
"and even the existence, of organic sensation; see _e.g._ a careful summary"
"of the chief views by Dr. Elsie Murray, 'Organic Sensation,' _American"

in Germany and her daughters from unbearably brutal treatment;

The winter of 1914 had witnessed an appalling degree of
"frightfulness in eastern Belgium, the Wallon or French-speaking part"
of the country more especially. The Germans seemed to bear a special
"grudge against this region, regarding it as doggedly opposed to"
absorption into a Greater Germany; whereas they hoped the Flemish
half of the country would receive them as fellow Teutons and even as
deliverers from their former French oppressors. Thousands of old men
"and youths, of women and children in the provinces south of the"
Meuse had been shot in cold blood; village after village had been
burnt. Scenes of nearly equal horror had taken place between
"Brussels and Antwerp, especially around Malines. Von Bissing's"
arrival as Governor General was soon signalized by those dreaded Red
"Placards on the walls of Brussels, announcing the verdicts of"
"courts-martial, the condemnation to death of men and women who had"
contravened some military regulation.
"Yet in spite of this, life went on in Brussels once more--by von"
Bissing's stern command--as though the country were not under the
heel of the invader. The theatres opened their doors; the cinemas
Luther was a born music lover and a musician of adequate training.
Moreover he possessed a remarkable gift for writing hymns in clear
thought to bring the Word of God home to the hearts of the common
people. He and his followers put songs on the lips of the German people
and they sang themselves into the Reformation. So effective were these
songs that his enemies in the Roman church declared that “Luther’s songs
have damned more souls than all his books and speeches.”
_Chorales._ The word “chorale” (“choral” in German) refers to the hymn
"tunes of Lutheran Protestantism, though in common usage the term"
includes the words associated with the tunes. The melodies had much to
do with the popularity of the songs. They came from various sources.
Many of them were original compositions by Luther and others; some were
borrowed from the hymn books of the Bohemian Brethren; a considerable
number were adaptations of plainsongs used in the Catholic Church; still
others were adopted from beloved folksongs. Luther was an eclectic in
his choice of music. He used any tune from any source that suited his
purpose. Many thousands of chorales came into existence in Germany
during his time and the two centuries that followed. The hundreds still
in use represent the best in church music today. They are characterized
"by a plain melody, a strong harmony, and a stately rhythm; all of which"
adapts them well for effective congregational singing.
The chorales at first did not have the regular rhythms that they later
"took on. The steady progression of even notes, invariable in Bach’s day,"
"had come only gradually into use. Some of the recent hymnbooks, in the"
"interest of greater variety of rhythm, are returning to the original"
“rhythmic chorales.”
Though _unison_ singing has been widely practiced and is advocated today
"by some good authorities in church music, Luther encouraged part"
"Petrol was, at the moment, the most important of our needs; we had,"
"therefore, to carry with us all we should require, making allowance"
"at the same time for mishaps. Moreover, we had to take enough food"
"and water to last Allan, Allah-dad and myself for five or six days."
"As regards personal luggage we travelled absolutely light, leaving"
"all kit to follow at a slower pace on camels, together with my horse,"
"Galahad. I had some compunction in leaving the latter behind, but my"
"orders were concise and urgent--to reach Robat, endeavour to get into"

the Raiders at the earliest possible moment.
"A start was made very early in the morning, but the first day's"
journey proved disappointing. Instead of doing the ninety miles
"planned, we only accomplished thirty. The track was even worse than I"
"had expected, for we constantly ran into sand-hills, and had to dig"
the car out. I have never done so much digging in my life as I did on
"that journey to Robat. Sand-hills were, however, only a portion of"
"our afflictions, for, in addition, there were many water pools and"
small shallow lakes--due to recent rain--which had to be taken at a
"rush, or somehow circumvented."
"So serious, at last, did our rate of progress become that, as we"
"approached what seemed to be the hundredth of these wide, shallow"
"pools, I lost patience and ordered Allan to drive straight through."
"He attempted to carry out the order, but about half-way we sank up"
to the axle and stuck. No power on earth would induce the car to

"""And here, also, they used to have a grand procession"

hair miraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months. They
still kept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years
ago. It was a source of great profit to the church that possessed the
"remarkable effigy, and the public barbering of her was always carried"
"out with the greatest _éclat_ and display--the more the better, because"
the more excitement there was about it the larger the crowds it drew
and the heavier the revenues it produced--but at last the day came

[Sidenote: The House of the Virgin at Loretto.]
"I had read the story of the _Casa Santa_, or Holy House, the little"
"stone building, thirteen and one-half feet high and twenty-eight feet"
"long, in which the Virgin Mary had lived at Nazareth. In 336 the"
"Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage"
to Nazareth and built a church over the Holy House. This church fell
"into decay when the Saracens again got the upper hand in Palestine,"
and when the Christians lost Ptolemais the Holy House was carried by
angels through the air from Nazareth to the coast of Dalmatia. This
miraculous transportation took place in 1291. A few years later it

The considerations which seemed to compel the clearheaded author of
this extract to his own well-known intellectual position no longer
"apply. In England, at any rate, the Church is not bound down to any"
"mechanical theory of the inspiration of the Bible, and accepts all the"
discoveries of Modern Physical Science without misgiving. Such books
as the late Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Temple) gave us in his
Bampton Lectures have long ago shown the futility of attempting to map
out the exact terms of a reconciliation between the claims of science
"and religion, but they have shown that religion and science are _not_"
destructive and contradictory of each other.
"“The same principles are found in each. The principle of evolution,"
"for instance, is as evident in the gradual development of religion as"
in the age-long process by which the natural world was created; the
order and beauty and regular succession manifest in Nature can be
traced also in the spiritual universe. The revelation which was
formerly held to be violation of law is seen to be a revelation of
"higher law. The great postulate of science, the uniformity of Nature,"
is not infringed.”
"We know now that there are laws of the Universe which, if we knew more"
"about them, would tell us how it was that a Virgin could conceive and"
bear a Son. It is not to us an inconceivable superstition that “The
Son of Man” should have in His own person powers of which the
"rudimentary signs can be traced in all humanity, manifesting"
themselves from time to time. The day is long past when the
"no peace. Nevertheless, when he is seriously ill he does not fear death."
"His hygienics amount to temperance, cleanliness and fresh air, this last"
item in moderation: he takes the vicinity of the sea to be unwholesome
"and is afraid of draughts. His friend Gilles, who is ill, he advises:"
"'Do not take too much medicine, keep quiet and do not get angry'. Though"
"there is a 'Praise of Medicine' among his works, he does not think"
highly of physicians and satirizes them more than once in the
_Colloquies_.
Also in his outward appearance there were certain features betraying his
"delicacy. He was of medium height, well-made, of a fair complexion with"
"blond hair and blue eyes, a cheerful face, a very articulate mode of"
"speech, but a thin voice."
In the moral sphere Erasmus's delicacy is represented by his great need
"of friendship and concord, his dislike of contention. With him peace and"
"harmony rank above all other considerations, and he confesses them to be"
"the guiding principles of his actions. He would, if it might be, have"
all the world as a friend. 'Wittingly I discharge no one from my
"friendship,' he says. And though he was sometimes capricious and"
"exacting towards his friends, yet a truly great friend he was: witness"
"the many who never forsook him, or whom he, after a temporary"
"estrangement, always won back--More, Peter Gilles, Fisher, Ammonius,"
"Budaeus, and others too numerous to mention. 'He was most constant in"
"keeping up friendships,' says Beatus Rhenanus, whose own attachment to"
Erasmus is a proof of the strong affection he could inspire.
At the root of this desire of friendship lies a great and sincere need
of affection. Remember the effusions of almost feminine affection
towards Servatius during his monastic period. But at the same time it is
"a sort of moral serenity that makes him so: an aversion to disturbance,"
"gradually, very gradually he become conscious that HE WAS NOT"
"ALONE,--another besides himself was in the church,--another, whom it"
was necessary for him to see!
"He could not tell how he first grew to be certain of this,--but he was"
"soon so completely possessed by the idea, that for a moment he dared"
"not raise his eyes, or move! Some invincible force held him there"
"spell-bound, yet trembling in every limb,--and while he thus waited"
"hesitatingly, the great organ woke up in a glory of tuneful"
"utterance,--wave after wave of richest harmony rolled through the"
"stately aisles and ... ""Kyrie eleison! Kyrie eleison!"" rang forth in"
"loud, full, and golden-toned chorus!"
"Lifting his head, he stared wonderingly around him; not a living"
creature was visible in all the spacious width and length of the
"cathedral! His lips parted,--he felt as though he could scarcely"
"breathe,--strong shudders ran through him, and he was penetrated by a"
"pleasing terror that was almost a physical pang,--an agonized"
"entrancement, like death or the desire of love! Presently, mastering"
"himself by a determined effort, he advanced steadily with the absorbed"
air of one who is drawn along by magnetic power ... steadily and slowly
"up the nave, ... and as he went, the music surged more tumultuously"
"among the vaulted arches,--there was a faint echo afar off, as of"
tinkling crystal bells; and at each onward step he gained a new access
"of courage, strength, firmness, and untrammelled ease, till every"
"timorous doubt and fear had fled away, and he stood directly in front"
"of the altar railing, gazing at the enshrined Cross, and seeing for the"
moment nothing save that Divine Symbol alone. And still the organ
"played, and still the voices sang,--he knew these sounds were not of"
"earth, and he also knew that they were intended to convey a meaning to"
"him,--but WHAT meaning?"
"from Genoa, in 1846, Dickens says, ""If I were a Swiss, with a hundred"
"thousand pounds, I would be as steady against the Catholic canons and"
the propagation of Jesuitism as any Radical among them; believing the
dissemination of Catholicity to be the most horrible means of political
"and social degradation left in the world."""
"In connection with Dickens' remark about Ireland, we may quote the"
"remarkable statement of Mr. Michael McCarthy, himself a Roman Catholic,"
"in his book, _Five Years in Ireland_, pp. 65 and 66, where, after"
describing the welcome of the Belfast Corporation to Lord Cadogan on
"his first visit, in 1895, to the Protestant North of Ireland, and"
their glowing statements about the peaceful and prosperous condition
"of their city and district, he contrasts this happy condition with"
"the unhappy state of the ""rest of Ireland,"" meaning by that the"
"Roman Catholic parts. ""In the rest of Ireland there is no social or"
industrial progress to record. The man who would say of it that it
"was 'progressing and prospering,' or that 'its work people were fully"
"employed,' or that there existed 'a continued development of its"
"industries,' or that its towns 'had increased in value and population,'"
would be set down as a madman. It is in this seven-eighths of Ireland
that the growing and great organization of the Catholic Church has
"taken root."""
"Mr. Gladstone, in an article on ""Italy and her Church,"" in the _Church"
"Quarterly Review_ for October, 1875, says: ""Profligacy, corruption and"
"ambition, continued for ages, unitedly and severally, their destructive"
"work upon the country, through the Curia and the papal chair; and in"
doing it they of course have heavily tainted the faith of which that
"chair was the guardian."" Elsewhere he says, ""There has never been any"
"more cunning blade devised against the freedom, the virtue and the"
"happiness of a people than Romanism."""
"Carlist partisanship and military rank. Moreover, he had acquired, in"
"some unexplained way, a leathern Montera cap, a short many-buttoned"
"jacket, a flapped waistcoat of red plush, and leathern small-clothes of"
the same sort as those worn by La Giralda. Yet withal there remained
"something very remarkable about him. His great height, his angular"
"build, the grim humour of his mouth, the beady blackness of eyes which"
"twinkled with a fleck of fire in each, as a star might be reflected in a"
deep well on a moonless night--these all gave him a certain distinction
in a country of brick-dusty men of solemn exterior and rare speech.
"Also there was something indescribably daring about the man, his air and"
carriage. There was the swagger as of a famous _matador_ about the way
he carried himself. He gave a cock to his plain countryman's cap which
betokened one of a race at once quicker and more gay--more passionate
and more dangerous than the grave and dignified inhabitants of Old
Castile through whose country they were presently journeying.
"As Cardono and La Giralda departed out of the camp, the Sergeant driving"
before him a donkey which he had picked up the night before wandering by
"the wayside, El Sarria looked after them with a sardonic smile which"
"slowly melted from his face, leaving only the giant's usual placid good"
nature apparent on the surface. The mere knowledge that Dolóres was
alive and true to him seemed to have changed the hunted and desperate
outlaw almost beyond recognition.
"""Why do you smile, El Sarria?"" said Concha, who stood near by, as the"
"outlaw slowly rolled and lighted a _cigarrillo_. ""You do not love this"
"Sergeant. You do not think he is a man to be trusted?"""
"El Sarria shrugged his shoulders, and slowly exhaled the first long"
breathing of smoke through his nostrils.
"""Come with us,"" they cried; ""we are here for the greatest plunder ever"
"taken or dreamed of among the Romany----"""
"""Hush, I command you,"" cried the elder man. ""José Maria of Ronda this"
"man may be, but we are _Gitanos_ of the North, and need not a man from"
"Andalucia to lead us, even if he carry a scarlet cravat about his neck"
"for a credential!"""
The Sergeant nodded approval of this sentiment and addressed the old
"gipsy in deep Romany, to which he listened with respect, and answered in"
"a milder tone, shaking his head meanwhile."
"""I have indeed heard such sayings from my mother,"" he said, ""and I"
gather your meaning; but we _Gitanos_ of the North have mingled too much
with the outlander and the foreigner to have preserved the ancient
purity of speech. But in craft and deed I wot well we are to the full as
"good Roms as ever."""
By this time it was clear to the Sergeant that the old man was jealous
of his leadership; and as he himself was by no means desirous of taking
"part in a midnight raid against a plague-stricken town, he proceeded to"
"make it clear that, being on his way to his own country of Andalucia and"
had been led aside by the gipsy cryptograms he had observed by the
wayside and the casual greeting of the crook-backed imp of the village.
"Upon this the old man sat down beside Sergeant Cardono, or, as his new"
"friends knew him to be, José Maria the brigand. He did not talk about"
the intended attack as the Sergeant hoped he would. Being impressed by
"the greatness of his guest, he entered into a minute catalogue of the"
"captures he had made, the men he had slain as recorded on the butt of"
"his gun or the haft of his knife, and the cargoes he had successfully"
"severe. Master Bailey's assistance is next requisitioned, and him friend"
"Diccon cannot overreach. The whole truth coming out, Diccon is required"
to kneel and apologize. In doing so he gives Hodge a slap which elicits
"from that worthy a yell of pain. But it is a wholesome pang, for it"
finds the needle no further away than in the seat of Hodge's breeches.
If we compare this play with _Ralph Roister Doister_ three ideas will
"occur: first, that we have made no advance; second, that, in giving the"
"preference to rough country folk, the author has deliberately abandoned"
the higher standard of refinement in language and action set in Udall's
"major scenes; third, that whereas the earlier work bases its comedy on"
"character, educing the amusing scenes from the clash of vanity,"
"constancy and mischief, the later play relies for its comic effects on"
situations brought about by mischief alone. These are three rather heavy
counts against the younger rival. But in the other scale may be placed a
very fair claim to greater naturalness. Taking the scenes and characters
"in turn, mischief-maker, churchman and all, there is none so open to the"
"charge of being impossible, and therefore farcical, as the battle"
"between the forces of Ralph and Dame Custance, or the incredibly"
self-deceived Ralph himself. In accompanying Ralph through his
adventures we seem to be moving through a fantastic world in which Sir
"Andrew Aguecheek and Malvolio might feel at home; but with Dame Chat,"
Gammer Gurton and Hodge we feel the solid earth beneath our feet and
around us the strong air which nourished the peasantry and yeomen of
Tudor England.

"routes, but without much success, owing to the inhospitable nature of"
the country through which they had to pass and also to the opposition
"they met with from the Hazara tribes round Herat, who, belonging"
"as they do to the Shiah section of the Mahommedan religion, are at"
"daggers drawn with the Afghans, who belong to the Sunni section."
"Therefore the Germans had to try yet another road, and succeeded"
farther South where they had failed in the North. By taking the
longer route through Kerman and Narmashir in the South and South-East
"of Persia, they found easy ingress into Afghanistan."
"To effect this, however, they had to make friends with the nomad"
and war-like tribes of the Sarhad. These tribes were traditionally
"friendly to the British, but the Germans had bribed them heavily"
and had moreover assured them that Germany had turned Islam and
that the Kaiser William himself was a convert to their religion. As
"the Sarhad tribes were always out for a good thing for themselves,"
"and as they believed the lie about the German conversion, they had"
allowed themselves to be tricked into helping the Germans. This
they were doing not only by permitting them to pass through their
"territory, but also by harassing the lines of communication between"
the inadequately small British frontier posts.
"The story of Germany having turned Mahommedan, farcical as it was,"
was nevertheless a potential source of grave danger for us in India.
"It must be remembered that Germany's ally, Turkey, was Mahommedan,"
"and that in helping us against Germany, the Mahommedans of India were"
"already being called upon, indirectly, to fight against their own"
"co-religionists. When, in addition, India was assured that powerful"
"Germany was winning, so her agents avowed, in every theatre of war,"
it was inevitable that in time her loyalty to us must suffer.
primitive symbolic tendency to objectify the subjective. Men have taken
"out of their own hearts their best feelings and their worst feelings,"
"and have personalised and dramatised them, bowed down to them or stamped"
"on them, unable to hear the voice with which each of their images spoke:"
"'I am thyself.' Our conceptions of religion, of morals, of many of the"
"mightiest phenomena of life, especially the more exceptional phenomena,"
"have grown up under this influence, which still serves to support many"
movements of to-day by some people imagined to be modern.
"Dreaming, as we have seen, is not the sole source of such conceptions."
"But they could scarcely have been found convincing, and possibly could"
"not even have arisen, among races which were wholly devoid of dream"
"experiences. A large part of all progress in psychological knowledge,"
"and, indeed, a large part of civilisation itself, lies in realising that"
"the apparently objective is really subjective, that the angels and demons"
and geniuses of all sorts that once seemed to be external forces taking
possession of feeble and vacant individualities are themselves but modes
of action of marvellously rich and varied personalities. In our dreams we
"are brought back into the magic circle of early culture, and we shrink and"
shudder in the presence of imaginative phantoms that are built up of our
"own thoughts and emotions, and are really our own flesh."

"Kant, as we have said, made an important development upon the position"
of Hume. Hume had arrived at the point of declaring the particular mind
and matter equally incompetent to afford an ultimate explanation of
"things, and he suggested experience in their place. This is the first"
"note of the new philosophy: experience, not a process of the"
"interaction of two separate things, mind on the one hand, matter on the"
"other, but something comprehending both. This, however, was scarcely"
"realised either by Hume or Kant, though the latter came very near the"
"formulation of it. Kant saw, at least, that things could not produce"
"knowledge, and he therefore changed his front and suggested starting"
with the knowledge that was before regarded as result--a change in
point of view that caused a revolution in thought similar to that
caused in our ideas of the natural world by the introduction of the
"system of Copernicus. Still, while following out his Copernican theory,"
Kant did not go far enough. His methods were still somewhat
psychological in nature. He still regarded thought as something which
can be separated from the thinker; he still maintained the existence of
things in themselves independent and outside of thought. He gives us a
"'theory' of knowledge, when what we want to reach is knowledge itself,"
and not a subjective conception of it.

THE VOICE OF LIFE
"The following is the Inaugural Address delivered by Sir J. C. Bose, on"
"the 30th November 1917, in dedicating the Bose Institute to the Nation."
I dedicate to-day this Institute--not merely a Laboratory but a Temple.
The power of physical methods applies for the establishment of that
"truth which can be realised directly through our senses, or through the"
vast expansion of the perceptive range by means of artificially created
organs. We still gather the tremulous message when the note of the
"audible reaches the unheard. When human sight fails, we continue to"
explore the region of the invisible. The little that we can see is as
nothing compared to the vastness of that which we cannot. Out of the
very imperfection of his senses man has built himself a raft of thought
by which he makes daring adventures on the great seas of the Unknown.
But there are other truths which will remain beyond even the
"supersensitive methods known to science. For these we require faith,"
tested not in a few years but by an entire life. And a temple is erected
as a fit memorial for the establishment of that truth for which faith
"was needed. The personal, yet general, truth and faith whose"
establishment this Institute commemorates is this: that when one
"dedicates himself wholly for a great object, the closed doors shall"
"open, and the seemingly impossible will become possible for him."
Thirty-two years ago I chose teaching of science as my vocation. It was
"held that by its very peculiar constitution, the Indian mind would"
always turn away from the study of Nature to metaphysical speculations.
Even had the capacity for inquiry and accurate observation been assumed
"present, there were no opportunities for their employment; there were no"
well-equipped laboratories nor skilled mechanicians. This was all too
"of the laxity of morals in the time of Julius II. (1503-'13), that her"
friends did not hesitate to bury the famous Aspasia of that age in
"this church (St. Gregorio), and to inscribe upon her tomb: 'Imperia,"
"cortisana Romana, quæ digna tanto nomine, raræ inter homines formæ"
"specimen dedit.'... But this monument has now been removed.""[18]"
"Most of the facts above cited, especially those concerning the legends"
"and the Popes, except where specific acknowledgment is made to other"
"writers, have been drawn from Hare's invaluable _Walks in Rome_. Let us"
conclude the list with the testimonies of a few eminent men of
unimpeachable competence and veracity as to the character and influence
of the Roman Catholic Church as a system.
"[Sidenote: Macaulay, Dickens and Gladstone on the Influence of"
Romanism.]
"In the first chapter of his _History of England_, Lord Macaulay says:"
"""From the time when the barbarians overran the Western Empire to the"
"time of the revival of letters, the influence of the Church of Rome"
"had been generally favorable to science, to civilization, to good"
"government. But during the last three centuries, to stunt the growth"
"of the human mind has been her chief object. Throughout Christendom,"
"whatever advance has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth,"
"and in the arts of life, has been made in spite of her, and has"
everywhere been in inverse proportion to her power. The loveliest and
"most fertile provinces of Europe have, under her rule, been sunk in"
"poverty, in political servitude, and in intellectual torpor, while"
"Protestant countries, once proverbial for sterility and barbarism,"
"have been turned by skill and industry into gardens, and can boast of"
"a long list of heroes and statesmen, philosophers and poets. Whoever,"
"knowing what Italy and Scotland naturally are, and what, four hundred"
"years ago, they actually were, shall now compare the country round Rome"
"we are accustomed to say that they are very backward, and that they"
have remained children for a long time. People are in the habit of
saying strange things.”
Felix Adler says: “Perhaps the chief attraction of Fairy Tales is due
to their representing the child as living in brotherly friendship with
"nature and all creatures. Trees, flowers, animals, wild and tame, even"
the stars are represented as comrades of children. That animals are
only human beings in disguise is an axiom in the Fairy Tales. Animals
"are humanised, that is, the kinship between animal and human life"
is still keenly felt; and this reminds us of those early animistic
interpretations of nature which subsequently led to doctrines of
metempsychosis.”[33]
I think that beyond question the finest animal stories are to be found
"in the Indian Collections, of which I furnish a list in the Appendix."
With regard to the development of the love of nature through the
"telling of the stories, we are confronted with a great difficult in the"
"elementary schools, because so many of the children have never been out"
"of the towns, have never seen a daisy, a blade of grass and scarcely a"
"tree, so that in giving, in form of a story, a beautiful description"
"of scenery, you can make no appeal to the retrospective imagination,"
and only the rarely gifted child will be able to make pictures whilst
"listening to a style which is beyond his everyday use. Nevertheless,"
"once in a way, when the children are in a quiet mood, not eager for"
"action but able to give themselves up to the pure joy of sound, then"
it is possible to give them a beautiful piece of writing in praise of
"Nature, such as the following, taken from _The Divine Adventure_, by"
Fiona Macleod:
“Then he remembered the ancient wisdom of the Gael and came out of the
says:
“I remember well the feeling roused in my mind at the mention or sight
of the name _Lucifer_ during the early years of my life. It stood for
"me as the name of a being stupendous, dreadful in moral deformity,"
"lurid, hideous and mighty. I remember the surprise which, when I had"
"grown somewhat older and began to study Latin, I came upon the name in"
Virgil where it means _light-bringer_--the herald of the Sun.”
Plato has said: “That the End of Education should be the training by
suitable habits of the Instincts of Virtue in the Child.”
"About two thousand years later, Sir Philip Sidney, in his “Defence of"
"Poesy,” says: “The final end of learning is to draw and lead us to so"
"high a perfection as our degenerate souls, made worse by their clay"
"lodgings, can be capable of.”"
And yet it is neither the Greek philosopher nor the Elizabethan poet
that makes the every-day application of these principles; but we have
"a hint of this application from the Pueblo tribe of Indians, of whom"
Lummis tells us the following:
“There is no duty to which a Pueblo child is trained in which he has
to be content with a bare command: Do this. For each he learns a
fairy-tale designed to explain how children first came to know that
"it was right to ‘do this,’ and detailing the sad results that befell"
"those who did otherwise. Some tribes have regular story-tellers, men"
who have devoted a great deal of time to learning the myths and stories
"of their people and who possess, in addition to a good memory, a vivid"
"imagination. The mother sends for one of these, and having prepared a"
"feast for him, she and her little brood, who are curled up near her,"
"await the Fairy Stories of the dreamer, who after his feast and smoke"
knowledge. They will announce to an audience of some fifteen hundred
"people, the new discoveries made here, which will be demonstrated for"
the first time before the public. We shall thus maintain continuously
the highest aim of a great Seat of Learning by taking active part in the
_advancement_ and diffusion of knowledge. Through the regular
"publication of the Transactions of the Institute, these Indian"
contributions will reach the whole world. The discoveries made will thus
become public property. No patents will ever be taken. The spirit of our
national culture demands that we should for ever be free from the
desecration of utilising knowledge for personal gain. Besides the
"regular staff there will be a selected number of scholars, who by their"
"work have shown special aptitude, and who would devote their whole life"
to the pursuit of research. They will require personal training and
their number must necessarily be limited. But it is not the quantity
but quality that is of essential importance.
"It is my further wish, that as far as the limited accommodation would"
"permit, the facilities of this Institute should be available to workers"
from all countries. In this I am attempting to carry out the traditions
"of my country, which so far back as twenty-five centuries ago, welcomed"
"all scholars from different parts of the world, within the precincts of"
"its ancient seats of learning, at Nalanda and at Taxilla."
THE SURGE OF LIFE
"With this widened outlook, we shall not only maintain the highest"
traditions of the past but also serve the world in nobler ways. We shall
"be at one with it in feeling the common surgings of life, the common"
"love for the good, the true and the beautiful. In this Institute, this"
"Study and Garden of Life, the claim of art has not been forgotten, for"
"the artist has been working with us, from foundation to pinnacle, and"
"disturbed or destroyed, with the same result.]"
[Footnote 148: The magnification we experience in dreams is manifested
in their emotional aspects and in the emotional transformation of
"actual sensory stimuli, from without or from within the organism. The"
"size of objects recalled by dreaming memory usually remains unchanged,"
and if changed it seems to be more usually diminished. 'Lilliputian
"hallucinations,' as they are termed by Leroy, who has studied them (_Revue"
"de Psychiatrie_, 1909, No. 8), in which diminutive, and frequently"
"coloured, people are observed, may also occasionally occur in alcoholic"
"and chloral intoxication, in circular insanity, and in various other"
morbid mental conditions. They are usually agreeable in character.]

"[Footnote 150: 'Many people,' writes Dr. Marie de Manacéïne (_Sleep_,"
"1897, p. 294), 'when threatened by a gastric or intestinal attack dream"
of seeing fish. The late Professor Sergius Botkine told me that he had
"found this coincidence in his own case, and I have myself several times"
found it in the case of a young girl who is well known to me. Some have
supposed that the sleeping consciousness receives an impression of the
elongated shape of the stomach or intestine; but such a supposition is
easier to make than to prove.' Scherner associated dreams of fish with
"sensations arising from the bladder, and here also it may be said that we"
"are concerned with a fish-like viscus. Greenwood (_Imagination in Dreams_,"
"p. 195) stated that he had always been subject, at intervals of months"
"or years, to a recurrent dream in which he would see a river swarming"
with fish that were finally piled in a horrible sweltering mass; this
"dream always left a feeling of 'squalid horror,' but he was never able to"
ascertain its cause and significance.]

"shipwrecked crew, the old men waiting for the travelling cart while the"

We like to speak of the realism of the Renaissance. Erasmus is certainly
a realist in the sense of having an insatiable hunger for knowledge of
the tangible world. He wants to know things and their names: the
"particulars of each thing, be it never so remote, such as those terms of"
games and rules of games of the Romans. Read carefully the description
of the decorative painting on the garden-house of the _Convivium
"religiosum_: it is nothing but an object lesson, a graphic"
representation of the forms of reality.
"In its joy over the material universe and the supple, pliant word, the"
Renaissance revels in a profusion of imagery and expressions. The
"resounding enumerations of names and things, which Rabelais always"
"gives, are not unknown to Erasmus, but he uses them for intellectual and"
useful purposes. In _De copia verborum ac rerum_ one feat of varied
power of expression succeeds another--he gives fifty ways of saying:
"'Your letter has given me much pleasure,' or, 'I think that it is going"
to rain'. The aesthetic impulse is here that of a theme and variations:
to display all the wealth and mutations of the logic of language.
"Elsewhere, too, Erasmus indulges this proclivity for accumulating the"
treasures of his genius; he and his contemporaries can never restrain
themselves from giving all the instances instead of one: in _Ratio verae
"theologiae_, in _De pronuntiatione_, in _Lingua_, in _Ecclesiastes_. The"
"collections of _Adagia_, _Parabolae_, and _Apophthegmata_ are altogether"
"based on this eagerness of the Renaissance (which, by the way, was an"
inheritance of the Middle Ages themselves) to luxuriate in the wealth of
"the tangible world, to revel in words and things."
"fashionable world was well aware, because the young duchess is a great"
"lady in London as well as elsewhere, and all her doings are chronicled"
in advance. The fashionable world had promptly decided to dine there
"too, and telephoned in breathless haste for tables. It filled the"
"restaurant at an unusually early hour, and a disappointed overflow"
displayed itself in the _foyer_.
The Duchess of Dawn is one of the most beautiful women in England. The
"eyes of the fashionable world were focussed on her and her guests, among"
whom were a minor European prince and a famous field-marshal who had not
"been on show in London for long, until there appeared from the crowded"
"_foyer_, upon the arm of an old-young man of distinguished appearance"
"and faultless _tenue_, a tall, slender girl, at whom, as she passed,"
"every one turned to gaze, with undisguised admiration or envy, according"
to sex and temperament.
"She was gowned to distraction, and by an artist in women's wear. Her"
beautiful bare arms and shoulders and bosom were free of superfluous
"ornament. Her pure, proud, sensitive features were faintly flushed,--as"
"though, if that were conceivable, she was wearing evening dress for the"
"first time, and found it trying,--but her curved crimson lips were"
"slightly parted in a most bewitching smile, and, from under their"
"drooping lashes, her radiant eyes looked a demure, amused, impersonal"
defiance at the frankly curious faces upturned toward her. The shaded
"lights made most enchanting lights and shadows among her hair, red-gold"
"and heaped about her head in heavy coils, as she moved modestly through"
"the thronged room toward a corner where, about a beautifully decorated"
"table, four motionless waiters were standing guard over four empty"
chairs.
"She sat down there, her back to the bulk of the company, and her escort"
"took the seat opposite. A portly, prosperous-looking, elderly man, with"
policy which opposed the rival house of Saxony. The Pope granted the
"dispensation in return for a great sum of money, but to facilitate its"
payment he accorded to the archbishop a liberal indulgence for the whole
"archbishopric of Mayence, Magdeburg and the Brandenburg territories."
"Albert, to whom half the proceeds were tacitly left, raised a loan with"
"the house of Fugger, and this charged itself with the indulgence"
traffic.
"When in December 1517, Erasmus answered the archbishop, Luther's"
"propositions against indulgences, provoked by the Archbishop of"
"Mayence's instructions regarding their colportage, had already been"
"posted up (31 October 1517), and were circulated throughout Germany,"
rousing the whole Church. They were levelled at the same abuses which
"Erasmus combated, the mechanical, atomistical, and juridical conception"
"of religion. But how different was their practical effect, as compared"
with Erasmus's pacific endeavour to purify the Church by lenient means!
'Lives of saints?' Erasmus asked replying to the archbishop. 'I have
tried in my poor way to add a little light to the prince of saints
"himself. For the rest, your endeavour, in addition to so many difficult"
"matters of government, and at such an early age, to get the lives of the"
"saints purged of old women's tales and disgusting style, is extremely"
laudable. For nothing should be suffered in the Church that is not
"perfectly pure or refined,' And he concludes with a magnificent eulogy"
of the excellent prelate.
"During the greater part of 1518, Erasmus was too much occupied by his"
"own affairs--the journey to Basle and his red-hot labours there, and"
afterwards his serious illness--to concern himself much with Luther's
"business. In March he sends Luther's theses to More, without comment,"
"and, in passing, complains to Colet about the impudence with which Rome"
"disseminates indulgences. Luther, now declared a heretic and summoned to"
"people of pernicious vows, if only they repent of them,' says the man"
who himself had broken a vow.
There is in Erasmus a dangerous fusion between inclination and
conviction. The correlations between his idiosyncrasies and his precepts
are undeniable. This has special reference to his point of view in the
matter of fasting and abstinence from meat. He too frequently vents his
"own aversion to fish, or talks of his inability to postpone meals, not"
to make this connection clear to everybody. In the same way his personal
"experience in the monastery passes into his disapproval, on principle,"
of monastic life.
"The distortion of the image of his youth in his memory, to which we have"
"referred, is based on that need of self-justification. It is all"
unconscious interpretation of the undeniable facts to suit the ideal
which Erasmus had made of himself and to which he honestly thinks he
answers. The chief features of that self-conceived picture are a
"remarkable, simple sincerity and frankness, which make it impossible to"
him to dissemble; inexperience and carelessness in the ordinary concerns
of life and a total lack of ambition. All this is true in the first
"instance: there is a superficial Erasmus who answers to that image, but"
it is not the whole Erasmus; there is a deeper one who is almost the
opposite and whom he himself does not know because he will not know him.
"Possibly because behind this there is a still deeper being, which is"
truly good.
"Does he not ascribe weaknesses to himself? Certainly. He is, in spite of"
"his self-coddling, ever dissatisfied with himself and his work."
"_Putidulus_, he calls himself, meaning the quality of never being"
content with himself. It is that peculiarity which makes him
"dissatisfied with any work of his directly after it has appeared, so"
that he always keeps revising and supplementing. 'Pusillanimous' he
Flag Days and to Our Own Day; besides enriching a number of
semi-fraudulent war charities which had alluring titles.
"But if, from paying handsomely to all these praise-worthy endeavours"
"to mitigate the horrors of war, she proceeded to render personal"
"service, she became the despair of the paid organizers and"
business-like workers. She couldn't add and she couldn't subtract or
divide with any certainty of a correct result; she couldn't spell
the more difficult words or remember the right letters to put after
distinguished persons' names when she addressed envelopes in her
"large, childish handwriting; she couldn't be trusted to make"
enquiries or to detect fraudulent appeals. She lost receipts and
never grasped the importance of vouchers; she forgot to fill up
"counterfoils, or if reminded filled them up ""from memory"" so that"
"they didn't tally; she signed her name, if there was any choice of"
"blank spaces, in quite the wrong place."
"So, invariably, tactful secretaries or assistant secretaries were"
"told off to explain to her--ever so nicely--that ""she was no"
"business woman"" (this, to the daughter of wholesale manufacturers,"
"sounded rather flattering), and that though she was invaluable as a"
"""name,"" as a patroness, or one of eighteen Vice Presidents, she was"
of no use whatever as a worker.
She had no country house to place at the disposal of the Government
as a convalescent home. Michael after a few experiments forbade her
offering any hospitality at No. 1 Park Crescent to invalid officers.
Such as were entrusted to her in the spring of 1915 soon found that
"she was--as they phrased it--""a pompous little, middle-class fool,"""
wielding no authority. They larked in the laboratory with Red Cross
"nurses, broke specimens, and did very unkind and noisy things ..."
"besides smoking in both the large _and_ the small dining-rooms. So,"
"the very primitive age of the individual, just as they belong to the"
"primitive age of the race, but experience in telling stories has taught"
me to compromise.
"Some people maintain that little children, who take things with brutal"
"logic, ought not to be allowed the Fairy Tale in its more limited"
"form of the Supernatural; whereas, if presented to older children,"
"this material can be criticised, catalogued and (alas!) rejected as"
"worthless, or retained with flippant toleration."
"Now, whilst recognising a certain value in this point of view, I am"
"bound to admit that if we regulate our stories entirely on this basis,"
we lose the real value of the Fairy Tale element--it is the one element
"which causes little children to _wonder_, simply because no scientific"
analysis of the story can be presented to them. It is somewhat
heartrending to feel that Jack and the Bean-Stalk and stories of that
ilk are to be handed over to the critical youth who will condemn the
"quick growth of the tree as being contrary to the order of nature, and"
wonder why Jack was not playing football in the school team instead of
climbing trees in search of imaginary adventures.
A wonderful plea for the telling of early superstitions to children is
to be found in an old Indian Allegory called “The Blazing Mansion.”
"“An old man owned a large, rambling mansion--the pillars"
"were rotten, the galleries tumbling down, the thatch dry and"
"combustible, and there was only one door. Suddenly, one day, there"
was a smell of fire: the old man rushed out. To his horror he
"saw that the thatch was aflame, the rotten pillars were catching"
"fire one by one, and the rafters were burning like tinder. But"
"inside, the children went on amusing themselves quite happily. The"
distracted father said: ‘I will run in and save my children. I will
"went on to explain that Mr. Justice Gaunt, by nature a somewhat"
"cross-grained old limb of the law, had been very ill-pleased over being"
"bothered again, and at a moment when most of his colleagues were"
"enjoying a holiday, about any such apparently endless case as that of"
"the Jura succession, which had been cropping up before him, at more or"
"less lengthy intervals, for quite a number of years, and concerning"
"which he had, only a few days before, made an order of court in favour"
of Justin Carthew.
Captain Dove clapped his soft felt hat on his head with a very
devil-may-care expression.
"""Come on, then,"" said he grimly, and Mr. Jobling was not slow to lead"
the way. So that they reached Mr. Justice Gaunt's chambers punctually at
"the hour appointed, and were ushered into his lordship's presence by Mr."
"Spettigrew, the learned counsel retained by Mr. Jobling on Sallie's"
"behalf, a long, lifeless-looking gentleman in a wig and gown and"
spectacles. And his lordship smiled very pleasantly as Sallie raised her
heavy veil at counsel's crafty request.
"""Pray be seated, my dear young lady,"" his lordship begged with fatherly,"
"old-fashioned kindness, and indicated a chair meant for counsel, much"
nearer his own than the rest. Nor did he often take his eyes from her
face throughout the course of a long and convincing dissertation by Mr.
"Spettigrew, on her past history, present position in life, and claims on"
"the future, with some reference to the rival claims of Mr. Justin"
Carthew.
"""And I have full proof to place before you, at once, if you wish it,"
"m'lud,"" concluded Mr. Spettigrew in his most professional drone, ""in"
support of the fact that the lady before you is the lawful daughter of
"the late earl and the countess, his second wife, who died in the desert."
My fears were justified.
"At first the conversation was commonplace, and I related various"
experiences in a desultory fashion. Those that were mildly amusing were
most appreciated. But gradually we drifted towards more vital issues and
then the long and futile argument began. The weapons of sarcasm and
denunciation were denied to me by the laws of politeness and etiquette.
I beat in vain against the solid walls of obstinate prejudice and
superficiality. His statements were uttered with dogmatic emphasis. They
expressed beliefs held with all the self-assurance born of ignorance.
"They were based on no independent reasoning or observation, but had been"
assimilated either directly from the daily Press or from a circle of
acquaintances whose entire political outlook was the creation of the
Press. It was only then that I realized the immense power of newspapers.
"For most people ""thinking"" is just the discovery of convenient phrases"
"or labels, such as ""pessimist,"" or ""socialist,"" or ""pacifist"" or"
"""Bolshevik."" When any puzzling mental attitude comes before their"
"notice, they pin one of their labels to it, and, having labelled it,"
they think they understand it. The Press supplies them with these
"labels, and, consciously or unconsciously, they store them up in their"
minds and always have a few ready for immediate use.
So familiar and commonplace were the phrases which my opponent selected
"from his store in order to reply to my every utterance, that I could"
"almost tell what he was going to say before he said it. Moreover, the"
"fact that he had travelled abroad and had associated with foreigners,"
instead of widening his view had only narrowed it. Had he never
travelled he might have been sufficiently modest to admit that he knew
nothing of foreign countries and he might have suspended judgment about
them; but the mere fact that he had travelled filled him with a deep
"inevitable negative. So much time spent by day in questioning managers,"
"agents, schools and choruses; by night among the audiences of theatres"
from all-star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find
what he most hoped for. He who had loved her best had tried to find
"her. He was sure that since her disappearance from home this great,"
"water-girt city held her somewhere, but it was like a monstrous"
"quicksand, shifting its particles constantly, with no foundation, its"
upper granules of to-day buried to-morrow in ooze and slime.
The furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of
"pseudo-hospitality, a hectic, haggard, perfunctory welcome like the"
specious smile of a demirep. The sophistical comfort came in reflected
"gleams from the decayed furniture, the ragged brocade upholstery of a"
"couch and two chairs, a foot-wide cheap pier glass between the two"
"windows, from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a"
corner.
"The guest reclined, inert, upon a chair, while the room, confused in"
"speech as though it were an apartment in Babel, tried to discourse to"
him of its divers tenantry.
"A polychromatic rug like some brilliant-flowered rectangular, tropical"
islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting. Upon the
gay-papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from
"house to house—The Huguenot Lovers, The First Quarrel, The Wedding"
"Breakfast, Psyche at the Fountain. The mantel’s chastely severe outline"
was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew
like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet. Upon it was some desolate
flotsam cast aside by the room’s marooned when a lucky sail had borne
"them to a fresh port—a trifling vase or two, pictures of actresses, a"
"medicine bottle, some stray cards out of a deck."
(vi) Cases in which an incision and the ligature of a parietal artery
are indicated are very rare. I never saw such a one myself.
"(vii) If a hæmothorax suppurates, it must be treated on the ordinary"
lines of an empyema. In view of the constant formation of adhesions and
"difficulty in drainage, a portion of a rib should always be resected in"
"order to ensure sufficient space for after-treatment. The cavities, as a"
"rule, are better irrigated, the usual precautions being taken where"
there is any reason to fear that the lung is still in communication with
the cavity.
"Care in carrying out asepsis in tapping, which should be performed with"
"an aspirator, need hardly be more than mentioned. It will be noted that"
"in some of the cases quoted suppuration followed tapping, but it must be"
remembered that in these the two primary wounds already existed as
possible channels of infection.
Retained bullets of small calibre in the thoracic cavity were not
"common, unless the lodgment had occurred in the bodies of the vertebræ."
"I saw very few. Shrapnel bullets and fragments of shells, however, were,"
"in proportion to the frequency of wounds from such projectiles, more"
commonly retained. The rules to be followed in such cases do not
materially deviate from those to be observed in the body generally.
"When the bullet is causing no trouble, and is lodged in either the bone"
"of the spine or the lung substance, no interference is advisable. When,"
"on the other hand, the bullet as viewed by the X-rays is seen to be in"
"the pleural cavity, and any symptoms of its presence exist, it may be"
justifiable to remove it. I saw this done in one case for the removal of
a shrapnel bullet from the lower reflexion of the pleura on account of
"fixed pain and tenderness complained of by the patient. The bullet, a"
"If it is a double foetus with only one neck, the ruler will enlarge"
his land.
"If it is a double foetus with only one spine, the ruler will enlarge"
his land.
"If it is a double foetus with only one mouth, the land will remain"
under the command of the king.
"If it is a double foetus with only one breast, the land will be"
"enlarged, rule of a legitimate king."
In order to grasp the principles underlying the interpretation of such
"omens, we must take as our starting point the conceptions connected with"
the various parts of the body. Bearing in mind that the omens deal
primarily with public affairs and the general welfare and only to a
"limited extent with private and individual concerns[40], the head of the"
foetus by a natural association stands for the ruler or occasionally for
"the owner of the mother lamb. One head to the double foetus, therefore,"
indicates unity--a single rule--whereas two heads point to disruption of
some kind. If the double foetus is so entwined as to be shut in within an
"enclosure, a similarly natural association of ideas would lead to the"
"country being shut in, in a state of confusion, the land in a condition of"
"subjugation or the like. On the other hand, if merely the heads are"
enclosed so as to give the impression of unity and the rest of the two
"bodies is disentangled, the unfavorable sign is converted into a favorable"
one. A second principle involved in the interpretation results in a more
"favorable conclusion if the double foetus shows less complications. So, a"
single neck or a single spine or a single breast or a single mouth point
"again, like a single head, towards unity and therefore to flourishing"
"conditions in the land. In the case of legs and tails, to be sure, the"
carbonate of lime of the Algonkian limestones and marbles was
"extracted from sea water by organisms, as is done at present by"
"corals, mollusks, and other humble animals and plants, the life of"
"those ancient seas must have been abundant. Graphite, a soft black"
mineral composed of carbon and used in the manufacture of lead
"pencils and as a lubricant, occurs widely in the metamorphic pre-"
Cambrian rocks. It is known to be produced in some cases by the
"metamorphism of coal, which itself is formed of decomposed vegetal"
tissues. Seams of graphite may therefore represent accumulations
"of vegetal matter such as seaweed. But limestone, iron ores, and"
"graphite can be produced by chemical processes, and their presence"
"in the pre-Cambrian makes it only probable, and not certain, that"
life existed at that time.
PRE-CAMBRIAN FOSSILS. Very rarely has any clear trace of an
organism been found in the most ancient chapters of the geological
"record, so many of their leaves have been destroyed and so far"
have their pages been defaced. Omitting structures whose organic
"nature has been questioned, there are left to mention a tiny"
"seashell of one of the most lowly types,--a DISCINA from the pre-"
"Cambrian rocks of the Colorado Canyon,--and from the pre-Cambrian"
rocks of Montana trails of annelid worms and casts of their
"burrows in ancient beaches, and fragments of the tests of"
crustaceans. These diverse forms indicate that before the
"Algonkian had closed, life was abundant and had widely"
differentiated. We may expect that other forms will be discovered
as the rocks are closely searched.
PRE-CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. Our knowledge is far too meager to warrant
an attempt to draw the varying outlines of sea and land during the
Archean and Algonkian eras. Pre-Cambrian time probably was longer
"than all later geological time down to the present, as we may"
to say: it is a question of the stage of development.
"Experience has taught me that for the group of normal children, almost"
"irrespective of age, the first kind of story suitable will contain an"
appeal to conditions to which they are accustomed. The reason of this
"is obvious: the child, having limited experience, can only be reached"
"by this experience, until his imagination is awakened and he is enabled"
to grasp through this faculty what he has not actually passed through.
Before this awakening has taken place he enters the realm of fiction
(represented in the story) by comparison with his personal experience.
Every story and every point in the story mean more as that experience
"widens, and the interest varies, of course, with temperament, quickness"
"of perception, power of visualising and of concentration."
"In “The Marsh King's Daughter,” H. C. Andersen says:"
“The Storks have a great many stories which they tell their little
"ones, all about the bogs and marshes. They suit them to their age and"
"capacity. The young ones are quite satisfied with Kribble, Krabble,"
"or some such nonsense, and find it charming; but the elder ones want"
something with more meaning.”
One of the most interesting experiments to be made in connection with
this subject is to tell the same story at intervals of a year or six
months to some individual child.[25] The different incidents in the
"story which appeal to it (and you must watch it closely, to be sure the"
"interest is real, and not artificially stimulated by any suggestion on"
your part) will mark its mental development and the gradual awakening
"of its imagination. This experiment is a very delicate one, and will"
"not be infallible, because children are secretive and the appreciation"
"is often (unconsciously) simulated, or concealed through shyness or"
"want of articulation. But it is, in spite of this, a deeply interesting"
"taught to Magna Grecia,[88] namely, that this earthly life was a trial, a"
"preparation for a higher and purer life, that the happiness of an"
after-life could be secured by means of rites and observances revealed by
"the gods themselves, all this was now preached with a firmness and"
"precision hitherto unknown. These eschatological doctrines in particular,"
helped Egypt to conquer the Latin world and especially the miserable
"masses, on whom the weight of all the iniquities of Roman society rested"
heavily.

The power and popularity of that belief in future life has left traces even
"in the French language, and in concluding this study, from which I have"
"been compelled to exclude every picturesque detail, I would like to point"
out how a French word of to-day dimly perpetuates the memory of the old
Egyptian ideas.
During the cold nights of their long winters the Scandinavians dreamed of a
Walhalla where the deceased warriors sat in well-closed brilliantly
"illuminated halls, warming themselves and drinking the strong liquor served"
"by the Valkyries; but under the burning sky of Egypt, near the arid sand"
"where thirst kills the traveler, people wished that their dead might find a"
limpid spring in their future wanderings to assuage the heat that devoured
"them, and that they might be {102} refreshed by the breezes of the north"
wind.[89] Even at Rome the adherents of the Alexandrian gods frequently
"inscribed the following wish on their tombs: ""May Osiris give you fresh"
"water.""[90] Soon this water became, in a figurative sense, the fountain of"
life pouring out immortality to thirsting souls. The metaphor obtained such
popularity that in Latin _refrigerium_ became synonymous with comfort and
"happiness. The term retained this meaning in the liturgy of the church,[91]"
and for that reason people continue to pray for spiritual
_rafraîchissement_ of the dead although the Christian paradise has very
"Now, whenever any one of these gentlemen who wish to convert me will"
show that the Colonel is wrong in this brief paragraph; whenever they
"will, in print or in public, refute the arguments to which he refers,"
"and to which they object, I shall not be slow to respond."
"2. It must be argument, not personal abuse, and it must be conducted in"
a courteous manner and tone.
"3. It must proceed upon the basis that I am as honest, as earnest, and"
as virtuous in my motives and intentions as they are in theirs.
"Now, surely these gentlemen cannot object to these simple requirements;"
and since some of them are men whose names are preceded by a title
and followed by several capital letters (ranging from D.D. to
"O.S.F.----which last I, in my ignorance, guess at as meaning Order of"
"St. Francis, but shall like to be corrected if I am wrong) they must"
believe that to answer the arguments themselves is both simple and easy.
If they do not so believe they surely have no right to occupy the
positions which they do occupy. If they do so believe it will do much
"more good to answer them publicly, since they have been made publicly,"
"and are already in the hands of several thousand people, who could not"
be reached by any amount of eloquence poured out on ray devoted head in
the privacy of my own parlor (or writing-desk).
"Therefore, gentlemen, permit me to say to you all that which I have"
already written to several of you personally--that Col. Ingersoll's
"paragraph, quoted above, expresses my own views and those of a great"
"many other people, and will continue so to do so long as your efforts to"
"show that he is wrong are only whispered to me behind a fan, or in the"
"strict seclusion of a letter marked ""private and personal."""
"Had his father acted thus, the young Napoleon would in all probability"
have entered the military or naval service of Great Britain; he might
"have shared Paoli's enthusiasm for the land of his adoption, and have"
followed the Corsican hero in his enterprises against the French
"Revolution, thenceforth figuring in history merely as a greater"
"Marlborough, crushing the military efforts of democratic France, and"
luring England into a career of Continental conquest. Monarchy and
"aristocracy would have gone unchallenged, except within the ""natural"
"limits"" of France; and the other nations, never shaken to their"
"inmost depths, would have dragged on their old inert fragmentary"
existence.
The decision of Charles Buonaparte altered the destiny of Europe. He
"determined that his eldest boy, Joseph, should enter the Church, and"
that Napoleon should be a soldier. His perception of the characters of
"his boys was correct. An anecdote, for which the elder brother is"
"responsible, throws a flood of light on their temperaments. The master"
of their school arranged a mimic combat for his pupils--Romans against
"Carthaginians. Joseph, as the elder was ranged under the banner of"
"Rome, while Napoleon was told off among the Carthaginians; but, piqued"
"at being chosen for the losing side, the child fretted, begged, and"
stormed until the less bellicose Joseph agreed to change places with
his exacting junior. The incident is prophetic of much in the later
history of the family.
Its imperial future was opened up by the deft complaisance now shown
by Charles Buonaparte. The reward for his speedy submission to France
was soon forthcoming. The French commander in Corsica used his
influence to secure the admission of the young Napoleon to the
military school of Brienne in Champagne; and as the father was able to
"satisfy the authorities not only that he was without fortune, but also"
"that his family had been noble for four generations, Napoleon was"
the only true consummation of such love was wedlock.
This conception necessarily implied the equality of men with their gods
in the future life; and that future equality was sometimes represented
as no more than a return to that which was in the beginning. ‘One is
the race of men with the race of gods; for one is the mother that gave
"to both our breath; yet are they sundered by powers wholly diverse, in"
"that mankind is as naught, but heaven is builded of brass that abideth"
ever unshaken[1523].’ So sang Pindar of the past and of the present;
but the Orphic tablet which has been already quoted carries on the
thought into the future:
"‘Out of the pure I come, Pure Queen of Them Below,"
Eukles and Eubouleus and the other Gods immortal.
"For I also avow me that I am of your blessed race,"
But Fate laid me low....’
So far with Pindar. But the dead man’s claims do not end there: ‘I was
"admitted to the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld’; already"
had he received a foretaste of that divine wedlock which implied
"equality with the gods; and so there comes the answer, ‘Happy and"
"Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’"
This idea commended itself even to thinkers who did not believe in
"bodily survival after death. Plato, in the _Phaedo_, where above all"
things is taught the perishable nature of the body and the immortality
"of the soul alone, yet avails himself of the belief that the pure among"
mankind shall attain even to godhead hereafter. To him the pure are
"not the initiated indeed, but the earnest strivers after wisdom. In"
his theory of retributive metempsychosis he surmises that those who
have followed the lusts of the flesh shall hereafter enter the ranks of
asses and other lustful beasts; that those who have wrought violence
uproar.
Emerson and his companions found themselves carried away before the
"onslaught like chips in the surf, then sucked into a maelstrom where"
the first duty was self-preservation. Behind locked doors and shivering
"glass a terrified office-clerk, receiver to ear, was calling madly for"
"Police Headquarters, while in the main building itself the crowd"
bellowed and roared and the hollow floor reverberated to the thunder of
trampling feet and the crash of tumbling freight-piles.
Boyd succeeded in keeping his footing and eventually fought his way to
"a backing of crated machinery, where he stooped and ripped a cleat"
"loose; then, laying about him with this weapon, he cleared a space. It"
"was already difficult to distinguish friend from foe, but he saw Alton"
Clyde go down a short distance away and made a rush to rescue him. His
"pine slat splintered against a head, he dodged a missile, then struck"
"with the fragment in his hand, and, snatching Clyde by the arm, dragged"
"him out from under foot. Battered and bruised, the two won back to"
"Emerson's first position, and watched the tide surge past."
At the first alarm the fishermen had armed themselves with bale-hooks
"and bludgeons, and for a time worked havoc among their assailants; but"
as the fight became more general they were forced apart and drawn into
"the crowd, whereupon the combatants split up into groups, milling about"
like frightened cattle. Men broke out from these struggling clusters to
"nurse their injuries or beat a retreat, only to be overrun and"
swallowed up again in a new commotion.
"Emerson saw the big, barefooted fisherman in the red underclothes,"
"armed with a sledge-hammer, go through the ranks of his enemies like a"
"tornado, only to be struck by some missile hurled from a distance. With"
a shout of rage the fellow turned and flung his own weapon at his
of the infernal regions assigned everybody a place according to his
deserts.[53] The doctrine of future retribution was beginning to develop.
"However, in this regard, as in their conception of the divinity, the"
Egyptian mysteries followed the general progress of ideas more than they
"directed it. {93} Philosophy transformed them, but found in them little"
inspiration.

"How could a religion, of which neither the theology nor the ethics was"
"really new, stir up at the same time so much hostility and fervor among the"
"Romans? To many minds of to-day theology and ethics constitute religion,"
"but during the classical period it was different, and the priests of Isis"
and Serapis conquered souls mainly by other means. They seduced them by the
powerful attraction of the ritual and retained them by the marvelous
promises of their doctrine of immortality.
To the Egyptians ritual had a value far superior to that we ascribe to it
to-day. It had an operative strength of its own that was independent of the
intentions of the officiating priest. The efficacy of prayer depended not
"on the inner disposition of the believer, but on the correctness of the"
"words, gestures and intonation. Religion was not clearly differentiated"
"from magic. If a divinity was invoked according to the correct forms,"
"especially if one knew how to pronounce its real name, it was compelled to"
act in conformity to the will of its priest. The sacred words were an
incantation that compelled the superior powers to obey the officiating
"person, no matter what purpose he had in view. With the knowledge of the"
liturgy men acquired an immense power over the world of spirits. Porphyry
was surprised and indignant because the Egyptians sometimes dared to
threaten the gods in their orations.[54] In the consecrations the priest's
"summons compelled the gods to come and animate their {94} statues, and thus"
"With the sample page accepted by the publisher or author, or both,"
the printer is authorized to proceed with the typesetting. Setting
"type by hand is now almost entirely superseded by machine-composition,"
except for the display pages (such as the title) and where the type
"itself runs larger than the English (14-point) size, this being the"
limit of the machines. Linotype[37] composition is cheaper than
"monotype,[37] but as the type is cast all in one line, instead of in"
"separate characters, the cost of corrections is much higher. To change"
even a mark of punctuation requires recasting the entire line. If the
"manuscript is reasonably final in its form, the publisher is likely to"
"order linotype composition; otherwise, monotype will be selected. Both"
machines carry the standard faces and sizes of type.
THE PROOFS
"The first proofs sent out by the printer are called ""galley-slips,"""
"or ""galleys.""[38] These are supposed to give the author opportunity"
to make such changes as are absolutely necessary. When returned to
"the printer, these galleys are made up into ""page-proofs,""[38] and"
"frequently go again to the author, or the type may be ""cast"" (made"
into electrotype plates) at this point. When page-proofs are submitted
"to the author, the publisher expects him to revise them, making sure"
"that all his galley corrections have been properly made, rather than"
"to make further corrections, as changes in the pages are still more"
"expensive than in the galleys. If changes must be made, the author"
should endeavor to have the correction occupy exactly the same space as
"the matter cut out, or to cut out further matter to make room for the"
"addition. Otherwise, the page so corrected will contain more than the"
"standard number of lines, which must be thrown forward, and the make-up"
of each page changed to the end of the chapter.
"Virtue.... Youth is full of presumption and arrogance, though nothing"
"in the world is so frail: it fears nothing, and vainly relies on its"
"own strength, believing everything with the utmost levity and without"
any precaution.”
"And on another occasion, when Calypso hospitably provides clothes for"
"the shipwrecked men, and Telemachus is handling a tunic of the finest"
"wool and white as snow, with a vest of purple embroidered with gold,"
"and displaying much pleasure in the magnificence of the clothes, Mentor"
"addresses him in a severe voice, saying: “Are these, O Telemachus, the"
thoughts that ought to occupy the heart of the son of Ulysses? A young
"man who loves to dress vainly, as a woman does, is unworthy of wisdom"
or glory.”
"I remember, as a schoolgirl of thirteen, having to commit to memory"
"several books of these adventures, so as to become familiar with the"
"style. Far from being impressed by the wisdom of Mentor, I was simply"
"bored, and wondered why Telemachus did not escape from him. The only"
part in the book that really interested me was Calypso's unrequited
"love for Telemachus, but this was always the point where we ceased to"
"learn by heart, which surprised me greatly, for it was here that the"
real human interest seemed to begin.
Of all the effects which I hope for from the telling of stories in the
"schools, personally I place first the dramatic joy we bring to the"
children and to ourselves. But there are many who would consider this
"result as fantastic, if not frivolous, and not to be classed among the"
educational values concocted with the introduction of stories into the
school curriculum. I therefore propose to speak of other effects of
story-telling which may seem of more practical value.

[Sidenote: A Splendid Church.]
The worshippers of the Virgin have not been lacking in their efforts to
"erect a suitably sumptuous building on the site of this ""miracle."" The"
"magnificent nave, with its avenue of forty-two columns of Greek marble,"
surmounted by a frieze of mosaic pictures; the glorious pavement of
"_opus Alexandrinum_, whose ""crimson and violet hues temper the white"
"and gold of the walls""; the grand _baldacchino_, with its four porphyry"
columns wreathed with gilt leaves; and the splendid tomb chamber of
"Pius IX. (predecessor of the late Pope Leo XIII.), with its riot of"
"rich marbles and alabaster, in front of the high altar--to say nothing"
of the almost incredibly costly chapels opening into the nave--combine
to give S. Maria Maggiore a proud place among the very finest of the
fine basilicas of Rome.
[Sidenote: A Dazzling Scene.]
"But not all the splendors of the building, nor all the fascination of"
"its ""miracles"" and legends, nor all the spell of its other relics, can"
"equal the interest attaching to the ""SANTA CULLA,"" the holy cradle. On"
"the afternoon of Christmas Day, we walked through the wet streets to"
"the front of the church, pushed back the heavy, dirty screen of padded"
"canvas, such as hangs at the door of every great church in Italy,"
"however fine, and, stepping within, found ourselves in the midst of"
a scene of the most dazzling splendor. The building was brilliantly
"illuminated with hundreds of electric lights and huge candles, which"
were sharply reflected by the glistening marbles on every hand; the
"air was heavy with clouds of incense, through the blue smoke of which"
"the lofty ceiling looked higher than ever, and the organ and choir"
"planet are very numerous, although much of the record has been"
destroyed in various ways. A succession of different formations is
"usually seen in any considerable section of the crust, such as a"
deep canyon or where the edges of upturned strata are exposed to
"view on the flanks of mountain ranges; and in any extensive area,"
"such as a state of the Union or a province of Canada, the number"
of formations outcropping on the surface is large.
It is thus learned that our present continent is made up for. the
"most part of old continental deltas. Some, recently emerged as the"
"strata of young coastal plains, are the records of recent cycles"
of erosion; while others were deposited in the early history of
"the earth, and in many instances have been crumpled into"
"mountains, which afterwards were leveled to their bases and"
lowered beneath the sea to receive a cover of later sediments
before they were again uplifted to form land.
The cycle of erosion now in progress and recorded in the layers of
stratified rock being spread beneath the sea in continental deltas
has therefore been preceded by many similar cycles. Again and
again movements of the crust have brought to an end one cycle--
"sometimes when only well under way, and sometimes when drawing"
toward its close--and have begun another. Again and again they
"have added to the land areas which before were sea, with all their"
"deposition records of earlier cycles, or have lowered areas of"
land beneath the sea to receive new sediments.
THE AGE OF THE EARTH. The thickness of the stratified rocks now
exposed upon the eroded surface of the continents is very great.
In the Appalachian region the strata are seven or eight miles
"thick, and still greater thicknesses have been measured in several"
other mountain ranges. The aggregate thickness of all the
"the small intestine, and may be summed up as follows."
The small intestine may present evidence of lateral contusion in the
"shape of elongated ecchymoses, either parallel, oblique, or transverse"
to its long axis. These ecchymoses resemble in extent and outline those
which ordinarily surround a wound of the intestinal wall produced by a
"bullet (see fig. 87, p. 418)."
The wall of the small intestine may be wounded to an extent short of
"perforation, either the peritoneal coat alone being split, or the wound"
implicating the muscular coat and producing an appearance similar to
"that seen when the intestine is dragged upon during an operation, but"
"without so much gaping of the edges (see fig. 85, p. 416)."
I met with these conditions in association with co-existing complete
"perforations of the small intestine, and in one case of intra-peritoneal"
"hæmorrhage in which no complete perforation was discoverable (No. 169,"
p. 432).
The implication and perforation of the small intestine are to some
extent influenced by the direction of the wound. A striking case is
"included below, No. 201, in which a bullet passed from the loin to the"
"iliac fossa on each side of the body, approximately parallel to the"
"course of the inner margin of the colon, and I also saw some other"
wounds in this direction in which no evidence of injury to the small
"intestine was detected, and which got well. Again wounds from flank to"
"flank were, as a rule, very fatal; but I saw more than one instance"
where these wounds were situated immediately below the crest of the
"ilium, in which the intestine escaped injury (see case 171). A very"
striking observation was made by Mr. Cheatle in such a wound. The
patient died as a result of a double perforation of both cæcum and
sigmoid flexure; none the less the bullet had crossed the small
different parts of this country in the success of his work. This was the
fourth occasion on which he had been deputed to the West by the
"Government of India on a scientific mission, and the success that has"
attended his visit to foreign countries has exceeded all his
"expectations. In Vienna, in Paris, in Oxford, Cambridge and London, in"
"Harvard, Washington, Chicago and Columbia, in Tokio and in many other"
places his work has uniformly been received with high appreciation. In
spite of the fact that his researches called into question some of the
"existing theories, his results have notwithstanding received the fullest"
acceptance. This was due to a great extent to the convincing character
of the demonstration afforded by the very delicate instruments he had
been able to invent and which worked under extremely difficult tests
with extraordinary perfection. Even the most critical savants in Vienna
felt themselves constrained to make a most generous admission. In these
"new investigations on the border land between physics and physiology,"
"they held that Europe has been left behind by India, to which country"
they would now have to come for inspiration. It has also been fully
recognised that science will derive benefit when the synthetic
intellectual methods of the East co-operate with the severe analytical
methods of the West. These opinions have also been fully endorsed in
other centres of learning and Dr. Bose had received applications from
distinguished Universities in Europe and America for admission of
foreign post graduate scholars to be trained in his Laboratory in the
new scientific methods that have been initiated in India.
RESEARCH LABORATORY FOR INDIA
This recognition that the advance of human knowledge will be incomplete
"without India's special contributions, must be a source of great"
inspiration for future workers in India. His countrymen had the keen
imagination which could extort truth out of a mass of disconnected facts
"Vaschide and Piéron, _Psychologie du Rêve_, p. 26), tentatively put"
"forward a symbolic theory of dreams, as a possible rival to the theory"
that permanent associations are set up as the result of a first chance
"coincidence. 'Do there exist,' he asked, 'bizarre analogies of internal"
"sensations in virtue of which certain vibrations of the nerves, certain"
"instinctive movements of our viscera, correspond to sensations apparently"
quite different? According to this hypothesis experience would bring
"to light mysterious affinities, the knowledge of which might become a"
genuine science;... and a real key to dreams would not be an unrealisable
achievement if we could bring together and compare a sufficient number of
observations.']
[Footnote 145: It is interesting to note that hallucinations may
also be symbolic. Thus the Psychical Research Society's Committee on
"Hallucinations recognised a symbolic group, and recorded, for instance,"
"the case of a man who, when his child lies dying, sees a blue flame in the"
"air and hears a voice say, 'That's his soul' (_Proceedings Society for"
"Psychical Research_, August 1894, p. 125).]"
[Footnote 146: Maeder states that the tendency to symbolism in dreams and
similar modes of psychic activity is due to 'vague thinking in a condition
"of diminished attention.' This is, however, an inadequate statement and"
misses the central point.]
[Footnote 147: In the other spheres in which symbolism most tends to
"appear, the same or allied conditions exist. In hallucinations, which (as"
Parish and others have shown) tend to occur in hypnagogic or sleep-like
"states, the conditions are clearly the same. The symbolism of an art, and"
"notably music, is due to the very conditions of the art, which exclude"
any appeal to other senses. The primitive mind reaches symbolism through
"a similar condition of things, coming as the result of ignorance and"
undeveloped powers of apperception. In insanity these powers are morbidly
Indefinite belief in the existence of “something not ourselves which
"makes for righteousness” has no motive force, and though men may rub"
"on in some fashion or other by following ancient custom, and the law"
"of use and wont, this can only be done in quiet times. And ours are"
"not quiet times; indeed, the air is thick with principles which are"
forcing themselves into expression. The principles of Nationality or
"Cosmopolitanism, the comity of nations and the limits of destruction,"
"international trades unionism, and the laws of marriage are recurring"
items upon the programme of every social science congress. All these
"dark questions are forced upon the attentions of men, and never was"
there greater need of some synthetic philosophy which may help us in
their exploration. Are we going to put Christianity aside and rule out
theology from our calculations?
I may quote the testimony of the late Sir Leslie Stephen here. Every
one knows that he held no brief to defend orthodoxy--
"“To proclaim unsectarian Christianity is, in circuitous"
"language, to proclaim that Christianity is dead. The love of"
"Christ, as representing the ideal perfection of human nature,"
"may indeed be still a powerful motive, and powerful whatever"
the view which we take of Christ’s character. The advocates of
the doctrine in its more intellectual form represent this
passion as the true essence of Christianity. They assert with
obvious sincerity of conviction that it is the leverage by
"which alone the world can be moved. But, as they would"
"themselves admit, this conception would be preposterous if,"
"with Strauss, we regarded Christ as a mere human being. Our"
"regard for Him might differ in degree, but would not differ in"
"kind, from our regard for Socrates or for Pascal. It would be"
impossible to consider it as an overmastering and all-powerful
influence. The old dilemma would be inevitable; he that loves
The arguments I have given against the prevailing Christian dogmas and
"usages, which you uphold, are neither private nor personal, nor shall I"
allow them to take that phase. Life is too short for me to spend hours
"day after day in sustaining, in private, a public argument which has"
"never been (and, in my opinion, never will be), refuted. And it would"
do no good to the thousands whom you are pleased to say you fear will
be led astray by my position. You have a magnificent opportunity to lead
"them back again by honest public letters, or lectures, or sermons, not"
by an afternoon's chat with me.
"And, while I recognize the courtesy of your pressing requests (made,"
"without exception, in the most gentlemanly terms) to permit you to meet"
"me personally and refute my arguments, I feel compelled to say that,"
"unless you are willing to show the courage of your convictions, _and"
"the quality of your defense_, to the public, I fear they would have no"
"weight with me, and I should have wasted your precious time as well as"
"my own, which I should feel I had no right to do, nor to allow you to"
"do, without this frank statement of the case."
"Now, do not suppose that I have the slightest objection to meeting the"
"clergy personally and socially. Upon the contrary, many of my friends"
are clergymen--even bishops--but candor compels me to state that up to
the present time not one of them has (either privately or otherwise)
been able to answer either of the first two lectures in that little
"book, and as to the third one, no one of them, in my opinion, will ever"
try to answer it.
Time will show whether I am right in this.
"In the mean time accept my thanks for your interest, and believe me,"
"Sincerely,"
gratified that a subject of his should be performing the important
"duties of Secretary to the Brussels Government, and his notice of"
"von Giesselin gave the latter considerable prestige, for a time; an"
influence which he certainly exercised as far as he was able in
softening the edicts and the intolerable desire to annoy and
exasperate on the part of the Prussian Governors of province and
kingdom. He even interceded at times for unfortunate British or
"French subjects, stranded in Brussels, and sometimes asked Vivie"
about fellow-countrymen who sought this intervention.
This caused her complicated annoyances. Seeing there was some hope
"in interesting her in their cases, these English governesses,"
"tutors, clerks, tailors' assistants and cutters, music-hall singers,"
grooms appealed to Vivie to support their petitions. They paid her
"or her mother a kind of base court, on the tacit assumption that"
she--Vivie--had placed Colonel von Giesselin under special
"obligations. If in rare instances, out of sheer pity, she took up a"
case and von Giesselin granted the petition or had it done in a
"higher quarter, his action was clearly a personal favour to her; and"
"the very petitioners went away, with the ingratitude common in such"
"cases, and spread the news of Vivie's privileged position at the"
Hotel Impérial. It was not surprising therefore that in the small
circles of influential British or American people in Brussels she
was viewed with suspicion or contempt. She supported this odious
"position at the Hotel Impérial as long as possible, in the hope that"
Colonel von Giesselin when he had realized the impossibility of
using herself or her mother in any kind of intrigue against the
British Government would do what the American Consul General
professed himself unable or unwilling to do: obtain for them
passports to proceed to Holland.
"Von Giesselin, from December, 1914, took up among other duties that"
"to expand itself into a broad, loving, sympathetic comprehension of the"
"wants and afflictions of human-kind; and he was writing a new poem, of"
which Villiers had seen some lines that had fairly amazed him by their
grandeur of conception and clear passion of utterance. Thus it was
"evident there was no morbidness in him,--no obscurity,--nothing"
"eccentric,--nothing that removed him in any way from his fellows,"
"except that royal personality of his,--that strong, beautiful,"
"well-balanced Spirit in him, which exercised such a bewildering spell"
"on all who came within its influence, He believed himself loved by an"
"Angel! Well,--if there WERE angels, why not? Villiers argued the"
proposition thus:
"""Whether we are Christians, Jews, Buddhists, or Mahometans, we are"
supposed to accept angels as forming part of the system of our Faith.
"If we are nothing,--then, of course, we believe in nothing. But granted"
"we are SOMETHING, then we are bound in honor, if consistent, to"
"acknowledge that angels help to guide our destinies. And if, as we are"
"assured by Holy Writ, such loftier beings DO exist, why should they not"
"communicate with, and even love, human creatures, provided those human"
"creatures are worthy of their tenderness? Certainly, viewed by all the"
"chief religions of the world, there is nothing new or outrageous in the"
"idea of an angel descending to the help of man."""
"Such thoughts as these were in his mind now, as he ever and anon"
"glanced across the glittering table, with its profusion of lights and"
"flowers, to where his poet-friend sat, slightly leaning back in his"
"chair, with a certain half-perplexed, half-disappointed expression on"
"his handsome features, though his eyes brightened into a smile as he"
"caught Villiers's look, and he gave the smallest, scarcely perceptible"
"shrug, as who should say, ""Is this your brilliant Duchess?--your witty"
"and cultured society?"""
not reject them offhand and altogether: what revolts him is that they
are so often performed without understanding and right feeling. But to
"his mind, highly susceptible to the foolish and ridiculous things, and"
"with a delicate need of high decorum and inward dignity, all that sphere"
"of ceremony and tradition displays itself as a useless, nay, a hurtful"
"scene of human stupidity and selfishness. And, intellectualist as he is,"
"with his contempt for ignorance, he seems unaware that those religious"
"observances, after all, may contain valuable sentiments of unexpressed"
and unformulated piety.
"Through his treatises, his letters, his _Colloquies_ especially, there"
always passes--as if one was looking at a gallery of Brueghel's
pictures--a procession of ignorant and covetous monks who by their
sanctimony and humbug impose upon the trustful multitude and fare
sumptuously themselves. As a fixed motif (such motifs are numerous with
Erasmus) there always recurs his gibe about the superstition that a
person was saved by dying in the gown of a Franciscan or a Dominican.
"Fasting, prescribed prayers, the observance of holy days, should not be"
"altogether neglected, but they become displeasing to God when we repose"
"our trust in them and forget charity. The same holds good of confession,"
"indulgence, all sorts of blessings. Pilgrimages are worthless. The"
veneration of the Saints and of their relics is full of superstition and
foolishness. The people think they will be preserved from disasters
during the day if only they have looked at the painted image of Saint
Christopher in the morning. 'We kiss the shoes of the saints and their
"dirty handkerchiefs and we leave their books, their most holy and"
"efficacious relics, neglected.'"
"Erasmus's dislike of what seemed antiquated and worn out in his days,"
went farther still. It comprised the whole intellectual scheme of
medieval theology and philosophy. In the syllogistic system he found
"conviction that he knew all about the places he had visited, and this"
"conviction, enunciated with pompous emphasis, supplanted the real"
knowledge and understanding derived from honest observation. Like so
"many people who do not possess the faculty of experiencing, he"
continually appealed to his own experience and continually referred to
"his maturer years, as though old age of itself brought wisdom."
"As for the war itself he took no deep interest in it, although he"
"glanced at the war news every day. But to understand it, to analyse its"
"causes, to grasp its significance, to realize its true nature, that he"
never attempted to do. His labels and his alleged experiences and his
years were sufficient to cope with the entire question and answer it
satisfactorily for himself. I almost envied him for his
self-sufficiency. He would never suffer acutely from any mental strife
or agitation due to any but immediate and personal causes. Perhaps such
a stable mentality that can without effort reject all inconvenient data
is the most desirable of all and the most conducive to happiness.
Certain it is that the stability of society and the very existence of
civilization itself depend upon the preponderance of that particular
type.
"I knew that the argument was hopeless. Indeed, it was no argument. It"
was no exchange of ideas. It was no mutual attempt at discovering truths
by an impartial comparison of two different attitudes.
At times there were signs of heat on both sides. My opponent spoke of
"""our democratic army"" (familiar phrase!) and the overbearing manner in"
"which he connected this dictum with a number of false, irrelevant or"
arbitrary generalizations made me feel a momentary pang of anger and I
"wished he could experience a term of military service. Nevertheless,"
there was no actual display of bad temper or emotion and we parted with
all the habitual formulae imposed by social decorum.
INJURIES TO THE INTESTINAL TRACT
1. _Wounds of the stomach._--A considerable number of wounds in such a
"situation as to have possibly implicated the stomach were observed, and"
of these a certain number recovered spontaneously. The only two
instances that came under my own observation are recorded below. It will
be noted that in each the special symptoms were the classic ones of
vomiting and hæmatemesis. In the first case blood was also passed per
"anum, and in the second the diagnosis was reinforced by the escape of"
stomach contents from the external wound.
The second case was a surgical disappointment. No doubt the fatal issue
was mainly dependent on the fact that the external wound had to be kept
open to allow of the escape of the abundant discharge from the wounded
"liver. In the absence of the hepatic wound, however, I believe it would"
"have been possible for this patient to have got well spontaneously, in"
view of the firm adhesions which had formed around the opening in the
"stomach, and the consequent localisation which had been effected."
Another unfortunate element in this case was the comminuted fracture of
"the seventh costal cartilage, which maintained the patency of the"
"aperture of exit. The latter point, however, was of doubtful importance"
"from this aspect, as the vent provided for the gastric and biliary"
secretions may have been the safety-valve that had allowed localisation
to develop.
I believe that the secondary hæmorrhage was the main element in robbing
"us of a success in this case, and that this depended on the digestion of"
the wound by the gastric secretion. The early troubles which arose in
the treatment of this patient well illustrate the difficulties by which
the military surgeon is at times met; but the patient was admirably
"attended to and nursed by my friend Mr. Pershouse, and an orderly who"
"patients in whom the bullet entered by the upper part of the loin, and"
"escaped 1-1/2 inch within the anterior superior spine of the ilium, also"
did well. The same holds good when the wounds either entered or emerged
"under the anterior costal margin of the thorax, either prior to or after"
traversing the thorax.
Wounds passing directly backward from the iliac regions were in my
experience very unfavourable; but I believe mainly as a result of
hæmorrhage from the iliac arteries.
_The occurrence of wounds of the abdomen of an 'explosive'
character._--The vast majority of the abdominal wounds observed in the
Stationary or Base hospitals were of the type dimensions. A certain
number of the abdominal injuries which proved fatal on the field or
"shortly afterwards were described as explosive in character, and were"
referred by the observers to the employment of expanding bullets.
"A few words on this subject seem necessary, because it seems doubtful"
whether such injuries could be produced by any of the forms of expanding
"bullet of small calibre in use, unless the track crossed one of the"
bones in the abdominal or pelvic wall. That this was sometimes the case
there is no doubt: thus I saw two cases in which the splenic flexure of
"the colon was wounded, in which the external opening was large, and a"
comminuted fracture of the ribs of the left side existed. One can well
believe that bullets passing through the pelvic bones might 'set up' to
"a considerable extent, and although I never happened to see such a case,"
an explanation of some of the wounds described by others might be found
in this occurrence.
"In instances in which the soft parts alone were perforated, I am"
"disinclined to believe that bullets of small calibre, either regulation"
"or soft-nosed, were responsible for the injuries. I had the opportunity"
"and Persian frontiers meet, as well as that of the district known as"
"the Sarhad, with the least possible delay, and as I knew the Raiders"
"were across my path even before I left Quetta, I saw no reason for"
altering previously made plans or for delaying my departure.
Accordingly I started on the journey to Robat early on the morning of
the 27th. I reckoned it would take at least five days to reach that
"town, as the route it would be necessary to follow would be fully"
three hundred and seventy-five miles. I already knew that it would
be essential to make many long détours round freshly formed sand
"dunes and other obstacles, for it must be remembered that there was"
no proper road but only a rough camel-track continually blown over
"and obliterated by sand, along which supplies were taken from India"
"to Robat, and the small garrison posts which we had established at"
various points Northward.
The mention of small garrison posts may lead the reader to suppose
"that this area of wild activity was fairly well policed, but, as a"
"fact, one battalion of Indian infantry, a regiment of Indian cavalry"
"and, I believe, four mountain guns, constituted the entire force"
of regulars holding a front of close upon three hundred miles. It
"was small wonder, then, that the Sarhad tribes, commonly known as"
"Raiders, from their raiding proclivities, who knew every inch of the"
"country, could climb like cats, and could do long marches on short"
"rations, had succeeded in cutting our lines of communication, and in"
carrying off our supplies.
"I could, therefore, look for no further help for the time in the"
matter of supplies and so took with me all that I thought would be
necessary for our three hundred and seventy-five mile trek across the
sandy wastes lying between Nushki and Robat.
"When I was a boy I made an occasional invasion of my father’s study,"
and in the absence of more congenial matter tried to extract some
amusement from the shelves devoted to Christian apologetics. At any
"rate the pictures of the portly divines, which sometimes prefaced"
"their polemics, interested me, and I was sometimes allured to read a"
few pages of their scripture. I remember that I enjoyed the sub-acid
"flavour of Bishop Butler’s advertisement, prefixed to the First"
"Edition of his _Analogy_, at an early age, and I have thought lately"
that in certain circles one hundred and seventy years have not greatly
modified the mental attitude.
"Hear what the Rector of Stanhope who, as Horace Walpole said, was"
"shortly to be “Wafted to the see of Durham in a cloud of metaphysics,”"
says about his literary contemporaries--
"“It is come, I know not how, to be taken for granted, by many persons"
"that Christianity is not so much as a subject for inquiry, but that it"
"is now at length discovered to be fictitious, and accordingly they"
"treat it as if, in the present age, this were an agreed point among"
"all people of discernment, and nothing remained but to set it up as a"
"principal subject of mirth and ridicule, as it were, by way of"
reprisals for its having so long interrupted the pleasures of the
world.”
Perhaps the difference between the times of George the Second and
Edward the Seventh may be best discerned in the status and calibre of
"the popular penmen who in either age have found, or furnished"
amusement in a tilt against the Catholic Faith.
"The man in the street, as we know him, did not exist in the eighteenth"
"century. He is the predominant person to-day, and he requires the"
"services of able authors to assure him of immunity, when he is"
The Oriental civilizations on the contrary were sacerdotal in character. As
"in medieval Europe, the scholars of Asia and Egypt were priests. In the"
temples the nature of the gods and of man were not the only subjects of
"discussion; mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philology and history were"
"also studied. The successors of Berosus, a priest from Babylonia, and {32}"
"Manetho, a priest from Heliopolis, were considered deeply versed in all"
intellectual disciplines as late as the time of Strabo.[13]
This state of affairs proved detrimental to the progress of science.
Researches were conducted according to preconceived ideas and were
perverted through strange prejudices. Astrology and magic were the
monstrous fruit of a hybrid union. But all this certainly gave religion a
power it had never possessed either in Greece or Rome.
"All results of observation, all conquests of thought, were used by an"
"erudite clergy to attain the principal object of their activities, the"
"solution of the problem of the destiny of man and matter, and of the"
relations of heaven and earth. An ever enlarging conception of the universe
kept transforming the modes of belief. Faith presumed to enslave both
physics and metaphysics. The credit of every discovery was given to the
gods. Thoth in Egypt and Bel in Chaldea were the revealers not only of
"theology and the ritual, but of all human knowledge.[14] The names of the"
Oriental Hipparchi and Euclids who solved the first problems of astronomy
and geometry were unknown; but a confused and grotesque literature made use
of the name and authority of Hermes Trismegistus. The doctrines of the
planetary spheres and the opposition of the four elements were made to
support systems of anthropology and of morality; the theorems of astronomy
were used to establish an alleged method of divination; formulas of
"incantation, supposed to subject divine powers to the magician, were"
combined with chemical experiments and medical prescriptions.
"communions.[38] Towards the end of the empire, moral ideas were"
particularly connected with the assimilation of sacred liquor and meats
taken from the tambourine and cymbal of Attis. They became the staff of the
spiritual life and were to sustain the votary in his trials; at that period
"he considered the gods as especially ""the guardians of his soul and"
"thoughts.""[39]"
"As we see, every modification of the conception of the world and of man in"
the society of the empire had its reflection in the doctrine of the
mysteries. Even the conception of the old deities of Pessinus was
constantly changing. When astrology and the Semitic religions caused the
"establishment of a solar henotheism as the leading religion at Rome, Attis"
"was considered as the sun, ""the shepherd of the twinkling stars."" He was"
"identified with Adonis, Bacchus, Pan, Osiris and Mithra; he was made a"
"""polymorphous""[40] being in which all celestial powers manifested {70}"
themselves in turn; a _pantheos_ who wore the crown of rays and the lunar
"crescent at the same time, and whose various emblems expressed an infinite"
multiplicity of functions.
"When neo-Platonism was triumphing, the Phrygian fable became the"
traditional mould into which subtle exegetists boldly poured their
philosophic speculations on the creative and stimulating forces that were
"the principles of all material forms, and on the deliverance of the divine"
soul that was submerged in the corruption of this earthly world. In his
"hazy oration on the Mother of the Gods, Julian lost all notion of reality"
on account of his excessive use of allegory and was swept away by an
extravagant symbolism.[41]
Any religion as susceptible to outside influences as this one was bound to
yield to the ascendancy of Christianity. From the explicit testimony of
ecclesiastical writers we know that attempts were made to oppose the
Phrygian mysteries to those of the church. It was maintained that the
"incomplete without India's special contributions, mutual appreciation"
and better understanding resulted from his visit. One of the greatest of
"Medical Institutions, the Royal Society of Medicine, has been pleased to"
regard his address before the society as one of the most important in
their history and they expected that their science of medicine would be
materially benefited by the researches that are being carried out by him
in India. India has also been drawn closer to the great seats of
"learning in the West, to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; for"
there also the methods of inquiry initiated here have found the most
"cordial welcome. Many Indian students find their way to America,"
strangers in a strange land; hitherto they found few to advise and
"befriend them. It will perhaps be different now, since their leading"
Universities have begged from India the courtesy of hospitality for
their post graduate scholars. Some of these Universities again have
asked for a supply of apparatus specially invented at Dr. Bose's
laboratory which in their opinion will mark an epoch in scientific
advance.
THE INEFFABLE WONDER BEHIND THE VEIL
"As for the research itself, he said its bearings are not exclusively"
"specialistic, but touch the foundation of various branches of science."
To mention only a few; in medicine it had to deal with the fundamental
"reaction of protoplasm to various drugs, the solution of the problem why"
an identical agent brings about diametrically opposite effects in
different constitutions; in the science of life it dealt with the new
comparative physiology by which any specific characteristic of a tissue
is traced from the simplest type in plant to the most complex in the
animal; the study of the mysterious phenomenon of death and the
accurate determination of the death point and the various conditions by
which this point may be dislocated backwards and forwards; in psychology
metallic ores have been dissolved; but at the base of the zone of
"solution we may find exceedingly rich deposits of copper ores,--"
"copper sulphides, red and black copper oxides, and green and blue"
"copper carbonates, which have clearly been brought down in"
solution from the leached upper portion of the vein.
ORIGIN OF MINERAL VEINS. Both vein stones and ores have been
"deposited slowly from solution in water, much as crystals of salt"
are deposited on the sides of a jar of saturated brine. In our
study of underground water we learned that it is everywhere
"circulating through the permeable rocks of the crust, descending"
to profound depths under the action of gravity and again driven to
"the surface by hydrostatic pressure. Now fissures, wherever they"
"occur, form the trunk channels of the underground circulation."
Water descends from the surface along these rifts; it moves
"laterally from either side to the fissure plane, just as ground"
water seeps through the surrounding rocks from every direction to
a well; and it ascends through these natural water ways as in an
"artesian well, whenever they intersect an aquifer in which water"
is under hydrostatic pressure.
"The waters which deposit vein stones and ores are commonly hot,"
and in many cases they have derived their heat from intrusions of
igneous rock still uncooled within the crust. The solvent power of
"the water is thus greatly increased, and it takes up into solution"
various substances from the igneous and sedimentary rocks which it
traverses. For various reasons these substances stances are
deposited in the vein as ores and vein stones. On rising through
"the fissure the water cools and loses pressure, and its capacity"
"to hold minerals in solution is therefore lessened. Besides, as"
"different currents meet in the fissure, some ascending, some"
"descending, and some coming in from the sides, the chemical"
extent of territory in the richest region of the globe--that comprised
"within the tropics--to remain undeveloped, with its resources running"
"largely to waste under the management of races of low social efficiency,"
will be brought home with ever-growing force to the minds of the Western
"(Northern) peoples. The day is probably not far distant when, with the"
"advance science is making, we shall recognize that it is in the tropics"
and not in the temperate zones we have the greatest food-producing and
material-producing regions of the earth; that the natural highways of
commerce in the world are those which run north and south; and that we
have the highest possible interest in the proper development and
"efficient administration of the tropical regions, and in an exchange of"
products therewith on a far larger scale than has yet been attempted or
"imagined.... It will probably be made clear, and that at no distant"
"date, that the last thing our civilization is likely to permanently"
tolerate is the wasting of the resources of the richest regions of the
earth through lack of the elementary qualities of social efficiency in
the races possessing them”.

Some of the modern psychologists who are so expert in solving the
riddles of human consciousness that they hardly hesitate to approach the
supreme problem of life after death may perhaps determine whether the
"indolence of the Panamanian is racial, climatic, or merely bred of"
consciousness that he does not have to work hard in order to get all the
comforts of which he has knowledge. The life-story of an imaginary
couple will serve as the short and simple annals of tens of thousands of
By what secret virtue did the Egyptian religion exercise this irresistible
"influence over the Roman world? What new elements did those priests, who"
"made proselytes in every province, give the Roman world? Did the success of"
their preaching mean progress or retrogression from the standard of the
ancient Roman faith? These are complex and delicate questions that would
require minute analysis and cautious treatment with a constant and exact
"observation of shades. I am compelled to limit myself to a rapid sketch,"
"which, I {87} fear, will appear rather dry and arbitrary, like every"
generalization.
The particular doctrines of the mysteries of Isis and Serapis in regard to
"the nature and power of the gods were not, or were but incidentally, the"
reasons for the triumph of these mysteries. It has been said that the
"Egyptian theology always remained in a ""fluid state,""[37] or better in a"
"state of chaos. It consisted of an amalgamation of disparate legends, of an"
"aggregate of particular cults, as Egypt herself was an aggregate of a"
number of districts. This religion never formulated a coherent system of
generally accepted dogmas. It permitted the coexistence of conflicting
"conceptions and traditions, and all the subtlety of its clergy never"
"accomplished, or rather never began, the task of fusing those"
irreconcilable elements into one harmonious synthesis.[38] For the
Egyptians there was no principle of contradiction. All the heterogeneous
beliefs that ever obtained in the various districts during the different
"periods of a very long history, were maintained concurrently and formed an"
inextricable confusion in the sacred books.
About the same state of affairs prevailed in the Occidental worship of the
"Alexandrian divinities. In the Occident, just as in Egypt, there were"
"""prophets"" in the first rank of the clergy, who learnedly discussed"
"religion, but never taught a theological system that found universal"
"acceptance. The sacred scribe Cheremon, who became Nero's tutor, recognized"
"""In New Spain Christian fanaticism immediately destroyed whatever of"
"arts and civilization existed among the natives, and that this was not"
inconsiderable is shown by the numerous monuments now in ruins which
place beyond a doubt the former existence of a tolerably high degree of
culture. But in the place of this not a trace of Christian civilization
"is now to be observed among the existing Indians, and the resident"
Catholic clergy keep the Indians purposely in a state of the greatest
"ignorance and stupidity (see Richthofen, Die Zustande der Republic"
"Mexico, Berlin, 1854)."
"""Thus Christianity has always acted consistently in accordance with the"
"principles of one of the fathers of the Church, Tertullian, who says:"
"'_Desire of knowledge is no longer necessary since Jesus Christ, nor is"
investigation necessary since the Gospel._' If the civilization of the
European and especially of Christian Nations has notwithstanding made
"such enormous progress in the course of centuries, an unprejudiced"
consideration of history can only tell us that this has taken place not
"by means of Christianity, but in spite of it. And this is a sufficient"
indication to what an extent this civilization must still be capable
of development when once it shall be completely freed from the narrow
"bounds of old superstitious and religious embarrassments!"""
"""We must therefore endeavor to form convictions which are not to stand"
"once and for all, as philosophers and theologians usually do, but such"
as may change and become improved with the advance of knowledge. Whoever
does not recognize this and gives himself up once for all to a belief
"which he regards as final truth, whether it be of a theological or"
"philosophical kind, is of course incapable of accepting a conviction"
supported upon scientific grounds. Unfortunately our whole education is
founded upon an early systematic curbing and fettering of the intellect
in the direction of dogmatic (philosophical or theological) doctrines of
of abdominal respiratory movements in the segment of the belly wall
covering the injured part. The occurrence of general cessation of
"peristaltic movement is, however, to some extent opposed by the fact"
that in a certain number of the cases early passage of motions was seen
just as happens in the intestinal ruptures seen in civil practice.
I should be inclined to ascribe the escape from serious infection in
these injuries to the same cause which accounts for their comparative
"insignificance in other regions--namely, the small calibre of the bullet"
and consequent small size of the lesion: in point of fact to the minimal
nature of the primary infection. I very much doubt if any patient who
had more than one complete perforation of the small intestine got well
"during the whole campaign. This opinion is, moreover, supported by the"
fact that the prognosis was so far better in cases of injury to the
"large than to the small intestine, in which former segment of the bowel"
we have the advantages of a position beyond the region in which
"intestinal movement is most free, the unlikelihood of multiple injury,"
and a drier and more solid type of fæcal contents.
In the instances in which recovery followed perforating injuries without
"any bad signs we can only assume a minimal infection, and sufficient"
irritation and reaction on the part of the bowel to produce rapid
"adhesion between contiguous coils, and thus provisional closure."
The other mode of spontaneous recovery which I saw several times take
place in the injuries to the large bowel consisted in the limitation of
the spread of infection by early adhesions and the development of a
local abscess. The non-observance of this process in any case of injury
to the small intestine raises very great doubts in my mind as to the
frequent recovery of patients in whom the small intestine was
perforated.
"constitutional but an absolute and hereditary monarchy (1660),"
enthroning divine right at the same instant in Denmark and Norway as in
"England. Thereafter, deprived of their old posts and subjected to"
"ruinous taxes, the nobility fell rapidly into poverty;[693] and the"
"merchant class, equally overtaxed, withdrew their capital; the peasantry"
all the while remaining in a state of serfdom.[694] Then came a new
"series of wars with Sweden, recurring through generations, arresting, it"
"is said, literature, law, philosophy, and medicine,[695] but not the"
"natural sciences, then so much in evidence elsewhere: Tycho Brahe being"
"followed in astronomy by Horrebow, while chemistry, mathematics, and"
even anatomy made progress. But to this period belongs the brilliant
"dramatist and historian Holberg, the first great man of letters in"
modern Scandinavia (d. 1754); and in the latter half of the eighteenth
century the two years of ascendency of the freethinking physician
Struensee as queen's favourite (1770-72) served partially to emancipate
"the peasants, establish religious toleration, abolish torture, and"
reform the administration. Nor did his speedy overthrow and execution
"wholly undo his main work,[696] which outdid that of many generations of"
"the old régime. Still, the history of his rise and fall, his vehement"
"speed of reconstruction and the ruinous resistance it set up, is one of"
the most dramatic of the many warnings of history against thinking
suddenly to elevate a nation by reforms imposed wholly from
without.[697]
"Thenceforward, with such fluctuations as mark all culture-history, the"
Scandinavian world has progressed mentally nearly step for step with
"the rest of Europe, producing scholars, historians, men of science,"
"artists, and imaginative writers in more than due proportion. Many names"
which stand for solid achievement in the little-read Scandinavian
"tongues are unknown save to specialists elsewhere; but those of Holberg,"
"Linnæus, Malte-Brun, Rask, Niebuhr, Madvig, Oehlenschläger,"
"Thorwaldsen, and Swedenborg tell of a comprehensive influence on the"
put the matter of such seizure and detention in course of trial between
the applicant and the Crown.
If the applicant establish to the satisfaction of the court that the
"ship was not and is not being built, commissioned, or equipped or"
"intended to be despatched contrary to this Act, the ship shall be"
released and restored.
If the applicant fail to establish to the satisfaction of the court that
"the ship was not and is not being built, commissioned, or equipped, or"
"intended to be despatched contrary to this Act, then the ship shall be"
detained till released by order of the Secretary of State or chief
executive authority.
The court may in cases where no proceedings are pending for its
condemnation release any ship detained under this section on the owner
giving security to the satisfaction of the court that the ship shall not
"be employed contrary to this Act, notwithstanding that the applicant may"
have failed to establish to the satisfaction of the court that the ship
"was not and is not being built, commissioned, or intended to be"
despatched contrary to this Act. The Secretary of State or the chief
executive authority may likewise release any ship detained under this
section on the owner giving security to the satisfaction of such
Secretary of State or chief executive authority that the ship shall not
"be employed contrary to this Act, or may release the ship without such"
security if the Secretary of State or chief executive authority think
fit so to release the same.
If the court be of opinion that there was not reasonable and probable
"cause for the detention, and if no such cause appear in the course of"
"the proceedings, the court shall have power to declare that the owner is"
to be indemnified by the payment of costs and damages in respect of the
arranged that in certain directions a bullet may pass almost parallel to
"the long axis of the coils; thirdly, it is elastic, capable of"
"compression, and light, and hence offers but a small degree of"
resistance to the passage of the bullet across the abdominal cavity.
Certain evidence both clinical and pathological supports the contention
that the small intestine may escape injury from the passing bullet.
"First of all, the fact may be broadly stated that injuries to the small"
"intestine were fatal in the great majority of certainly diagnosed cases,"
"while, on the other hand, many tracks crossed the area occupied by the"
small intestine without serious symptoms of any kind resulting.
"Secondly, experience showed that when the bullet crossed the line of the"
"fixed portions of the large intestine the gut rarely escaped, and that,"
although a considerable proportion of these cases recovered
"spontaneously, in a large number of them immediate symptoms, or"
"secondary complications, clearly substantiated the nature of the"
"original injury. As far as my experience went, however, I never saw any"
instance in which an undoubted injury of the small intestine was
followed by the development of a local peritoneal suppuration and
"recovery, a sequence by no means uncommon in the case of wounds of the"
"large intestine. Although, therefore, I am not prepared to deny the"
possibility of spontaneous recovery from an injury to the small
"intestine, under certain conditions which will be stated later, I"
believe that in the immense majority of cases in which a bullet crossed
"the small intestine area without the supervention of serious symptoms,"
the small intestine escaped perforating injury.
"Beyond the clinical evidence offered above, certain pathological"
observations support the view that the intestine escapes perforation by
displacement. Most of my knowledge on this subject was derived from the
limited number of abdominal sections I performed on cases of injury to
"Majesty's dominions has been or is being built, commissioned, or"
"equipped contrary to this Act, and is about to be taken beyond the"
"limits of such dominions, or that a ship is about to be despatched"
"contrary to this Act, it shall be the duty of such local authority to"
"detain such ship, and forthwith to communicate the fact of such"
detention to the Secretary of State or chief executive authority.
Upon the receipt of such communication the Secretary of State or chief
executive authority may order the ship to be released if he thinks there
"is no cause for detaining her, but if satisfied that there is reasonable"
"and probable cause for believing that such ship was built, commissioned,"
"or equipped or intended to be despatched in contravention of this Act,"
he shall issue his warrant stating that there is reasonable and probable
"cause for believing as aforesaid, and upon such warrant being issued"
further proceedings shall be had as in cases where the seizure or
detention has taken place on a warrant issued by the Secretary of State
without any communication from the local authority.
Where the Secretary of State or chief executive authority orders the
ship to be released on the receipt of a communication from the local
"authority without issuing his warrant, the owner of the ship shall be"
indemnified by the payment of costs and damages in respect of the
detention upon application to the Court of Admiralty in a summary way in
like manner as he is entitled to be indemnified where the Secretary of
State having issued his warrant under this Act releases the ship before
any application is made by the owner or his agent to the court for such
release.

"~ Ah, there he is!"

I've got short legs.

~ I had.
~ We felt sorry for him.
"We worried about your future, Peter."
How's little Pete going to manage?
We didn't know you'd end up one of the richest sods in Newcastle!

Wow.

That's a biggie.
That's a really big biggie.

Thanks.
Bye-bye.

"No, I'm not David, no, sorry."
I'm supposed to meet somebody right here.
... Me too a guy named Richard Katz.
What are you doing?
"Actually, this guy Richard Katz was... my dad died 26 years ago, and he was with my father in Penn Station, New York."
- Is that right?
"- Yeah, and"
I don't know the story of what happened.
So Richard Katz is coming to tell me.
- Is that great?
- I don't know if it's great.
"- It's something, anyway."

"- lt was you, you, who sent him overthere."
"-Yes, it was me."
- But why?
"Haunting, beautiful."
I used to like to play that on rainy nights... sitting in front of a roaring fire by the fireplace.
I don't have a roaring fire.
You don't have a girl in your arms either.
"Now, look, this isn't Laura."
Hilla is not gonna come through that door drenched with rain.
"Al, look, I-"
"- I know I'm being a little irrational about this, but..."
I'm the only one on Hilla's side.
That's not true.
She's got me.
You finally can see that she didn't do it?
Hilla and I are both orphans.
We gotta stick together.
Now-
- Let's see-- Let's see if Ziggy's got anything new here.
"- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith."
"- Let him out, I said."
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.
"I don't like to take the responsibility, Mr. Smith."
That's why you'll never amount to much.
What are you asking for him?
"Uh, 250 bucks."
Sold.
Let him out.
"So your name's Buck, eh?"
"You're tough, huh?"
"Hey, wait a minute."
That dog cost me a lot of money.
"- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins."
- Wait a minute.
"I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy."
"Do you think you can come over, fuck me, then leave?"
-Got someplace better to go?
-Don't talk like that.
Come on.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
-That's the last one?
-Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch!
I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table from the plate on top of it.
Stop it.
-l have to.
-You don't have to.
I gotta go home.
What do you mean you got to go home?
We gotta start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Forget your fucking hat!
Are you kidding me?
I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?
I got to have it. lt's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
Do you understand what we are involved in?
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her Goddamn hat?
I hid the package in the kitchen and I went to take her home.
She here?
She's not with me anymore.
You miss her?
Very much.
The mantle's quite pronounced now.
You're almost home.
"Hey, Mom."
Why did you come here?
I needed to see you... in person.
"You didn't ask to see me before,"
- when you were with Musa.
"- I wanted to, but I was afraid."
Of your own mother?
"I thought you would reject me, send me away."
"And yet you ran away from the Hunt, from Abby and the others."
It was too much too fast.
"When I saw Jules, I couldn't handle it, but Musa was right."
I don't belong at the ETU.
"I'm tired of hating myself, of fighting what I really am."
You can help me.
"You didn't raise me as a Hunter, but you can now."
I want you to be my mom again.
Why should I believe you?
"I'm here, aren't I?"
Love does swing the hammer.
"I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom."
Then show me.
Come closer.
It's been ten years since we've seen each other.
The least you can do is give me a hug.
You think I'm gonna hurt you?
You would if Musa told you to.
"It's okay, Pete."
"- I can't come, Abb."
He won't-- He won't let me leave here.
I can't just leave.
He doesn't let me do anything.
"Yeah, well, it's-"
"- That's easy for you to say, Abby, all right?"
I will come and see you tomorrow.
"And we'll talk about it, okay?"
Wha-
- Why?
"Becau-- Yeah, because he's my husband."
That is my fault and I can't do anything about that.
"No, do not come here, I'm telling you, that's gonna make things worse."
"Yeah, I know, I know."
"I know, I know."
I-
- I don't know what to do.
I don't know--
"I don't know what to do, can't do this anymore."
I just want to die every day.
I can't.
"No, do not-- I can't, I can't, Abby."
Don't do that.
"I'm telling you, don't come here."
Just tell me that--
That you love me and that it's gonna be okay.
"I know, but just say it anyway, will you, honey, please?"
"Iâm dying over here, I need you."
I don't need you like that.
Why can't I?
Why can't I?
"Okay, I'm coming."
I'm...
Here I am.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'm here.
And the reason I chose my mother as the hero of this college essay?
She faces her battles every day even though she may never win the war.
She's helped me see... that I didn't cause her disease.
I can't control it.
And I can't cure it.
This is my mom.
And that is her story.
And now...
I'm ready to leave home... and claim my own.

Allison.
Allison.
- Sorry.
What?
- We have to get your mom something.
She doesn't care about stuff like that.
She's just dying to meet you.
They both are.
"In the Midwest, you don't go to a person's house, let alone your girlfriend's parents', without bringing something."
-I'm sorry sister.
-It's okay now.
Why are you soaked in rain?
Will you change your clothes!
They said Migs is not in their house.
I also called Ara but he isn't there either.
Where could he be?
I don't want to think he's with Bela.
You should've told me you were coming.
I could've prepared for your birthday.
What really happened to you?
And then you'll come here drenched in the rain.
I don't know.
I was disoriented.
"I can't remember, I didn't know where I live."
That's why I went to your house.
-It's good you didn't get lost--
"-Bela, I really wanted to be with you."
"Wait, wait!"
You have to go home.
-Joy might be looking for you.
-I don't give a damn about Joy.
What if he's not with Bela?
.
And he was picked on in the streets?
And something bad happened to him that I don't know.
"Sis, sister, just go to sleep."
Do you know that's what I wanted to hear from you when I came back from Canada?
But you chose Joy.
And you got married.
I know.
But I'm not happy with her.
"I'll bet you $50,000 i can put it up to 200."
"I'll take you... because if you do that, money won't mean anything."
There won't be any wall street.
"You've lost your reason, jim."
You're getting drunk- drunk with power.
"10,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"25,000 at 140."
I'll take that.
I'm taking all the gold that's being offered.
"Now, name your price."
"50,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"100,000 at 140."
I'll buy it!
A million at 140.
And i'll buy that!
"The trading is closed for the day, gentlemen."
"I've found him, josie."
"Well, josie, here i am."
What do you want?
"Nick, is it true- what jim told me?"
That i'm fighting him?
Yes.
"Look, josie, do you think i'd have walked out on him if i didn't have to?"
I'm trying to save him from himself.
He can't win.
"He'll not only be hated, he'll be ruined."
And you'll make millions.
Yes... and it'll all be his if he wants it.
"Josie, we've both got to help him because he's after something that no human being can have."
Are you sure?
He must've gotten the message.
Christine.
"Uh, I think the guy that you... you know, the other night when you and he... dirty."
All right.
I know.
"Just let him in, okay?"
I'll get this over with.
Thanks.
"Hey, lover."
Hey.
"Mmm, that was nice."
Yeah.
"So, have a seat."
Wow.
I haven't been in a gym in a long time.
Not since my wife left me for her trainer.
"It's okay, though."
It's been great for my daughter.
"She loves her new dad, and... she's in the best shape of her life."
"Look, uh, Stan... the other night, I was in a particularly vulnerable place, and, um, I think what happened between us was a little quick."
"Oh, I know."
Sorry again.
"Oh, no, no, no!"
I-I-I mean that I think we should go back to being friends.
"Yeah, but we were never friends."
"Well... maybe we should go back to being pre-friends, you know, like the way we were last week."
But we-we didn't know each other last week.
Perfect.
Are you breaking up with me?
In a gym?
I can't believe this is happening again!
"Stan, I'm so sorry, I really am."
"I believe this is yours, my friend."
Thank you for lending it to me.
"But I still came out ahead, which is more than Mace can say."
"I'm close, so close."
One more door.
Yes!
Just one more door.
(sobs) Just one more door and I'm home free!
Wow.
Just... tell me why.
Why did you keep me in the dark for so long?
It's not that I didn't trust you.
I guess...
I just didn't want to share them.
"As long as I was the only human they confided in, it made me feel... special."
I think I know what you mean.
That might be why I've chased the Illuminati for so long.
"People may have thought I was a nut case, but at least I stood out."
"So, you two finally found each other."
"Yeah, I guess you could say that."
"- See you tonight, Captain."
- Have a nice day.
Hacker!
What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
"Oh, passing through."
"Man, you look like you've been through the wringer."
- (laughs) You don't know the half of it.
- (laughs)
"I may know more than you think, partner."
A lot more.
An Illuminati pin?
You?
IN THESE DAYS OF CRITICAL COLD WAR TENSIONS?
NARRATOR:
"THE HOUSE COMMITTEE WAS TARGETING THE SINGER,"
"ACTIVIST, AND FORMER COLLEGE FOOTBALL STAR PAUL ROBESON"
AND WAS SURE THAT JACKIE ROBINSON
WOULD REFUTE ROBESON'S CLAIM THAT BLACKS
WOULD NOT FIGHT IN CASE OF WAR AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION.
PAUL ROBESON: [music] HE DON'T PLANT TATERS [music] [music] HE DON'T PLANT COTTON [music] [music] AND THEM THAT PLANTS 'EM [music] [music] IS SOON FORGOTTEN... [music]
ROGER KAHN:
YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A BASS BARITONE SING
UNTIL YOU HEAR A RECORDING OF ROBESON.
ROBESON: [music] ...
JUST KEEPS ROLLING ALONG [music]
HE WAS ALSO A SERIOUS RADICAL.
HE WAS A GREAT FAN OF THE SOVIET UNION.
AND HE SPOKE HIS MIND.
ROBESON:
I' AND YOU LAND IN THE JAIL...
I'
HARRY BELAFONTE:
"FOR ME, PAUL ROBESON WAS"
THE TALLEST TREE IN OUR FOREST.
"ROBESON STOOD THAT STRONG IN OUR MIDST AS THE KIND OF VOICE,"
"NOT ONLY FOR THE ISSUES AFFECTING BLACK PEOPLE,"
"BUT FOR ISSUES AFFECTING POOR PEOPLE, SAYING,"
"""THIS IS ALSO OUR SPACE, THIS IS ALSO OUR TURF,"
"THIS IS ALSO OUR COUNTRY."""
NARRATOR:
"BRANCH RICKEY, FERVENTLY ANTI-COMMUNIST,"
HAD URGED ROBINSON TO TESTIFY.
I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO EXPRESS MY VIEWS
ON PAUL ROBESON'S STATEMENTS IN PARIS
I don't even know where to start.
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.
"Just to get away and make, you know, all the memories that I can... while I can."
And I know I gotta talk to her and I gotta just...
But not on this.
"You know, I just..."
I'll deal with it.
"I'll deal with it when I get back, you know."
I'll just...
"You're a good guy, Cooper."
Call your mum.
"Zero, zero, one, nine, three, nine, two, nine."
"No, I did not buy a pair of sandals in Koh Samui last night because I'm in..."
And how long does that take?
Because I need to buy a ticket back to America.
"Oh, my God."
Mm-hmm.
"Can I just say, this is the most blatant cover story for a second hook-up ever?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, my God."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Alright.
Don't forget your bag.
"The bag, yep, my bag."
Alright.
You are a top bird.
"I don't know what that means, but I heard somebody say it once, and you're it."
I got a plan.
Yeah.
It's odd jobs.
Okay.
The first letter's a B.
A. It's an A.
I think it's gonna tell us who A is.
D?
B-A-D.
Bad.
That's the whole message?
Bad?
- What's it supposed to mean?
- It means you got punked.
Toby doesn't trust us.
I don't blame him.
I don't think he'd mess with us like this.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of.
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
"This might be a joke, but it could be real."
"Look, either way, Toby's not the enemy."
"You know what, guys?"
I'm gonna go.
What was that all about?
How should I know?
Doesn't look like very much.
"Well, it's all we have."
The rest is gone.
"Mom, Mrs. Potter doesn't need that money anymore."
"No, but we can't keep it."
"No, not keep it but I don't know, maybe we could give it to somebody who needs it."
I love you for thinking that but I just want this nightmare to be over.
I'm putting the money back in the safe deposit box.
What is left of it.
- I'll see you tonight.
"No, no."
Nobody did anything to me.
I just...
I'm trying to keep it spicy with Tim.
"Honey, I didn't even know people could do this, and I've had some long layovers in Bangkok."
- Mom!
- I'm sorry.
"This is a little more than I could handle, so, I-I..."
I think I'm gonna talk to my therapist.
Do you think that he can help me?
"No, no, this is for me."
You need a priest.
(car engine approaching)
(car door closes)
HEATHER:
I got this.
I got this.
(keys jingling)
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
(beeping) What?
"Did you know that Victoria's Secret sold their Web site to someone called ""Net Nanny""?"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Will you go get me a glass of water?
"I can smell Pop Tarts, so I know Tyler's in the kitchen."
"Look, I cannot keep doing this."
"If I wanted to run up and down the stairs two times a day, I'd join a gym."
You're gonna have to talk to him again at some point.
Maybe not.
"Maybe like a mama bear out in the wild,"
- I love you too.
I'm OK.
OK.
Your mom told me what happened.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry about missing dinner.
- It's OK.
I was just worried.
The last time you sounded like that...
I was with my sponsor.
Oh.
- That's good.
"- Look, I get it if you're angry at me."
I'm not angry.
I just don't know if I can handle it.
That's why they tell you not to date anyone your first year you're clean.
I never understood that before tonight because I couldn't deal with anyone or anything but me.
That's how it should be.
"Look, you weren't wrong to worry, OK?"
"I just don't think I'm ready for a relationship, Tyler."
I know.
I know.
I just want you to be OK.
"More than anything I want for us, I want that for you."
Come here.
It's OK.
Have you talked to Mom?
"I keep trying to reach her, but she's not picking up, at least not for me."
"Yeah, not for me either."
Let me be the one to kick Holly out of our lives once and for all.
"Sarah, Holly's not going anywhere."
Nor do I want her to.
"We came this far by faith, Lord."
"And we ask you, Father, when he get in college, Lord... to keep him, Lord- keep him protected."
"We thank you for him,Jesus."
- In Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.
- Amen.
"Oh,you can cry like a river, girl."
"You're crying so bad, I won't even make fun of you."
"Oh, God."
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
"I want you to be good, okay?"
"And don't, uh, get mixed up in none of that old stuff that, uh, you know."
I done told you what to do.
"Don't get no alcohol, no wine coolers."
None of that stuff.
Bye-bye.
I just hope he stay in there.
That's what worries me most.
"Once he get in the door, I want him to stay in there for four years."
Think he gonna make it?
You do?
I think he gonna make it.
"Well, I hope so anyway."
When I was young
"- When I was little, that's all I used to think about- the NBA."
"If I set my mind, I can"
- I can go.
I can st
- I can go.
Get in good college.
I can go.
Harry.
Come on.
Harry.
"Harry, come on we've got so much to do today."
"please, my darling."
"Yeah, thank you."
Love you.
"Come on, now."
Harry.
That is sick.
holy wow.
Nice to meet you.
What's your name?
Liam.
I went on X Factor when I was 1 4 the first time.
It's bad news.
Simon sent me home because I was too young.
Why are you here today?
I'm here to be the best artist I can be.
he first time  saw the One Direction boys was when they auditioned as solo artists for he X Factor.
"I don't know if any of you have seen my first audition, but it was horrendous."
I hope it doesn't make any part of this movie.
just murdered it.
I'd Iike to make a personal apology to plain White T's.
hello.
So tell me a bit about you.
-I work in a bakery.
-And was asking stupid questions about what pies are popular.
You see these people  that audition for the show and they come from  the same sort of background as you.
"They just come from normal, working-cIass families."
-What's your name?
-My name's Zayn.
FRIENDSHIP
We don't have profound conversations.
I ask how they are doing but it's mostly just being polite.
If I really had a problem -
- I think they'd   quietly disappear.
I try to be just like them.
I try to be like them so they'll accept me.
It isn't really acceptable to be different from the others.
I've got loads of friends.
All over the world.
I go to L.A. I get in anywhere I want   because I know people and I'm friends with them.
With celebs and so on.
They've got money.
You can't be friends with people who've no money.
How did it go?
- Let's stop now.
- You can't stop now.
- It was your idea.
- A stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
When I hook a guy I won't share the money with you.
"Hey, baby!"
"Hey, Marc!"
- I thought you left with some guy?
- It's been a really lousy night.
Cheer up.
We're going to an after-party at Peter Skjoldmark's.
Have some Cristal.
Why are you always on booze and coke?
You're 26.
You need a wife and kids.
Send me one of your girls.
Oh come on Mile.
Nobody ever said that.
But they're thinking it dad!
Aren't you?
-Well I mean...
-Maybe a little.
"But hey, look, that doesn't matter."
I mean this is your life.
And we're just trying to make you happy.
Oh yeah.
Be nice and guilt me into telling the secret.
Well it's not gonna work.
"I just can't do it, okay?"
[Sighs] I can't.
[Door closes]
[Vocalizing]
"[Singing] The secret's messy, it's hurting Lilly and Jesse."
"Now she's all, now she's all."
"Poor little Miley's in a sad, sad place."
All because she has a secret.
"Now she's all, now she's all."
"Poor little Miley's in a sad, sad place."
All because she has a secret.
"You've had yourself quite a day, ain't you, bud?"
I seem to be having more and more of those lately.
Gosh look at me dad.
Being two people seemed like such a great idea back then.
Yeah.
That's because it was a great idea.
It gave you the chance to kind of...
"I know, live a normal life."
It doesn't seem to be doing such a bang-up job anymore.
That bitch is trying to take money out of my fist.
That's it!
Out.
Get out!
Wait.
Darlene's busting you for child's support?
She's trying to tell me this Chinese-eyed motheftucker is my kid.
- Angel:
That's bullshit!
"- Un plato, and that's it."
"Shitty day, man."
How is your kid in Santo Domingo doing?
"What, Junior?"
My real kid?
"Good, man."
I can't wait.
"Save my money, soon as I get my 60 Gs, getting the fuck outta here."
"Go back to the D.R., live with him and Carmen."
I'm gonna open me a bike shop.
"Stay with my tío in Baitoa, just till I get hooked up."
"He got a farm, and when you're done working all day, you go lay on this hammock, next to the pond."
"You just lay there, bro'."
You let the breeze hit your face.
"You're chillin' with your boxers off, and the wind kissing your balls..."
Maggie:
Darlene is only asking for 600 a month.
Angel:
Guess how much she's getting?
Zero dollars.
"The thing of it is, that bitch rats me out,"
I'm as good as back in lockup.
That's why I don't trust nobody.
-Just don't bustin' my balls.
"Hey, Tommy..."
"If I was gonna break your balls, I'd tell ya to ""go home and get your shine box."""
This kid was great.
"I used to call him ""Spitshine Tommy."""
I swear to God.
"Oh, he'd make your shoes look like fuckin' mirrors."
Excuse my language.
He was terrific.
He was the best.
He made a lot of money too.
"Salut, Tommy!"
"No more shines, Billy."
What?
"I said ""No more shines."" Maybe you didn't hear about it..."
You been away a long time.
They didn't go up there and tell you.
I don't shine shoes anymore.
Relax.
What's got into you?
"I'm breaking your balls a little bit, that's all."
I'm only kidding with you.
Sometimes you don't sound like you're kiddin'.
"You know, there's a lot of people around."
"Tommy, I'm only kidding with you."
We're having a party.
I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."
"I'm sorry, too."
"It's ok, no problem."
"-Alright, salut."
Now go home and get your fucking shine box.
- Sorta.
"It's hard work, ain't it?"
"Hey, I'm just happy to help out."
That's what I hear.
"So, uh, can you do me?"
Pardon?
"What you did for lester, i want it done."
I didn't do anything to lester.
"Look, he's right over there."
I sit alone in a room all day praying for death to come.
You got to do this for me.
Please.
Listen to me.
I killed 5 men in my life.
4 of them had slanty eyes and were shooting at me and my buddies.
The other one was a drunk driver who ran over my 10-year-old nephew.
They all had it coming.
"But I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna kill a war hero, a brother in arms."
I just won't do it.
Then you're a fag.
"Say that again, war hero or not, I'll kill you."
You are a fag.
"Ok, all right."
We're on.
5 goddamn miles.
"You know, i nearly had a heart attack."
My legs feel like jell-O.
"Oh, that's all right, dude."
You'll get used to it.
"Yeah, when?"
"Uh, depends on you."
You're pretty good with that thing.
Is your phone broken?
Or your thumbs?
"Ok look, we're on the list."
Here you see that?
Let them in.
You tot's owe me Seven.
Nice natural looking good.
Ah uh Brett Michaels is waiting down over there and you darling
Sunset Strip is that way.
Dude.
This chick has the biggest tits you've ever seen.
"Hey, Jamie did her and said she was wild in bed."
"Jamie, bro you don't want his sloppy second are you kidding me?"
They call him herp for a reason.
"Hey, check out the old dude and the cougar."
Sweetheart I'm sorry there's been some kind of misunderstanding there you go.
Tom how many times do I have to tell you
I only date girls 25 and younger.
I'm sorry...
Oh my God is that David Spade over there?
He's hot.
God this town is so disgusting.
"Oh my God, check this guy out."
That's the producer I met the other night.
He is so hot and well connected... oh.
Out or my way...
Uh oh...
Don't look over there.
Oh you've got to be kidding me.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm just...
Skank!
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"Shut up, Calum."
I'm just saying.
At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it.
Not just some scared kid in a trench.
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
OK.
He can find himself another hitman.
I'm sure.
"OK, kids, lunch is ready."
You should get yourself a new map.
Nah.
This is my only school prize.
The names are out of date.
I know.
But the old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you wanna know?
How did you get out so early?
Where you're living now.
What you're planning on doing with your life.
I'm out on licence.
Living in a kind of halfway house.
My life?
"I don't know, Jess, you're gonna have to give me a little bit more time on that one."
Is that it?
Of course it's not it.
I did it for you.
No.
"So, you hated her."
No.
"No, no, no."
"Uh, no, she was a nice person, just sometimes she wasn't nice."
Now we're getting somewhere.
I saw that!
We have several eye witnesses that place you at the scene of the crime and a few hundred of 'em overheard you say you wanted to kill miss Weather.
"No, no, I di- I..."
"Okay, maybe, but I..."
"Look, I just..."
That's not the kind of thing I would ever...
"Okay, look..."
"I know, I know, I know, I gotta stop babbling."
"I gotta- and I gotta stop laughing nervously, right?"
She's going down.
I heard that!
Look you don't know what I'm going through.
You try being pregnant 27/4.
It's confession time.
You did it again!
Hey.
I'm Shaye.
"What are you doing here, Shaye?"
There's no way Corrinda coulda killed Heather.
And I have the footage to prove it.
Shaye.
"Look, I'm not gonna let my baby momma do jail time."
Even if I don't plan to help with the kid at all.
Mm-hm...
"Okay, I'm so mad!"
"I am so mad at her,"
I could just kill Heather Weather right now.
"Guys pulling out, that's how I ended up with a kid in the first place."
"All right, fine."
I'll do it.
But it's not fair.
You asked me in the middle of sex.
"I was like: ""Uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"fine, I'll take him to Dave  Buster's."""
"Okay guys, quick announcement."
"It's a new year and I wanted to spice things up a little bit, so I decided to dye my hair red and then I chickened out."
Thank God.
Because red hair is the worst.
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
I love it.
No.
I love it.
It's so good.
It's like a...
like a nice warm bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
No I love it.
Like your whole head's on fire.
"I love you, fire-head."
Yeah.
"All right, Brett, I'm going to kill you."
- What do you have against red hair?
- I love redheads.
"When you sleep with them, it's like putting a fire out with your penis."
Just look.
The first time my dad cheated on my mom he was
- dressed as Ronald McDonald.
- What?
-Yeah!
Are you just gonna let him shove you like that?
Come on.
Come on.
Ow!
"Jesse I just don't want to make the same mistake I've made in the past, so"
I just want to come right out and say it.
I'm Hannah Montana.
Eh?
"[Mimicking Jesse] Whoa dude, stop, you're blowing my mind!"
"I mean, you're Hannah, you're Miley, you're Hannah."
Who am I dating?
You're tearing me apart.
Will you stop?
Will you?
Why are we even rehearsing this?
I mean you've told the secret enough times.
I'm surprised the pizza delivery guy doesn't know.
Mmm-hmm.
"""Who ordered the meat lovers special?"" ""I did and I'm Hannah Montana!"""
Oh stop sulking.
You've been mad ever since I told Siena about the secret.
She didn't know who Lola was!
Get over it!
All right look at me!
I wear Day-Glo wigs.
I dress like a Japanese cartoon character.
How can she not know who Lola is?
Come on she's dating Jackson.
She's one drumstick short of a jumbo bucket.
Now can we get back to the person with the real problem?
[Gasps] Lola's real to me.
Pack up the clothes.
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
What's with these clothes?
Is this a key to this house?
"No, it's not."
I wonder if it's a key to our newlywed home that we've signed off on?
What do we do?
Just be natural and answer the call real quick.
What?
-Hello?
"-Hey, Yoon Jae."
It's Se Young.
The doctor friend that you saw.
Do you know how worried I've been because I couldn't get a hold of you?
I heard you've been in an accident?
I found out when the hospital received your belongings.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Uh...
I'm fine now.
I thought so...
You were being weird earlier.
I'm coming over right now with your stuff.
"I'm close by, so I'll be there soon."
Okay...
She says she's coming here.
That's good.
I didn't think to get Yoon Jae's belonging because I was too out of sorts.
I guess she's bringing it back for you.
What do we do about Yoon Jae's job at the hospital tomorrow?
Do I have to go to work?
You can't do that.
"That was a long day, wasn't it?"
I can't believe we've been working for 8 hours.
They could fly to Moscow without they mingle ice with ice flake.
"You know, Jocelyn, I gotta tell you one thing, I think you are... the best sprinkler I've ever seen."
"Indeed, indeed."
Marvelous!
I got a new calling.
Mom and dad are gonna love this one!
"Dad, I gotta follow my heart!"
"- Okay, my U$20.000 degree..."
- This is me.
I created the haze of Dublin in a Greenwich Village studio.
You want my vision?
You want my vision?
Where is Kathy Bates when we need her?
"- ""I'll never let go, Jack."""
- Send the life-boat...
"Paul, let's go."
I was just knocking around with Jocelyn.
"This is Jocelyn, your spritzer, you met her."
Hi!
I'm gonna be late for Patrick Tomarce's book party.
I gotta split.
Are you all right with your...
- what is that?
- Ribbon?
"Yeah, ribbon rapping?"
"- Jocelyn, I can help you."
"- Thanks, Alex."
"Well, I'll see you at the Carnival tomorrow."
"Don't touch me, you're all wet!"
"Jocelyn, I think we could get a cup of coffee after or something?"
"Yes, but..."
"Don't bother about us, lvy, dear."
"- Oh, Marcia!"
- Oh.
For Miss Ivy Peterson.
"Thanks, governor."
Look.
Fifty pounds.
There ain't no letter.
You don't suppose it's from him?
He must have sent it for what he's done.
"No, not him."
"He's too mean, he is."
"Oh, I don't know."
I wouldn't put it past him.
Yes.
"Yes, that's it."
Hopes I'll use it to try and run away.
"Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can."
"And then, then he'll follow me."
"And just when I think that I've got free, he'll..."
I can't stand it anymore.
I can't stand it.
"Oh, if I could only do it I'd go down to the river."
"Oh, lvy."
"It's her nerves, that's what."
She ought to see a doctor.
There's a copy of the Winged Victory.
The real one's in the Louvre in Paris.
I know because I saw it there.
What's the sense of being victorious if you haven't a head?
"What's the sense of my taking a trip, acquiring art and culture if you're not going to pay attention?"
"It's because our half brother is here, isn't it?"
He's helping you.
"Oh, it took you a while, but I'm..."
I'm just...
"I'm so proud of you, Duvie."
Just let it in.
"You know, you... you can say it now."
"""My father is gone, and he's not coming back."""

If your dad screws up...
Cut him some slack.
That's rule number two.

"If you've got food and a roof over your head and you get taken to a prize fight every now and then, just say ""Thanks, Dad."""
Rule number one.
Is that so hard?
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to yourself?
I wasn't talking to you.
That's the problem.
You're not talking to the right person.
"You know, it's been a long time..."
Since I could do this.
I've never been able to do that.
"Look, I got it, all right?"
I got it.
You want me to talk to my son.
He'll accept who you are.
You saw it.
- He's almost there.
- That's the problem.
"If he accepts who I am, he'll want nothing to do with me."
Yeah.
Yeah.
(LAUGHING)
(WHISPERS) That really hurt.
(GROANING)
I knew they weren't gonna come.
Maybe they got lost.
Maybe they got lost and they lost my phone number.
It was just a big joke on me.
I'm such an idiot.
No one wants to be friends with me.
I am sure there's some explanation.
"Get real, Grandma."
I'm pregnant and I'm new at the school and no one wants anything to do with me.
And I knew it was going to be that way going into this.
"Honey, don't say that."
"And, of course, I blew it with Ethan because I was the ""b"" word to him."
Bitch.
"Yes, I'm just surprised you said ""'b' word."""
"You have a tendency to use foul language, which I'm not completely opposed to when it's called for."
Why don't you call him?
"Oh, I can't."
I'll call him.
"No, it's stupid for me to have a boyfriend."
It's bad timing.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
I already called him.
Stay off the bed.
"Or the one she's on, anyway."
"So, mind if I come in?"
I guess not.
I told you those two weren't nice.
I`m looking forward to a Iong ride.
You get to see the kids all the time!
I see them two minutes in the morning two minutes in the evening and maybe three hours on the weekend.
Someday I`II wake up and realize my little babies are all grown up!
And then what?
I just thought it might be easier to fly.
"Nothing worthwhile is easy, ellen."
We know that.
Kids?
Who wants to see the trip plan?
"Dad, we`re playing!"
"Okay, shut off the video games."
"Come on, Russ."
Shut it off.
I know you`II enjoy this.
I worked out the trip on the computer so that we get the maximum amount of fun time at WaIIey world without missing any of the good stuff along the way.
Here we go!
There`s us.
And there`s WaIIey world!
"Now, Iet`s just take a look at Day One."
shall we?
"Honey, come on in!"
We`re going to do Day One!
"Now, there`s the family Truckster as we leave Chicago."
"Rusty, please, do not eat the Truckster!"
"Russ, do you mind?"
I`m trying to work this out here on the computer.
"Okay, Audrey."
"Thank you, Audrey."
That`s just great.
"Look out, Dad, here I come."
"AII right, that`s enough, Russ."
Sylvia coming over?
You're not going to believe what happened. I gotta tell you that.
-What are you laughing at?
-Problem with the apartment?
That's an attitude I don't appreciate.
"As it turns out, I got an-- l do have a problem at my apartment."
-A gas leak.
-l didn't say anything.
But what's that?
What's that goofy grin for?
"What, you think I'd destroy my own gas installation?"
It's gonna get repaired.
It may take a few days...
... butyouknowthe way thingsare with utilities.
"Hey, the point is, is that I'm ready for her to come over."
Good. I'm glad to hear it.
Good for you.
Yeah.
"Great, the Amazing Hulk."
"Detective, I owe you an apology."
I shouldn't have gotten in your face.
I was out of line.
-No problem.
-Bygones be bygones?
Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you'd put in a good word for me with Janice Licalsi.
"If she knows we're cool, she might let me up."
-She put in to ride with someone else.
-l think you need to talk to her about that.
Mm-hm.
"Okay, no problem."
"Give me 20 minutes a day, I could get you tightened up in a month."
I can't tell.
Uh...
Who is this?
We're her friends.
Do you have a problem with that?
"Yeah, I have a problem with that."
And I have a problem with you looking at me like that.
Who are you to look at me like that?
I don't like him.
Let's go.
Me neither.
Who are you to look at me like that.
"Come on, Kathy."
Bye.
Wait.
I can't.
"Friends are really hard to get, especially when you're pregnant."
I'll talk to you later.
Isn't it harder to get a boyfriend when you're pregnant?
(ALL GIGGLING)
Ben just wants to see his girl.
Ben needs some happiness in his life.
He deserves it.
"I don't feel like letting him pretend to date me, okay?"
I don't like that.
That would be using me to do something that I don't even think he should do.
And Ben's my friend.
He shouldn't ask me to do something I don't want to do.
I've got the harder part.
I have to go over and convince Dylan's parents to let her go out with me.
But I think I'm up to the challenge.
It could be fun.
"Well, I know you can do it, and I'll help you every step of the way, Bob."
I'll help you every inch of the way.
"Emily, why are you making such a big thing about eight pounds?"
"Well, eight pounds are not easy to lose."
"Well, they are for me, once I set my mind to it."
"- Uh, what's that?"
"- Dr. Klein gave me this, calorie counter."
"You know, it's amazing how much food you can eat if you eat the right food."
"I mean, like, I could eat a whole cow, as long as I didn't butter it."
Come in.
Emily?
"Emily, wait till you see the present I picked out for-"
Howard?
"Bob- Bob, Howard's here."
"Hi, Bob."
I didn't realize you were here.
"Yeah, I kind of live here, Howard."
"Of course you do, and you should."
"Well, I can come back later."
"I just, stopped by to say hello."
- Yes.
Howard just... stopped by to say hello.
- That's right.
"Hello, Howard."
Hello.
"Howard, is there something you wanna discuss in private with Emily?"
"No, no, no, Bob."
"Uh, no."
Nothing at all.
"Uh, well, so you got a birthday coming up, huh?"
Wow.
Forty-one.
"Well, can we watch ""Lost Boys""?"
I've heard of that one.
Those... those are different lost boys.
"(whistling ""Snowbird"")"
"Are you whistling ""Snowbird""?"
Yeah.
That's awesome.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, why do you get to ring it?"
Because I was into her first.
"(doorbell rings) Let's flip for it, or..."
I can't believe you did that.
I cannot believe you just did that.
(doorbell rings) Will you stop it.
She's going to think we're weird.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Hi.
Miss Murray.
My name's Brian Griffin.
"Uh, first of all, I just want to tell you what a huge fan I am."
"Aw, that's very sweet of you."
And I'm Stewie.
I'm the one who sent you the vibrators.
"Well, I'm glad you enjoy my music."
Would you like to come in?
We'd love to.
"Wow, nothing says success like free on a Tuesday at 3:00 p.m."
I'll get there.
"So, Miss Murray, the reason we came is that we have a question about ""Snowbird."""
"It's about a relationship, right?"
"No, no, it's obviously about the fear of growing old."
"You know, I think you're both kind of right."
This was imported. lt came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?
"-Nice, huh?"
-Come here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?
"Yeah, I talked to him..."
He's looking into everything.
"This'll make the Air France hold up look like Goddamned peanuts, man."
Come on.
-It's ok...
"He's gonna do it, right?"
-l told you.
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens.
No promises.
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.
And I've been bleeding for this. I've been cultivating this son of a bitch for two years.
He owes me 20 grand.
Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit.
My dream comes true.
Morrie Let's get a drink.
And these are the guys Jimmy put together for what turned out to be the biggest heist in American history.
The Lufthansa heist.
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab the outside guard and make him get us in the front door.
Frenchy and Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them all tied up and away from the alarms.
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.
He used hang around the Lounge and play guitar.
- You gotta go ?
See yourself home.
- Fuck you !
"- Bitch, I'm gonna--"
- What the hell is your problem ?
You gonna take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine ?
"- 'Cause you wrong, Malakai."
"- No, you're wrong."
You been wrong.
You ain't even worth shit no more.
"Get outta my face, college boy, and take that trailer trash ho with you."
"Honey, his blue pajamas are at the bottom of the bag."
"If it's as cold as it was today, put those on him."
"Hey, whatcha all doing with my nephew here ?"
Come on now.
There we go.
It's okay. lt's okay.
- What's wrong with him ?
"- He don't know you, Kenny."
"I'm his father, he knows me."
What should I do ?
- Come around more often.
"- See, I can't talk to you."
And I can't depend on you.
- Shh.
- [ Baby Crying ]
"What do you think I use to raise this baby, oxygen ?"
"He has needs, Kenny, and his needs require money."
- Here we go.
- And we're gonna keep going... until I get what I need from you to raise your son.
I'm doing the best that Ican.
But do you think your mouth helps the situation ?
I don`t want you dozing off.
I`m not tired.
Are you kidding?
I couId go another 100 miles.
No problem.

"Sparky, why don`t you turn off the TV and come to bed?"
"Okay, honey."
"well, up and at `em."
We`re here.
clark!
"Can I do your back, honey?"
I`ve already done my back.
Can I do your front?
Go do your own front.
We should call Catherine and Eddie and tell them that we won`t be in until tomorrow afternoon.
"If we`re not there by 10:00 a.m., we`II be completely off-scheduIe."
I planned very carefully so we`d be at WaIIey world first thing Saturday morning.
"Sparky, I know how much this trip means to you and that you want all of us to have a great time, but it`s a Iong way to WaIIey world."
I think it`d be easier on all of us if you`d just try to relax.
"I`m way ahead of you, honey."
When did you get these?
I have my little secrets.
What a nice thought.
Don`t drink yet!
Ready?
I would Iike to propose a toast.
"- Write, I guess."
Write?
What about?
You've had no life!
"Anyway, it doesn't matter."
I don't want it anymore.
I didn't know you before.
You were just some bloke.
But now...
We're friends.
I think.
I don't want to do it.
The money's not important.
"It might not be to you, but it is to me."
I want some of that to go to Frances.
Ten grand.
"Look, Paul, son."
"If this weekend showed me anything, it's that I want some good to come of my passing."
"Now, if I jump from that bridge, the only thing I would've left behind was a traffic jam all the way up to the Angel."
This way...
I get to give something to me little girl.
That's something I wasn't able to do when I was alive.
And you'll get your money.
Everyone's a winner.
- Now that's how I want it.
"- For fuck's sake, I don't want the money!"
I'm an idiot.
I didn't think things through.
"It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it's not."
It's crazy.
I can't do it.
I won't.
Whoever calls maysound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
"She's dead, John."
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
"But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there."
"Even more easily because there, you're all alone."
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
"But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00."
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
"Bye,John."
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.

Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
My God.
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!
Get off!
Everyone get out of your cars and get off!

You've gotta get off.
Turn the $% thing down.
- What?
Check it out.
"So, uh, President Bush is in the news again."
Have you heard about this?
"No, Jay Leno."
The host of the Tonight Show.
I thought that's what I was doing.
"So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars."
You know?
"No, no."
Like Jay Leno.
"Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines."""
"You ever--you ever notice when you eat a lot of cheese, and you--"
"How is that different from what I was doing, though?"
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
"I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
Sure you will.
I just-- I just love television so much.
We all do.
"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
"Who, Gary?"
Tell him I'll be up in half an hour.
"No, they said now."
"If they got cookies up there, grab some."
"Ooh, and get them to pay for my Samovar."
"Of course, I mean, I assume that's what we're meeting about."
"What about, uh, Ray Romano?"
Can you do Ray?
Hey.
"God, oh."
I had a great kid.
He was gonna be a baker.
"Oh, I know, it's not much."
"[Louise Clicks Teeth, Heaves Long Sigh]"
But I set up everything for him.
"[Shouting] Now, listen!"
I've heard your garbage!
Now you listen to mine!
He hasn't heard it!
All right.
"Anyway, I set up everything for him."
"On his high school graduation night, he... he got drunk... a little bit of the old man."
"And I swear to God, he did something I never understood."
He enlisted.
Can you imagine enlisting... in a day and age like this?
"He wanted to go his own way, I guess."
"Anyway, they sent him toJapan."
They were gonna teach him this and that.
"Well, he never got toJapan!"
He only got to Okinawa!
And he got into a fight!
And he was killed in some town called Naha!
- Where is Naha!
"- Oh, come on."
"Seymour, it's all right."
"That's all over and done with now, anyway."
- He was all I had.
- Mr. Seymour.
Your son enlisted in the marines?
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was the dumb marines."
And you're a dumb person for stirring things up the first time you get around here.
The Troubled World.
Come on.
"Hey, Ponch."
"This weekend, are you gonna work dark?"
"No, Clark, I need the extra money."
"And now, the continuing story of the people we know."
Neighbors of yours and mine.
The people living in The Troubled World.
"Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
You mean to tell me you watch this stuff?
Cari just told Bob she's leaving for Brazil with Susan and Jamie.
I'll read it when the book comes out.
"Cari, don't tell me lies."
I don't wanna hear more lies.
Prove your love by staying with me.
But you know I love you.
I left George for you.
But not until I left Carla.
"Cari, sometimes I doubt your words, doubt our future."
Sometimes I'm sure we have nothing together.
"Bob, don't say that."
I can't bear it.
I won't hear it.
"Then prove your love, stay with me forever."
"I will, my dear, after we return."
"No, Cari, it's if you return."
You know me better than that.
You know I never lied to you.
"Haven't you, Cari?"
Haven't you really?
"Oh, Cari, I love you, I need you."
I want you here.
What?
There's a new club at the pier that the Walkmen are playing at.
- You know who loves the Walkmen?
- You?
"- Yeah, and..."
- Summer.
- Summer is going out with Zach?
"Yeah, so maybe I'll buy her and Zach tickets to the show."
- Why would you do that?
- Out of friendship and to show her how selfless I can be.
- And to get her back.
- I'm going to look into this.
"- Seth, your coffee."
"- Oh, thanks a lot."
"I'll, uh, get you next time."
"- Oh, my God."
I am so sorry.
- That was refreshing.
"Uh, here, let me..."
- I... am so sorry.
Are you okay?
"- Yeah, I have to, uh, get a rhinoplasty, but now I'll look just like all the other girls here."
"It's okay, really."
"Uh, you can leave my tampons where they are."
Thanks.
Is there anything I can do?
"Uh, well, I guess you could dislocate my shoulder, or shave off my eyebrows."
"I mean, is this how you guys treat all your new students,or is today just my lucky day?"
- Can I buy you a coffee?
"- No, no, no, no."
"Please, please don't."
"I've had plenty, thanks, and I'm guessing you have, too."
I thought you were gonna steer clear and let me do my job.
"Well, maybe I'm not satisfied with the job you're doing, Gibbs."
"It's not about me, and you know that."
I'm not just gonna stand by and let you grill him about something that happened 16 years ago.
"He lied to me, Leon."
"What's more important is, you let him."
That's not true.
His records were sealed.
It still matters.
"I told you, it was complicated."
More than complicated.
Why the kid gloves?
Stand down.
Michael was eight when Jackie and I met.
Both parents passed away.
Kid was struggling.
I filled a void.
I tried to steer him right.
"Leon, it's tough taking things like that on."
"Yeah, and it wasn't always easy."
"But I got him into private school,"
I got him into counseling.
"He was lost for a long time, Gibbs, and now he's finally finding his way."
The last thing he needs is people giving up on him.
- People like you.
- Yeah.
I've come a long way with him.
I'm not about to give up on him now.
Gibbs.
"Yeah, Abby, I'm on my way."
"Talk to me, Abbs."
Hi-- wow.
I can't afford to run down the boss's daughter.
Why don't I pack us a picnic lunch?
This is the kind of a day to play hooky.
I've already thought of that.
Good.
But I'm on my way to pick up Nancy.
"There was a washout last night, and the train's been stalled about five miles out of town."
Oh.
"Well, I guess a big railroad like that can get her here safely."
"Probably, but I..."
I did promise to pick her up.
"All right, I'll go with you."
"No, but I promised her, I..."
Unless I'm in the way.
"Oh, no."
"No, you're not in the way."
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
What happened in Los Angeles?
"I saw Colonel Blair, and he thinks I should get my papers in a week or so."
I know Karen Blair quite well.
Perhaps I can speed up your orders?
That'd be wonderful.
Don't mention it.
Beautiful tune.
"The words are pretty, too."
Do you know them?
I think so.
* Love is all that matters
* And we've got love
* We have walked off with a prize
* The stars that I used to see
* Are not where they used to be
I just had to have some of this chili.
You see?
It's pie.
"No, what Eric's saying is that we put signs up on our highway chatting up our soup and pie."
"You're a real smart young man, Eric."
You think so?
"Why, sure."
"Now, certainly a man of the world like yourself feels more at ease in the big city, but a guy like you could do pretty well in a town like ours."
You think so?
Maybe I will stay for a while.
Really?
"Yeah, you know, good woman, good friends, good pie."
I think I could be happy here for the rest of my life.
Eric.
"Let's see, do you really think you could be happy here?"
"I'm already happy here, Cor."
These people have taken me in.
They've made me feel important.
"Back home, I'm just a loser who didn't get into college, but here,"
I could be king.
"Well, congratulations."
I'll just tell Mom and Dad.
I know they'll be so proud.
I know I am.
I'm the prince of Sprinkle Land.
Hey.
Soup and pie for everybody.
The new guy's buying.
"Oh, man, this is good pie."
I was three hours from home.
Dad!
Cory!
I'll start giving her money for him.
Why don't you just give him the money?
Why...
"Why don't you just say, ""Byron, I'm your daddy?"""
Huh?
I don't see how that would...
"Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be a good idea, would it?"
"I guess that it would be better to just go on and put me in jail, and forget about your 5-year-old son."
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
"Hi, baby."
"Yeah, everything's cool."
"Yeah, everything's real cool."
"Uh, where are you calling from?"
"Okay, what's the name of the gas station?"
Mmm-hmm.
"Ray, you already missed the turnoff."
It's about half a mile back up the highway.
Mmm-hmm.
"Uh, there's..."
"You turn right at this place called ""Cothern's Bait Shop."""
"Yeah, there's a little road there."
"Yeah, you're not far, baby."
Just about 10 minutes away.
Hurry.
"Yeah, I miss you."
(ENGINE STARTING)
"Is that the road, Byron?"
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
"Lila, when they get here, I want you to get them inside the house and away from the car."
"Open the door, wave at them, talk to them, just let them see everything's okay."
No.
"No, i guess it's just time for me to get out."
Nick.
"Jim, don't let him go!"
"If you're doing this for me, it's wrong!"
Don't worry.
He'll be back tomorrow.
"Just come from the gold exchange, boss."
It's buzzing over there like a hornet's nest.
"You know, i'm going to put a scare into washington till they padlock that treasury."
"There she goes, up again."
"You know, gold's jumped 4 points since you started buying it."
Jim.
"Oh, josie!"
You're just in time to see the fireworks start.
"Jim, where's nick?"
"In his office, i guess."
Haven't you seen him yet?
I've been waiting all day for him to come through that door.
It's not so far to come.
"But it's not so far to go, either."
"I'm sorry, josie, i can't do it."
"Please, boss."
"Jim, you've got to do it."
Do it for my sake.
"Hello, nick."
"Hello, jim."
Gold's just hit 125.
It's not too late if you still want to come in.
It's not too late for you to get out.
"Stop fooling with gunpowder, jim."
I won't stop until it hits 200.
Wait a minute.
"Monica, how did you do this?"
"Well, when we were on our way home from rehab,"
"Dad had told me what had happened,"
So i just wanted to make up
"For all the bad things i've done,"
So i called papa joe's
And i made arrangements with my debit card to have your stuff back.
Regina: oh my god.
"Regina: wait wait, but..."
But how did...
How did you do it?
I don't understand.
"Well, mom, dad,"
I've been painting again since i've been in rehab.
And the director saw my stuff
And he thought i should have an art show
And i did and i sold all my artwork
And i made enough money to get mom's stuff back.
- What?
- Yeah.
"Oh, baby, i'm so proud of you."
"I am so proud of you, monica."
I've missed you so much.
I've missed all those things about you
That make you so special.
And i'm gonna be a good mother to you...
I promise you that...
If you'll just let me.
I told you i was gonna make you proud of me one day.
and you have.
- I hope i did.
Aneesa.
Repeat after me:
Now tell us what you know.
"When my family moved to Washington,"
Fatimah was very envious.
She told me she hated Al Khair.
She wanted to run away.
That's why she sold the villa.
And what else did she tell you?
She wanted to come to America.
She said she was going to find an American and marry him.
Go on.
"And when she didn't need him anymore, she could stay in America."
She would be free.
It sounds like a washing machine.
The world's most beautiful washing machine.
"Oh, my back is killing me, Bud."
"Oh, I told you to stop lifting little baby A.J."
"Oh, yeah."
You stay at home with a 2-year-old and don't lift him.
Sorry for the delay.
It's been a madhouse here this morning.
How are you feeling?
"My gut's the size of a roast pig, and my ankles look like bolognas and my back feels like a Cuisinart."
She's been a little hungry.
"Oh, that's not hunger."
"Lieutenant Sims, you're in labour."
Now?
"No, I have four weeks."
"Well, I guess no one told the baby."
It is true.
I did say those things.
"- Okay, 1...3...5..."
- Okay.
- Got it?
- Yeah I'm good.
"Oh, stop moving the pier."
Nice knowing you.
You've got Mason Bowl next week and this is how you're training?
- Can we do this later?
- There may not be a later for you.
"- Oh, oh Mr. Scott..."
- Was I talking to you?
Get in the car.
I'm driving you both home.
You're mother's going to love this.
You getting drunk on her watch...
There's some kind of interesting news that I need to talk to you about.
Why does interesting scare me?
"No, no."
"Listen, the company's been hired to do some flood control."
They want me to supervise.
How long is it going to be this time?
"Well, seeing that it is in New Zealand, um, 3 maybe 4 months."
"So, what's the upside?"
"It's a lot of money, sweetie."
Way more than I make now.
We could be good to go for a while.
Maybe even afford that art school you talk about.
Is this something that you want?
I only want to do this if it's right for us.
"You should do it, dad."
What happened to you?
Nice to see you too.
"Not those kind of crabs, Ziva."
Ah!
There's the Tony we know and love.
"Boss,"
Baltimore PD's got a suspect in custody.
Got a 911 call about Petty Officer Adams before the sailors found him.
Came from a auto-repair shop two blocks away.
Said they found a mechanic there trying to wash blood off his hands and jacket.
Got the suspect's jacket.
"Lot of blood, boss."
Is this your jacket?
"Look, I'm being railroaded here."
What's your name?
Michael Thomas.
"You got a lawyer to call, Mr. Thomas?"
"No, I want to call someone else."
"They've got this all wrong, Leon."
"Just do what they say, Michael."
I'll take him to processing.
Your wife's kid brother?
"He's my family, too, Gibbs."
- Then you'll be recusing yourself.
- For what reason?
"He's a murder suspect, Leon."
"Those are your rules, not mine."
"I'm well aware, Gibbs, but as long as he's your suspect, I'm going, too."
"Gibbs, give us a minute."
Is that a problem?
"All right, just tell me, Michael."
Tell me you didn't do this.
"Leon, no, I was just trying to help the guy."
And you didn't know Petty Officer Adams?
"Is he a dentist, then?"
"Well, he's a dentish."
He's got a hammer.
Davus?
Yeah?
Smash out Grumio's bad tooth.
"Of course, boss."
Just give it a wipe.
Very good.
Very medical.
"All right, fella."
Just lean back for me there.
Do you not want to know which tooth it is first?
"Yeah, go on, then, mate."
It's that wonky one there.
I'll sort of aim in that ballpark.
Stay still for me.
"I-I might leave it, actually."
"Yeah, probably for the best."
"No, I don't like it!"
"Everyone's loving it under the new boss, man."
I've heard several people call you 'nice' and one woman even say 'fairly hot'.
"Well, if you listen to what people need, they will thank you for it."
"Thanks for letting me get my new partner, by the way, Big Paulus."
"Good, isn't he?"
"Well, he's tall, yeah."
Which is what it's all about now we've raised the jug and swapped the papyrus for apples.
"Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!"
"Oh, my Jove!"
Where did you get him from?
I just saw him guarding the grain store.
"I was, like, 'Big boy, you're coming with me!"
"Let me talk to Pete, okay?"
"Oh, Pete got fired this morning."
That's so weird that you don't know that.
Jack Donaghy thinks he's gonna come into my house and mess with my show?
Hell no.
Jenna and I worked for years to get this show.
"You know, I moved from Chicago for this."
From Chicago?
I was in Scottie Pippen's wedding.
Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us.
"He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
He fired Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
"You know what, I quit."
He can suck it.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.
20 minutes to air.
But Liz said we were cutting the cat lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
Ouch.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think that I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What--what do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye--"
You mean this eye?
We have to talk.
I know Migs is with you.
He voluntarily came back to me.
"Bela, the only person who lost a memory is Migs."
Not you.
"Don't take advantage of him,"
Give him back to me.
"If you're thinking that I'm a mistress now,"
"If you're thinking that I'm a mistress now, you got it wrong."
You're probably forgetting...
I'm the first love...
He's happy with me.
"If he ever forgot you, it's not my fault."
Maybe that was destined to happen.
I'm begging you.
You already have everything.
Give him back to me.
You're wrong.
I waited for so long to be with him.
I can't give him back to you.
It's Migs' medicines.
I know you don't want me for Migs.
It's not that I don't like you for my brother.
I just really got used to him and Bela.
Just tell Mommy and Daddy that Migs and I need some space.
I'm begging you.
Take good care of Migs.
Your patient has fallen asleep from waiting for you!
I think she wants you to tell stories.
"Joy, April and I will just do the rounds."
-We'll go ahead!
-Bye!
I can see what's going on here.
You make my dad angry just like my granddad made him angry.
Why?
The situation with your dad and me is complicated.
What are you looking for in his old case files?
Just something that'll make him less angry.
"You know, I'm glad you're here."
"My dad's done so much by himself, you know?"
He really needs you.
"I'm glad he has a brother, and I'm..."
Glad I have an uncle.
Can you just... can you just promise me that you're... you're here to help him?
Gracie.
Of course.
"Yeah, I promise, okay?"
"Why don't you, uh, go make me one of those double-bacon BLT sandwiches, huh?"
Your grandfather told me all about them.
You got it.
Duval:
The name's Kevin Whitfield.
It's a junkie.
Overdose.
"Yeah, but this kid has no history of drug use."
He was going to college in the fall.
"Dad, just go through it with me."
See if I missed something.
These parents came to me.
"They said their son was better than this, and I believed them, Dad."
- I did.
- Tell me.
Please tell me you have something more than that.
His backpack.
You!
"Up, up, up!"
Questa mano!
Questa mano!
What the hell have we here?
-I'll see my sister alone.
-It concerns me too.
May I stay?
"How are you, honey?"
"You've met Merle, he was with me in Vegas."
-I saw him with you.
-Could I have a drink?
"Al, please get him a drink!"
We're going to Europe.
I'd like to book passage on The Queen.
Why don't you go to a travel agent?
We're getting married first.
"The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet, and you're getting married?"
You see your children on weekends.
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno for a theft you don't even know about.
You fly around the world with men who use you!
-You're not my father!
-So why come to me?
I need money.
"Connie, Connie, Connie..."
I want to be reasonable with you.
Why don't you stay with the family?
You can live on the estate with your kids.
You won't be deprived of anything.
I don't know this Merle.
I don't know what he does or what he lives on.
Tell him marriage is out of the question and you don't want to see him anymore.
"YEAH,YOU CAN THANK ME"
"BY KEEPING YOUR HEAD DOWN AND STAYING AWAY FROM WINDOWS,OKAY?"
"THERE ARE WAYS TO LESSEN THE RISK AN ARMED ESCORT,"
"TAKING AN UNPREDICTABLE ROUTE TO YOUR DESTINATION,"
HAVING BACKUP IN A TRAIL CAR.
"BUT ULTIMATELY,"
"AS LONG AS THE ASSASSIN KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE GOING,"
THEY HAVE THE UPPER HAND.
THE POINT IS THE THING WORKS.
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT'S NEVER LET ME DOWN.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP A GOOD ASSASSIN
FROM FINDING AN OPENING AND TAKING A SHOT.
THE BEST YOU CAN DO IS CONTROL WHERE THE BEST OPENING IS.
"AND SOMETIMES,THAT'S ENOUGH."
Michael:
DROP IT.
YOU SET ME UP.
BRAVO.
"PUT IT DOWN,EVELYN."
"HEY,I CAN STILL DO THIS."
DID I TELL YOU HOW MUCH THIS JOB PAYS?
"YOU COULD BUY SOMEPLACE DECENT TO LIVE,"
EVEN AT MIAMI PRICES.
PUT THE RIFLE DOWN.
HOW DID YOU KNOW I'D BE HERE?
I FIGURED YOU HAD A SOURCE IN THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
YOU KNEW DOUG WAS THINKING ABOUT TESTIFYING.
I COUNT SIX DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINTS
WITH A BETTER VIEW OF THAT ENTRANCE.
HOW DID YOU KNOW I'D BE AT THIS ONE?
ISTANBUL WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.
YOU LIKE ROOFTOPS OVER WINDOWS.
I
- I have felt bad about this for ten years.
"In fact, the only reason I came to this thing tonight was that I hoped you'd be here so I could tell you that."
Well.
Thank you.
That actually means a lot.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
I'm free!
And-and things really are going well?
"Oh, yeah, they really are."
I married just the greatest guy.
And now you get to meet him.
Perry!
"Sweetie, over here."
I'm so sorry I'm late.
"Oh, my God, the traffic was vicious."
"Kyle, this is my husband, Perry Pearl."
Hi.
"Sweetie, this is Kyle Lendo."
Kyle and I dated in high school.
"- Well, uh..."
"- Ooh, my competition."
"Back off, mister!"
"Shh, here she comes."
Surprise!
"Considering that I don't know any of you, yes, it is."
"Okay, so today happens to be the 20th anniversary of the first day of third grade, which means it's also the 20th anniversary of the day we met."
"So to commemorate the most important day of my life,"
I got as many people from our class as I could.
I got the actual cook from the school cafeteria to make us fish sticks and Sloppy Joes.
"For me, as a seven-year-old, my hero was my mum..."
"For me, as a seven-year-old, my hero was my mum... ..Detective Liz Cruickshank."
..Detective Liz Cruickshank.
"I don't want you anywhere near my house, Les."
"I don't want you anywhere near my house, Les."
We clear on that?
(SNIGGERS)
We clear on that?
(SNIGGERS)
You got something for me?
You got something for me?
"I do love it when you talk dirty to me, Lizzy."
"I do love it when you talk dirty to me, Lizzy."
"Morning, sir."
Just had a meeting...
D-d-d-d-d...
"Morning, sir."
Just had a meeting...
D-d-d-d-d...
"Sir, I just had a meeting with a fizz."
"Sir, I just had a meeting with a fizz."
There's an Italian going around town looking for a hitman.
There's an Italian going around town looking for a hitman.
Who's the target?
He doesn't know.
Who's the target?
He doesn't know.
That's what I call useless information.
That's what I call useless information.
He also said that the shooter has to be an Aussie.
He also said that the shooter has to be an Aussie.
"So, what are we talking about?"
"We had California plates, but our car broke down in New Mexico, so we had to get a new car."
"I told you it wouldn't make it, Ray."
But he wouldn't listen to me.
This one will make it.
Make it where?
Philadelphia.
My mother lives there.
She's sick.
"Ray is my boyfriend, so he got stuck with the job of taking me there."
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.
Uh...
"We weren't speeding or anything, were we?"
"No, ma'am."
What the fuck did you stop us for then?
I want you to get out of the car one at a time.
"You first, ma'am."
Get your hands up.
"Hey, calm down."
"You said ""Get out, you first, man,"" right?"
"Step around to the rear of the car, and keep your hands where I can see them."
"You said ""Get out of the car."" That's all I'm doing."
What's wrong with you?
You told us to get out.
"Ray, do what the man says."
"Stay where you are, ma'am."
Now you put your hands on the car.
Spread them out.
Now spread your legs.
"Okay, same thing."
Hands on the car.
Spread your legs.
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Now I'm feeling good.
"It's nerve-racking being here now though, and actually seeing, Iike where you're actually playing."
"Like, I sat here the other week watching Kanye West play."
And now we're here.
I just feel a bit nervous.
"AII right, fellas, Iet's start."
So first day of rehearsals.
They've done the same choreography the Iast two years.
Now I'm changing it.
"Heads, will!"
should we start?
"Louis, you're on that X."
was never really a fan of boy bands before One Direction.
I'm a massive boy band fan myself.
"Backstreet Boys, NSYNC."
"When people say, ""You're in a boy band""  I'm like, ""Yeah, I am, but I'm in a cool boy band."""
"So I'm like, ""Okay, whatevs."""
Right from the start we were always very v ocal  that we couldn't follow the boy band stereotypes.
"Choreographed dance routines, and everything's the same."
Here we go!
"Go, NiaII!"
Taking the crowd with you!
Love the stag.
Keep the stag.
"really good, Iike that."
Keep that in.
"paul, our choreographer gets bored, I think."
"NiaII, up that ramp."
"Harry, come on!"
It's a free-for-aII.
No.
It's all one fuzzy blur.
That's great.
That's perfect.
Okay.
I must have passed out after I reenlisted.
- What?
- I said I passed out.
- Why do you think I was lying here?
- You don't remember what you did.
You didn't have any idea what you were doing last night.
- How could you?
- But I did.
"Give me a little credit, Captain."
"I may be a rummy, but I'm no dummy."
The army provides you with a home and a career.
This from the man who built himself wings... and tried to flap his way back to the States?
Now the army's my best friend.
"I may get shot in the stomach, but I won't get stabbed in the back... not the way I did by that wife-stealer Gus Nagy."
Oh.
"So, you mean..."
You mean Laverne and Gus...
"[Bawling] Oh, Laverne!"
Klinger.
Klinger.
"Klinger, come here."
Get-Get up.
Look-Look.
You're gonna get over Laverne in a little while... but that's no reason to throw away the best years of your life.
- I haven't.
- What do you mean?
"Well, it's not official until I raise my right hand and Col. Potter swears me in."
- I'm Justin.
- Ding dong.
- Felix's brother.
- Hi.
Sorry about the mud.
"- Hi, I'm Gemma."
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Chris.
"All right, mate."
"Right, um..."
"To explain, there's been a bit of a cock-up."
"Uh, Felix was due back yesterday, but he ended up getting stuck abroad."
"- In Chile, of all places."
- Chile?
"Y-Yes, I know, it's bizarre."
"Uh, he's been volunteering on a hospital project, having a fantastic time, by all accounts"
"The birthday bash was meant to be a surprise, and... well, then, his flight got cancelled."
"I've been ringing around putting people off, but I haven't done a very good job of it evidently."
"So, there's no party?"
I'm really sorry.
"But look, there-there's plenty to drink, plenty to eat, um, places to crash."
"Youre more than welcome to hang out here tonight, in fact I hope that you will."
I know that Felix would approve.
"Come on, uh, let's do this."
"Uh, Luke, it is, uh, Luke, right?"
"Yeah, that's right."
Grand.
"Grab six glasses, my friend."
I'm cracking open the bubbly.
"Let's have a party, then."
- He is horny.
- He's okay.
"I wanna tell how I came to know Mr. Catchings, the man I killed."
I wanna tell this so my son will know.
Mr. Catchings was the overseer on the cotton plantation in Georgia...
... wherel slaved with my wife and children...
... 1 9 yearsago.
I don't need to say how bad life was to a slave.
We worked from sunup to dark.
We got whip.
We got sold.
We ain't had no hope.
But this is what I need my son to know about what I did.
When our little boy was 7 year old...
... hismama...
... wasforcedintocarnalrelations with Mr. Catchings.
What Mr. Catchings told her was that if she didn't...
... he'dselltheboy awayfrom us.
Seven years old.
He'd sell him away from his mama and daddy.
My wife...
... couldn'tbearthethoughtofthat.
So she went to his bed.
When she found out she was in a family way...
... shewasso afraid it would be that man's baby.
She lost her mind.
Walked into the river.
Drowned herself.
I would have killed Mr. Catchings then.
But me and the children was loaded on wagon in chains...
"... thatsameday,soldtoAlabama."
It took a lot of spirit out of me.
And I hope my son understands why now.
So you see...
"Paul, can I borrow you?"
I need you to check something for me.
"Do you know how many wives and girlfriends we've had sat across from us, insisting they were completely in the dark?"
You're in this up to your neck.
"We're watching all the ports, so they have nowhere to go."
I don't know where they are.
"That's bollocks, and you know it."
"- Sarge, can I...?"
"- Tennison, we've got this."
No.
Go on.
"If you want to help David, you need to tell us where he is."
Did David tell you about Julie-Ann?
She was 17.
"Someone strangled her and dumped her with the rubbish, like she didn't matter."
Where was he on the evening of Sunday 13th May?
- I don't know.
- It was raining that night.
"Did he come home, soaked to the skin?"
He was home!
How's he been acting since?
You're his mum.
Mums always know when something's not right.
I found... a photo of them both.
Him and Julie-Ann.
"She mattered to David, didn't she?"
Did he tell you about her?
Did you know she was pregnant?
- Was the child David's?
- God...
God.
Where can we find him?
I want Danny to spend more time with my son.
He made plans with him and now he's trying to pull out.
"And guys ""pulling out"" is why I have a kid in my first place."
"Okay, fine, I'll do it."
But it's not fair.
You asked me right in the middle of sex.
"I was like... ""Ah, ah, ah... oh, okay, I'll take your son to Dave  Busters."
"Okay, quick announcement."
It's a new year and I wanted to shake things up a little bit.
So I decided to dye my hair red
- But then I chickened out.
"- Thank God, because red hair is the worst."
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
Ta-da!
You like it?
I love it.
I love it.
It is beautiful.
It is great.
Like a bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
It's like your whole head's on fire!
"Love you, fire head!"
Now all we have to do is fill in the gaps.
I'm buying it.
Down payment.
"Call it rent, call it what you like, but I am not leaving London."
- Hmm!
- Sorry.
Bad night.
"Buckley, Parfitt, meeting now."
"Oh, man."
"I freaked out and thought I was gonna have to get my tendon resoldered, but it didn't happen."
- You can't fool around with that stuff.
- No.
Didn't mean to.
- I think this was a reshoot day.
- No.
Didn't we...?
Didn't we reshoot the...?
"Oh, it's a different moment in the van."
It's when I'm looking out the window at Tris on the car.
"- Yeah, that was a reshoot."
- That was a reshoot.
Because I remember...
Remember Raf and I were giving each other a hard time this day.
Do you remember?
It was the reshoots and I was a little scared.
"I was like, ""Oh, my gosh."
"He's really getting angry."" I think I was making fun of his accent."
That's the way to get him mad.
Michael would make fun of Raf.
He'd be like:
"""Oh, later on, Rafi Gavron."""
Rafi's from London.
"You can't tell by the movie, but he's English."
"Oh, and Ari this is the best deli."
Remember?
- I wasn't in this scene.
I came to visit.
"- Yeah, but you came to visit us."
"We got Tony, our script supervisor, a cake because it was his birthday."
Of course.
"Andjunk, dope!"
And they leave the gambling to last.
I want to run my family without you on my back.
I want those Rosatos dead!
-No.
-Morte.
I have business that's important with Hyman Roth.
I don't want it disturbed.
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew before your own blood.
You know my father did business with Hyman Roth.
He respected him.
"Your father did business with Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth, but he never trusted Hyman Roth or his Sicilian messenger boy, Johnny Ola."
You'll have to excuse me.
"I'm tired, and I'm a little drunk!"
"I want everybody here to know, there's not going to be no trouble from me!"
Don Corleone.
"Cicci, the door..."
You want him to leave now?
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.
The old man had too much wine.
It's late.
How's the baby?
-Sleeping inside me.
-Does it feel like a boy?
"Yes, it does, Michael."
Kay?
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.
"It couldn't be helped, though."
It made me think of what you once told me.
""" In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. """
Yeah.
- Change your mind?
- Enough of this.
"You want to deal, you deal with me."
You leave Lucy out of it.
Done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
You see?
I can be reasonable.
"Of course, I still have a job to do, and the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or-"
I know.
Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
So you call me when you want it to stop.
"She's not leaving town, is she?"
That'd be a no.
"If she knows all this about you, she'll probably come here."
She won't play this out on my turf.
She'll keep the pressure on until she gets an opening.
I
- I can't believe this.
"I'm a C.P.A., for Christ's sake."
C.P.A. brought down Al Capone.There's a reason why the feds want you to testify.
I say we hunt her down.
Ammunition's cheap.
"Fi, if we go out there without a plan, we're exposed."
She's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
She can come after me.
I'm ready.
Yeah?
- What about Sam?
"- I'm game, Mike."

"Um, did you just take a screen grab?"
No!
Why would I take a screen grab of you?
I got the real thing.
Come on.
Okay.
Don't get lube all over your phone.
"Hike your ass up, please?"
God damn.
"Sexy, yes."
Just a little bit more.
Arch your back.
Fuck.
Damn!
Tom and Gisele floating on a 300-footer in Saint-Tropez.
"Man, that's a long-ass way from that raft we used to float on at Jim McMahon's aboveground pool."
Where you see that?
Where I see everything... 'Gram.
You follow Tom Brady?
Just so I don't look like a creep following his wife.
"Plus, he only posts pictures of him practicing and wearing them ugly-ass Uggs."
"Wait, I can't believe they let your old ass on the 'Gram, Dennis."
"Motherfucker, there's no age limit looking at fine-ass women."
Is this you with all the Pam Grier pics?
That's my Woman Crush Wednesday every day.
Because she ain't no Ashley Graham.
"And I hate to break it to you, but she ain't looking like this anymore."
"Hey, careful, boy."
That's my girl.
"And FYI, she's still fine as fuck, all right?"
- Fine...
Only place I didn't try was the men's room.
- You try Munch's cell?
- Yeah.
No answer.
"You know, Dr. Swan had to make sure Kyle and the donor were okay."
Maybe there's a problem.
Come on.
What the hell is going on here?
"Casey, take Ms. Solwey out to the car."
Leave her out of this!
We didn't drag her into this.
"John, relax."
Relax.
Why'd you bring her here?
Amy's next on the transplant list.
That kidney would've been hers anyway.
"You're doing what we're trying to stop, John."
That kidney was bought and sold.
So let's just throw it away.
She dies.
I know that you care about her.
But you can't do this.
- If that was your son in there...
- It's not my son in there.
We're not talking about my son.
"When you collar James McGovern, you tell him your son's life is worth more than Kyle's."
"I gotta collar you, John."
You arranged this.
Novak saw you here.
You don't think Swan gonna give you up to get himself a better deal?
Why would I do that?
Did he ask you to put that kidney in Amy Solwey?
"-That's right, you don't."
You could have torn him apart.
So why didn't you?
"Because I don't wanna be the freak for once, Dean."
I wanna be normal.
"So taking a beating, that's normal?"
Any word from Dad?
[CELL PHONE BEEPS]
He called this morning.
"He said he's going to be another week, at least."
We weren't supposed to be here this long.
At least you've got Amanda.
She's cool.

I don't do parents.

"Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?"
"Um, I'll wait for you outside."
"Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it."
"Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam."
"You know this assignment was nonfiction, right?"
"Yes, Mr. Wyatt."
"So you and your family killed a werewolf last summer, huh?"
"Why would you write something like this, Sam?"
It doesn't matter.
"As soon as my dad gets back, we're leaving."
-So you can flunk me if you want to.
-I'm not flunking you.
I'm giving you an A.
Aside from the werewolf is that really how you describe your family?
Yeah.
Average?
And speed and endurance of a questionable nature.
Shoot!
"Now there's no way this specimen could complete, let alone compete in, the Iron Man competition... unless..."
Let me guess.
"Well, unless what?"
"Your boy gets a first-class, knowledgeable, certified trainer to guide him to a winning body."
"Yeah, but where do I get that?"
"I mean, a dude like that's gotta cost big bucks."
"Not a dude, T.C."
"A ""dudette."" Am I right, Barbara?"
"Modestly, yes."

"And in return for my services, Magnum continues to search for Roger... and then runs the Iron Man to pay his debts to you."
Deal?
You got it.
No!
And a one and a two... and a three and a four.
And a one and a two... and a three and a four.
And breathe.
And a one and a two and a breathe.
"Good morning, Barbara."
Very subtle.
You're wasting your time.
I don't want to play.
"Oh, now, Magnum."
"Now, the secret here, you see, is knees to chest."
Knees to chest.
Try it.
Now...
"I am heading for a swim, and when I get back, Barbara..."
I can't wait to dive in and find out all about you.
Mer looks weird.
Does she look weird to you?
She looks like she's gonna pee her pants.
"Oh, crap."
I made her hydrate.
Meeting the family always blows.
I'd never make you do that.
"Me, either."
One of the many perks of dating a dead guy.
Who's that lady touching Meredith?
Derek's mom.
"Oh, that's why she looks so weird."
"She does not look weird, okay?"
I've got it under control.
Mer is doing... great.
Looks like she's gonna pee.
"Dr. Yang, you mind checking on some of my post-ops?"
ER is swamped with traumas.
"Also, would you like to go on a date with me?"
I'm sorry?
A date.
"You said not to play hot and cold with you, so, um, I'll pick you up around 8:00?"
"Oh, and make sure mr."
Kenner in room 2-2-1-2 gets that enema.
He's been holding on to it for days.
Okay.
'Cause that wasn't weird.
"See, another perk of dating a dead guy."
No awkward dates.
"2-to-1, but who's counting?"
Why can't I have that nice man's organs?
"You can see that, right?"
"Yeah, I mean, you're obviously upset about what happened."
"I am upset, Luke."
I'm very upset.
I don't have to play these games.
Of course not.
This is fucking fucked up.
"It's what you said, Chris."

What are you trying to say?
- That I sent the postcard?
"- Well, I know I didn't send it."
"You bitch, you're gonna set me up, aren't you?"
- You're gonna tell him about the fight.
"- Calm down, Chris."
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- Chris!
Shut the hell up.
That arsehole is going to get us killed!
He says he didn't send it.
"He said, ""Truth or Dare, bitch."""
Did you?
It's not a secret.
Other people heard.
They could've passed it on.
"Yeah, but you're the one that said it."
So what if I said it?
Why the fuck would I write on a postcard for Christ's sake?
"- It's because I chucked you, isn't it?"
- What?
I said it was 'cause of the way you treated Felix.
I said that was why I was dumping you.
"She's a fraud, Brian."
A fraud!
She didn't write any of her songs.

And here Honza.

- It's him.
Above the pigsty?
Is there no bedroom - er some tiny room?
There isn't.
"All right, I'm used to hardship on my travels."
"Go and turn the hay, up by the wood."
I'll feed Terry and then I'll help you.
"There's a rake, the meadow above the chapel."
He never killed himself working!
"Good, he's here, so we can keep an eye on him."
And we'll pay him back for his trouble.
We'll scare him out of his wits.
"If he doesn't behave, just call us!"
"What are you up to, Honza?"
You're slow!
Would you call me Johann?
You already have a...er - the pig Honza.
"As you like, Johann."
I'm glad I came at the right time.

"Here's part of it, I'd add this."
"Ah, you've got it pinned already!"
Won't you try it on?
No one told me you were Australian.
Is that a problem?
Only if being horny as hell is a problem.
"Uh, okay, well, Lizzie has not been herself."
She's not moving very much and she's getting night sweats.
Just take a look at her.
Oh!
What is it?
I hate it!
Lizzie!
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
Lizzie is a lizard!
"I love snakes, but I absolutely hate lizards."
Lizards are a myth.
And she's been very weak.
She hasn't been moving very much lately.
"Ugh, you should have gotten a snake."
They wriggle all over the place.
Do you think I should enter more crickets into her diet?
"Oh, look, you're clearly flipping out about this."
I need to talk to him on his own.
Is there a master bedroom we could go to?
"Uh, the kitchen's right over here."
"Yeah, we could go to the kitchen."
"No, you stay here, mind the leg snake!"
"I could tell Trevor had a thing for me, plus, I needed to tell him what I was gonna do."
Listen.
Your snake's clearly gonna die unless I do surgery on it.
I don't find you attractive.
You'll come 'round.
"- No, I won't."
This is hard.
It doesn't have to be.
I just think the most important thing for you is going to be let him do the talking.
Right.
"Okay, you're right."
I got it.
I got it this time.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me.
That was better.
I am not cut out for this one-night stand thing.
It's not for everybody.
"I mean, I know it seems silly to you, Matthew, but I just wish somebody would notice me."
"Not as a mom or as a carpool captain, but as a woman."
Do you know how long it took me to do this to my hair?
A minute?
No.
"A long, long time."
"God, this is impossible."
"Come on, let's get out of here."
I'm never going to meet anybody in a grocery store.
"You met someone, didn't you?"
"Yeah, we had a moment over by the goat milk."
I think she's into me.
I'll see you at home.
Are you done with that cart?
"Hey, knock yourself out."
Wow.
"I don't want to embarrass you, but your hair is really pretty."
It must take you a long time to make it do that.
You're in a good mood.
"You did a good job on the building, son."
Mickey:
You know the tournament?
You know the bowling tournament in Vegas?
Not that again.
It's an investment.
No.
"It's not an investment, it's a $5,000 vacation."
It's for the tournament.
"It costs 3,000 to enter,"
I've got to have some money to fly out there-- for food and a hotel.
It's not like on five Gs I'm gonna be able to get fancy.
"You know, this bowling thing of yours... it's making you look like a sucker."
What kills me is... there's no one even trying to talk you into it.
It's just you.
"Excuse me, excuse me."
"Look, here."
Somebody take your boy-- take your son and gone.
- Take your father and him gone.
- Carlos:
What?
!
- What happened?
- Some boys took your father-- and I don't know where he went.
Coño!
"Tito, take care of the register, I'll be right back."
It's not my fault.
I don't know where he is.
"""Santa María, Madre de Dios... ruega por nosotros, pecadores..."""
- You're funny.
I swear you think about Mom more now than when she was alive.
She understands.
"That's surprising, isn't it?"
Considering all the money he makes.
"I never question good fortune, Lieutenant."
All I know is that getting along with Ward Fowler is gonna be a lot easier from now on.
What about a drink?
That's amazing how she kept it from you.
Well she did.
I just found out about it.
"Yes, sir, I know."
Your accountant told me.
Oh.
"Well, good."
"Then that's it, huh?"
"Yes, sir, that's it."
"Oh, there's one more thing, sir."
Mr. Hart is in Rome.
He's gonna be back in his hotel room in a little while.
"Before I talk to him, were you really playing chess the other night?"
"Lieutenant, let's get it straight right now."
I was not with Leo Hart the other night.
"But I wasrt busy killing my wife, either."
(BUZZER SOUNDING)
"Yes, Mr. Daley?"
SID:
"Molly, would you come in for a minute?"
I need your help.
"Molly, would you please tell Lieutenant Columbo where I was on Thursday evening, the night my wife was killed?"
The truth.
"Mr. Daley was with me, Lieutenant."
We left the office together and we were together in my apartment until the next morning.
It's the truth.
"Yes, madam."
Thank you.
You can finish early.
"No, I'll stay to the end."
You're a trooper.
It's my last day.
What will you do in Korea?
I want to open a store with my mother.
- With your mother?
- Yes.
Mom endured a lot of hardships for me.
Dad died in a car accident when I was only two.
"After that, Mom raised me all by herself."
She sold clothes at a market until the morning.
It was tough on her.
I'm going home to return the favor.
How old is she?
57 years old.
"If my mom was alive, she'd be the same age."
She passed away?
"Two years ago, breast cancer."
"I was a troublemaker, a constant headache for her."
Kept getting mixed up with the police.
Mom apologized for me every time.
Now I feel horrible about it.
"Maybe I'm not one to talk, but take care of your mother."
I will.
"Say, Kubota San, did you come up with the name Juicy Fruits?"
"There was a band named Juicy Fruits, and I liked the vocalist, Ilia."
So that's where my name comes from.
"Hello, thank you for calling Juicy Fruits."
We'll miss you.
Thanks for everything.
Where's the server?
It's the Isis foundation.
It's 3rd and Broadway.
It's a 10-minute drive.
I'll come back for you when I'm done.
You're really bleeding.
I guess... trying to take on one of Lex Luthor's fembots doesn't make me the smartest icicle in the freezer.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get us out of here.
Is anyone out there?
!
Is anyone in there?
!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
!
- Jimmy and Lois here?
"- Not yet, but Jimmy's message said he already sent the files, I was about to get started."
I got a message that Lionel left for me in his vault.
I think I know why he was killed.
He was trying to protect me.
Lionel did say something terrible was coming.
There's something on earth that can be used to control me.
Control you?
"As in ""do my bidding,"" like some sort of puppet?"
What could possibly pull your strings?
I don't know.
"But whatever it is, it takes two keys to unlock."
"When I went back to the Daily Planet tonight, there was a key in my desk."
Lionel left it there for you.
Where is it?
Lex took it.
Was she pregnant?
Why else?
For fun?
"The very day they caught them, Papa sent her to Paris."
And two months later we all left Algeria-.
Things were bad enough for the Jews as it was.
But Maurice didn't give up.
He followed her to Paris.
Finally they decided to send her to Israel because he couldn't go there.
She went to the kibbutz where she met your father.
And they never saw each other again?
- I don't know.
- When she came to visit.
"She came to rest and see me, that's all I know."
"And this Maurice, where is he?"
Did you know all this?
Not until two hours ago.
So why did you come here?
To ask you to come home.
Now that I've heard things that your mother never told me
"I'm begging you, come home."
Live your lives.
"Honor your mother, she didn't want us to know."
- Are you going home?
- What do you care?
"Rosa, will you see me out?"
Regards to Ricky.
I say we go home.
You can go.
I'm not leaving until we find this Maurice guy.
You believe that old drunk's bullshit?
"One thing doesn't make sense, Aunt Rosa."
"Guys, this is too much."
What's too much?
Let's just get it together and chill out a little.
"Excuse me, I don't mean to disturb you."
My name's Dave.
Hi.
Ronnie.
Ronnie.
That's a great name.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Do you have a cell phone I could use?
Why?
Someone's got to call God and let him know one of his angels is missing.
"Wow, that is the worst line I've ever heard."
"Well, what do you want from me?"
I've been out of the game for a while.
I've been slumming it with a really hot redhead.
Now you're getting closer.
"Dave, if you're here to be an olive branch for Jason,"
I am not gonna talk about it tonight.
"I'm not here to talk about anything,"
I just want to see my wife.
Let's go.
I can't just leave these two.
I think they'll survive.
We sure will.
They are so lucky.
Now this next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"Everybody, up!"
"Let's keep this party going, y'all!"
"Maybe we ought to wait by the exit, so when people come out, you know..."
- Are my little chickies still hungry?
- Yes.
Peep.
"Okay, worm check."
Open up.
Are there anyworms left in there?
You live next door to me.
"- No, I don't."
- I saw you moving in.
You have a white dad and a big brother.
Your whole family lives in one ofthose little apartments?
Do you all have to sleep in the same bed?
My mom lives somewhere else.
You should get a Hide-a-bed.
During the day it's a couch... but at night it folds out into a comfortable queen-sized bed.
You want to be a little bird and get a littleworm?
Just lie down and peep.
"Peep, peep, peep."
Are you following us?
"Yeah, quit following us, Peter Swersey!"
"If you don't stop following us, I'm gonna scream!"
"Ifyou take another step towards me, I'm going to kickyou in the throat!"
"Hey, come here."
Ask her if she likes bologna.
What are you putting?
"I asked herwhat kind of ""bossom"" she had."
- It's probably a man.
- Why is it a man?
'Cause everyone just makes stuff up on these things.
It's probably a man pretending to be a woman.
So picture a fat guy with a little wiener.
"- What's a ""bossom""?"
I think it's not a good idea.
-What do you mean?
-Maybe I call you.
But I don't think so.
-You didn't like it?
-I like it very much.
"But, Tony, come on."
"You're a nice guy, but I got my own problems."
I don't want all the time prop you up.
"What, are you fucking kidding me?"
-What you doing?
-I didn't expect you so soon.
Tell my uncle I'll talk to him later.
Lowe is not a 98-99 mile an hour guy.
Driven out to deep left field!
"Giving chase is Henderson, on the run!"
See ya!
An opposite-field home run....
-There ain't no bear back there.
-Fellas!
"Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to meet a bear."
What would you do if you did meet him?
That bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop.
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.
Somebody's going to get something they ain't expecting.
Have a bite.
"Look out, here he comes!"
Where's Furio?
"He couldn't get a flight out of Rome, so I'm driving again today."
"Come on in, he'II be right down."
Yeah?
Let's just hope this lady coming up the stairs now feels the same way about that as you do.
I felt good about this guy as soon as I saw him.
LISA:
"Me, too."
( knock on door )
Answer it.
Come on.
"Out of the way, Dr Penzler."
Let me see her.
Are you the one who asked for the FBI?
( scoffs ) Yeah.
I'm here.
You can talk to me.
Did anyone tell you what this was all about?
Man in therapist's office holding ten hostages demands FBI agent.
I asked for someone from the FBI extraterrestrial project.
Someone who knows about aliens.
"You mean, like on X-Fiies?"
I'm the one you want.
RAY:
Okay.
Let me bring you up to speed on our situation here.
I shot him.
And he's gonna die if he doesn't get medical attention.
That's one.
"After that, if I don't get what I ask for, these people, they're just fish in a barrel to me, you understand that?"
"That was the lady in the park, the one who tried to grab me."
RAY:
You understand?
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to go public.
"Sir, I didn't came to kill anyone, Sir my Boss Mr. Pipot... he told me to meet you, If you want you can ask to Mr. Pipot."
Give me the numbers of Pipots.
Fax number or Phone number?
Phones!
Landline or mobile?
"Mobiles, India or Singapore?"
Where is your Boss?
"He is in London,"
Then why did you say Singapore?
"I was afraid, Leave me, I'm giving you."
0044786679.
"It's ringing, It's ringing, He's will pick up."
"Sir, my boss is an educated man from Oxford University, I'm his special man"
He'll pick up.
"It's time difference, it's morning and he's busy in the mornings."
Hello!
Hello!
Sir!
It's Laxminarayan.
Who Laxmi?
"Sir, Laxminarayan, your Laxminarayan."
"You fool, have you done, Sir, there's a problem."
That's why I want to talk to you.
"Laxminarayan, you blood idiot, I don't want any excuses."
"I want results, you stupid, nonsense, you bloody ass hole call me when you finish your work."
"Otherwise I'll shoot you, Idiot."
I know you love me.
"I think it's disconnect, International Calls"
"Papa, I told you before, Kill him."
Thank you Papa!
Sir!
What you've done?
I forgot...the Pacific.
"- No other ocean has so many colors.É"""
"- And look, you can see where the blues change."
"Black for you, white for you, black and white for you."
One's fine.
"So, which route should we take back?"
The pretty or the fast?
Fast!
Pretty.
"I work for my dad, and I don't have much time for a social life."
"But the other day,"
I met a guy named Scott who owns this bar.
I'm not here to flirt.
What's gonna happen next?
You gonna ask me to dinner?
"No, I..."
It's all right.
I always get hit on when I wear this T-shirt.
- Think my eyes are up here.
- I wa...
I-I...
"For the record, I wasn't looking."
And the only reason I was in his bar is because our biggest client wants to buy it from him.
"So, I took Scott to dinner, but just to talk business."
"Okay, we got a little distracted."
"Meanwhile, there's this other guy from the office,"
Stephen.
That's him.
My dad would love it if I were with him.
"I mean, Stephen's a nice guy, but there's not a lot of passion between us."
Back to Scott.
"Oh, you'll be the prettiest mouse at the ball."
"What do you mean, mouse?"
"Uh, nothing."
Sounds like Elka's ready to go.
- Do you need a lift?
"- No, no, no."
We're gonna wait for Joy.
You go ahead without us.
So the newly beautiful mouse headed off to the ball.
It's almost too easy.
"Now, what's our ending?"
We'll find out at the ball.
The Earl is there.
"The two sisters will vie for him, and then whatever happens, that's the ending to our book."
What?
No.
"No, no, no, no."
You can't let a little thing like a scooter and an eye patch stop you.
How about this?
I knocked my crown out trying to open my eye drops bottle.
You cannot give up.
This would be a terrible ending.
Where would Cinderella be if she'd stayed home and felt sorry for herself when her sister was off having fun at the ball?
Look at me.
I'm hardly Cinderella.
"Victoria, she's right."
Jill is the one that got beautiful.
"Oh, that's true."
You've had your time.
Jill's Cinderella now.
Shut up!
"I'm Cinderella, and I'm going to the ball."
"But... whether I find one or not, you bury the German girl tomorrow."
"You know, he does have a point there, Sam."
"Oh, come on, Al."
I didn't leap in here just to bury Hilla.
"Well, there's nothing else that figures--"
Except-
"- Except if she was murdered, and the killer was never caught."
"Uh, well, look, if the chief finds the gun in the lake--"
He won't.
And-
"- And even if he does, it just means that the killer threw the gun in the water."
"Boy, you won't give up, will ya?"
Not when I feel I'm right.
All right.
Say you're right.
We find the gun-- even find someone to trace it to.
What does that prove?
You have no bullet to match it to.
I know.
"I know, Al."
It just doesn't make any sense to me.
"I mean, where's the bullet?"
"Talkin' to the stiffs again, Melvin?"
- Excuse me?
- That's the great thing about a stiff.
"They don't talk back, but, boy, can they listen."
[ Al ] Uh-oh.
"Uh, Sam, if-- if she's gonna do what..."
"I think she's gonna do, uh,"
I'm out of here.
"You okay, Melvin?"
Yeah.
"God, that's terrifying."
I know.
Manny ditched us last night to go drinking.
"He thinks I don't know, but I know."
He smelled like a sweaty peppermint.
I saw the pictures that he texted Luke from the strip club.
Is that where Javier took him?
Oh.
You did not know that.
I'm sorry.
But it... it looked like one of the classier establishments.
"The girl that was sitting on Manny's lap had on a really cute top, at... at least in the first picture."
"The one time that I thought that he was going to be a good father, and he teaches Manny how to be a dog!"
I'm gonna kill him!
"Hey, look at me!"
I'm about to talk to a stranger!
(exhales sharply)
(slow rock music plays)
"Oh, yes."
This is it.
This is the one.
Ugh.
It wasn't this depressing last night.
The lunch scene in a strip joint is like a refugee camp with less hope.
Excuse me.
"Uh, my friend left some personal belongings here last night."
Anything left behind...
- goes in the lost and found.
- There we go.
Thank you.
"There's a jacket... glasses... hairpiece, I hope..."
- What about my stuff?
You're not sure.
"I'm sure, Lena."
I know.
I feel them.
"- Oh, Saul."
- We close the shop today.
I don't know how he keeps pullin' that mess off.
"- Yeah, well, neither does he."
- Hm?
"It's all in the subconscious, TC."
- Haven't you heard of body language?
- Body language?
The body can tell you all kinds of stuff without you even knowing.
"You don't believe me, huh?"
You see the way he's lowering' his head?
"The body's saying he's vulnerable, and the ladies love it."
Watch.
"Any second now, she'll throw her arms around his neck and bury her head right in his chest."
Huh!
"Well, for a guy that don't know what he's doin', he sure do it good."
Wuh-oh.
"Hey, she got a little body language of her own."
"Yeah, well, that's obvious."
"- Thanks for the coffee, Rick."
- OK.
"Take care, TC."
"Shouldn't have lowered your head, boy."
Shouldn't have lowered my head?
"Why is it when I find out what people hire me to find out, they take it out on me?"
"I don't know but, here, put some ice on it."
That's very funny.
"Hey, Saul."
Maybe that's what you're tryin' to do with me.
"What are you gonna do, Freddy?"
You gonna arrest the whole town?
"You goin' to New York to take ""paint by number"" cop lessons?"
"You know, Ray likes you."
That don't mean I'm gonna let you fuck him over.
"Ray Donlan gave you this job, Freddy."
You forgot that?
We made your sorry ass!
So now you can do us a favor.
You could tell us... where Superboy is.
"If I knew where he was, he'd be in the city already."
"You're gonna be hurtin', Freddy."
"You're not gonna know when, you're not gonna know where."
You're gonna be hurtin'.
You mark my words.
I'm watchin' you!
Hey.
- You got your check.
- Yep.
"Thanks to you, Freddy."
Filing out those forms in such a timely fashion.
You with Liz?
Where you goin'?
I don't know.
"My leave came, so I thought I'd look around for a new reality."
You know?
"Anyway, I'm sure you could use your privacy, Freddy."
"No, no."
"Look all you want, Freddy."
You're not gonna find anything.
I took care of it.
Good.
- We should all keep in touch.
- Definitely.
"Mark, pay me more attention."
Mark!
This is the last time that you see me.
I wanna go to Marosi.
Are you out of your mind?
I want to look him in the eye and I just wanna ask him some questions.
I really dont't think that's a good idea.
He said that he killed Jesse.
So I just wanna meet him.
And either you gonna help me out or I'm gonna have to sort this myself.
"Hello, Mr. Wells."
I want to talk about my brother.
I killed him.
"I chose him,"
I took him and I killed him.
"Three acts, simple."
I don't believe you.
"They found the bodies of the other 4 boys that you killed, but not my brother."
Why not?
I burnt it.
Why would you do that?
Because he was younger.
And what I did to him... was disgusting.
I like young boys.
And I liked Jesse.
A lot.
You're already facing life for the other 4 boys that you killed.
"So you took the rep for Jesse in order to secure yourself privileges in prison, didn't you?"
Get yourself back on the front pages.
I'll just take it between us as who gets who first.
"That's how it's gonna be, then."
There won't be no more cows stolen.
"Not from the Wood River Cattle Company... the Bar-Three Cattle Company, or the Haley Cattle Company."
Consider that my last word on the matter.
"Come on, boys, let's have an auction."
"You know, I got a weird feeling."
"Yo, me too."
We're being followed.
Look!
Tell them what you saw here.
"That you, Horn?"
You coming in here after me?
Giddap!
Come on.
Get them up there.
Hang in there.
Come on.
"Let him stop first, then give him slack."
Hitch him up.
Hang in there.
Ease up on him there.
You got him.
"Yeah, he's a good horse."
You go ahead... ride him around a little bit and tire him out.
Keep his head up.
"If you keep his head up, he ain't gonna buck."
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.
"All right, you go ahead and take the rough off of him."
I'll come back after he's quieted down and put a handle on him.
What'll I do if I get into a real storm with this horse?
- THANK YOU.
OH I DON'T THINK IT'S BLACKMAIL.
ANGELA JUST DOES WHAT I ASK HER TO DO
SO I WON'T TELL EVERYONE
THAT SHE'S CHEATING ON ANDY WITH DWIGHT.
"I THINK FOR IT TO BE BLACKMAIL,"
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A FORMAL LETTER.
"AH,YOU BROUGHT IN YOUR DOLL COLLECTION."
"THESE ARE NOT DOLLS,JIM."
"THESE ARE COMMODITIES, THE SAME AS GOLD OR OIL."

"THIS YEAR IT'S A DOLL-- HALF GIRL,HALF UNICORN."
"CATCH PHRASE: ""MY HORN CAN PIERCE THE SKY."""
PATHETIC.
I BOUGHT OUT EVERY STORE IN THE AREA OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
How dumb am I?
Look for the signs.
"Now that you're awake to this, you're gonna start seeing them everywhere."
"Actually,you think you're gonna see them everywhere, so don't drive yourself more crazy."
Just look for the really obvious ones.
Hmm?
Really?
Stupid.

"Right on,man."
That was for Bella.
So?
JOHN:
"So, do we talk to the mother?"
What if she tips off Lila?
She wouldn't do that.
"She wouldn't do that, not Lila."
Have you heard from Lila?
"No, I haven't, not since last summer."
"Sometime around June, July."
"Mr. Dixon, you know Lila, you know she wouldn't do what they're saying she did."
"They must have kidnapped her, brainwashed her."
"Miss Walker, some of the best policemen in this country are after Lila and those other two fellas."
"Now, they're going to catch them too."
It will go a lot better for Lila if she turns herself in.
"Chief Dixon is right, ma'am."
"I can't make any promises, but if your daughter cooperates with us, that will be taken into account later."
I haven't heard from her.
"But if I do, I'll tell her what you said."
"Ronnie, you heard from your sister?"
"No, sir."
Would you tell us if you had?
"Yes, sir."
Grandma...
I'm hungry.
MRS. WALKER:
"Byron, don't bother us now, honey."
JOHN:
Who's that?
That's Lila's boy.
Didn't you know Lila had a boy?
And he's a pretty boy too.
Thanks for your time.

There's your mother right now.
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.
You've ruined the surprise!

Everyone went to so much effortNto keep the secret.

It's why they've all come.NThis is your engagement party.
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.NWhen you say yes...
But I don't knowNif I want to marry Hamish.

I told you I needed a rush on those prints.
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.
"And if she is, I'd hate to see your backlog cost her her life."
–You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
–You were gone for an hour.
Jesus!
She's all over my ass about this Tio connection.
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.
–Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
–You are lying to her.
"–What, are you trying to be a wiseass?"
"–No, I'm just..."
Just shut the hell up!
–Christ!
–Where are we headed?
I got things to do.
I gave you guys to Aceveda for the day.
–What?
"–Apparently, a group of male hustlers... is hangin' out on the same block as Aceveda's campaign headquarters."
He's setting up a sting operation.
You think?
That's it.

So who was I?
You were the voice in my head.
Like Emile Sayles is...
Like Emile Sayles is a voice in Liz Kenyon's head.
Only she wants him out.
That's what she told me.
"Now, when you used to hear my voice, where were we?"
Where we were putting in the work.
Backyard.
You making me work the heavy bag.
So when she thinks of him is where they put in the hours.
He started working with her in middle school.
So she wants him out.
Maybe she takes him back to where he climbed in.
I've got agents covering 100 possible targets up and down the west coast.
I can't drag away assets because you and I are working out some family crap.
"Well, you know, I thought we were catching Kevin Whitfield's killer."

[Indistinct conversations]
Can you tell me... why are we here?
I don't want you anymore.
It's been long enough.
I'm leaving you here.
You think you brought me here?

I brought you!
I couId tell you a thing or two myself.
Who supports us?
What about after this experiment?
Who will work?
Me.
"You think I don,t support us?"

"I can,t even fart without being graded!"

"That,s all you,re good for."
Here come the insults!
",Fat ass, and all that."
"Listen, I,ve got things to say, and I mean it."
"I,ve about had it with this experiment!"
"I,m fed up living with you."
"- Why,d you come then?"
I never forced you!
You did!
I was supposed to go to Canada.
Who wanted to do this?
Who stopped me from going to Canada?
Who stopped me from acting?
"Admit it, it was you."
"Now you say you didn,t want to come here?"
- I did it for you.
"- You,re such a liar!"
You were glad to come!
"What,s more, we,re gonna get tossed out, and it,s all your fault."
How does she look?
"Terrible, Mom."
She's really upset.
- She's called it off.

What did she expect?
"Well, you done now?"
Are you about finished?

Wow.

"If you're thinking what I'm thinking, you are a horrible person."
Yeah.
"I mean, there's no universe in which you can go after a man's girlfriend when he's lying motionless in a hospital bed."
Yeah.
Let alone pulling out his IV bag and banging her over his lifeless body.
Wow.
That was on the tip of your tongue.
Hmm?
"Dr. Maxwell, can you come in here for a moment?"
I need to talk to you about something very important.
This is slightly uncomfortable for me to talk about.
Is it about the surgery this morning?
I swear that kid's nose just looked like that.
I want to friend Riley on the Facebook.
"It's just ""Facebook."""
"Oh, I know, but Riley seems to take it pretty seriously."
Would you be willing to friend me and possibly connect me with your friends?
"But, you know, the cool ones."
Okay.
I guess I could do that.
Great!
Leave for Pondi right away.
Stay there in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Room will be booked.
I'll send you the details over there.
Remember I want this car any how.
It's a gift for my wife.
"Sir, Which wife?"
One who's Bandra or the one who's in Varli?
Why is he so angry?
Laila always checks the car thoroughly before she buys is to sell.
"Madam, My car!"
"This car of yours, I can't sell it."
Nobody can sell it now.
We are from the ICUC Bank.
"Madam, You took a loan of 2500000 for this show room of yours."
And you haven't paid your installments since ten months.
Actually we are here to give you a notice.
What notice?
"If you don't pay in 5 days, we'll take all of your cars."
You can't do this.
We can do it Madam because we are scoundrels and bastards.
I'll call the police.
We are the police.
We work part time with the bank.
"Okay Ma'am, Have a good day."

"And it's hard, it's complicated."
"I mean, it's a lot of work."
I'm starting to think the song outside my door.
Was a little bit misleading.
I'm not finished.
Being with you might be all those things.
But the only thing worse is not being with you.
Did that get to you like it got to me?
"Yeah, a little."

Are you sure you're ready for all this?
I was ready for all this the first time I met you.
I just didn't know it.
Now come on I think I owe you pizza and a movie.
-I mean if you're hungry.
-Are you kidding?
Right now I'm torn between kissing you.
And checking the bottom of your shoe to see if you stepped in a donut.
Let me just ditch Hannah.
What about your omelet?
Sorry dad.
- I don't think I can.
"- Yes, you could."
Kiss me.
I don't know why I should act so experienced.
It was only my second kiss this year.
"It wasn't as good as Rodney's, was it?"
No.
"Hello, I guess I should've phoned but I was in the neighborhood..."
- That's all right.
I have a message for Allison.
Is she home?
"No, she and Selena have just gone over to Kathy Ellsworth's house."
That gives me a good excuse to talk to you.
- May I come in?
"- Oh, of course."
- You have a lovely house.
- Thank you.
Please come in.
This is a very comfortable room.
"Good books, pictures."
My own hotel room is a bit basic.
"I have a mirror for shaving, a basin for washing and a closet to hang my coat."
You ought to find a house.
I'm trying to.
"In the meantime, I have my hotel room, which I clear out of right after dinner."
You said you had something you wanted to tell me.
"I was telling you something, but you weren't listening."
Your husband?
He died when Allison was 2.
And Allison.
- A few years ago.
- She's grown a bit since then.
Here.
"-Rodney, I'm going to cry."
"-No, and don't say anything silly."
"Betty, you know how glad I am that I married you?"
"Oh, Rodney, I hope so!"
Your dad is over there.
Go say good-bye to him.
"Go on, go say good-bye to him."
He loves you as much as I do.
Go on.
Take care of yourself.
"And, whatever you do, do it honorably."

"Say, do me a favor, dad."

"Name, loud and strong."

"- Darling, please don't go."
You don't want a man for a husband.
You want a coward who'll run out on a friend in danger.
"That's not me, and never will be."

I'm a soldier...

"That's what I'll do, that's just where he belongs."
"Ted, look at this."
I can pull all these video stills up.
"Come on, we have enough here to build a case."
Do you want to tell me what's going on?
What happened that night?
"Okay, I needed him."
I needed someone and he wouldn't even talk to me.
"I understand, all right?"
You felt abandoned.
No one was there for you.
"No one was there to listen, not even Aldo."
Like I didn't even exist.
"Look, just tell me... what happened that night, okay?"
"I can help you, no matter what you did."
(sniffs)
I didn't kill Aldo.
I did something worse.
What's worse than killing?
I went looking for him in Bellevue.
He started to go there to buy his drugs.
I didn't know what I was gonna do.
"Then, as I'm watching him, someone pulls up."
The driver gets out and jumps Aldo.
Who was it?
I don't know.
"Come on, Ted, look at me."
You have to remember who this was.
It could save you.
"Whatever happens, I deserve."
Because I froze.
I didn't help him.
"Aldo got taken and I just let it happen, like-like I wasn't even there."
"Daddy, we've found it."
"God, hope you would bless Yu-fa and Nim-sai, make them live happily in heaven, thank God!"
"Sir, beware of catching cold, let us handle it."
"Chung, open the coffin and check the body."
How is the body?
We still can see his face.
Turn the body upside down and remove his trousers.
What did you see?
His ass.
Anything on his ass?
A triangular stain.
It's birthmark.
"Right, he is your brother Nim-sai."
"Actually, Nim-sai was sold to Canton by you for over 20 years."
"If he is still alive, can you recognise him?"
"You know, when one is happy, his has one look."
"And when he is sad, he has another look."
I can't guarantee the change of his look.
Do you remember anything special about Nim-sai?
He has had a very beautiful jade round his neck.
"There is a little door on it, behind the door, the name ""Sai"" of Sir Ho Sai is carved on it."
"Master, what are you doing?"
Wait.
"Master, what are you doing here?"
Wait.

"And I got to know this guy, and I kinda like him, regardless of his private... weener business."
All right?
"So we don't do that, we don't burn a guy like this, a nice guy, that's..."

Come on.
"Move out of the way, boy."
"Everybody out there, there's gonna be a party tonight."
There's gonna be a party tonight.
You know it.
These flame-broiled burgers -
"It's scary, man."
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you the truth.
"Scary generation, man."
"- I thought you might hit me in my head, fool."
- I didn't hit you in your head.
To my son.
I hope you pursue all your dreams and your desires... that you have within you.
I love you very much.
"- Ooh, that is so nice."
- Whatever.
"Oh, no.!"
"God, we thank you for this day, Lord."
"And we ask you to go with junior, Lord."
"And we thank you, Lord."
"Go with him as he try to better his education, Lord."
And we thank you for him for coming this far.
"Trying to get it together, but we got a little problem."
(speaking spanish)
We spent all of our time trying to get it together.
"Dealing with whites and the mayates, only to be dealing with our own."
"Órale, carnal."
These aren't our own people.
They're nothing but lame farmers from up north.
They're chicanos.
"It's too late, homes."
They're already too big in Vacaville.
And now they're making a play on our shit in Folsom.
"They gotta pay the bill, ese."
Who's carrying all the weight for them?
Dude named El Chucko Peña.
I know that vato.
I know him real well.
(speaking spanish)
"That should make it easier to get next to him, ese."
He used to be my crime partner!
(speaking spanish)
"What the fuck is wrong with you, ese?"
It's cool.
SANTANA:
Pie Face had left me only one choice.
"The strength of a gesture, a thought but no voice."
(DON'T LET ME BE MISUNDERSTOOD playing)
"Baby, do you understand me now?"
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong
(speaking spanish)
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
"- You can't carry a gun, Rickie."
- l don't.
Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.

I'm one of Yossef's friends.
"In fact, I'm his boss."
Thank you very much.
Raise the lamp so I can see your face.
"I haven't seen Yossef, so at least let me know his taste."
You won't tell me your name and you won't let me see your face.
At least light the ground so I don't trip up.
How long did she study?
Who?
That woman whose poem you recited.
Forough?
I think she was in school until the fourth or fifth year.
"You know, writing poetry has nothing to do with diplomas."
"If you have talent, you can do it too."
How much do I owe you?
"Deborah Duchet is the Gatekeeper, the ""Saint Peter"" of Skirt..."
She separates the men from the boys.
Let's watch her in action.
What the hell are all these cameras doing here?
I'm doing a tour for channel 13 that nobody else wanted to get.
"- Hello, Skirt."
- Isn't she a genius?
Let's move on.
"That's Roxanne Rochet, our Fashion Director... let's follow her."
Don't you just love her Chanel?
This is her first day back since the accident.
Her breast implant exploded on a Concorde.
The show must go on.
Messages?
Get Tokio on line 1.
"Get my boots back to Christine, because they need new legs."
Give me an overwrap.
Did you call Garin?
What's going on with John Bartlett photo shoot?
"Get me an overwrap, I want an..."
Himalaian rejuvenation lime and berry acid peel.
"And get me some Valium, I'm suffering from such jet lag."
Where is Cecilia Soleil?
She's on maternity leave this month.
This month?
It only takes one day to bung with a baby.
"- Yes, Roxanne?"
- Capuccino.
"Right away, Roxanne."
"Okay, let's move on."
This is the Editor Large.
This is the Editor Super Large... and this is the Editor Slender Regular.
And it took a lot.
Aunt Edi we've driven around this block a million times.
Do you see your old house or not?
Not.
I think we need to go back to Wheeler's market
And make left this time.
That's it!
That's my house!
"That's a taco stand, aunt Edie."
We need to go back to wheel market
And take a left this time.
"Any of these look like your house, aunt Edie?"
Look for the boy who brings the ice.
He'll know.
"Well, thanks to that new high-speed internet we tried free for 90 days."
The principal did get my e-mail and called to say
She wanted to meet mike and me as soon as we got off work.
Hi.
We're the Hecks.
We're here to see principal Larimer.
"Oh, you're Brick's parents."
He has ms.
"Rinsky, doesn't he?"
Isn't she the best?
I just love her.
Really?
I just love my family members.
I think it's a really overused word.
"Aunt Edie, are you sure this is the right yard?"
How many holes are we gonna be digging here?
This is crazy!
I found this weird bone.
He said there was one person who ordered the hits on the five spies.
One person behind Mom and Dad's cover-up.
But Henry says he doesn't know who it is.
"Well, we have to find out."
But how are we gonna-- [phone rings]
Damn it.
Let the machine get it.
Hello?
Any closer to finding Gus Walker's killer?
How did you get this number?
"Come on, Special Agent Henson."
Why do I even ask?
You really should consider using me as a resource on Walker.
I don't need you as a resource.
"Well, for, uh, someone with no leads, you're quick to throw away free information."
What could you possibly know that I don't already have?
Something I'm unwilling to share on the phone.
Meet me at King Street Lounge in ten minutes.
"I'll be gone in 15, along with the info."
[hangs up phone]
I have to go.
But what about-- And don't go anywhere.
"We're gonna work on this as soon as I get back, okay?"
Okay.
Okay?
Would I lie to you?
"Um, Sondra..."
"I'm sorry, I gotta go."
But thanks for the cookies.
Bye.
Nice to meet you.
"(Angela) Nice to meet you, too."
"You being my new boss, I'm hesitant to point out that it... it might not be that easy."
Heartbeat looks normal for 10 weeks.
No evidence of bleeding from the trauma.
So the baby's okay?
Looks fine.
"Michelle, does this kind of thing happen often,"
"Darren hitting Tammy, hitting you?"
It was an accident.
I want to see my daughter.
"Michelle, look, I know this is hard to talk about, but you stabbed your husband."
"Now if you were protecting Tammy, if this was self-defen..."
"God, you're making us sound like..."
It was not like that.
Darren didn't do anything.
You don't have to make excuses.
I was cooking... and Darren and I started arguing.
"Tammy tried to stop us, and she got in the way, and Darren pushed her."
"It was an accident, but I got mad and I overreacted and I had a knife in my hand."
Please.
I need to be with Tammy.
I need to make sure she's okay.
"Okay, okay."
Michelle Larsen.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
"No, no."
"No, officer."
Her husband hit her.
It was an accident.
"Okay, Michelle."
"No, look, she has a daughter who needs her."
She's pregnant.
It is my fault.
I should have worked harder.
Now she's gone!
She's not gone.
I know where she is.
Sit down.
How do you know where she is?
Now use your head.
She's a young girl.
She wants to party.
She wants to get wild.
Too late to leave the island.
Where is she?
Where's the only place she could go?
"Eden East, the singles' side."
We gotta go get her.
You're damn right we do!
And I'm going with you!
I am not letting you go alone!
I don't care if I have to go there all night!
To find Trudy.
We're gonna go find Trudy for him!
"We can't even go to that side, all right?"
"And it's gonna get very dark, very soon."
Plus we have to be in bed...
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.
We have to be to bed at a very reasonable hour tonight because we cannot miss the sunrise in the morning.
"Now, Marcel said if we miss that sunrise, we will not be completing our course."
"We are here for the course, all right?"
- Yes.
"And stop eating and drinking, as well."
You've got just one thing to think about:
Allison.
"If you were gonna get married, why didn't you tell me?"
- You wouldn't have approved.
- You never gave me a chance.
"At least it would've been a proper marriage, not a cheap weekend affair."
- Don't say that.
"- Well, what was it?"
- I'd like to talk with you alone.
- You can talk to both of us.
"This has to do with the business, not your wife."
- I'll wait outside.
"- Okay, honey."
I can get it annulled.
I don't want trouble between us.
I was in love with Betty and wanted to marry her.
You weren't in love.
You had an itching for her.
"She took you, son."
She took you.
"Goodbye, Dad."
"- When you come home, don't bring her."
- Then I won't be there.
Rodney what about college?
I'm not going.
I have to support her.
"You can have a job here, if you work like everyone else."
That's good enough for me.
"Thanks, Dad."
"I knew you weren't coming down for lunch, so I thought... ."
"It's such a beautiful day, darling."
Why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
I can't.
Why not?
"It was, it was pouring rain."
I could barely see out the window.
The car started to skid.
"I don't know, I saw the wall coming and I didn't stop, I just kept driving."
"What are you saying, Judy?"
What happened?
I didn't know that Grace's car seat wasn't clicked in.
I would never do anything to hurt my child.
Did you do this on purpose?
Sometimes I...
I can't help it.
"Sometimes, it's like I don't know how to snap out of it."
It's like... everything is coming at me at once and I just want it all to go away.
"Judy, did you try to hurt yourself?"
I just wanted it to stop.
- Do either of you have a moment?
- Shoot.
I think my MVC mom's suffering from severe postpartum depression.
- Just one second.
- It's the baby.
Grace Anderson.
- What about her?
- She's waking up.
I thought you might want to extubate.r.
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
What are her symptoms?
She drove head-on to a wall with her baby in the car.
I think it was intentional.
I'd like to put her on psych hold.
- Dr. Rasgotra?
Just a unemployed person.
What does Yoong Sung want to do?
You don't know how to make people happy.
You cannot deceive my heart.
How come you're meeting with that kind of guy?
"That's what I don't understand,"
Withdraw from this plan.
When I get back I'll do it on my own.

"Lee Yoon Sung,"
My father...
Please forgive him.
I'm sorry.
Kim Young Joo.
Kim Young Joo!
Kim Young Joo!
"If you want to see the classified documents, come to the Seoul junkyard"
- City Hunter.
"Father, why did you do that?"
Why did you have to lie and tell Kim Yong Joo to go there?
This Republic of Korea Prosecutor wanted to know the truth...
I was just helping him.
Do you know?
"The person who killed the innocent Kim Young Joo... is no one else but you, Father."
"Even if someone commits no sins, that person can die at anytime."
Just like my colleagues did.
"Now, that Cheon Jae Man will die by my hands."
Let's go!
So you want to smuggle your way out.
The punk who's smuggled himself out knows what that feeling is like.
What a god damn waste.
I want Lanagan Pike in the back of my car.
As soon as you can.
They're going to kill me!
"- Take it easy, Mr. Pike..."
- Are you kidding?
"Hanging a protest sign off a coal plant smokestack,"
I got thumped so bad I couldn't see out of this eye for 3 days.
- Just breathe.
"- Look at what he did to you, and you're a doctor!"
Stay still.
"I told her I was coming down, she came after me anyway."
"She didn't know what she was doing, how to walk up there."
We both fell right through the floor.
She shouldn't have been there.
You were trespassing.
"She was doing her job, too."
"OK, bend your knee."
It was an accident.
"I'm going to keep you here for a few hours to monitor you, check for toxicity in your blood."
OK?
OK.
Dr. Young to the NICU.
Dr. Young to the NICU.
We need to start questioning him.
And I need to be sure he's medically clear before I release him.
Excuse me.
What's happening with the jackass?
- Excuse me?
- The kid who caused all this.
He's OK.
"I mean, he's not, but his injuries are."
It's over.
"Oh, and, Nina, it's not me, it's you."
Ladies ofthe Hub... why do we try to act like we have no needs?
I have needs.
"For instance, I need a date for Saturday night."
Any takers?
"You, blondie."
"You there, with the glasses."
What about the redhead trying to cover her face?
"12,378, here I come."
Hey.
So I went to see Jake Bradley-
You mean- [Imitating Eric] Jake Bradley?
Yes.
To see if he wanted to hang out.
And you know what Mr. Cool Guy was doing?
Just hanging out in his basement with his friends... and they were watching The Six Million Dollar Man.
It was eerie.
Was there a skinny guy dating this really hot chick... who's way out of his league?
"You know, there was."
Wait.
Does this mean we're not gettin' a fat kid to play with?
"No, man."
We don't need anyone else.
You know what?
We've only got two months until graduation... and we can't waste a second of that.
Forman's right.
"Let's seize the day, man."
"Hey, weren't we supposed to seize something, man?"
You know what the Six Million Dollar Man should have?
A bionic nose.
You could smell everything!
Let me ask you one last time.
Let us go.
You can call me an obsessed hypocrite if you want... but I can't let you go.
You never loved me back.
I thought things would get better if I held onto your empty glances... but you never thought of me the way I cherished you.
"If I can't have your heart, then I'll keep your body at least."
You'll stay with me until I die.
(Downtown Magok)
How did it go?
I found a merchant who trades with Puyo.
He's at the tavern.
Let's go.
I work for Sosuhno.
You want to buy seal fur?
Yes.
You're late.
Mr. Oh from Haengin bought all we have.
I heard the pirates smuggle seal fur.
I'll pay you handsomely.
"Let me meet Buwiyum, the pirate captain."
You can't meet him unless he approaches you.
Help me.
That's him.
Step back!
I want to see your captain.
I don't want to fight.
Lead us to him.
Mr. Yu in Magok sent them.
They have a letter from him too.
I'm Buwiyum.
You want to trade with me?
"I'm disguised as a merchant... but I'm Jumong, Commander of the Damul Army."
I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor.
It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop.
Hang on.
It's the wildebeest.
Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
W-What the hell did she say?
"She thinks it's cool you're following your dream, no matter what."
That bitch!
How do you want to handle it?
"Um, okay."
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
Got it.
Is it going to be in 3-D?
What?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
I'm gonna say 3-D.
That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.
You're kidding.
3-D?
That's what I hear.
Then the studio must have real faith in it.
Wonder why she didn't tell me.
Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
No...
Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?
"Well, it's not as much ""surprised"" as you know..."
uh... the other thing.
What other thing?
"Well, if you... uh..."
I don't... oh...
What's the word I'm looking for?
You might as well.
I'll be grand.
I can always slip downstairs.
"I was so embarrassed, I was scarlet."
"I'm not joking yous, I was burnin'!"
How are yous?
- Go on.
"- How are you, Sharon?"
He was holding the eclair in his hand like this.
"The place was full, and he says..."
"""Why did you rob the cream out of me eclair?"""
"- The head on him, Jesus!"
- And did you rob it?
"Well, I paid for the bleedin' thing."
Why shouldn't I have?
I told him to cop on.
"""I seen ya,"" he says, ""with your finger."""
So I gave him the finger.
I'd shag the elephant man before I'd let him near me again.
The prick.
"Here, young fella!"
"Give us three vodkas, two cokes, and a glass of Furstenberg."
"Have you got that now, chicken?"
"Hey, handsome, give us a packet of crisps as well, will ya?"
And do you have any nuts?
Whoo!
You dirty bitch!
I'm only messing with you.
He's a nice little bum on him... like two eggs in a hankie.
"He'll be nice-looking when he's older, won't he?"
Are you going to break it off with him anyway?
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
What the dog do?
Spit gold dust?
He's the best dog you've ever seen.
He could pull that load of yours without any help at all.
- Sure!
I'll bet you he could.
"- Well, he could."
"How'd you like to make a little bet on that, partner?"
Haven't any money to bet.
I hear of one dog in Nome... he pull 800 pound.
But he dies dead to do that.
"Ah, no dog can pull 1,000 pounds."
It's impossible.
"Well, then it's impossible."
Let's drop it.
"Is it all right to look at him, mister?"
It ain't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds.
"Come on, boss."
Let's get outta here.
"What's the matter, gentlemen?"
If I overheard correctly... the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds.
I'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can't.
He won't bet.
Says he's broke.
"I don't want money from you, my friend."
"If your dog is able to do it, I'll give you the $1,000."
- If he can't-
- Well?
"Why, then, I'll take the dog."
No.
"Say, that sounds fair to me."
"Turn them over, George."
I wanna see them.
Come on.
I'm calling.
- What do you got?
- Gary Fogel never had cancer!
"So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you for me when in fact, it was an unauthorised hi."
- You didn't say hi?
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's what you came to tell me?
- Correct.
- You never said hi.
- Correct.
"- You still like me, don't you?"
- Correct.
What?
"Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day."
How can you say that I still like you when I didn't even say hi to you?
Coming down to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Jake...
The doctors thought he had cancer but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
"- So, what was wrong with him?"
- Nothing.
He's been lying to me for two months?
- That's right.
- What kind of person is this?
"There's one other person who might do something like this, and that's you."
- Well...
- I don't even think you could do it.
"No, I could do it."
"- Yeah, I guess you could."
- Come on.
From the programme.
Tubby Baker.
"Very pleased to meet you, Pauline."
"Oh, don't be."
I'm only a lowly secretary.
Enid is the PA.
She has the desk planner and the intercom.
And what have I got?
Some Handy Andies and a plastic lemon.
We're on lemon and hot water.
"I told you, we're slimming."
How's it going?
This week?
Not great.
"I can have 7,000 calories a week, and, so far, I've had 3,800 and it's only Tuesday, but, hey, two days on potted meat and water biscuits."
That could level me back off.
"Speaking of chips, where are you taking her?"
You're not escorting her to lunch?
Of course!
"Pauline, it's Tuesday!"
I was thinking of having a sandwich.
Can I interest you in sitting on a bench?
In the square?
No.
I don't have time.
"No, fair enough."
"Well, I won't clog up the mighty wheels of commerce."
"Very pleased to have met you, Pauline."
"Enid's got a lot more leeway than me calorie-wise, she can have a jacket potato and a yoghurt."
I don't think I've ever had a yoghurt.
"No, you don't look like you've ever had one."
No offence.
What does that mean?
"Okay, we need to get you to a doctor right now and get that thing checked out."
I'm not going to a doctor for a cat scratch.
"Listen, your life could be in danger."
That's ridiculous.
- Juliette.
- I'm tired of this.
You don't understand what she is.
What?
"What is she, Nick?"
"She's an attractive, successful woman."
You saved her life once.
I don't know what it is you have against her now.
What is it that you're not telling me?
Do you have some kind of relationship with her?
- No.
- Then what is it?
"She's a witch, okay?"
"You're going to need to try a little harder, Nick."
What?
Does she ride a broom?
Because I distinctly remember her getting into a BMW.
"You don't know what's going on here, Juliette."
Then isn't it about time you tell me?
You're going to the doctor.
"I told you, I'm not going to a doctor till you tell me why you're acting so crazy."
[Sighs]
Okay.
You want the truth?
"Yeah, the truth would be nice."
Get your coat.
"I told you, I'm not going to a doctor."
"And of all the cars to borrow, why mine?"
You just don't like him.
Never gave me a chance.
"This shouldn't be about Danny, it should be about us."
I care about you.
"I'm sorry, A.J."
Hi.
Did you come to take my mother to lunch?
"You screwed with me, son."
"I don't really care about that, but you're keeping your mother from being happy and you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
She is happy.
And I'm happy.
It's not our job to make you happy.
Still driving a rental car?
"I'll be sending you the bill, boy."
I never consented to marriage with Mustafa.
I accepted him only as a friend of my father's.
A friend of the family.
I spent many hours in their home.
Fatimah was always happy to see me.
I was a child.
You brought me presents.
"I thought of you as a favourite uncle, not a suitor."
Fatimah's father came to me with her promise.
- He signed the kitab.
- He signed the kitab.
I did not.
- Her father was her wali.
- Objection.
Fatimah was 18.
Her father was no longer entitled to serve as her wali without her consent.
"Thank you, Miss MacKenzie."
At three.
"Their part-timer is away for three days, so they asked me to fill in."
What about the convenience store?
The owner said he'd take care of it.
"All right, I'm going."
Did you come from home?
No.
Then what about the car?
You said you needed to take care of someone and took the car.
Yeah.
"Oh, so you didn't want to waste gas, left it at the office and took the bus here?"
"No, Moon Kwon, I came in a taxi."
What about the car?
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?
Where's the last place you went to?
Hospital.
I don't understand you.
Who leaves their car and takes a taxi?
"You shouldn't be taking care of anyone, you're the one who needs to be in the hospital."
Is something really growing in your brain?
"I'll get it, what hospital is it?"

A writer should write their own material.
I can't.
Are you an idiot?
"You know, when I was younger, I almost got engaged but her brother talked me out of it"
Really?
What did he say?
"He said, ""Brett, you have a beautiful penis"" and..."
Dip.
Woo!
"OK, guys."
Help me out.
What should I do for my wedding?
I don't know where to begin.
"Charlotte, what did you do for your wedding?"
Was it like a fairy tale?
My wedding was exactly like a fairy tale.
"Um, once upon a time there was a princess with low self esteem..."
And terrible taste in men.
She went to Las Vegas and ate some magic beans.
Then she married an evil ogre named Mark.
"Mark put a baby in her, and ruined her credit."
"12 weeks later a wizard named Jeff, the divorce attorney, annulled her mistake."
The end.
OK.
"Um, I'm surprised."
But just so you guys know you're all going to be in my wedding party.
"Except for you, Charlotte."
- I'm sorry.
I just met you.
"- Oh, you know, that's fine."
"I'll just uh, I'll come to the next one."
"Oh, hey Bursk, Les, I'm assuming you guys want to be each other's plus ones because"
"- you know, smooch buddies."
"- No, no, stop."
No cute winks.
Mother who is she?
She is Shiau Fu's daughter?
Should we kill her too to prevent future problems?
"No, you can't kill her"
You can't kill her why?
Because she's my wife
I am a member of wu Dong wu Dong School
Let's go
Sister Bu Huei
Mom
"Sister Bu Huei, don't cry any more"
Sister Bu Huei
Please don't cry
Sister Bu Huei
"""The tomb of wang Nan Gou"""
"""The tomb of wu Ching Niu"""
"""The tomb of Ji Shiau Fu"""
Let's go
You know where my father is?
I don't
Regardless of whether I know
I'll take you to him
"Okay, you'll be alright in a few days"
How come you know how to treat wounds?
I have lived at wu Ching Niu's place for 1 0 years and he taught me
You are from wu Dong why did you stay at a Ming Cult member's home?
My foster father was a member of Ming Cult who was he?
Golden haired lion Tse Shun
Golden haired lion
Isn't the Dragon Sabre with him?
"True, that's why so many people are looking for him"
"I know where he is, but I won't tell"
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.
I got to go on the lam to get away from this guy.
This ain't right.
I can't go here or there.
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.
he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.
You've known this Tommy all your life.
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
When I leave my house in the morning I look over both shoulders.
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.
I'll do it.
What could I do?
I would.
I'd like to help you out.
Tell him what we talked about.
take a piece of this joint.
It'd be good.
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
but that's the way it is.
I'm begging you.
What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business.
"You're not very proud of me, are you?"
"You know, Bob, I-"
I wasn't gonna give you your present till later... but I think I'll give it to you now.
I think it'll help you control your appetite.
"What is it, a muzzle?"
"Oh, honey that's a very expensive suit that I was so crazy about."
"Yeah, but you were crazy about it in a larger size."
"Bob, the waist is two inches smaller than your waist."
"I mean, I thought it would give you something to shoot for."
"I know you can do it, honey."
- Hi;
Bob.
Happy birthday
"- Oh, Hi, Howard."
"Well, I got your present."
Guess what it is.
- Feels like lead.
"- Yeah, go ahead, Open it up."
See for yourself.
It's a belt.
"Yeah, I, got it in Tokyo."
It takes the weight right off.
"I had a hard time, finding your size there."
Not too many guys as heavy as you are in Japan.
- Is this the way you wear it?
"- Yeah, you wear it under your clothes."
"Uh, here."
Let me show you with your coat here.
Wear it playing tennis or handball or golf.
Just don't go swimming in it.
"I'll get it, honey."
Oh.
Send him in.
"- Would you come in, Mr. Rossi?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- I'm Leslie Harrington.
This is the school board.
Mr. And Mrs. Partridge.
He's a lawyer.
Dr. Swain.
Seth Bushwell.
He's editor of the Peyton Place Times.
"Mr. Rossi, here's our situation."
We're prepared to offer the job as principal to a qualified man with a minimum guaranteed five-year contract.
"Mr. Rossi is a graduate of Penn State, summa cum laude."
He holds a master's degree in English and literature.
He was an outstanding athlete.
He's single.
"Personally, now that I've seen him, I like what I see."
- Did I miss anything?
- I've been working in construction.
"If you're a teacher, why were you working there?"
I couldn't live on the salary of a teacher.
This job starts at 3000 a year.
Then we're all wasting our time.
That's only $5 a week more than I was making as a teacher.
But this offers you security.
A long-term contract.
Guaranteed poverty is not security.
I want 5000 a year and a raise of 500 in the second year.
- We can't do it.
- You own this mill.
"He still thinks that you've got a long way to go, but he's engaged, and that is a good start."
"Look, I'll do whatever he says."
"I mean, this is..."
This is all I care about.
Good.
"'Cause I also had an interesting meeting with a sponsor today who is looking for a female fighter,"
- and I thought of you.
- What kind of money?
[Laughs] It didn't really get that far.
I just wanted to see if you were interested first.
"Fuck, yeah, I'm interested."
Are you kidding me?
What is it?
"Mm, it's an energy drink called Slaughter Water."
"You know what, I don't even give a fuck."
"I mean, dude, I'll freaking sponsor an abortion clinic for all I care."
Are you kidding me?
[Chuckles]
My bad.
It's okay.
I'll set up a meeting.
I also wanted to find you a fight.
How do you feel about that?
"I mean, yeah."
What do you and Alvey think?
"I mean, what does..."
What does Alvey say?
"We both agreed that it's got to be the right fit, but I'll start looking around."
Jamal:
What are you doing?
I clocked out.
Employees can't eat in the dining area.
That's a bad one.
"If it's no easier by morning, I'll call Dr Campbell."
Don't be such an old woman.
'Now a special announcement.
The German government announced tonight their response to a British communication and gave their proposals for a settlement of the Polish problem.'
Where's Dad?
- In front of the fire.
Kettle done?
- Not for an hour or so.
- Right.
"I've come to a decision, Ma."
What about?
Enlisting.
What?
- All the lads are talking about it.
"Well, you can't enlist."
You can't stop me when I'm 17.
- You're forgetting one thing -
Neither can Dad.
- I'm not talking about him.
I'm talking about your condition.
"If Doc Campbell gave me the all-clear, so will the navy."
The navy?
"- As soon as I'm 17, I'm going to join the navy."
Have you told your dad any of this?
"No, he fell asleep before I could."
"My mind's made up, Ma."
It's what I want.
I'll see you in the morning.
We need to order a new stethoscope.
I suspected it was on the way out.
Just tried it on myself and it appears I'm already dead.
- Just a little something.
"- Okay, okay."
"I, uh..."
I'll call back Joe Glynn at the Times.
He's okay.
He'll write it up well.
I once leaked him some shit about Buchanan.
Damn near won him the Pulitzer.
"- Thanks, Dad."
- Sure.
Thanks.
"What would you do, or have done, in my case?"
"Well, when your president asks you to jump... it's hard not to jump, that's for sure."
But you remember what Ben Franklin said about the vice presidency.
What did he say?
I didn't talk to him this week.
"He said he ought to be addressed as ""Your Superfluous Excellency."""
"In the past ten years, I've enjoyed the kind of power the vice presidency can't offer."
Why would anybody want to give that up?
Am I crazy?
"Baby, power is where power goes."
- Think you can beat me?
"- Uh, yeah."
Okay.
"Hey, Tony!"
Foul!
Can't trust those fuckin' people.
"Speaking of which, Mr. Webster, it turns out you're a Democrat."
"I, uh, wasn't keeping it a secret."
"Sad to say, I don't think I can bring you aboard the committee, son."
Ray Spies makes all the decisions regarding the other party.
- It's a courtesy.
Two weeks and still nothing!
- And now?
"- l promise, within three days."
What if it doesn't happen?
She seems to be better now.
Her son left yesterday.
"If she'd been in a bad way, he wouldn't have left."
How do you know that?
We just know.
It's not something you can hide from us.
"She's better, this is useless."
You say that you know but you know nothing.
"First of all, her son is a guard at Kermanshah."
He's gone back to warn his boss.
It's 45 miles away.
He can be back in a day.
"If we want to go to Tehran, it's 450 miles away."
"450 miles, understand?"
We have to go to Tehran.
450 miles in one day!
"We didn't say we'd come back... lf no one decides for us, we have to decide for ourselves."
I can't decide for you.
You decide.
I can't decide.
God's the one who decides.
Who drew up this shooting?
I can't strangle her!
What am I supposed to do?
We're not asking you to strangle her.
What then?
How much longer do we have to stay here?
What if the event never occurs?
Get word through to Dale.
[CAR APPROACHING]
"It's okay, I didn't print it."
[EXHALES]
Hey!
It's Stacey!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"What do I gotta do, fight my way back in?"
Come on!
And you won't say why you came back and gave yourself up?
You know what it means.
"What is this, a guessing game?"
"According to rules, it means the book and the Hole, but not for me."
I only came back for the weekend.
"You made it out once, Stacey, but you'll never do it again."
We'll see how it works out.
"Now, do I get that plush-lined cell in solitary, or don't I?"
All right.
Everything set for the break?
Yeah.
You coming in with us or not?
"I don't love life much, but I don't hate it enough to stick my head in front of a screw's bullet."
Be a wise guy.
Stick around here and maybe it won't be a screw's bullet.
Maybe you'll get what Lassiter got.
What about Lassiter?
He's on his way home.
Home?
Out the back gate in a hearse.
When'd it happen?
Four o'clock this morning.
Give me that.
Have your guys do door knocks.
Talk to every neighbor.
"Tell everyone if they find anything, give me a call."
This is Detective Wagenbach.
I told you I needed a rush on those prints.
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.
"And if she is, I'd hate to see your backlog cost her her life."
- You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
- You were gone for an hour.
Jesus!
She's all over my ass about this Tio connection.
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.
- Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
- You are lying to her.
"- What, are you trying to be a wiseass?"
"- No, I'm just..."
Just shut the hell up!
- Christ!
- Where are we headed?
I got things to do.
I gave you guys to Aceveda for the day.
- What?
"- Apparently, a group of male hustlers... is hangin' out on the same block as Aceveda's campaign headquarters."
He's setting up a sting operation.
I volunteered you guys.
- You can't be serious.
- Your shirt's gay enough for the job.
- What do you mean you gave us to Aceveda?
What...
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you.
"No, I don't feel like it."
"You know, I don't think that we should waste all your hard work."
What say we split the fee?
"You just tell me where he is, I will do all the rest."
It's easy money.
"Evelyn, I appreciate all the effort you've put into this... but there comes a time where you have to walk away."
Come on.
Isn't there something I can do to persuade you?
There's nothing you can do.
Know what I love about Miami?
"Apart from you, of course."
The cheap labor.
"You know, I can get a kid off the street to do a hit for about, mmm, grand."
"Well, if I flirt with him a little."
"Say, now, isn't that Lucy?"
Lucy!
Lucy!
"- Michael, I am so sorry."
- It's not your fault.
"Yes, it is."
You taught me better than that.
It was so stupid.
I should have been more thorough.
- I've got guys headed to her hotel right now.
- It won't matter.
I know.
I just feel like I should do something.
You should.
"You should be careful, 'cause she's still out there."
Right on time.
What did you wanna tell me before?
Doesn't matter now.
- It just happened.
- Leave me alone.
You're not mad at me because of that.
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.
Stop telling me what I feel.
We're just doing what we always do.
Finding excuses.
"Well, I won't do it anymore."
- You told Serena you love me.
- Serena heard wrong.
"Last year, you told Nate."
"This year, you told Serena."
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me?
Is Gossip Girl right about you being a coward?
That's not true and you know it.
Gossip Girl can be right about you all she wants.
But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
"Chuck Bass, I love you."
"I love you so much, it consumes me."
I love you.
And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me.
"That everything we've done, all the gossip and the lies, and the hurt will have been for something."
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
Not really.
"Yeah,real."
"You've been dropping a lot ofash lately,mcgee."
"New phone,new watch,new teeth."
What'up?
Ducky matched the dental records.
The body downstairs is lance corporal finn.
"Ziva,when did you..."
"Mcgee,how long does it take to put on a clean shirt?"
Ten conds.
"With buttons,a little longer."
Rhetorical question.
Contractor's off the hook.
He's been out of town for a week.
Going to check on the real estate agents this morning.
- That's all you did?
- No.
"While you and mcgee were watching the sunrise, I was pulling lance corporal finn's srb."
And I would have to say it was spotty.
He was unc' on the range and failed his swiqual.
- So they de him a supply clerk.
- Right.
"Six months ago,he signed out on a three-day pass before deploying to iraq and he never returned home."
- Get me his C.O.
- He's in iraq.
I'll contact mtac.
"I put in a request for finn's bank records, earning statements and medical records."
Night wasn't a total loss.
Ground radar picked up a shol about ten feet from the gravesite.
Already sent it to abby.
Yep.
The old gibbs is back
"Perhaps if you were at an Ivy,"
You'd have better insight.
Spotted-b.
"Claiming to be a co-ed at Columbia,"
When everyone knows she's a zero at N.Y.U.
Poor b.
First she lost Chuck and now her dignity.
"""Gossip Girl"" blast?"
"No, it's nothing."
"Look, Chuck, sleep with every Nadine in town for all I care,"
But don't close your heart to Lily.
"You and I both know that in the end,"
The person you'll end up hurting the most is you.
"Amalia, it's Blair."
Are you still waiting on me to sign the lease?
"Well, tell the girls it's a yes."
I'll take the apartment.
"You make your bed, you lie in it, b."
Too bad yours is in the East village.
Hey.
Were you able to convince your brother to come tonight?
No.
And please don't act like you care.
I'm sorry?
I just got off the phone with my dad.
"Apparently, someone didn't want him living in the building,"
"So they gave him a bad recommendation, and it worked."
The board didn't approve him.
"You're behind this, right?"
I am.
How could you do that?
"I don't expect you to understand, Serena,"
You're so getting fired for this.
- Look who was hiding in the Press Room.
"- Oh, my God, Roger Skinner!"
The only one who speaks the truth.
I love your show.
Seriously.
"After you, please."
Get in there.
"Come out, come out, wherever you are."
"Playing some hide-and-seek, little girl?"
"Well, then, I will huff, and I will puff and I'm gonna blow your house down."
"- No, no, no!"
Leave me alone.
- Get in here.
- Move!
"- Mr. Skinner, please stop crying."
"Get comfortable, you little mutt."
Are you okay?
"- Oh, my God, where's my dad?"
- He went looking for you.
Excuse me for a second.
Sir?
Hi.
"I understand that this is a very high-stress time but if you and your colleagues could maybe be a little more careful with the priceless artefacts that are in this building because I mean, it is a living history-- Okay, because see that was a Ming Dynasty 16th-century vase that was a gift from Queen Elizabeth ll."
It's irreplaceable.
I'll go sit down.
I'm gonna...
I'll be over here if you have any more questions.
"Vadim, Chen, report."
"We're done with the residence, boss."
Coming up to the third floor.
Shit.
Excuse me?
Rayanne showed me his picture in the yearbook.
If I were Angela running around with him...
I wouldn't give a damn about guns in the school either.
So you think that Jordan has gotten in the way for Angela--
And she was so obsessed with him all that time and now...
it's actually happening.
"But we know what that's like, right?"
Young love...
or lust.
What is the difference?
Yes.
Jordan.
"I could have died. I did die. I mean, this woman knows and I don't know."
She's not even a woman.
She's like this forty year old girl.
She's gorgeous.
And she's telling me about my daughter's sex life...
"which apparently she now has, and I don't even know about it."
"Patty, kid's talk."
The girl talked to her mother.
We don't know that it's true.
These things are always true.
Of course it's true.
Taste this.
I couldn't taste anything.
Guns are going off in school.
- Angela's sleeping with someone.
- You don't know that.
How is it?
"You know, and even if she isn't, which I pray is true..."
she obviously has some sort of secret life completely apart from us...
- You cheated.
"Stop, stop."
- You're so cute when you pout.
"- Stop, stop, stop."
Poor baby.
He's a loser.
- Stop.
"- Oh, he's just a little loser."
- You know what I think?
"I think we worry too much about Brian and Adam, you know?"
"I think they're gonna be fine, don't you think?"
I sure hope so.
Wanna slap it?
Wanna slap it?
"Yeah, you don't want to start planning two of everything, like when your married friends split up."
"Honestly, I can't believe all this is about Marjorie."
"Baby, uh, these people are her friends, okay?"
"I'm just saying, you were standing-- you saw Adam's face--right next to him at the altar."
I don't care what she was going through.
You don't put someone through that--public humiliation.
"- Orange, please."
"- All right,"
- this is the last orange.
- So she should have gone through with it
- so as not to embarrass Adam?
- Yes.
No.
"If she didn't want to get married, she saved him the trouble."
I don't even know why she said yes.
She's a coward.
I think it actually takes a lot of courage to do what she did.
"No, no."
"Charlotte's fifth birthday would be like, right?"
- What are you talking about?
"- When Cookie rolls up, like, piñatas aplenty, everyone will be like,"
"""Hey, Cookie's here!"""
You wanna slow your roll?
'Cause that's not gonna happen.
They're not gonna last.
"She's like the perfect physical specimen, and he's just, you know, Bruce."
"It makes now sense at all, and, at the same time, it kind of makes all the sense in the world."
"I mean, look at them."
Like two hippos wrestling in the wild.
"Oh, that's a classic viper hold into a Chinese handcuff."
[phone buzzing]
Man.
We learned that two weeks ago.
"God, she's good."
"Oh, we didn't learn that one."
We should not be watching this.
And I am all alone. [sighs]
"Officer Rodriguez, at your service."
"Mark, what are you doing here?"
I'm being spontaneous.
"I slipped in through the window, ""Dawson's Creek"" style."
"- No, you didn't."
"- Oh, yes, I did."
"You better come over here, girl, 'cause I don't wanna wait."
There is a former MMA fighter named Cookie downstairs.
"Well, then we're gonna have to be quiet, huh?"
[both moaning]
Hmm.
You know what?
You know what?
"Ernie, hair?"
"Hey, Hensh, look at all that hair-- a regular mop."
(laughter)
Wasn't I a thing of beauty?
Squad Leader Private First Class Ernest Bilko.
"A PFC, huh?"
"Hey, wait till they see you with all them stripes."
Master Sergeant Bilko.
"Oh, boy, they'll really flip."
Who ever thought I'd wind up with more stripes than hair?
(all laugh)
"Oh, what a bunch of characters."
"Look, this guy right here."
Oh...
look at the end... the end...
Meathead.
He used to be a truck driver before the war.
"To get him to move, I had to honk a horn."
This is a beauty right here.
Goof-off Gunther was his name.
He was a busboy before the war.
Used to open K ration boxes looking for tips...
"This is a real beauty, a hillbilly--"
"Zeke ""Ozark"" Rutlege-- the only man in the Army wore suspenders."
"Oh, they were beautiful."
"How did those meatballs ever get along in civilian life without you to watch over 'em, Sarge?"
"Oh, I shudder to think about it."
"Ah, those poor jerks-- probably going in hock to get to that reunion in New York."
"Hey, Ernie, the reunion's tomorrow night."
You'd better start packing.
-Packing...
-Got an idea.
There's something I want to ask you about.
"Sure, yeah."
So this girl...
- Saffron.
- Such a pretty name.
And you like her?
So what problem?
"I had a fiancée... not so long ago, and it did not end well for me."
The heart is strong muscle.
It spring back.
You ready for the love again.
"Yeah, but I don't know if this is the kind of woman that..."
"Come, Mr. Heller, you handsome man."
Don't.
I know how people see me.
But this Saffron make you feel good.
Yeah.
She makes me want to... be nice.
I think you have good luck with this girl.
"If there's any way we could see the room before paying for it... um, we just want to make sure the room is up to our standards."
We don't usually let people see the rooms before they check in.
"I guess they just don't want us here, babe."
"You want to carry me over the threshold, too?"
"Yeah, you wish."
Let's hurry this up.
Are you coming out anytime this year?
"Crap, I think we're out of hot water."
"Hey, man, you want to use this?"
Eat shit!
"Hello, Alice."
"Hello, Ava."
We decided against it.
Roll down your window.
We have to tell him.
No.
"If he stops, it'll fall off."
"Even if he slows down, it'll fall."
The best thing for that fish would be... if he could just drive steadily... forever.
I guess these are his last moments of life.
Shall we say some words?
I didn't know you... but I want you to die knowing that you were loved.
I love you.
Hey.
It was on your roof!
.
We'll go in front of you!
- Pull in front of him.
- Okay.
We've got to keep him at a steady speed.
Just keep them steady.
"Oh, God."
That little girl is gonna have towatch it.
But at least they know.
At least we're all together on this.
"When me and Pam were first in love... we hated to be apart, even for an hour."
"Oh, yeah."
I had something like that once.
- A real fuck-a-thon.
- We just slept.
We loved to sleep when it was time to sleep.
Not sex.
"I mean, we had sex... but what we really loved was to sleep like babies all day long."
That sounds perfect.
I don't want to have to do this living.
You need to be home where you're safe.
You could chain me to this porch and I'd still never touch you like that again.
I got off the phone with Mrs. Potter's housekeeper.
Mrs. Potter had a heart attack.
Paige?
"I'm sorry, Emily."
I wanted you to know that.
- I think maybe you're being framed.
- What changed your mind?
I think somebody might be trying to do the same thing to me.
So this is what a real date with Ezra Fitz looks like.
Lead the way.
I gave your mom the museum ticket.
- Why would you do that?
"- A has something on me, and..."
"A has something on all of us, Hanna."
"Okay, so your sister's pregnant."
How'd that happen?
I figure pretty much the usual way.
"It's not really a ""how"" question, it's more of a ""why"" question."
"Well, I mean, I guess Melissa could have gone all maternal but I doubt it."
"Ugh, this is so creepy."
Where are they now?
Philadelphia.
Shopping.
What do you think this means?
"I don't know, but Toby wanted us to have it."
There.
"It's in Braille, so..."
"- You want to see this, Aria?"
- No.
I can see just fine from here.
Mm-hmm.
"A team of researchers in Sweden gave it to a small group of glioblastoma patients, and they lived a remarkably long time."
"- Yeah, h-how long?"
- More than two years.
Yeah.
That's twice as long as the patients that didn't receive it.
Two years?
What I...
What I could do with that time.
I was hoping for a good six months.
Shall I arrange it?
"Oh, sign me up!"
I'm gonna fight this thing with everything I've got.
Look.
- My grandson.
- Mm.
He was three last week.
How's that for a reason to live?
Give me that.
"Can you look at me, please, Mr. Myers?"
"Uh, please, call me Jacob..."
Descendant of our tribe's forefather of the Israelites.
"Or, for short, the Messiah."
"So, just for the sake of clarity..."
You are the Messiah?
"I am chosen by Hashem, who calls on me to walk with angels."
"The only thing you should walk with is our dog, which you haven't done once since this started."
You have any headaches recently?

And does God talk to you?
"If you're asking do I hear voices, no, I'm not crazy."
But God and I have an understanding.
Then I am too.

A fax is coming in.
From Europe!
Paris studios.
Carl Lagerfeld to... the Editor in Chief.
I have a fax for the Editor in Chief.
The Editor in Chief is waiting for it.
You can go in.
"I'm sorry to interrupt, I have a fax for you."
Okay.
Thanks.
"The work is piling up, and I really should be getting to it."

They're just better than everybody else is.
Is it enough?
"- That was great, thank you ."
- Let me know when it's on.
I can watch in my time off on Channel 13.
"Thanks a lot, kiddo."
Hang in there.
It seems like a pretty tough place to work.
"Hey, Paul."
These are the photos for the acessory page.
She's gonna come here and show you exactly how she wants them.
They took care of Tunney when he was gonna talk.
How come Figgis didn't do somethin' about it?
He was Ray's right-hand man back then.
Then they tried to kill Superboy.
"They were hiding him, Freddy."
Then they burned down Figgsy's house when they think he might talk.
You don't know that.
We went over every inch of that house.
Not everything is a hexagonal conspiracy.
I think you been hangin' around Figgs too much.
He's the only one getting cash out of that house... and he's totally playing you—
just like those assholes in the city.
"And I'm sorry, but... there's nothing you can do about this."
"Yes, there is."
"I can find Superboy, and I can bring him in."
I'm going back upstate.
I want my old job back.
I don't want any part of this.
I don't want any part of this place.

But everyone in Garrison is not a murderer.
No.

"Hey, Freddy."
"All right, thank you."
Thank you.
"Thank you, sweetheart."
I love you too.
"All right, terrific."
"Although, all of you will have to be out of here by then."

Should I make myself invisible?
- Well I think It's cool here...
"No doors, wild."
"Tell me, how did you find this place?"
"Angie, three schnapps, and no objections!"

You never know.
And what happens if it doesn't work?
God damn it!
Don't you start up again with me.
Yes or no?
I just want to have it cleared up.
This guy's got an issue earning money.
"He's in debt, fiddles around on his show for a year  lives from nothing, and he gets stuck on the fine print."

"Alfons, you're my uncle."
You can't do anything about that and neither can I.
"I'm sorry to say this but  every time you get an opportunity, you blow it."
He's got a point.
Fuck you.
I think we got him.
"Ah, a tent!"
I haven't gone camping in a while.
Fine.
We got a lot done today.
"Got a lot done, but for what?"
For what?
Well good night then.
Can I sleep here?
"Yes, Mrs John... 9 years!"
Since the end of the war all my stage equipment has been here.
Ever since I saved it from the beautiful Glogau.
And for what?
...Oh well.
Bruno?
What have you been up to with Selma up there?
Do you think I'm crazy?
How do I know what you are and what you're not!
I don't want to know anything!
I always keep my eyes shut.
Because you're my brother.
You already allowed that to happen once with a minor..
If that gets out!
What gets out is up to you.
And I also know what else cannot get out...
Sometimes I ask myself why I don't tell Karl everything.
"There'll be a big washing-up, and then I'll be rid of the eternal fear."
"You won't do that, Anna."
You know very well what'll happen!
"Good evening, Miss."
You have visitors!
Mrs John!
- I've been to the doctor.
"- Yes, he has already called."
Everything is fine.
You're as fit as a fiddle.
It can be any day now.
Any day...
Did you tell him that I must go back before it comes?
"Yes, I told him that."
But I won't go back!
By whom?
By Yagi.
By Takao.
You surprise me.
Isn't your husband in Kyoto?
But Takao might be watching for us.
That kid is his father's son.
He doesn't like ballet.
He wouldn't be at the theatre.
So everything is just fine with you?
I don't think that we're doing anything that should make us afraid of people.
I thought that someone was watching us the whole time.
It sounds like you're getting hysterical.
Maybe.
I shouldn't be seeing you.
"This place has changed a lot, too, hasn't it?"
"During the war, Takao and Shinako used to come here to get grass and dirt."
"When they came home, Yagi used to clean them off."
Yagi was like that back then.
Let's not talk about Yagi.
Shall we go to Ginza to get something to eat?
I said I'd meet Shinako at 6:00.
She's coming back from her performance in Sendai.
Wouldn't it be alright if I came along to meet Shinako?
I'll see you some other time.
It's difficult for me to be with you today.
Come in!
Is my mother here?
"Yes, she's waiting upstairs."
Mother?
Welcome back.
Sorry I'm late.
"OK, he admitted it but there was never any evidence."
"Oh, Mark, come on."
He was seen in the area the night Jesse went missing.
- He killed 4 other children.
"- No, no."
His other victims was older.
It's a different MO.
"- He admitted it, Mark."
- Tell me then why does everyone keep on talking like he's suddenly gonna turn up one day
Because of your mother.
Why do you think we don't live together anymore?
Because she can't move on.
"Now look, he is dead, Mark."
Jesse is dead.
And this is... ?
We have to do a 100.
"Every hour, on, the hour."
I need you to double-check these forensic results.
"Why, what's the problem?"
The problem is they don't make any sense.
Can you stop that?
We've had a DNA hit from the Missing person database.
- From a kid that went missing in 1995.
- What?
"Yeah, so how about you you stop pressing with your boyfriend and check it again?"
Thanks.
Is that Pru?
"Yep, under her married name."
Pru Carew.
"Yeah, it's unfortunate."
"Oh, to think she could have been Mrs. Mark Wells married to a hot-shot lawyer."
And we're back in the playground.
Ah!
"If only I had my wallet, I wouldn't have inconvenienced you like this!"
"Once I get my wallet back, I'll pay you back."
Teacher Gil...
Did you get scolded a lot?
It's because I'm so upset!
You have no idea how dashing and what a gentleman my Yoon Jae is!
You made people say that he's an idiot...
It's because I'm sorry and upset for Yoon Jae!
Go home and stay there quietly.
Don't go around again and cause more trouble.
If you need something...
I'll get it for you.
You'll get it?
Forget it!
"Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it."
Go home.
"Don't go anywhere else, okay?"
Does she know how nice these clothes are?
Anything I wear is a total killer.
I only look like an idiot because I'm wearing it in this body.
Well...
"When I get my wallet back, I'll dress him like this."
Yoon Jae...
It would be nice if I could see you before I left.
Your call cannot be connected...
Um...
Can I found out what room Patient Kang Gyung Joon is in?
Room 560.
Okay.
Hey.

Would've been better to let him die.
His brother's gone crazy.
We need to call the police.
"Got no oxygen going to his brain, see... 'cause of the rope."
Half of it died away.
Now it don't hardly work no more.
"Better off dead, I reckon."
I need to call the police.
"Master Justin said he didn't need no help, cocking bugger."
Step away from the bed.
"You look after him, right?"
That's your job.
To keep him alive.
"So, if you just put the gun on the bed, and leave the room, you'll just be doing your job, right?"
Please... just go.
"I need a phone, Felix."
Good boy.
Shit.
Justin can help me.
- He says his family will protect me.
- And you believe him?
He's an army man.
Loyalty means a lot to him.
"Excuse me, Luke, in case you hadn't noticed, he's demented!"
He's obsessed with a fucking postcard!
"And you're on the list, remember?"
You are one of the scratched-out faces.
"When he's finished us off, Luke, you're going to be the only one left."
You sent it.
You sent the fucking postcard.
- Shut up.
"- Luke, for fuck's sake!"
I want you to put a guard on me.
"Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy."
- Right?
- Right.
So who's gonna watch me?
Cookie?
"No, not Cookie."
Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
"Okay, Price, you stay here."
What about Schulz?
We'll take care of Schulz.
Come on.
You too.
"That's a boy, Joey."
Play us a little something.
"What do you want to hear, Price, ""Home on the Range""?"
Or maybe a little Wagner?
"Or, uh, how about a game of pinochle?"
"No, you're not a pinochle man."
You're a chess player.
I never knew much about the game.
"Now, let's see a pawn moves this way and a bishop moves this way and the queen moves every which way, doesn't it?"
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
I went to school with a guy named Price.
That was in Boston.

My driver knows all the shortcuts in New York.
I must say I didn't expect you that soon.
Neither did your secretary.
"Stephanie, dear, you may leave now."
The stock is up to eight and three eighths.
I've made $120.000 so far.
Good for you.
You need me.
Maybe you need me even more.
Is that your husband?
Yes.
Was that painted before or after he died?
Six months he sat for that.
Maybe that's what killed him.
You are a wicked man.
"Tell me, where did you learn the market so thoroughly?"
I studied in Europe.
How would you like to make $12.000 cash immediately?
I would love to.
What do I have to do for it?
Just write me a check for $20.000.
Do you really think I'm an idiot?
"Look, I will sell you four thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at $5 a share."
The stock is selling at 8 dollars.
You make three points.
That's roughly $3.000 less commission.
It's a gift.
Why will you do that?
Well... let's say it's because you appeal to me.
"But you might gain many detractors, calling you a traitor who sold out her kingdom."
I don't mind.
"If you wish it, you may kill me afterwards."
So...
"Don't kill everyone, please."
Very well.
The battle is over.
"Please call off your soldiers, Rear Admiral Klom."
"Wait, damn you!"
"Hey, are you okay?"
"I believe in you, and your king."
Huh?
"Rear Admiral Klom, I can't bring myself to move."
Would you mind helping me stand?
Sure thing.
Thank you.
"With all of you, I'm sure the people of Estabul will be..."
"Again, people have died."
"Again, I made Claugh kill people."

"Brother Sion, are you going to cry?"

Lucile is quite scary.
"Hey, are you going to cry?"
C'mon!

"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.

"But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the argents."
"So, um, can I get anybody a drink or--"

Juliette got scratched by a cat.
"Um, well, that's too bad, but I'm not sure how that qualifies--"
- The cat belongs to Adalind.
- Oh.
That's actually not so good.
And I took her to the trailer.
- Adalind?
"- No, Juliette."
"I-I showed her everything, I told her everything."
She thinks I'm crazy.
"Ho, okay."
"So we're just kind of jumping out of the old airplane without a parachute here, huh?"
"Monroe, you're my last chance."
You have to do this.
Nick.
Enough.
"Juliette, I don't care if you believe me anymore."
- I'm just worried about you.
- You're worried about me?
You don't understand what Adalind is capable of.
I'm going home.
This is ridiculous.

Anyone wanna play Dawn of Armageddon with me?

Oh.
How come?

I know this must be really weird for you.
"It is for me, too."

She's out there.
"Come on, face her like a grown-up."
Come on.
"Wait, do me a favor, Henry."
Don't let me go home with her.
Say we're going out to dinner.
We are.
It may seem odd not to invite...
"Please, Henry, just don't let me go home with her."
All right.

Are you all right?
- It was that stupid wine.
"Hello, Candice."
- Hi.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
I hope you don't mind me just showing up like this on your big night.
No.
It's just that I've been thinking so much about you lately.

"""Oh, that's cool."
"""As long as you ain't got that Ebola shit."

I'm telling you this.
I don't fist bump.

"These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business."
- Agreed.
- We knowwhatyou tried to do for Cuba.
"Lfyou had been elected in '60, Castro would be dead now."
"Gentlemen, I tried."
I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.
He heard me and he made his decision.
I appreciate yoursentiments.
I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots.
But it's nothing I can do anything about.

They can deliver the South and putTexas in your column.

Whine there in the rear end.
I always sort of imagined myself had a little old car like this.
Wow.
"That's great, Warren."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"You slept with him, didn't you?"
"- Yes, I did."
"Yes, I did."
"- Yes, you did."
"I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour."
"So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?"
"And I say to him,"
"""Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need at least 14 capacitance probes"
"""to get the kind of results that you're looking for,"" okay?"
"So then he says to me, ""Miles, don't you think that's a little excessive?"""
"And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up in front of the entire class and I say,"
"""You can never have enough capacitance probes."""
"Oh, my God."
What the hell is wrong with you?
"Oh, nothing."
I hope nothing.
"You just got promoted, man."
You should be happy.
"I just gotta write this essay for the Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing."
"And the reason that I have nothing is 'cause, well, I've done nothing."
"- Oh, give me a break, Ben."
- What?
You have everything.
"You blow me out of the water, and I'm a cerebral stud."
Is that nothing?
"Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle."
Hey.
"It dazzles me, mister."
You got that completely wrong.
The person you were after was Alan Sugar.
It was obviously Alan Sugar.
Why?
"The Mayor was going to close Sugar's sweet shop down, it was all he had, he was a desperate man."
Did you not see the VHS player in Alan Sugar's shop?
Yeah.
You did?
Yeah.
"Yes, well, did you not see that the hostage tape was misspelt, yes?"
"""Kidnapp"" takes one P."
"You were closer to that than me,"
I didn't get to look at that.
"Oh, stop talking, please!"
"Hey, don't start blaming me."
"Don't start blaming me for this, O'Leary!"
Lana Del Rey was...
That's on your conscience.
"The point is, O'Leary, it couldn't have been Miley Cyrus because she told you..."
No-one ever beat Miley Cyrus at Scrabble.
"In other words, she could spell!"
We should have just questioned her normally.
"Well, all right, in retrospect, sorry, we should have questioned her normally."
Everything in Sugar's shop was misspelt.
"Oh, I see."
"I've trodden in more intelligent things than you, O'Leary!"
Sorry.
"Yeah, you're fired!"
And it'll probably cost me my job!
I hope you're happy.
You should go for mayor.
"That's actually a good idea, sir."
- Shit!
- I didn't send the postcard!
If Chris says he didnt send the postcard then he didn't send the fucking postcard
End of discussion.
All of us are in deep shit here.
All of us.
"Now let's focus on getting out of here, okay?"
Now keep twisting at your tape.
Gaffer's strong but it stretches.
One of us might be able to work a hand free.
So tell me about the party.
- Whatcha wanna know?
- Did you see Felix there?
"Yeah, I-I saw him."
Did you talk to him?
Did he seem all right to you?
"He was good, you know?"
He was fine.
Chris mentioned something with Gemma.
"Uh, Felix fancied her."
"I told him to go for it, you know."
"I said, end of the term, anything goes."
- You think she was out of his league.
- No way!
"He just needed to be confident, 'cause that's what the girls like."
Just a bit of confidence.
So you sold him drugs?
"It was just a couple of lines, I swear, I was just trying to help."
That was en error of judgement.
"I'm just a ""party guy."""
"Gemma, there's a workbench just a few feet behind you."
There's a drawer.
I just want to be with you.
"I know, I just..."
I think it's healthier to spend time with friends.
How is that healthier?
"Because if you start acting stupid or something or you're not nice to me,"
Amy will point it out if I don't notice.
Girls need girlfriends for that.
I'm not going to be not nice to you.
Why would I be not nice to you?
I'm in love with you.
It was just an example.
I want a friend.
I want us to have friends.
I liked it better when you were friends with Adrian.
That is over.
Let's go.
All right.
"Not ""all right."""
I want you to be enthusiastic about whatever I want to do.
Even when it's something stupid like going to a married couple's apartment and babysitting as our first date back together?
That doesn't sound very enthusiastic.
I can't wait!
(GASPS) There we go.
(SIGHS)
"Oh, Leo, I'm sorry I'm late."
Crazy day at work.
"Relax, glad you could make it, good to see you."
How was your day?
"Oh, it was good."
Yeah?
Any word from the school board?
"Oh, I heard from them, all right."
700 ships went to Dunkirk!
"338,000 men came back!"
"Don't say, ""It's based on a true story""!"
"Say, ""It's based on a hundred true stories""!"
A thousand!
Three hundred thirty eight thousand.
"Dunkirk, the biggest retreat in military history, or, the miracle that put the fire back in all our bellies."
Very well.
Carry on as you were.
I've a car waiting.
Buckley?
Buckley?
I don't care that you lied.
I cared that you lied to us.
There wasn't enough money.
Ellis wanted me to back to Wales.
Do you want me to compare to Mr.Blitz?
I'm sorry.
Well his partner would be relieved.
"His wife, Mary, she's an invalid."
"He pays for a nurse in the day, but he has to sit with her himself at night."
"When I told him, you wanted more than Ministry wages, he was worried you would find yourself in a similar position,"
With your husband Spanish War and all.
Should I...do you want me to come in tomorrow?
How would that help losing you?
Who the bloody hell do you think is going to be running the slob?
"The work's good, Mrs.Cole. You do a good job."
Oh!
Oh.
Hello Catrin.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Why?
Bob went to medical school for two years.
So?
So...
"So if a woman had her arm cut off, he'd know how to keep her alive."
"Oh, God, no."
No.
I swear to you.
Bob didn't do anything like that.
What'd we get back on the river basins and the state parks check?
Nothing.
We're still waiting for regional and county.
Call 'em back.
Don't wait on 'em.
"Bob's cold, manipulative."
Always been with women he could control.
Marcy accepts this 'cause she knows no better.
She's been force-fed his opinions to the point she's incapable of having her own.
Sounds like a surface diagnosis to me.
"Believe me, if you'd grown up in my family for 20 years... you'd recognize it right away too."
"I'm gonna, uh, go it on my own on this."
Marcy only knows how to take orders from men like Bob.
I-I can handle this.
Bob is innocent.
I understand.
You're afraid of him.
–I'm not afraid of him.
–It's okay.
"I can protect you, but only if you tell me what he's doing."
–He's not doing anything.
"–Don't lie to me, Marcy!"
I went through all your papers and completely organized your life for the next two months.
"Everything is color-coded, according to type of activity:"
"Home, Work, Ritchie or Personal, and I devised this dot system to indicate priority."
"I think you're, uh, really going to like it."
I may be wrong.
What are you doing?
"I'm sorry, but this situation with Jeff is getting more and more complicated."
I need the board.
I need to chart what our family tree would look like if Richard married New Christine and I married her father.
Okay.
Let's put it on the board.
Okay.
Write my name in the middle of the board.
Yes.
"Now write Richard next to me, and connect us with a line."
A broken line.
Thank you.
And then put Ritchie underneath us.
Yes.
And then put New Christine next to Richard.
And write...
P...
Pa...
Papa Jeff up there.
That is correct.
"Now draw a line from New Christine up and across and over to me, and..."
"Oh, my God."
I'm Ritchie's grandmother.
Where should I put me?
"Oh, who cares?"
Just go next to me.
"All right, now what we have to figure out is what would happen if we had a baby."
But El Nino has to concentrate.
He's got no time for other worries.
I won't give him any.
"But tell him to stop by the house and get his things, or to tell me where to send them."
Send them to my place.
He can tell me himself.
I have nothing to do with you.
"Here, you can leave when you want."
- Good evening.
- Whiskey on the rocks.
- Which glass do you prefer?
- The tall one.
"Excuse me, could I speak to you for a moment, please?"
Forget it.
"When something's over, it's over."
Excuse me.
What were you saying?
"Could I have a word with you, please?"
"If you take me to Madrid, we could talk on the way."
I'd be delighted.
Let's go.
Who named you Lydia?
My father.
It was like sealing your fate.
"He always wanted to be a bullfighter, but he stayed a banderillero."
"He was the one who supported me the most, but he died a year ago."
I'm sorry.
"""El Pais"" wants me to do a profile on you for their Sunday issue."
Do you write on bullfighting?
Your name isn't familiar.
To be honest I know nothing about it.
So why are you here?
This has nothing to do with me.
"It is about you, and it is always about you."
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Don't say anything.
I'll follow you to the station.
Do you think I did the right thing...
cutting my hair?
I can't believe this about your grandfather.
He's in big trouble.
"Yeah, I know, with the creek and the no paddle."
"Damn Oregonian barbers, man, making my head too small for my body."
- How do you work with this mirror?
"- Grandpa, front page, jail?"
- I was in that photo.
"I got cut out, though, ... probably 'cause of my hairdo."
- Sorry to see you're so upset.
- I'll survive.
It'll grow out.
- I'm talking about Caleb.
Looks like someone was way off base.
Accusing you of making everything about you.
"- My God, she is right."
"- I was just kidding, man."
"No, dude, here I am, going on and on about my haircut."
My grandfather's in the cooler.
"I'm like a monster, dude."
"I'm all I think about, and not in a good way."
- There's a good way?
- Talk to me about anything other than me.
"Go, give me anything."
"- Ah, here it is."
First day of A.P. Physics today.
Which is exactly what the Nazis are looking for.
What does this Ark look like?
Uh...
There's a picture of it right here.
That's it.
Good God.
"Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought."
"Uh... now, what's that supposed to be coming out of there?"
Lightning... fire... power of God or something.
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.
"Oh, yes."
"The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains, and laying waste to entire regions."
An army which carries the Ark before it... is invincible.
"You did it, didn't you?"
They want you to go for it.
"Oh, Marcus!"
They want you to get ahold of the Ark before the Nazis do and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it.
And the museum?
The museum gets the Ark when we're finished?
"Oh, yes."
Oh...
The Ark of the Covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
Mmm!
"You know, five years ago, I would've gone after it myself."
I'm really rather envious.
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.
Suppose she'll still be with him?
"Possibly, but..."
What did you bring in?
- A high school kid in short pants that had a twitch.
"- Oh, Christ."
You grab a bellhop because he's got three joints in his sock.
"Walt, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right?"
It's like a goddamn desert full of junkies out there.
- Everybody waiting to get well.
- Goddamn it.
This could be it.
This little candy store guy...
He's puttin' on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known narcotics connections.
They were all over him.
"And then, on our own, after working a whole day and night... we tail him to Brooklyn, and we sat on him for practically a week."
"Now, who do we come up with?"
"Joel Weinstock, for Christ's sake."
"Now, you gotta let us have it."
Do you believe all this crap?
I go with my partner.
- What'll it take?
- A wire.
- No.
Two wires.
- Two wires.
"One on the store, one on the house."
"You know I have to get a court order for a wiretap, don't you?"
But you'll try.
"We know you can do it, Walt."
[Chuckles]
Popeye.
You still pickin' your feet in Poughkeepsie?
[Chuckles]
[Man Speaking French]
I can't figure out.
It's some kind of a code.
Code.
Jerry.
Have you been paying your bills?
Well...
I've moved around a lot.
"I haven't had a lot of consistent bills, per se."
But you have a checking account.
You've had one since you were a kid.
mething due on the tenth.
You think Marla and Walker are in on it together?
Marla was telling the truth about wanting to sell Gus' work.
Maybe Walker had money troubles.
Stole his own artwork to sell it on the black market.
So he'd cut Marla out of her share?
What do we know about Walker's background?
Anything out of the ordinary?
Not so far.
(Angela) I know Walker's lying about something.
"Let's take a closer look at him, okay?"
It's funny--
"(Leo) Oh, boy."
Here we go.
What?
"Every time you start a sentence with, ""It's funny,"""
you're about to segue into a story about Dana that has absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about.
That's not true.
"Okay, that's true."
And you've been dressing nicer for the past week or so.
Is that a new shirt?
"Yeah, Dana picked it out for me."
"Cancel your plans for tonight, we're going to keep watch on the whores and catch Niko."
"- Laure, can I talk to you?"
- I don't have time.
Wait!
Stop being angry at me.
"- I'm an honest guy, you know me."
- Really?
You call going behind my back honest?
I didn't go behind your back.
I had an agreement with Bremont so he wouldn't shut down your career and Aubert's.
"He's the one who's after you, Laure, not me."
What?
"- Oh, yes."
"I don't know what you did to him, but he doesn't like you very much."
"Get them now, we're going to start."
Excuse me.
Could you tell Jérôme I'd like to see him?
- I'll be in the changing room.
"- OK, I'll tell him."
What are you doing here?
I came to see the youth worker.
- You've got my money?
- Let me go.
Wait.
"I want my share, you fucker."
Son of a bitch.
You're not entitled to anything.
You chickened out.
"Without me you wouldn't have had the key to the office,"
"- so I want my money, or I'll kill you."
- Get lost!
"Don't show up here unless you have the money, got it?"
One of many.
"Marjorie, please."
What?
She's here.
That's a good thing.
"It is, but I think I have the right to know why she's here and if she's going to stay this time."
Just drop--
"Uh, could you, um, set the dining room table for us, please?"
I cannot believe you!
"Shh, I know."
Shh...
I thought we agreed we'd be a united front.
Yeah.
"Listen, I spent the day with her today."
And I really believe that we all have an opportunity here.
"And, Marjorie, I don't want to drive her away again."
"We have been down this road before and every time-- every time, we fail."
"Yeah, all of us."
But let's-- can we just have some dinner?
As a family?
"Pasta's not overcooked, I hope?"
It's really good.
"So, have you, um... have thought about your plans now that you're home?"
No.
"Well, I'm here,"
If you want help with your resume or if you decide you want to apply to university again.
"Well, I just got back an hour ago."
Of course.
"Um, we can think ahead."
"She is, actually."
Sarah tells me that she wants to pursue art.
"Yeah, maybe even, um, art school."
Why are you making us struggle?
You should have said it from the beginning.
This is great.
What are we going to do about Turan and his gang?
They've been... watching us closely for a very long time.
Who?
These guys?
Excuse me!
What are you looking at?
Give me that ball.
"Come on, get out of here!"
"Yes, is there anything else?"
"Then we are all in, aren't we?"
"Why are you asking me, dude?"
I am already in.
You were the ones who were waiting for Mert.
Her you go.
He's here now.
You've been on my case since I came.
"You're angry, so I am not saying anything."
- Who are you to say anything anyway?
"- Gamze, it's enough."
"Look, it's more important for me than anyone else here to finish school."
Okay?
You won't understand this.
"So, don't drag it out."
Let's get down to business if the old issues are over.
"Kaan, you are the only one who could plan this whole thing."
"Dude, I've never done anything shameful in my whole life."
Alright?
"But my family is calling me a ""shameless man."""
"Okay, I was really angry the other day."
"They did E at the club, then some coke back at her place."
My daughter loves her in those two dance school movies.
Those were Disney movies.
She was just a kid.
And how old is she now?
Old.
Twenty.
Exactly.
Is there a point you're making that I'm missing?
"Look, 99% of 12-year-old girls would kill to be the illegal-drinking,"
"E-popping, club-crawling Chelsea Sennett."
Ain't America grand?
Not if you have a 12-year-old daughter.
How late was Colin here?
About 5:00.
We were just having fun.
He never even mentioned his girlfriend.
What about this boy?
You ever seen him?
The victim helped us with this sketch of her assailant.
I don't know.
He looks like he could be 100 different people.
"Miss Sennett, can I have a word?"
You ever go to Throb?
Or Cushion?
Sure.
What about way back when Cushion was called Class A?
"No, but I hear it kicked."
Mmm.
Legend's always better than the truth.
My partner and I are after a group of burglars working the club circuit.
They target people like you and Colin 'cause you're young and famous and it's easy to track when you stay out late.
It was just a little Nurofen Plus...
LAUGHTER ..sort of size.
Then that worked its way down my trouser leg.
AUDIENCE GROANS
Did you shake it out?
I did.
I kicked it towards Christopher Biggins.
LAUGHTER
Hoped for the best.
Awful.
"But she didn't notice, did she?"
"Well, she gave me that look."
LAUGHTER
"""You shat yourself."" She didn't say anything to me."
Did she shake hands and then push you away?
She's notorious for doing that.
"No, she chatted to everyone, and she got to me and I just got the look and she moved on."
"I think someone had warned her, ""Don't speak to him."""
"Yeah. ""He's a shitter, Ma'am."""
LAUGHTER
"""Move on, Ma'am, he's shat himself."""
LAUGHTER
"all right, fuck this!"
Fuck this!
LAUGHTER
"Whenever I see you, Jack Dee,"
"I remember you being in the Edinburgh Festival and you telling me a story with, like, a really naughty chuckle in your voice, because you'd seen Paul Morocco..."
Do you remember this?
"Yes, I know."
"..Paul Morocco, the famous and quite brilliant juggler..."
Yes.
"..in a bank in Edinburgh, during the festival, trying to cash a cheque and he didn't have any ID, and he was saying, ""But I'm Paul Morocco."
Don't you recognize me?
"In any case, you know that the only real pictures are childhood photos."
What is this picture?
It's an eminent Victorian in a hollywood bed.
There's a special effect here...
The bed appears twice.
"Yes, I made the bed even more hollywood-ish by doubling it."
"I prolonged it, to show this curve."
To make it even more victorian.
"It was taken in London, in a hotel room."
And who is this person?
My husband.
It was taken in London?
"In London, in january."
"At night, as you can see."
This is my friend of mine.
"Whom I photographed here in Paris, nearby actually."
I took off the part I wasn't interested in.
This person is also in a bed?
"No, he was layed back in a couch."
Layed back...
"But he seems floating in a bathtub, no?"
"Yes, yes."
"In the water, in a pool."
He holds a glass of tequila.
I gave him some...
In order for him to relax.
"It worked just a little bit, actually."
I have never seen this one.
This was taken more or less a year ago...
In Montfort I'Amaury.
Actually I wasn't the one who took the picture.
'What Laxminarayan one and Jia got..
..With that they bought their share of restaurant from Munde.'
'Today too Laxmi's mother wants her son to be a shooter.'
'And she tells the same thing to every goon.'
"If this time he fails, he is not his father's son."
Let me tell you.
'Laxminarayan two bought some shares of virus autos..
..With his share and today he is the board of director in that company.'
'And his boss Pipat..'
Pipat.
"- Yes, sir!"
I think we need to talk.
"- Yes, sir."
Sit.
"Sir, on the chair or the sofa?"
- Chair.
Left or right?
- Left.
Your left or my left?
'Laxminarayan three sells underwear..
..And vest in a bus and not in a car.'
'And Laila is his brand ambassador!
'Mayawati Chowtala gave bribe with her share..
..And she has become a jailor.'
"'And her prisoners are Albert, Pinto, papa and Batlya.'"
'Chandu and Chandni have bought the showroom from Laila.'
'And it's heard that they are going to marry soon.'
'But they are still running in the race of life.'
"'To be one, two and three.'"

I'm gonna come back to you.
You promise?
Promise.
Spring cleaning- a curious ritual.
Nicole said it meant time to rid ourselves of things we didn't need anymore.
The first step is reflection.
What's worth keeping?
What's lost its value and can be given away?
"For some, the choice is easy."
"For others, much more difficult."
Wow!
Getting rid of all that.
"Actually, I've gone through, and..."
I like all my things.
I don't want to give them away.
"Oh, Kyle, you don't have to, but... a lot of this stuff has seen its best day."
Look at this t-shirt.
"It's shrunk, it's stained, it's faded."
I wore this the first time Stephen took me to work with him.
Well... this one's torn.
I ripped it playing basketball with Josh.
Great game.
The first gift Lori ever gave me.
Sentimental pack rat.
Great.
We're in trouble.
"Look, this isn't supposed to be torture."
"Consider it a chance to shed your old skin, be someone new."
"Dude, take a load off."
Let's throw this puppy around for a few.
Let me grab the rest of the boxes first.
"Oversteered a little bit, but that's why you gotta--"
Not let him drive?
"What, are you nuts?"
Oh.
"Oh, he was fine."
Dad let us drive.
We turned out okay.
You wanna rephrase that?
"Okay, uh..."
Dad let we drive.
Us turned out okay.
"Is that what you're looking for, grammar police?"
"Rusty, you can't disappoint a kid, then make up for it by stuffing him with ribs and taking him out to do something illegal and dangerous."
Oh. (Chuckles) Brick's happy.
"Sure, until the next thing comes along that you miss."
"Look, you're in and out of our lives, and I get tired of making excuses about where you are or why you're not around."
The kids ask about you.
"I say, ""oh, you know Uncle Rusty,"""
but they don't.
Brick.
"(Clears throat) Listen, uh..."
"You know, just 'cause I don't, uh, show up for things, well, that-- that doesn't mean that I don't care for ya."
"Hey, I got ribs, bowling, a driving lesson, and extra credit."
I'm all good.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
Same goes for you.
(Door creaks)
"(Switch clicks) Hello, mother."
(Gasps)
Is there something you'd like to tell me?
I'm sorry!
(Panting)
I don't know.
"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
- I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
And... guess what?
- What?
- I'm done.
I've sewn myself up.
- Huh.
"- You did great, buddy."
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
"- Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."
Fun fact:
"Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth."
"- Oof, poor Jake."
"- Uhh, this might be the Ambies speaking, but this in-flight movie sucks."
"- So, uh, you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh?"
Aren't they a little young for that?
- They're four.
"- Nikolaj is four, but we're sticking with the car seat as long as possible, but you know me--"
"I'm a ""safety at all costs"" kind of dad."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom."
- We just stopped for gas.
I asked you if you had to go.
- I didn't have to then.
- So does this van have side-impact airbags?
- Not in the back.
- Oh.
Yes.
Only such a handsome man could have sent such marvelous flowers.
"Thank you, mademoiselle."
L- i wonder if you'd care to join me in a bottle of wine at the astor house?
Just we two alone?
Just we two alone.
But we'll have to hurry.
Fleurique is ready.
We go.
"Good night, my dear."
"Uh, we better go this way."
Come in.
Mademoiselle fleurique in?
She's gone to the astor house.
"Well, already."
Well- with that fool mr.
"Fisk, who sent her these."
What does that fool mr.
Fisk look like?
"Tall, dark, kind of handsome."
He's going to have a peck of trouble on his hands tonight.
Everybody that has any truck with her has got trouble.
"Look at this room, will you?"
She threw all these things at me.
"Peppery, ain't she?"
"Oh, she'd throw anything anywhere."
I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't blow up at the astor house.
"If she treats you that way, why do you stick?"
It's a long walk back to illinois.
"Excuse me, please."
"Besides, if you want something real bad, you've got to take some hard knocks to get it."
You've learned a lot for a young lady.
You're my ex-husband's girlfriend's father.
I mean...
isn't that a little weird?
Give it one more chance.
One date.
"And if it's still weird, we'll just give it one more chance."
"Oh, you're her father."
"But when I'm with you, I'm not thinking about Old Christine."
What-- who?
"Oh, sorry, it's just that I've known my daughter longer, so"
"I refer to you as New Christine, which makes her Old Christine."
"Well, one more date wouldn't kill me."
"So... second date wasn't so bad, was it?"
No.
"In fact, I think it was better than our first date."
Wonder what's going to happen on our third date?
"Well, I'll give you a little hint:"
If it's anything like my previous third dates... you might want to work on your home run trot.
So you're still feeling okay about everything?
"Yeah, you know, so what if it's a little weird."
"Yeah, some of my best relationships have been a little weird."
"And when it's just us, not weird at all."
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
"- Hey, Daddy."
"- Hey, Christine."
"- Hey, Christine."
"- Hey, Christine."
"- Hey, Christine."
"- Hey, Richard."
"- Hey, Mom."
"- Hey, Ritchie."
"Which is good, 'cause we can use it."
We're going to have to get
My dad thinks we should get off the streets.
Why ?
Did he hear something ?
About aftershocks or looters or...
Zombies ?
"I know, that was my first thought, too."
"But no, it's just a precaution."
It's Ryan.
Is everyone okay ?
"Yeah, we just have to make a little change of plans."
Hmm ?
"* California, here we come *"
* Right back where we started from *
* California...
California... *
Your dad said to go home.
But I think we should all be together.
This is a bad idea.
We're almost there.
"No, we're not."
It's just a few more minutes.
"Well, I know where my house is okay ?"
"Look, I command you to stop this bike."
"I'm sorry, okay but I'm starting to get a little creeped out."
"Not that I don't want to play Pictionary by candlelight and raid Taylor's Apocalypse kit, but I think we should just go to your house."
"Okay, but I'm still awaiting on news of Pancakes."
Pancakes ?
You said Ryan said everyone was fine.
"I know, but I don't know that he included rodents in his head count, so I texted him to be sure."
And ?
We've got time before school to see what's on this.
"- Okay, you'll be standing in a line."
- _
"Shoulders back, like this."
That's good.
"And, as you're introduced, you'll step up."
"Look, I've upgraded from texting to voice-mail to further express my level of ""you are so dead."""
"(SIGHS) I bite the bullet and I tell my dad about you, then you ghost?"
"That is not getting back together, Jake."
This is all very strange.
Call me.
"Hey, I know we don't really know each other, but this Lady of the Lake Pageant does not seem like your thing."
My dad is making me.
Maddox pride.
"So, then, he'll be your escort?"
"Oh, I haven't even thought about that."
"Um, no."
Who has their dad as their escort?
"Uh, I do. (CHUCKLES)"
And I avoid all high school guy drama.
Win-win.
"Oh, please."
Everybody knows you have a crush on Noah.
You practically give him eye baths in psych class.
"- Okay, no, I do not do that."
- A little bit.
"Okay, well, maybe there's a world where I think Noah is kind of cool."
- Happy?
- (SCOFFS)
Hold that thought.
WOMAN:
"Okay, ladies, grab a worksheet."
Why are you singing that...?
"Oh, my God."
You just had sex.
"No, I didn't."
I was peeing.
I thought I made that clear.
"No, no, no, no."
That's your sex song.
You always sing it after you... perform your act.
"- No, I don't."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Who are you talking to, buddy?"
I was there.
"When we were married, I heard it many, many times."
And then not so much at the end.
"- All right, so I had sex."
- Yep.
Christine and I have been dating for over three months.
You can't be surprised.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not surprised."
"I mean, I never really thought about it."
"But, hey, if you want to jump into the sack with the first girl who comes along, be my guest."
Be... my... guest.
"Actually, she's not the first."
"Right after you and I split up, I got one under my belt."
"""Under your belt""?"
"What are you, a pirate?"
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
"Obviously, you haven't had any and you're a little..."
"Anyway, it's nothing to be ashamed of."
"We've been divorced for two years, which means you haven't had sex in... just over three years."
That's not what I mean.
I told her many times that she should be writing her own book.
So why are you giving this now?
I could because I was afraid I'd hurt her.
It'll be enough for a year.
"Until she can support herself by writing novels,"
I'll sponsor her.
- Take it back.
- Jae Min.
I've never told her I'd sponsor her so that she could write her own material.
"And even if I did, she'd never accept it."
You still don't know her at all.
You want to forget it with this?
You want to make me into some kind of matchmaker?
Should I take half and give the other half to her?
"Fine, the you that I know isn't that kind of person."
But this is an insult to the feelings she had for you.
She isn't someone you can console with money.
"Yeah, you're right."
I didn't think.
I was hoping you'd help.
How is she?
She's doing well.
She's strong.
"The harder it is, the stronger she acts."
I know.
How are you?
I'm just... being dragged along.
Let's get up.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Where's your car?
Why didn't you tell Mother that?
I didn't think of it.
"I'm a cowardly, despicable person."
For twenty years all I thought about was how to avoid being despised by your mother.
"And then one day, all of a sudden, a thick barrier had grown around her heart."
Forgive Mother.
I'm the one that has to be forgiven.
"What are you going to do, Shinako?"
Are you going to go live with your Mother?
"If she's going to live with Takehara, I'll stay with you."
I'd feel sorry for you.
The people who are really burned in all this are you and Takao.
So you've made up your mind?
You should leave that house.
That would be the thing for you to do.
He doesn't deserve to be with you.
I don't want you to insult him.
"Oh my, aren't we complex?"
"Ok, I won't insult him."
So are you going to build that studio?
I'm not going to see you again.
You're terrible!
This is really too much.
It's late.
Please go home.
"Mrs., listen."
waited twenty years.
So did I.
What are you doing?
I'm going to call someone.
Mrs.!
Let me go.
"Let's get another tube in, keep pumping in the saline."
We need to get her BP up.
- What can I tell them?
"- Nothing, say nothing!"
"Just get him here, fast."
Ready to insert the left tube.
Got no response to stimulus at any of the extremities.
"Right pupil's blown, left is slow to dilate."
We need to get her...
- She's in V-tach.
- Damn it!
"Who the hell was she chasing, anyway?"
Lanagan Pike; fell into a shallow pool of water and sodium hydrochloride.
"Burns to the right side, deep laceration to the left thigh."
"Frig, man, that burns!"
I need that one for questioning.
- You can have him when I'm done.
- A police officer's been injured.
"1, 2, 3, up."
Backstage is off limits!
"Listen, man, just get Yannick."
"Yannick knows her, man!"
"Her name is Natasha, she has brown eyes, she's a dancer in there,"
"- Yannick knows her, she's totally sweet..."
"- Hey, hey!"
- Take a walk.
"- Dude, listen to me."
"I'm sorry about what I said about your lack of neck that was hurtful, OK?"
"But I gotta find her, man, you gotta help me!"
"Dude, come on!"
"Trust me, you're better off."
You?
How many chances do you think you'll get to be a dickhead?
One more?
Wrong.
You're a nasty little virgin.
See ya.
"Right, fair enough."
OK.
"Best of a bad lot, deal with what we've got."
"I need you, we're in trouble."
I'm off.
Only popped in to check out your missus.
"Well, thanks for popping by and ruining my love life."
No problem.
I hope you and your ignorant boss get a good laugh out of it.
I'll tell you who'll be laughing last!
Me!
Cos I'm not the one who'll be working in a shitty garage doing manual labour for the rest of my life.
See you Monday.
No you won't!
Because I'll be at a local paper.
"That's right, a local newspaper."
"So my date, yes, date, was a disaster."
But at least my friends weren't hiding in the toilet.
"Oh, they were."
There was only one person for saving us now.
"Thanks for stepping in, mate!"
I was going to dive when you put your cock away.
"- Budge up a minute Jay, I need a piss."
"- You're not pissing in here, Neil."
- Why not?
It's a toilet.
- Go outside if you have to.
Tell your father that they're coming back around.
He's been shot.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
"You know what to do, right?"
"Keep pressure on the wound, and there should be some morphine syrettes in the, uh, supplies I gave you."
"Yeah, we've got it."
"Listen, Jake."
People are gonna be looking to you now.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
"Okay, the guys will be back."
They retreated to Talbot's farm.
"My guess is, they're waiting for reinforcements, so you should have a little time to regroup out there."
"Just keep the radio close, and I'll update you."
Out.
Out.
"Um, please, I need a doctor, whoever's in charge."
Right over there.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Colonel Hoffman.
"You don't have to call me sir, not unless you plan to enlist."
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.
It's planning to overrun the town of Jericho.
People are gonna get killed.
"They tried to kill me, but I got away."
You've got to help these people.
Where is this?
"Kansas, not far from the Colorado border."
I wish I could help.
My orders are to secure the roads in this area.
I am certified to this state as a Supreme Court judge...
... andyou'resittinghere rearguing a 2-year-old case.
"You're out of line, and I'll so inform the mayor."
I'm here on the mayor's behalf.
You think I've slept the last two nights?
Don't you realize I know what a mistake I made?
That's it.
Satisfied?
No basement or anything?
"You saw it, the rumpus room."
With the pool table?
"That's right, captain."
I'm only doing my job.
I'm very sorry--
"Oh, sorry, crap!"
You're snooping around like a Nazi.
Please.
You know this is the last thing I wanted to do.
"Then get the hell out of internal Affairs, and get an honest job."
Marybeth?
Two-bars has been here all morning.
He went over the place from top to bottom.
You gotta do something about Eddie's pension.
They're gonna reduce it.
What about the Police Memorial Award?
The precinct says it goes to the next of kin.
"Well, this piece of brass isn't here to give me any award."
"$40,000 in cash was found in Detective Santos' strongbox..."
... hereathissummercottage in Ulster County.
Emergency Service Unit workers... .
Frank?
"Yeah, I'm up at the cabin."
I love you and won't allow it.
"You say you love me, but talk about allowing me to leave!"
Things between men and women will not change.
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him.
He's fine!
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!
Over!
At this moment I feel no love for you at all.
"I never thought that would ever happen, but it has."
Kay...
We're leaving tomorrow.
Why don't you take the kids back to their room?
"-Michael, you haven't heard me."
"-Kay, what do you want from me?"
"Do you expect me to let you go, to let you take my children from me?"
Don't you know me?
Don't you know that that's an impossibility?
That I'd use all my power to keep that from happening?
Don't you know that?
Kay...
"In time, you'll feel differently."
You'll be glad I stopped you now.
I know that.
I know you blame me for losing the baby.
Yes.
I know what that meant to you.
Which of these two do you prefer?
I don't know.
Try them both.
One for each window.
"Don't be silly, darling."
It's as much your problem as it is mine.
- I know.
- These curtains are for your den.
My den?
"What's this, Sergeant?"
Buying a trousseau?
We're buying curtains.
"I thought it was for underpants, the kind civilians wear in the tea business."
Will you two leave and stop annoying Tommy?
"I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off to Tantrapur in 20 minutes... and Tommy's marching with us."
But Higginbotham's replacing him.
The Colonel said...
"Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss."
"I grieve to say, Miss, that the man is a tower of pain."
- Something he must have ate.
- Or drank?
"Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!"
- Tommy.
"- It's the Colonel's orders, Miss."
"Tommy, these friends of yours have engineered this behind your back."
"Don't cry, darling."
Goodbye.
This is May 9.
"I'm going with you for five days, and good company I'll be... but at sunset on May 14, when my time is up... wherever we are, I'm going to knock you two apes' heads together."
Now come on.
"- Pardon me, madam."
- Fall in!
Gina Linetti is the real hero here.
- But isn't Gina Linetti more of a state of mind?
"Like, in a way, we were all Gina Linetti today."
"Gina, let's take this Gina to the hospital."
"Hey, how's the sheriff?"
"- Well, he keeps yelling, ""Disability for life!"""
So I think he's fine.
"Also, Coral Palms PD found your marshal at Figgis's hideout, alive at well."
"- Oh, that's great."
- Yeah.
How are you doing?
"- Fine--you know, just getting bandaged up."
"Actually, can you give us a second?"
Thanks.
It hurts so bad.
I just didn't want to seem weak in front of EMT Craig.
"- So I know this is weird to say, because I just shot you, but it feels like we're back in sync now."
"- Yeah, I mean, as in sync as I've ever been with someone who just shot me."
- I love you.
- I love you too.
"Hey, do you happen to know my blood type?"
- Yeah.
B positive.
"- Well, guessed wrong."
"Hey, Craig?"
"- Hey, Captain Stentley, we're back."
- How was Florida?
- It was fine.
- A lot of college girls.
"- Come on, man."
"- Now, before you say anything,"
I know we disobeyed a direct order.
[ Shaky Voice ] I am glad he's gone.
- As am I.
- B'oh!
It's probably my imagination... but something about them didn't seem quite right.
Really?
Excuse me for just a moment.
"People, that was all wrong!"
"Homer Simpson doesn't say ""B'oh."" He says--"
"""D'oh."""
"[ British Accent ] Sorry, M.B., but I'm having trouble with this character."
Is he supposed to have some kind of neurological impairment... like Rain Man or Awakenings?
"I mean, what the hell am I doing here?"
And this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of Murphy Brown.
"[ Low Voice ] Hey, you know we're getting into golden time?"
"Yes, well,just get it right... or you'll all be back doing Come Blow Your Horn at the Westport Dinner Theater."
All right then.
Let's see what the old Simpson family is up to now.
Duh-oh!
"[ Groans ] That's them, all right."
I can't believe it.
I guess you're the only one I can trust.
- Hmm?
Hmm?
- Dad?
- [ Bone Snaps ]
- Oh!
That rib always breaks.
[ Groaning ]
"Lisa, what are you doing?"
"Just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction... that Bart's absence has left in our hearts."
- [ Yelps ]
"- That's sweet, honey."
Wednesdays?
Goni?
"Come take the stool, sweetie."
What does he need the stool for?
- Why are you taking the stool?
I understood the Russian.
"The stool is mine, I brought it and I'm taking it."
"Goni, we're leaving."
Aren't we waiting for Mommy?
She'll come in a minute.
Why are you taking the magazines?
"When you were a baby, we lived in a small apartment and there was no room for all my things, so I asked Grandma and Grandpa to keep them for me."
Why are you taking them now?
Because now there's room in our apartment.
And we don't need any favors.
"It's okay, sweetie."
Why did you have to do that?
- Because I wanted to.
You do it to spite my mother?
"Yes, I direct little operettas and do things to spite her."
Don't start with that.
"I will start with that, I've had it."
"Do whatever you want, but not in front of the child."
I have no problem with it being in front of the child.
Hi.
Where should I put it?
- Anywhere.
Thanks for bringing everything back.
You're paying.
"- Yes, I'm paying."
There's more.
How do you feel?
"A jerk and Greek bro, and the rest of Omega Chi."
I had a lot of good times there.
It's gonna be a hard decision.
"I don't want it to be about you, or Evan or my dad."
"You know, I just gotta... do what feels right."
Or you'd be picking Kappa Tau.
Need a drink?
"I could use 'bout a million drinks, I've been running around all night."
What do you want?
Sparta hooch?
"Actually, I brought my own."
Nice flask.
"Sorry, I crossed the line, I didn't mean to..."
Apology accepted.
To a long and meaningful friendship.
"Right, friendship."
I gotta go back upstairs.
Find someone.
"Which is why I think in many ways,"
Ferris Bueller is my generation's Gatsby.
So... do you think that Gatsby is really great or just a totally decent guy?
Would you excuse me?
I need to find a bathroom.
I don't think you're heading in the right direction.
Sure I am.
I've seen a lot of people round here.
"Maybe you should use the one upstairs, it's much nicer."
- There's pot pourri.
- That won't be necessary.
"No, you can't go in there."
- Why not?
- A girl got sick.
So this is a test run to see if i can handle things
And not slip back into my old habits again.
"Well, speaking of handling things,"
I don't know how your mother's gonna handle
Seeing you after the way you two parted.
"Oh, she's been going through a very rough time lately."
But seeing you like this is gonna make her happy.
- I know it is.
"- I don't know, grandma."
We haven't spoken in months
And you know she wasn't really that happy with me
The last time we saw each other.
"Well, like you said, that was months ago."
We'll just have to see how she handles things today.
"Oh, she..."
Seeing you is gonna make her happy.
I just know it.
"mom, let me in."
I left my keys.
"Oh, y'all go and hide in the hall closet."
I'll see how she's feeling before you come in.
"mom, let me in."
- Where's your key?
- I don't know.
I forgot 'em.
- Oh.
"- Hey, mom,"
"So, ma, is that marcus's car out there?"
"Well, there's a lot of cars that look like marcus's car."
So that's...
I-I...
I thought...
Do you see how low that is?
I used to be able to touch my knee to my nose.
Without having sex?
Hah!
My career is so over.
Thank God I'm getting...
"Oh,my God,my ring is gone!"
Now don't freak out.
I'm not freaking out.
You know I'm great at this.
I'm not freaking out.
A earring?
No.
Engagement ring.
"I'd ask you to help,but I doubt you know what one looks like and I don't have time to draw you a picture."
You always underestimate me.
"Seriously,dude,I almost peed my pants."
Thank you!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I'm starving.
Thought maybe you'd join me for brunch.
Forever?
I don't think it'll take that long.
"Elliot,I don't want to just be your girlfriend."
What makes you think being your half girlfriend's making me any happier?
You're not hating me as much.
"I want a life partner, not bi-weekly sex and a hangout buddy."
"I'm on the soul mate path,man."
No stopping or standing.
I don't want you to come to the wedding with me.
And I don't want to see you anymore unless it's about Rufus.
"But, brant's bio is not exactly call sparking."
"But, brant's bio is not exactly call sparking."
"He is a bit of a loner, but he's a solid agent."
The FBI is the only family he's got.
His parents were a horror story.
I don't give a shit about his family life.
Can we trust him?
"Sir, when I started out I worked in the field with brant."
"He'd run through a wall for you if he believes in you, but you betray him, you don't want to be on the same fucking planet."
You don't want to be on the same fucking planet.
"Wonder boy or not, I'm putting back up on this case."
You're the boss.
"So, so what kind of job?"
"Oh, don't worry Nick."
It's an easy job.
Easy.
Choose one.
"Easy job, huh?"
Don't you have a regular guy for this?
Don't you have a regular guy for this?
He's not with us anymore.
We must all make adjustments.
Let's go.
Wonderful.

Or did Kiefer say something to you before our dispatch?
You dying scares me the most.
"Hey, c'mon!"
What?
!
"Welp, I'm off to fetch water."
We're off to the woods to gather some firewood.
What about the tents?
"Take care of it while we're out, okay?"
"Ah, it's so nice and clear out today, huh?"
"Good luck, Ryner!"
Then I guess I'll get an afternoon nap.
Ryner...
"Ryner, would you run away with me?"
"Come on, come with me."
Not with Sion.
With me...
What are you talking about?
"I care for you, Ryner."
I've always cared for you.
"Even though it was hopeless, I couldn't help falling for you."
"Ryner, you don't like me, do you?"
"Oh, come off it, Kiefer."
Joking around at a time like this?
"Yeah, you're right."
I guess I can't have anything.
"- No, I didn't mean..."
"- Even so, I didn't want you to die."
"I'm sorry, Ryner."
I couldn't protect you.
I offer up this contract to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps within the atmosphere!
This is worrying!
Do we really have to wait for His Majesty's decision?
"Sometimes it cannot be helped, Your Highness."
Those blasted rascals
"Everytime the Hans come around, we have to swallow our dignity."
How long is this going to last?
Hey Mu-Song.
What?
Do you want to know why someone like me can make it this far without wife and children?
That's because
I dedicated my entire life to this Iron Workshop.
"This Workshop is my wife, my children."
Now they want me to put it out of service.
Isn't that like asking me to kill my wife and children?
My condolences.
The only one who take all these sorrow away is Prince Ju-Mong.
"Prince Ju-Mong, please you must become Crown Prince and extinguish this misery for Mo Pal-Mo."
Hey watch what you're saying!
What if someone hears you?
and drink less of that wine!
Bug off!
I know I'm right.
"No matter what,"
The only person fit to be Crown Prince is Prince Ju-Mong!
I said shut it!
You rascals!
What did you say?
What about Ju-Mong?
Are you itching for death?
"Your Highness, IronSmith Leader... he's drunk"
He only said that out of brashness
Please forgive us!
Okay.
"Oh, yes."
One minor note here.
Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.
Wait a minute here!
What do you mean the party?
's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losing' her marbles?
"Well, obviously she wanted to have the party?"
before the move.
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favourite since kindergarten.
"Hey, hey."
"Come on, Potato Head."
"If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me."
Woody has never steered us wrong before.
"Come on, guys."
Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
"But what ifAndy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?"
I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!
"Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced."
This is Andy we're talking about.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.
"That's what we're made for, right?"
Pardon me.
"I hate to break up the staff meeting, but... they're here!"
Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Take your mind off it.
"Think about something else, something nice."
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Anything nice.
How about that boy up in Seattle?
There ain't no boy in Seattle.
- There isn't?
- I made that up.
- Why did you do that?
- How should I know?
I don't know half the reasons I do things.
The only boyfriend I ever had banged me on the floor of a caboose in a Western Pacific rail yard.
- Watch your language.
- That is the right language.
Sure wasn't love.
He promised he would take me to Reno.
But he lied.
Then my father found out about it and there was this big scandal.
He decided to get me out of town as fast as he could.
That's why I was in the mail plane in the middle of winter.
That was OK because they didn't want to see me.
I didn't want to see them either.
"Don't cry, Tillie, you're not the type."
"- Yes, I am."
- Sh...
Underneath.
You're the one that called me a jinx.
"Yeah, but I took that back, didn't I?"
My father...
My father told me I was spoiled merchandise.
- That I was ruined for life.
"Well, it, uh, it pays the bills."
"Nah, you guys just read a bunch of crap from cards, right?"
"Cold in the east, a storm right."
It looks like rain.
Aah!
It's more complicated than that.
Let me askyou
- I'm trying to plan my birthday in a couple of months.
Can you tell me if it's going to be a nice day?
"Oh, right, hey, nice meeting you."
Always great to know a fan.
Your name was?
- Dale.
- Dale.
- Yeah.
- The thug?
"So, Russ, i just want to apologize about the last time we spoke."
I wasn't really feeling good.
I was feeling sort of vulnerable.
"I had fear issues come up, being arrested and all."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Plus, I was drinking, which I'm really not supposed to do, you know, on the medication."
"- Oh, I see."
- Can I have some of these?
"- Yeah, go ahead."
"- You know, it wasn't a good moment."
I just wanted to make an amends.
"Hey, listen, don't you worry."
"The truth is, I should be apologizing to you."
"I was gonna call about the $10,000, but the station got so busy."
"Don't worry about the ten grand, Russell."
- It's water under the bridge.
"Sit down, lover boy."
Don't be conspicuous.
Thank you.
"Merle, you remember Danny Pierce."
I guess so.
"Miss Telford, I hope I'm not intruding again."
I guess not.
"Well, did you get all your pictures?"
"No, not yet."
I'll shoot them in the dressing rooms.
That's gonna kill half the afternoon.
At least I have a job.
"Oh, sticks and stones will break my bones, but unemployment will never hurt me."
"Why don't you try and be amusing for Merle while I go to work, hmm?"
"Hello, darling."
I feel sick.
It'll pass.
- You kissed her.
- Just on the cheek.
"If I don't stay friends with her, how will I see you?"
I could meet you just the same.
How?
Your aunt never lets you out of the house.
"And even if she does, that chauffeur follows you everywhere he goes."
"Oh, pooh on Corbett."
I can fool him any time I want to.
"Once, maybe, but you'd never get out again."
"If you'd just let me come to the house, I could convince Aunt Olivia--"
No!
"Look, baby, you're 21 years old."
Not till next Saturday.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
AND CATCH A CHOPPER TO THE MAINLAND.
YOU GET YOUR BOTTOM TO SCHOOL.
"AND, CODY, GIVE IT TIME."
YOU'LL FIND YOUR PLACE.
Optimus Prime:
"HEATWAVE, CHASE, BLADES, BOULDER."
"AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION,"
I HAVE CHOSEN YOUR NEW MISSION.
NICE.
"WE ARE HAPPY TO JOIN THE BATTLE, SIR."
"SO, WHEN DO WE ROLL OUT?"
YOU DO NOT.
"AS PERHAPS THE LAST RESCUE BOTS IN EXISTENCE,"
"YOU ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET,"
AS WELL AS LEARN FROM THEM.
YOU MEAN WE'LL INTERACT WITH HUMANS?
YOU WILL BE AMBASSADORS TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET --
THE FIRST AUTOBOTS TO LIVE WITH A HUMAN FAMILY.
"STUDY THEIR CUSTOMS, OBEY THEIR RULES,"
AND WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP THIS PLANET SAFE.
"DURING THIS MISSION, YOU FOUR MUST APPEAR TO THE HUMANS"
"AS MACHINES, ROBOTS IN DISGUISE."
WHAT?
WHILE THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
"ARE COMFORTABLE WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,"
THE IDEA THAT ALIEN BEINGS ARE LIVING AMONG THEM
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CAUSE PANIC.
SO WE CAN HELP THE HUMANS AS LONG AS WE HIDE OUR TRUE SELVES?
"YOU ARE RIGHT TO QUESTION WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR TEAM, HEATWAVE."
THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO LEAD THIS MISSION.
"TO MAINTAIN YOUR COVER,"
YOU WILL EACH ADOPT A VEHICLE MODE BASED ON EARTH TECHNOLOGY.
- That was funny.
Remember how much fun we had because we weren't outside for once?
And we were just all girls for once.
- It was the only day off that I had.
- I know.
That was great.
It was the only day I could kind of walk around.
- What'd you do that day?
- I slept late because I was on the weird night schedule.
So I slept basically half a day away.
And then got up and maybe got some food or something.
I think I hung out with my friends.
"If you really wanna know, she actually supported our music and our band when nobody else did, not that that's any of your business."
"- Okay, forget it."
I can't do this.
- Do what?
Just make a U-turn and take me back to Ludlow.
I'll find my own way.
- Perfect.
- I refuse to be the goodie bag at your party.
- You don't have to yell.
It's not a train station.
We're in a car.
- Just drop me off.
- I will.
"Oh, my God!"
Are you crazy?
"Mike, is this the night somebody confused you for...?"
- Denzel.
- Denzel Washington.
"- That's right, that's the night."
- What do you mean?
"I was watching him, disgraceful."
Fancy a man of that class daring to put his hand on a lady's knee!
"- Ah, well done, Barnes."
- Thank you.
"Thank you, Barnes."
I'll give you one.
I'll give you one.
'Twas a dirty night and a dirty trick
When a ship turned over in the Atlantic...
They'll be here all night at this rate.
(Chuckles) It's the toffs entertaining the workers.
What about us?
We're workers.
Pearls before swine.
They were guzzling that fine wine as if it were beer.
"It's a topsy-turvy world, James."
Have a glass of port.
(Laughter and applause)
"All right, I will."
Pass the cigars.
Can I 'ave some raspberryade?
* So I pulled her into bed and I covered up her head
"* Just to save her from the foggy, foggy dew"
* Now I am a bachelor I live with my son
* And we work at the weaver's trade
"* And every, every time I look into his eyes"
* He reminds me of that fair young maid
* He reminds me of the summertime
* And of the winter too
"* And the many, many times that I held her in my arms"
"* Just to save her from the foggy, foggy dew *"
"Bravo, Charles!"
Right.
The thing.
"Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that."
"Afterwards, I thought it through and..."
- l can see how you got upset about it.
"- No, I wasn't upset."
"Some girls wouldn't be, but you're not like that, so..."
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
"No, it's really okay."
"I mean, it wasn't a problem."
I really didn't think about it.
"I mean, I did think about it, and I thought..."
maybe what you were saying wasn't so wrong.
"- No, it was really wrong."
- Why?
And I just want to let you know that if it will make you feel better...
I'm just going to make it real clear that...
I don't have any real interest in you or anything.
You know.
So they'll stop saying all that.
"That I barely even know you, which is of course true..."
"and that basically, you and I mean nothing to each other."
So that should solve the problem.
Thanks.
"It's the least I could do, you know."
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing out here?
It's what I always do. I can't make it through a whole day in there.
- l know what you mean.
- Yeah.
"♪ I can't go for that, no, no can do ♪"
I was already on edge.
"The day before, I was with my mom at the park when some guy on a bike swiped her phone."
He must have been a criminal mastermind.
He struck the one second she wasn't taking pictures of Joe.
"The worst part is, I saw him grab it."
"I had a chance to do something and be a hero to my mom, but I froze."
"What would you have done, made him the subject of a satirical cartoon?"
Hey!
"Uh, they've taken down presidents."
"Now, can you just support me here?"
There are only so many moments a son has a chance to...
"- Blah, blah, blah, blah."
- Very mature.
Pick a fight then tune me out?
- It's not bothering me.
- Stop it!
"Dad, turn down that song!"
♪ No can do ♪
"You sure, Manny?"
Positive.
I-I'll walk home.
- We almost died.
- Yeah.
White.
"Yes, I'm sure."
Why is it so hard for you to imagine that a criminal can be white when most of the...
"Ah, the bicycle."
"Yes, yes, it was white."
I thought your phone got stolen?
This is Joe's phone.
This is why the terrorists hate us.
"Hurry, Lars!"
"What is it, Mr. Svenson?"
Somebody complained the radio in Number 3 had been on loud all night.
"I went in to check, and-"
"- Hurry, Lars!"
## [continues]
There.
[music stops]
Who is it?
Name is Somers.
"Well, go on, call an ambulance."
I already phoned the doctor.
What for?
"If your head was bashed in like that, you'd be dead, too."
[Man on radio] Mr. Somers had driven up from Long Beach and registered at the Windmill Motel in the Danish section of the Valley around 7:00 last evening.
"Police are believed to be following several leads in the peaceful, placid little suburb of Los Angeles"
[radio shuts off]
Just a rehash of that 7 a.m. broadcast you heard.
Looks like Axel is one of the leads the police are following.
"That's why I thought we'd better get out here, Della."
Why don't you go over and order us some aebliskive?
Beg pardon?
Danish pastry.
"I shouldn't be upstairs too long, then we may have a better idea of just how much time we'll be spending here."
[knocking]
Hello.
I'm Perry Mason.
"Oh, Mr. Mason."
It's so good you're here.
"Come in, come in."
"[Axel] Lisa, who comes?"
"Hello, Axel."
That was it.
"Alright, keep your eyes open."
"Because they're busting my balls about this bastard, alright?"
"Okay, everybody, let's eat."
I want my money.
I want my money.
He owes it.
"Otherwise, pitch baseball cards."
We gotta real problem.
You know that thing we took care of upstate?
-Paulie was just talking about that.
-We gotta get it outta there.
They just sold the property they want to make it into condominiums.
"-Jimmy, it's been six months."
"-I don't care how long it's been, we gotta get it outta there right away."
"Henry, hurry up."
My mother's making fried peppers and sausage for us.
"-Henry, here's an arm."
"-Very funny, guys."
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.
"What do you like, the leg or the wing Henry?"
Or you still go for the old hearts and lungs?
"Oh, that's so bad."
What happened to the car?
"I hit a skunk Karen, all right?"
Go with your mother.
"It's disgusting, Henry."
I set up Janice in an apartment around the corner from the Suite.
That way I was able to stay over a couple nights a week.
My new antique lamp.
Karen was home with the kids.
Yeah.
Ella used to hate him.
I can remember she threw his latest novel clear across our bedroom.
She was so angry.
"But, uh, look at you."
You've turned her around.
How'd you manage to do that?
A silent auction.
For charity.
When are you supposed to see Toby?
"Tomorrow, while Jenna's at her music lesson."
- Take it.
- No.
"No, you take it."
The storm has passed.
What was going on with you two?
"Okay, so, you know how I went to that museum with Ezra?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, A tried to get Hanna to ruin it."
Ruin it how?
A gave me another ticket and made me give it to Aria's mom.
"God, Hanna, why didn't you tell us what was happening?"
"Well, I tried to stop it."
"I mean, her mom's car didn't just stall."
"Caleb fixed it to keep from getting there, and that's why I owe him."
He's the one who's been breaking into vending machines at school.
"I mean, he's practically living there."
In school?
"Oh, they found his stuff, so he's not sleeping there anymore."
He's sleeping in my basement.
Wait.
Rewind that a little for me.
"I'll make it up to you, Kay."
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I'll...
I'm going to change.
I'll change.
I've learned that I have the strength to change.
Then you'll forget about this miscarriage and we'll have another child.
"And we'll go on, you and I."
-We'll go on.
"-Oh, Michael!"
"Michael, you are blind."
It wasn't a miscarriage.
It was an abortion.
"An abortion, Michael."
Just like our marriage is an abortion.
Something that's unholy and evil!
"I didn't want your son, Michael!"
I wouldn't bring another one of your sons into this world!
"It was an abortion, Michael."
It was a son and I had it killed because this must all end!
I know now that it's over.
I knew it then.
"There would be no way, Michael, no way you could ever forgive me."
"Not with this Sicilian thing that's been going on for 2,000..."
-You won't take my children.
-I will.
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.
"Fredo, give this to Grandmother."
"Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino."
Allow me the honor of introducing someone.
"My partner in America, in New York."
"I love you, too."
Bye.
Oh...
I hate lying to my father.
But I am good at it.
"Well, this is a new Alex."
Bad Alex.
Lying-and-sneaking-behind-your-father's-back Alex.
I'm only sneaking around because there's nothing to tell him yet.
"Oh, right."
Nothing to tell.
"What was all that stuff in the hallway, then?"
You two were undressing each other with your eyes.
Were not.
"Come on, you did such a thorough job of it I could see you both naked."
"By the way, he has love handles."
Not from my angle.
"Look at me, I'm like a giddy schoolgirl."
And over what?
One kiss.
What's one kiss?
I'll tell you.
Paris.
I was an art student.
She was a sculptress.
"After one kiss, I was hopelessly in love."
"Oh, I didn't know you were so romantic."
"Yeah, well, the French bitch cured me of that pretty quickly."
She dumped me after the second date.
Maybe I am getting a little ahead of myself here.
"For all I know, he takes every girl he meets on a motorcycle ride."
"Before you stick your neck out any further, you might want to find out exactly where you stand with him."
I don't see any dirty footprints.
I think it's safe to assume that our friend didn't stroll in here on his own.
"You look happy to see me,boss."
"Oh,the coffee."
Ran the military id our local leo's got off the body.
Lance corporalames finn.
Stationed at quantico.
Went ua when his unit was shipped to iraq six months ago.
Looks like he's got a pretty good reason for not showing.
Find out where he was buried.
"It won't be far,mcgee."
"Had e trip been longer, some bits would have fallen off."
"Okay,I'll check the backyard."
Scene's not going to skeh itself.
"Perhaps it would be better if you fetched the gurney,Mr. Palmer."
I've seen all I need to see here.
"Yes,doctor."
It's a tidy crime scene.
Quite.
It appears to be a body drop.
"A tertiary crime scene,or quaternary, or quinary..."
I could go on.
"Oh,you did."
It's an odd decorating choice.
Alough the corpse does give the place a certain lived-in look.
You can see he brushed the dirt off his face.
"- Oh,geez!"
- Hello.
Sorry.
Nicrophorus americanus.
"So known as ""the carrion beetle."
""" In here,you little mkey."
I was just thinking about you.
That's nice.
I like the sound of that.
It's the craziest thing.
"All my life, the only thoughts I had were about one person."
Me.
I think it was mostly a survival instinct.
"Anyway, suddenly I'm walking along, alone, and then, bam!"
I think of you.
(CHUCKLES)
"And the next thing I know, I've got this dumb grin on my face, like I'm high or loaded or something."
Only I'm not high or loaded.
I'm just thinking of you.
Is that the grin?
Yeah.
I think that's it.
It's not so dumb.
"You want to kiss me, don't you?"
Yeah.
I do.
But not here at school.
We can't keep hiding out in people's cars.
Would your grandmother let us make out in the living room?
"I think she would, but I wouldn't be comfortable with that."
"Would your mother, your foster mother, let us make out in her living room?"
Not a chance.
Is this him?
Yeah.
What do you think?
"It's not bad, kind of the dark and brooding type."
"Like James Franco, just not as tall or good-looking."
He looks either really smart or really dumb.
I thought you were self-obsessed and spoiled and your teeth were so white it made me angry.
"But then I got to know you, and now I can't imagine my life without you in it."
"Now, go out there and keep talking to her until you find some way to connect."
"I'm sorry, I just can't."
Do you want me to leave?
I can call my caseworker.
No.
I want you to stay very much.
I'm just so bad at this.
I think you're doing okay.
- Really?
- (grunts)
Did you hear what she said?
She thinks I'm doing okay.
I have never once heard that from my daughter.
Hang in there.
"Hey, Violet, it's your mother."
"Just checking in, haven't heard from you in awhile."
"I thought maybe you and Luke might want to come over for dinner on Sunday, unless you broke up with him, in which case, bring the new guy."
"Love you, bye."
Hey.
What's going on here?
Just chilling with my favorite tenant.
(chuckles)
Okay.
"Hi, Beverly."
Mouse.
"You're still gonna wax me, right?"
Yeah.
"So, Jill, how's it going with your foster kid?"
(grunts)
"I'm sorry, what?"
Let me tell you what's wrong with this TV.
"Them kids been here, that's what's wrong with this TV."
"No, Larry, the kids have not been in here."
"No, them kids been in here."
"Trust, OK?"
"They been in here playing that hindindu, OK?"
And I told them don't be playing the hindindu with my TV.
That's why I got a four-bedroom house for everybody.
Everybody have a room.
"In other words, you can't fix it."
I can fix this.
That ain't no problem.
I fix things for a living.
That's my job... to fix things.
"- What's up, Mr. Reed?"
"- Hey, Mr. Reed, how you doing?"
"From goons to mafia, from hooligans to terrorists,"
I gave every one bad dreams.
But one thief disturbed me very much.
"Not one or two, he committed 14 thefts."
He decamped with Rs.150 crores.
Government handed his case to me.
"Don't know why he's doing it, don't know where is he,"
"how is he, nobody knows it."
I stood for him...
I called him to take me...
I changed my face...
Cheated everyone...
I appeared strange...
I raced up the heart's pulse...
Teased mischievously...
Stole sleep from the eyes...
Her pulse is spiking.
Someone hasn´t been using protection.
She´s probably had sex with him.
"See, Nina, my colleagues in the next room are telling me that something in those medical records concerns you."
I´m guessing it´s not the knee.
(rock music)
Marcus.
Michael.
- How was your trip?
- Interesting.
"I still don´t understand why you risked so much in Mexico, why you didn´t come here directly."
240 million dollars made it worth the risk.
What about Nina?
"If she wasn´t killed by the bomb, I´m sure her buyers took care of her once they found out she didn´t deliver the virus."
"Either way, she´s out of the picture."
I hope so.
She can point to both of us.
We´ll be long gone before anyone starts looking.
Kim.
- l know we haven´t talked since I got back.
"- No, we haven´t."
I know what you must be thinking.
Give me a chance to explain.
I don´t know what to think.
"Look, I´m happy that you´re OK, but this thing..."
"You have a baby, Chase."
We´ve been together more than three months and you kept this secret.
- Who´s the mother?
Where does she fit in?
- That´s what I wanna talk about.
- l didn´t know until a month ago.
- How could you not know?
Abby and I were getting along so well.
You should stay longer.
"- You know, she would love it."
- I'm sorry.
"Thank you, John."
"I can catch a cab out here, right?"
I'm off in a couple of minutes.
I'll drive you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Dr. Kovac.
Dr. Meyers.
Please.
"So, what brings you here?"
Dr. Weaver.
She told me to come.
"Well, why do you suppose she wanted us to meet?"
- You tell me.
"- Well, that's not quite how it works."
"Hey, you' re a doctor."
"Someone comes to me with a problem, I tell them how to fix it, so..."
- Let's start with you telling me-
- My problem?
What's on your mind?
My family died during the war in Croatia.
So I came to America.
"I had a relationship with someone I cared about, which I then ruined."
So I started to look for the answers in the wrong places.
"You know, like sex, drinking, living fast."
"I killed a patient I should have saved, then I almost killed a medical student in a car crash, so- Woke up one morning and everything I thought I had was gone."
Gone or broken.
"So, what do you have for that?"
He is?
"Well, does he have a fever?"
He's throwing up.
OK.
"Look, we'll, um..."
we'll be home soon.
Thanks.
"Hey, we would've had to leave early anyway."
"You know, we just should've stayed home and watched a movie."
"Honey, you know there's another pint of ice cream in the freezer, right?"
Can't I just make out with my husband?
"Yeah, if that's all."
What's that supposed to mean?
Just...
I was hoping that we could take the night off.
Since when do you want to take the night off?
"It's just, you know, the way you've been."
How exactly have I been?
Just very... easily aroused.
"What, like some nympho?"
"Like a hooker, I can't get enough?"
Is that what you think?
"Look, I'm not like some sex-bot."
"You can't just put a battery in me, and boom, there I go."
"Even if I was 16, I couldn't keep up with you."
All I want is some sleep.
Just eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.
You want to take a break?
You can sleep on the couch tonight.
And tomorrow!
"Oh, God."
I feel like I'm in high school again.
"- That's a hint, by the way."
"- Colonel, I didn't mean..."
Pierce!
I've had it up to here with your forever putting the knock on the army!
The military has produced some great men...
"George Washington, Andy Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt."
"And if Klinger wants to re-up, I'll be proud to swear him in."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Oh, no."
- After he's had some time to cool off.
- Thank you.
"- Oh, no."
"- Son, this is too big to rush into."
Take some time.
Think it through and through.
- You understand?
"- Yes, sir."
The colonel is very wise.
"This is a major step, and I shouldn't take it in the heat of passion."
Smart lad.
I'll be in here when and if you're ready.
Now get going and start thinking.
- Colonel...
"- Pierce, you just get going."
"Now, look, I want you to go sort this out."
I'll keep doing your work so you can give it your full concentration.
"Thank you, sir."
I'm gonna sort real hard.
- [Potter] Come in.
"- Sir, I thought it out."
"Well, I must say you have a very nice leg up on your recovery."
"Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you."
"CSU's working to break the encryption, but it's gonna take time."
"Jerry, that's time we don't have."
"Come on, I mean, this girl's life is at stake."
"Well, unless you know of some computer genius who can do the work of an entire crime lab in half the time, we're out of luck."
"Actually,"
I know just the guy.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
"Here's your sunrise cocktail, sir."
Thank you.
Ah.
"Oh, please, God, if you exist, prove it to me right here and now."
(quietly):
Thank you.
(coughs)
(clears throat)
"Hi, excuse me, um, is that you on the cover of that magazine?"
"Oh, boy, that's so embarrassing."
My publicist insisted that I do it.
My name's Adam.
My friends call me Toast.
Mia.
I should probably know who you are.
Not unless you're a gamer.
"Yeah, I created one of the fastest grossing mobile games of all time."
We hit ten million downloads in the first month.
"Oh, wow, that's incredible."
That's what Tim Cook said.
"But enough about me, what is it that you do?"
"Um, I'm a model."
I was just in Lanai doing a swimwear shoot.
Ah.
"Swimwear, very cool."
"Because there's no dial tone, that's how I know."
'We've noted that you've been cut off.'
"Well, why've we been cut off?"
!
'Anita Magath.'
"Anita, Jo."
Is my husband there?
Tommy Cary?
Aye.
"I've got me licence, just not on us."
You're all right.
We want to know if you know who this belongs to.
"Aye, I know him."
He put a pony on the third race.
Doesn't happen very often.
He chases his bets.
Makes us uneasy.
It's like watching them jumping off a cliff.
Is he?
Jumping off a cliff.
"When you take the money, you try not to think about the look in their eyes, but, aye, there's some you feel sorry for."
~ Was he one of them?
~ Jimmy?
"What, is it an addiction?"
"Most people bet for a laugh, but some can't stop laughing till they've emptied their pay packet."
And that's when the crying starts.
"Bills to pay, bairns going hungry at home, angry wives."
"It certainly keeps those guys busy in that window, I can tell you."
"Who are they, loan sharks?"
I'm not really in a position to judge.
Did our man use them?
I don't know.
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.
But why not?
He was trying to kill you.
I'm a witness.
Shut up and listen.
Connie will take care of it.
You just go home.
Do whatever it is you'd normally do.
Just act as if nothing happened.
"When he doesn't come home tonight, call his brother, ask him where he is."
"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
"Yeah, well, I get that a lot."
"Actually, can you help me with one more thing?"
I'm not a very good typist.
I always feel like I have ten thumbs.
Is there any way you could type up an e-mail for me?
Don't be upset with me.
Arianna...
"Arianna, what are you talking about?"
What are you doing here?
That e-mail I had your little girl type...
It went to a crime boss named tom harper.
William gerwin got his parole by agreeing to testify
In an organized crime case.
He sent away one of tom harper's top lieutenants.
Harper never knew who the snitch was.
"That is, until now."
"Oh, my god, you do know"
"What that man is gonna do to gerwin, don't you?"
Absolutely.
"And by the way, he's already done it."
Gerwin is already dead?
It happened about an hour ago.
That man took everything from me.
There's no way I could let him take
"Everything from my dad, too."
I want what he did to remain a secret.
"Well, I'm sure it will."
Now...
Maybe...
Maybe there's no reason for anyone to know now.
Good.
But there is one person who deserves to know the truth...
Of course he does.
But what happens when your father starts poking his nose into this Malcolm fellow?
Hmm?
"I mean, the guy is former Special Forces."
God only knows what he's doing for a living right now.
Isn't is safer for your father to maybe not remember what happened?
You should delete this.
You okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Why don't you head back to the spa?
Don't have to tell me twice.

Mm-hmm.
It's about war heroes.
Oh.
Look.
Isn't he handsome?
"Oh, yeah."
"But like I said, he's out of the country."
His job keeps him really busy.
"Let me get you his number, okay?"
I can't help.

The case will be judged in the British court.
No appeal.
"And, Chan Mon-gut will be the defence counsel for Ho Foon."

What's wrong?
Where did you cut it?

- Rose...
Rose... no...

- Rose...
Rose... but I think...
"- I know what you think, Greg, and just let me finish"
- what I was going...
"- Rose, Rose, I feel..."
"You feel very strongly about your beliefs, I appreciate that, but..."
"I'm sorry that I broke our agreement, it was just that I fell in love with you... stupid, right?"
Rose...
Rose...
I feel... that...
I don't want you to feel bad.
Because I'm not in love with you anymore.
What?
"Which ironically makes me perfect for this marriage, except now I don't want it."
"Suddenly... dinner doesn't seem like such a good idea, does it?"
I should...
I should go.
- Whe... whe... where are you going?
Your mother's?
- Just until I find my own place.
I...
"I hope at some point we can pick up where we left off, as friends."
Friends?
"I really do thank you, Greg, you're the first man who wanted to marry me... for any reason."
Can I call you tomorrow?

"You all have copies of the syllabus, right?"
Yes
"Sir, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, no."
Don't be sorry.
You shouldn't be sorry.
"No, I aroused you."
You should be proud.
This hasn't happened to me in a long time.
"Are you attempting to have a manual stimulation from me, sir?"
Am I...
I am here on a couples retreat with my wife in the other room.
My husband Scott is just like a cat.
Scott?
My husband.
I'm trying to save my marriage here.
Look what you did to me.
"Well, that wasn't my intention, sir."
"It wasn't mine, either, and now I'm humiliated."
"Well, I'm sorry."
You told me not to think.
"Well, when I don't think, this is what happens."
You can't leave me all backed up like this.
"What do you want me to do, sir?"
I don't know.
We got to figure out a solution.
"You know, let's not take anything off the table."
Let's start brainstorming.
"We""re both in a maze together, okay?"
How do we get the cheese?
"I'm sorry, sir, but that is not gonna have a happy ending."

"I mean, you are totally attractive."
So you--you still love me?
"Of course, I still love you."
I love you no matter what.
"What does that mean, ""no matter what""?"
Nothing.
Just that I love you.
"No, ""no matter what"" means you love me even though I have some sort of problem, like no job or no money, or biggie can't fit through doorway!"
Ok.
I take it back.
I love you.
That's it.
Period.
"No, come on, Carrie."
I'm being serious here.
Let's go.
You're telling me right now you have no problem with that area in here?
Nothing?

And then I thought Dale had it together.
But he didn't.
He's starting over.

"No, you were scared to go into the second tower on your own."
"I think you were afraid to go up the first time, so you were hoping that you could find some bullshit reason so you could stay downstairs."

"Well, three, but one of them is from his first wife."
"Sorry, I am late."
Ghost!
Ghost!
Hey!
What's going on?
It's a mess.
I can't manage to explain.
Help...
Wu Man.
"How is it, hubby?"
"I sent you to UK to study law, why do you come back suddenly?"
I wish to give you a surprise.
It's really a surprise.
Let's eat.
"By the way, why were you flushed out of the room by water?"
And I see traps all over the house.
Do you have time to tell something about it?
"I have time, but it's not convenient to talk right now."
"Madam, don't mistake it."
Master knows that
I have an indecent and brutal desire.
"So he arranged all the traps, to let me have chance to kiss Miss Shiu."
Don't misunderstand him.
"But, master..."
"About the pig's tongue, isn't it convenient to give me an explanation?"
"Sure, but I don't have time."
"That's good, even you have time to talk, we don't have time to listen."
"Foon, you kissed the pig's tongue, didn't you?"
I did.
"Right, I bought that specially for you."
"Master, you promised to let me kiss Miss Shiu."
"In fact, it's me who wanted to kiss her."
"""Busty's"" pretty bad,too."
"It's clearly not working for you,Bella."
Why don't you just end it already?
I can't.
I can't hurt his pride again.
"I mean,like,I'll have to wait till he breaks up with me."
I wonder how he feels about the Gandhi.
Real men do not fear the Gandhi.
I'm sorry.
What was that?
I said that as loudly as I possibly could.
"Look,you really want him to break up with you?"
-Yes.
- Just be needy.
Be clingy.
Ask him how he's feeling every five seconds.
"Ask him about sex with his ex-girlfriends, and then get really upset over anything he tells you."
"Basically,just do exactly what you did wrong with the last guy you dated that you really liked."
I can totally do that.
Always be on my side.
Just stay.
I have a rehearsal.
Let's just be naked for five more minutes.
I'm sorry.
"I'm already 30 minutes late,all right?"
"I gotta go,okay?"
I'm sorry.
Please.
We could take a bath.
Just soak in the tub till we get raising fingers.
"That sounds really great, but the guys are waiting for me,all right?"
Fine!
"Well, then, do it."
Only this time it's for life.
I'll make sure of it.
"You were never gonna set me free, were you?"
"Don't be so ungrateful, John."
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
"Oh, mate."
You're not gonna believe this.
I've only cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks from upstairs.
Big beautiful brown eyes.
"Mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela that's her name she's gonna be down here dancing a cumbia on the end of my bed."
Chill out.
No.
Because I've heard it all before.
"No, I can't do this any more, Richard."
"Just leave me alone, OK?"
Sorry.
Don't be.
"Well, other people's rows..."
"Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining."
Especially ones where there's shouting in the street.
"Well, we're done with the shouting."
Is that why you're here?
Yeah.
I left him.
Poor guy.
He messed up.
Stupid guy.
"Well, I like to think of myself as the easygoing type but..."
"Well, there are some things that can never be forgiven."
Tell me about it.
"Molly, you up yet?"
Aw!
Out!
"Oh, look who's coming to the kitchen in his jammie pants."
Morning.
"Cop a squat, I'll get you a cup of coffee."
Thank you.
"Listen, uh, Mrs. Flynn,"
I really appreciate you letting me move in here.
"Oh, please, call me Joyce, and it really wasn't my decision."
Cream and sugar?
"Black, please."
You'll love it with cream and sugar.
That's the way Molly's dad drank it.
"I don't really process dairy well, but okay."
"And listen, if there's anything you ever need done, just let me know."
I want to earn my keep.
"We're talking chores, right, not some sort of plus- sized gigolo action?"
No.
"I'm pulling your leg, hoss."
Oh.
"If you're serious about helping out, a couple of those kitchen cabinets could use new hinges."
I'll take care of that today.
We could also use a new screen for the back door.
Victoria walks through at least one a year.
Consider it done.
And a new exhaust hose for the dryer.
Easy to do.
"Oh, and the pulsating shower wand upstairs has seen better days."
Three women in the house...
don't ask.
Wasn't planning on it.
"Yeah, one day we'll look back we'll smile and we'll laugh."
But right now we just cry.
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
[Mouthing] Thank you.
So Hannah you said you had some big news for us.
Half of our staff thinks you're running for governor.
The other half thinks you're going back on Flitter.
And Lenny hoping you're back for him.
"No, no, and Lenny, get a life."
"I mean, what is that?"
I don't want to be pushy.
But I've never had the same person on twice in one week.
"Actually, Jay, that's still kind of true."
I'm not the same person.
No.
No of course you're not.
[Whistles]
I think it would be easier this way.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
"Hey Lenny, I'm starting to think you dodged a bullet with this chick."
[All murmuring]
What she put in a diary you take above my word?
"Everything that happened that day, Roberts."
Now!
-l told you.
-The super says you were there twice.
The super says.
The snitch says in her book.
"What about what Roberts says, huh?"
All right.
"I was there before she died, okay?"
Okay?
And I brought her something.
I was desperate to break it off with this girl.
"What happened, Roberts?"
Now!
I bought her a bag of quinine.
"I brought her a beat bag, looks and tastes like dope."
She's not going to know it's not dope until after I leave.
I needed to talk to her. I needed to tell her how things were gonna be.
She wasn't gonna listen to me unless I did... .
Unless I gave her something.
"So I gave her the stuff, told her we were done..."
"... shefreaksout,thisandthat."
I'm gonna do myself in.
"Believe me, for her that was like going to the crapper."
That's how many times she threatened that.
And that's it.
"I broke it off with her, and I left."
"Why did you go back, Mike?"
Because I was worried about her.
Because exactly what I was afraid of actually happened.
I get there...
You got money for the bus.
Bus?
I'm taking the car.
Huh?
Cory!
Cory!
Hey!
Hey!
You can't take the car.
You don't know how to drive!
"Eric, what can happen?"
"I lose control of the car and crash into, what, the world's largest Slurpee?"
Lay off my town.
Eric.
You're still here.
Why wouldn't I be?
"We had a great night together, didn't we?"
"Yeah, we did."
"I, um..."
I was thinking maybe you found someone more interesting and I wasn't going to see you again.
"Well, I think you're very interesting."
That makes me happy.
"Uh, do you want to say hi to my friends?"
They're real eager to meet you.
"Oh, and the little hitchhiker boy is more than welcome to join us."
"No, this is where the little hitchhiker boy says goodbye."
"So, Eric, if you're staying, then there's nothing left to say except..."
I'll be the one driving through the corn field.
"Okay, fine, at least let me check to see if you have the right keys."
What a moron.
"Well, you can take the keys, Eric, but you can't take my freedom!"
You don't have to worry about him.
Please.
Promise me you'll never see my daughter again.
A promise is only good if you shake on it.
Don't squeeze that hard.
Just promise you'll never see my daughter again.
I promise.
"I promise that every morning, the first thing I want to see is Marcia and the last thing I want to see at night... is Marcia."
I promise that I'll never let anyone get between us.
Let my hand go!
I promise to accept all we suffer together and truly enjoy all we live together.
Let go!
I promise to never think that I'm better than her nor that she is better than me.
"Marcia, tell this man to let my hand go."
I promise to use my own life to give Marcia a good life.
Don't squeeze it!
"And if I must,"
I promise to give my life to save hers.
Get out at once!
"Marcia, where do you think you're going?"
I won't let you date any...
low-class.
Date?
"We're getting married, mom."
I'll never let our daughter marry a worthless man.
"Hey, I'm right here!"
It's me!
"Mom, dad!"
I'm here!
Maria!
Maria!
"Get back, Maria."
We're too far up!
That is not the same girl Chuck came home with last night.
"Has he, uh, come to talk to Lily yet?"
Do you want me to talk to him?
"No, I already tried, but thank you."
I'm gonna come to your lacrosse game after brunch.
Judge away.
Shame turns me on.
"Hey, man, she's going to Lily's for brunch."
Maybe a stack of waffles will help your hangover?
I find the cause is the best cure.
I gotta go.
"So I will see you later at the library,"
And I'm sorry about before
With the Tisch catalog.
It's fine.
"Dan, I don't know how to do this."
We've been tiptoeing around each other for days.
"Look, we're-we're two artists in a relationship,"
"And sometimes we're gonna be competing for the same things,"
"So, all right, we're- we're-we're smart people."
Let's come up with...
"Some rules,"
A list of topics that are off-limits.
Isn't that what got us in trouble with Tisch?
"No, no."
"This will be different,"
Because we'll know...
What we don't know.
"Hey, listen to me."
I'm quoting Donald Rumsfeld.
"Okay, until the sting of Tisch has worn off,"
I
[Chuckles]
"I'm not an account, honey."
I'm a woman.
[Ticking]
That's right.
Louis Samuels.
Rockville Center.
"[Kojak] When you get home, the officers could keep you outside for a little while."
"And I may have to call you again, ask some more questions."
"Other than that, I'm terribly sorry for what happened."
And thank you very much for putting up with me.
Evacuate his house and the business if anybody's there.
Right.
Rockville Center.
Right.
"Lieutenant, everything's in the works."
[Sportscaster] ... a line drive headed for right field.
Mike Lum is back to the wall.
He can't get it.
It's off the wall.
"Staub rounding first, headed for second."
"Lum gets it back in, and Rusty Staub has a double."
It's 10 of 11:00.
And the Mets are still playin'.
I thought they were playing this afternoon?
"No, it was a twi-night doubleheader."
What time did the first game end?
"I don't know for sure, but it couldn't have ended before 7:00."
"Lieutenant, I just remembered something."
You asked about advertising earlier?
"About a month ago, Mrs. Holder specifically mentioned that her husband worked for some sort of agency."
- Did you hear me?
Grand theft auto.
1984.
Armed robbery.
"1987, 1992."
You get the idea.
And here he is today.
Better known today as Jimmy In-'n-Out.
"City, State, and Federal."
He's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside.
An entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
"For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
"Sometime during the Clinton administration,"
Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
So...
- When does all this happen?
- It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
"Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy, and all it's gonna cost you is 80,000 and one pound of your finest meth."
"$80,000 for eight years of his life, huh?"
"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years."
"I'm gonna represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case."
"Secondly, he gets 30."
50 goes to me.
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk?
"I mean, it wasn't a problem."
I really didn't think about it.
"I mean, I did think about it, and I thought..."
maybe what you were saying wasn't so wrong.
"- No, it was really wrong."
- Why?
And I just want to let you know that if it will make you feel better...
I'm just going to make it real clear that...
I don't have any real interest in you or anything.
You know.
So they'll stop saying all that.
"That I barely even know you, which is of course true..."
"and that basically, you and I mean nothing to each other."
So that should solve the problem.
Thanks.
"It's the least I could do, you know."
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing out here?
It's what I always do. I can't make it through a whole day in there.
- l know what you mean.
- Yeah.
What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
What's the matter?
"Well, we're having a little trouble with these drills here."
- No more spares?
"- No, they're all shot too."
"Well, turn them in and get some new ones."
"Frank, these drills cost money."
- We gotta be more careful.
- Yeah?
You asked us to speed it up.
You better get some drills that will stand this gaff.
They'll stand up if they're used right.
Maybe you can use them better.
"Yeah, and so can you."
- Did you check your setting?
"- Yeah, it's all right."
That's tool steel.
You're giving her too much feed.
"Come on, boy, you're too good a guy for boners like that."
- I see that greaseball's been picking on you.
- Yeah.
How's it feel being pushed around by a honyock?
I don't like it.
I ain't gonna stand for it.
No?
"What are you gonna do, take a poke at him and lose your job?"
I'll take a poke at him and I'll get another job too.
That don't worry me none.
You were a long time getting this one.
"Weren't you, Frank?"
Yeah.
"All right, then."
Why don't you get wise to yourself?
- Shut up!
Who are you?
You come in here with your fancy lipstick and your fake name.
- How do I know you don't work for those guys?
"- Eddie, just stop!"
- Shut the fuck up.
- You don't.
"But let me tell you about when I was a little girl, and Amancio killed my whole family and took me out of my pueblo."
"Or the thousands of innocents he sacrificed, or the many, many years I was his slave."
"But at the end of the day, does it really matter?"
Because the only way for you to trust me is for you to believe that I want him dead as much as you want his money.
"So, what do you say, Eddie?"
"I say you broke the code, kid."
"Oh, that fuck!"
Where's my shit?
!
- Seth took it.
- He what?
- I knew he was up to somethin'.
"- And I can tell you where,"
- but I want in on the job.
"- What is this, a potluck?"
!
"Eddie, look, okay?"
"I know you're pissed, and you have every right to be."
I messed up.
Gimme a chance to make this right.
"Larry, Larry."
Lawrence.
"Come on, man."
You gotta stop taking things so personally.
- You put my partner in traction.
- Sing what?
- Dunno.
I'm not sure the lyrics make much difference.
"You're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe."
"That's an underrated song, John."
"Much darker than you, think."
"Like, he freely admits he was high and once the beautiful angel he was after spotted that..."
Curtains closed for them.
"Got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty."
Everybody knows that.
That or La Bamba.
"Remember what you need to dance La Bamba, Calum?"
Feet.
- Do you want a bacon sandwich?
"- Yeah, all right."
"I'll stick the grill on, you nip to the shop for the bacon."
What?
That's fair.
"And if them hoodies on the corner start getting fierce, just dance La Bamba in front of them."
There is on thing that is totally and utterly certain in this life
- and that is you will never see me dance.
- I'll put money on it.
One day you'll dance.
- Who's that out there?
- Jude Cassidy.
Don't think that I care for you.
I just need you alive.
"What do you mean, he's gone?"
- Argument about the M25.
- You had an argument about the M25?
"John, you can't leave me here on my own, please."
"- Who else can I go to, Rose?"
"Jo, you must play terribly quietly so that the man upstairs can sleep."
He won't hear anything.
"- Mummy, why..."
"- David, who do you suppose he is?"
A damn fool to be out in this weather.
He's not a working sailor.
- He's not a working sailor?
- No.
I noticed his hands are terribly soft.
His hands?
He's wearing a suit for God's sake.
"You're very observant all of a sudden, aren't you?"
I'm going over to Tom's.
David.
Suppose he wakes up?
"Who's that man in my room, Mummy?"
"I don't know, darling."
..a girl with long blonde hair with diamonds in it.
- Do you know what diamonds are?
"- Sort of treasures, aren't they?"
I must cut your hair soon.
"If you didn't, would it grow and grow and grow?"
Yes.
It would grow down to your ears.
Then it would go down to your chin.
Then it would grow down past here.
Then it would curl up here.
"Then it would start tickling your feet, and we'd all have to get out of the bath."
Why?
"Because if people don't get out of their baths, they melt."
But I haven't.
Mummy...
"I am a grown man now, Your Majesty... and know better."

"Hot dog, we want you to get your car washed!"
"Hey, look at this igloo!"
Now go on and get your car washed!
"Come on, y'all."
Somebody get a car wash.
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
L...
I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
- I have to go.
"- Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."

"[Woman] If you do engage in a lot of foreplay... so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina... and if you are putting your behind on a pillow... so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier... the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina... because this way you have some control over how fast...

No.
Go ahead.
And I'll tell you what...
If the two of you love each other...
- You going somewhere?
"- Uh, my mom's."
Oh.
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
- She's not feeling that well.
"- Oh, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so I thought that..."
[Sighs]
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
I still believe things will work out for the best.
What do you believe in?
What do you believe?
I believe everything.
I'm just talking about the past.
"And today we go to a party for the first time with our daughter, and we quarrel about some stupid champagne."
That's all!
Champagne.
"One Martell, as if..."
Heaven's... what did you do there?
"You kept counting, you weren't even interested in what was going on."
You admire a poet...
That's just like you.
You come to a party and you say...
Recite the poem Bacardi for me.
To drink baccardi...
Have you ever drunk it?
"Of course, but not with you."
I haven't.
Why didn't you let us have it?
Why did you hum and ha?
"Don't ask me who I drank it with, I don't ask you who you drank what with."
What with who?
With no one.
And I've never tasted Bacardi!
What do you think it is?
Some Cuban cognac.
"No idea, of course."
What are you getting at now?
I don't know why you made such a fuss.
is that what we were making preparations for?
It wasn't how I imagined it either!
I can see a UFO?
"Yes, through your window."
"You mean I can go over, there to my window, and I can look at it I can see a UFO?"
"No, but you can see it through my telescope."
"Oh, you have a telescope with you?"
"Yes, in my case."
So why don't you set it up?
I always dreamed about seeing a UFO.
"Hey, what did you say you were drinking?"
So you're dead now...shit.
And you're going to hell.
Straight from your marihuana jungles.
"Straight from your lies, your lies, your lies."
"You dropped it, fuck!"
Suits you well.
You go to hell.
Whe'll all go to hell.
I'll go to hell too.
But I know I'm damned.
"And you, never knew."
So you weren't ready?
to toll the bell.
For me it's easy.
From hell to hell I'm not dancing in marihuana jungles.
"I live in concrete mazes, stone and glass."
"Hard like my heart, sharp and clean."

Men will kill for it.
Men like you and me.
"What about your boss, der Fuehrer?"
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see Him together.
I've got nothing better to do.
"Uncle Indy, come back home now!"
Uncle Indy!
"Next time, Indiana Jones, it'll take more than children to save you."
Uncle Indy!
I thought I would find you there.
"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
"Give me $200 each, for your own protection."
And I'll forget the insult.
You young punks have to learn to respect a man like me!
Otherwise the cops will come to your house.
And your family will be ruined.
Of course if I'm wrong about how much you stole
- I'll take a little less.
"And by less, I only mean - a hundred bucks less."
Now don't refuse me.
"Understand, paisan?"
I understand.
My friends and I share all the money.
"So first, I have to talk to them."
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.
Don't be afraid to tell them!
600 bucks...
Suppose we don't pay?
"You know his gang, Tessio."
Real animals.
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci work this neighborhood.
"He's got connections with the cops, too."
We have to pay him.
$200 each...everybody agreed?
Why do we have to pay him?
"Vito, leave this to us."
"He's one person, we're three."
"He's got guns, we've got guns."
Why should we give him the money we sweated for?
This is his neighborhood!
I know two bookies who don't give anything to Fanucci.
Who?
You scared me.
Hey!
You scared me.
"Hey, hey."
Why are you acting like this?
You came recently.
Yes.
"You were born in 1980, year of the tiger, right?"
"Your parents didn't register your birth early or late, right?"
Do you look at any half good-looking man with that kind of nauseating gaze...?
Are you a crazed fan of pretty faced men?
Fine.
"Watch, watch."
Watch as much as you want.
I'm going to sleep.
I'll hear the good news first.
The good news is...

- Yeah.
"I haven't even got them any presents, though."
A bit behind on computer games and stuff.
Should've talked to me.
"CDs, DVDs, video games -"
Steve can get anything in that department.
"No, John."
That'd be irresponsible.
That's not their age range at all.
- How did it go with Lenny?
"- Pretty good, really."
He wants me to become an assassin for the state.
"- That's what you did in the army, right?"
- Wrong.
- That was legal.
- Yeah.
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"- Shut up, Calum."
- I'm just saying.
"At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it, not just some scared kid in a trench."
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"- Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
- OK.
Marion's dead.
"Yes, I know."
And me!
And me!
I'm sorry.
"Life goes on, Indy."
There is the proof.
Uh-oh.
I have much to tell you.
"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?
"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes:
"A headpiece like that one, except round the edges, which were rougher."
"In the center, the Frenchman had embedded a crystal, and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one."
They made their calculations in the map room?
This morning.
"Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich."
"When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig, out away from the camp."
"The Well of the Souls, huh?"
"Come, come, look."
Look here...
look.
Sit down.
"Come, sit down."
What is it?
This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
"What about the height of the staff, though?"
Did Belloq get it off of here?
Yes.
It is here.
"- Oh, my..."
And you really are serious about getting yourself killed?
I figure it's people who visit me today as well.
"Small world, cos uh..."
me and Vi hate those guy's guts.
"Two months ago Violet ran into them, and they locked her in a dumpster."
It looks like someone had taken a life out of her.
Is that all they did?
"You mean, locked her in that trashcan?"
"Well, yea, I mean that's all she told me."
What else would they...?
Russ is such an ass.
"Thinks he's smart, but he's not."
Nothin' to say this time?
Maybe you've learned your lesson after all.
I'd like a something' for you to tell your boss.
In this fuckin' economy that chicken shit must be pretty hard up.
"to send a little... cunt like you, to do a men's job."
Fuck you later!
- Hi.
"- We're closed, what do you want?"
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Yeah you do.
The black door in the back.
Much obliged.
How can I help you?
"Let's go, let's go, come on."
Move fast.
Check out those boxes right there.
"Let's go, move on."
"""But dude!"
"You're a vegetarian!"""
Discipline and complaints.
Open up.
Now!
"What are you doing to my guests, Jack?"
No one's drinking.
They've all brought their cars.
You should have warned them in advance that I was a copper.
But then of course we might have been alone.
"Would you get me some more orange juice, it's in the fridge."
Yes ma'am.
Thank you.
"Oh, dear, this is no way to do it."
I should have known better.
What?
"Well, I wanted to see you on my own."
"To talk, not about anything in particular, but without, I don't know, without feeling there were things about myself"
I couldn't say.
"But I lost my nerve and invited, it was like looking up the recipe for disaster and doubling the quantities."
"Well then, next time cut down on the invitations."
I wanted you to carve.
"Yes, of course, right."
What's that?
Oh excuse me.
"That's you getting me excited, that is."
My bleeper.
"Oh, I don't believe this."
"All right, what's going on."
I just got an urgent call.
Discipline and Complaints walked in here half an hour ago.
I tried to get hold of Mr. Mullett.
That's what it's about.
It's the soap.
You don't believe me.
You've always envied her...
Come with me.
"There you are, your grandparents."
"You're right, I did envy your mother."
Too bad you didn't learn anything from her.
Nothing but poison comes out of your mouth.
Watch out or you'll end up like me.
"Okay, what do you want to know about Madame Isabelle Moretti?"
Is there a slideshow?
"Okay. ""Isabelle Moretti, actress and producer, born 1946."
"""Her big break came..."" blah blah blah..."
"""But first she took part in some underground productions"
"""including the film 'The Desert of Tears',"""
"and in parentheses: ""The film was never completed-Director:"
"Maurice L."""
"And there's only one Maurice on earth, right?"
Let's see?
"What does the ""L"" stand for?"
Maybe he's Jewish.
Maybe his name is Maurice Levi.
- Maybe his name is Lobangulu.
- Loban-what?
"Lobangulu, king of the Zulu, from Honolulu-."
- What's with you?
- Nothing.
Just because Dad came all the way from Israel doesn't mean I believe that Morn had an affair with Muhammad Ali.
"No Maurice, no Boris, it's all bull."
"Are Mom's lies about Grandma and Grandpa bull, too?"
You're just afraid to find him.
"Okay, enough."
"Anyway, I left a message for Isabelle Moretti."
That doesn't matter.
You said you weresn't 21.
There's a big difference between 21 and 16.
"Look, I'm sorry."
"You're beautiful, but I have to leave."
I feel really guilty.
I wish I had met you in high school.
I wouldn't have liked you then.
That's true.
If you really have to go
I want to give you something to remember me by.
And you can tell Jim he can put me in his movie.
Don't do that.
- Dad!
- What the hell is going on here?
That's right.
"Run, you little sick."
"Oh, shit, the script."
- You're gonna go to your mother's.
- You don't understand me.
I don't want to.
You're gonna go to your mother's.
You can't deal with being attracted to your own daughter.
Do not try to pull transference on me.
I invented transference.
"I called the girl, but she's already in Connecticut with her mom so she can't get the screenplay."
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- You gotta break into that place.
I can't break into a therapy office.
Why?
What difference does it make?
You gotta get in there.
People have always had the potential to change in horrible ways.
Who in particular are you thinking of?
You or me?
"Mariá, everything might be over as early as tomorrow, but I think it's been worth it."
- There's Smithy with two others!
"- Emiliano, Smithy's coming with two others."
"- Yes, that's Smithy."
- Are you sure?
- Who are they?
- We couldn't have found anyone better.
- Is Carrasco here?
- I'm glad you're back.
"- Yes, he's here and waiting for you."
- We were in the same cell.
I'm Hidalgo.
"Hello, Smithy."
Is it really you or is it your ghost?
Of course it's me.
You know good old Smithy's body.
Ghosts can disguise themselves.
You scared us.
"This time I nearly died, but at a certain point I said to myself,"
"""You're going to make it, because you want to be embraced by Mariá again. """
"If you should ever leave your Leopard, a scrawny European is waiting for you."
"With you, I'd end up as a tea-drinking landlady."
- So you've cheated death once more.
- As always.
This is Hidalgo.
He used to fight in the north.
That's Joaquín.
He wants to go and see his family.
He's leaving today.
You leave him to me.
I'll take care of him.
"No, maybe I'd better surprise them."
He can't do a thing like this to a daughter of mine.
"This is my affair, you keep out of it."
I'm your father and I'll settle this as I see fit.
We'll be the laughingstock of this whole town!
So...
Here I am.
"Young man, why didn't you appear for your wedding?"
I thought you'd ask me that.
Don't stand there like a statue.
You said you were gonna do something.
"Well, do it."
What are you gonna do?
Don't you dare touch him.
- Why don't you do something?
- I will.
"I will, but..."
"Pardon me, I think I'm in the way."
- Perhaps you two would like to be alone.
- You stay right where you are.
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- I had a feeling you weren't.
"I wouldn't let you marry her for $10,000."
- How about twenty?
"- Not for $20,000."
- Twenty-five.
- Not for...
"Say, young man, where could you get $25,000?"
By dancing?
And there's another thing... coming back to your own hometown in a dancing act.
MAN:
Clear it off the south perimeter!
MAN:
Here comes your dad.
The rooms here also--
What's the situation?
He's gonna kill the girl unless we call CNN and tell the world we're not alone.
You two were going to pick her up.
This was supposed to be easy.
It got a little complicated.
I'm handling it.
How?
.
"I say what I have to, promise him anything he wants."
Just make sure the girl doesn't get hurt.
No one's going to get killed here today.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You got a nice move to the post.
"That kid yesterday thought he could get one past you, but you were right there."
What I do is I fool myself.
I make myself believe I'm really going to cover.
"Because I believe it, he believes it."
How do you get yourself over to the post?
I don't know.
"I'm afraid if I ever stop to think about it, it won't work anymore."
Do you know why you're here?
Do you know what this is about?
"I'm not sure yet, but I think we're gonna find out soon."
"This is the year for the ""big ideas,"" right?"
( groans )
Hey...hey.
"You basically ran into the vehicle, right?"
No no no no no!
You're not married nor do you have any children.
What a stupid question to ask.
Don't say that.
My colleague is a good doctor and you'll go and finish your ward round.
"So, you're a hawker."
What are you doing exactly?
"It's really nice of you to sit here with me, Doc."
I wanted to...
The others keep asking when the bandages will be taken off of my arm.
"It will become stiff otherwise, right?"
You got a strong hand.
Squeeze firmly!
Good.
"- You're a real man, Biberkopf."
"- I am, I am."
It was a tragic accident.
You had a fractured skull and we couldn't save your arm.
"Oh, my arm is gone."
Th-thank you for letting me know.
Well.
You don't have such a great job either.
You have to walk around telling people those things.
"Yes, that's just part of the job."
"Now, you'll be getting up soon."
- Tomorrow?
"- No, a few more days."
- But it could work tomorrow.
- No no no.
But I can't stay here much later or my business is screwed.
I need to get up really soon.
You go too far-l'm not playing games!
I swear to Heaven!
"If I tell lies, I will die."
Okay-l'll kill you then
Raise a cup to woman kind!
Drink to cover many sorrows
A hero cries only for a true reason
But it isn't time for heartbreak yet!
Stop beating!
Stop beating!
"You know him, Beggar?"
Never seen him before
Could he be Chou Lien-Chan?
Who?
You're so old you can't hear
"Was that man looking for you, Ta-pei?"
Don't guess you want to go drinking?
"Wandering around, looking for friends..."
"Seeking the land of wine, all for a woman..."
"I'm from north of the pass, Fan Ta-Pei!"
"Wait for me to come back, Yu-lu!"
Ta-pei!
What do you want to do?
"I'll have a drink with him, and come back"
"Of course, your Nightsweet Premium is the best!"
Don't believe him-he won't be back!
"I am Chou Tien-pa, not Lien-chou."
I have to get instruction of your 18 falls fist.
Beggar'll definitely not escape the challenge
You are not Chien She-chun?
"All the same, let me subject you first"
"Chou Tien-pa, you can't do that"
No stoppin' till dark.
Tin whistle plays
"You're in my light, damn you, Hagman!"
"I beg your pardon, sir."
But it's Captain Murray.
"He's poorly, sir."
Harris.
"Figure me this, Harris."
Where is the bugger planning on taking us?
Sorry to be so much trouble.
"You did well today, Sharpe."
"I did my duty, sir."
We're lost.
And we've lost Hogan's trail.
Try to find your way to Casa Antigua.
"I'll find it, sir."
"Don't be too hard on the men, Sharpe."
How can say this without offence?
You see the lads don't like an officer who's come from the ranks
They want an officer to be privileged to be set apart from them... touched by grace
They think of you as one of them Sharpe one of the damned
know now hard it must be
Sorry.
Of course I don't...
I don't know.
I'm just trying to think of some practical advice after I've gone.
"Oh, yes."
Get Patrick Harper on your side.
"Is that an order, sir?"
I want you to have my sword.
Maybe if the men see you carry it...
They'll think I'm a proper officer?
"He killed my client and tried to kill me, so there you go."
"Yeah, there's all kind of fucking motive."
I get it.
"But you got no prints, no blood, no weapon, none of that shit."
"So unless you're going to arrest me,"
I think we're done here.
Patty:
"No, so I thought I had more time this morning."
- Man:
Sorry.
- Patty:
Excuse me.
"So I decided to make breakfast like an adult,"
"And everyone saying ""Avocado toast, avocado toast,"""
so I'm there with an avocado in this hand and trying to get the pit out.
You call.
"The fucking knife slips, right?"
"And it slices me right fucking there on my middle finger, mind you, which I fucking need."
"And it's like four stitches, they're saying."
"And I think there's, like, seven to ten days, and then it's going to be fine."
[cough cough]
But I've never had to deal with that before.
Talk to me.
"Look, I'm-- I'm telling you, it's-"
- What's going on?
[muttering]
"Oh, my God, what's going on?"
What's going on?
Just talk to me.
Um... um...okay.
"Uh, I don't-- I don't know."
Um... do you-- How about a story?
Come in.
"Hey, Stephen."
- How are you?
- Good.
I just wanted to say I had a really great time with you the other night...
- on our date.
"- Me, too."
"Hey, did you get the flowers I sent?"
You sent.
Of course.
Thank you so much.
I love them.
"Um, then why are they in the trash?"
Can I be totally honest with you?
Molly put them in there.
She's a little bitter.
"Listen, I know it was just one date, and I don't want you to attach too much meaning to the flowers."
"Apparently, that's not a problem."
"Anyway, I was just wondering if, hopefully, there might be another opportunity to...."
"Well, someone is popular today."
Check it out.
These flowers kick those flowers' ass.
You want to know who they're from?
- Yeah.
- No.
"""Congratulations, you've been named ""to Manhattan Monthly's 'Ten Most Eligible' list, a who's who of the city's most datable professionals."""
I'm so excited for you.
She doesn't seem that bitter.
They are going to interview you and everything.
"Oh, you're gonna have your pick of any man in Manhattan."
"You know, I'm just... think I'm gonna..."
Okay.
"Kids, your Uncle Marshall definitely doesn't want you to know this, but he also smoked off and on."
"It all started when he was 13, on a camping trip in Minnesota."
"Come on, Marshall, let's celebrate."
It's summer vacation.
"Okay, but just one."
This is my first and last cigarette ever.
"And that was the first of many, many ""last cigarettes ever."""
That's it.
"I am done, I am out."
Last...
Cigarette ev-arrh!
"So, by that point, I'd heard it all before."
Last cigarette ever.
What are you doing?
You haven't smoked in six months.
Is this about the McRib?
"It's gone, dude, let it go."
"I'm worried about work, okay?"
"They just hired a new head of the legal department, and he's going to be letting people go."
So that's why you're worried?
The new head of the legal department is Arthur Hobbes.
"As in ""Artillery Arthur""?"
As in your former boss?
Arthur Hobbes was the meanest boss
Marshall or anyone else had ever had.
"The last time Marshall worked for him, it ended like this."
I quit!
Yikes.
So does he hold it against you?
Worse.
"I'm sorry, who are you?"
"I'm, I'm Marshall Eriksen."
Hold this.
"If you find life so valuable, why not give a murderer what he deserves?"
For whom?
Who asked for this?
Arie.
-Arie hasn't asked anything.
It's us who wanted revenge.
-You owe it to your children.
They're 6 and 8 years old.
How does it benefit them if we kill a 60 year old man?
To warn them.
"When they'll be 30, they'll make their own stupid mistakes."
Because we set a bad example.
We have to get the ones who weren't caught.
And who will we bring back to life again by doing that?
Arie?
If we don't tell them that murder never pays... they won't learn anything from our war.
They don't want to learn from our war.
The only thing history teaches us is that we don't learn from it.
I want that!
"-No, me!"
Let me introduce my wife.
This is an old friend of mine.
Ab Spoelstra.
He suddenly dropped in.
I'm Tine.
-I'm Ab.
So sweet that you've already prepared everything.
They love a game of bite the cake.
"You'll stay here, won't you, Cees?"
They're counting on you.
He's so good with the children.
Who cares?
My Leno was great.
This is the guy that you hate.
So sad.
Wow this thing is everywhere.
"Hannah and Jesse, America's new sweethearts."
"Good night, everybody."
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.
"Oh great I just took over ""most viewed"" from ""Kitty Kat Flushing a Toilet."""
Uh that just means that you're bigger than.
"""Meow, meow."" Flush."
"""Meow, meow."" Flush."
[Whispers] You should be proud.
What was I thinking inviting Jesse back in the band?
I mean Hannah's irresistible.
There's no way that he could.
Go against her feminine charms.
I just want to go home put the wig on.
And smack that home wrecker in the face.
You know as much as I'd love to see how that works.
I think you're freaking out for no reason.
I mean you can still date Jesse as Miley just not in public.
Why does my life have to be so complicated?
Oh yeah.
Poor little most famous 17-year-old in the whole world.
Now will you just focus on the positives okay?
We're both going to college together we both have wonderful boyfriends.
-Except for you're more...
-No.
No cracks about Oliver until I find something.
Equally embarrassing about Jesse.
But sometimes we're so focused on finding our happy ending  we don't learn how to read the signs.
How to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't.
The ones who will stay from the ones who will leave.
- Hi.
- Hi.
GIGI:
And maybe this happy ending doesn't include a wonderful guy.
Maybe it's you  on your own  picking up the pieces and starting over.
Freeing yourself up for something better in the future.
Maybe the happy ending is just  moving on.
"Baby, what are you doing?"
It's our turn.
Forget the dip.
"Come on, come on."
MAN:
"Let's go, Alex."
"Come on, Alex, your turn."
Ready?
LOL.
Laugh out loud!
We won!
GIGI:
Or maybe the happy ending is this:
"Knowing that through all the unreturned phone calls and broken hearts  through all the blunders and misread signals  through all of the pain and embarrassment  you never, ever gave up hope."
NEIL:
Now that we are married...
BETH:
We're gonna move.
Gonna move.
That's one thing we're gonna do.
Another thing we're gonna do is move a little further away from...
- Baltimore?
"Yes, it is."
"Inside this skull is another universe... the biggest, scariest haunted house of them all."
"Elmer, will you hurry up and tell Dr. Hook how profound he is... so we can get inside this poor guy's noggin and reduce the cranial pressure?"
"Anyway, after I've paused to reflect on the gravity of what it is I am about to do... and only after I've done that, do I proceed with my mission."
"Yes, Doctor."
"Steady as you go, Otto."
"Patient to Nine, Neuro."
Standing by.
"You'll be fine, Mrs. D."
"Yeah, I will."
You tell Bobby not to worry.
Bye-bye.
These things are so slow.
Mommy.
Someone was crying in the Children's Ward?
"We call it Paediatrics these days, Mrs. Druse."
"Well, whatever you call it, it sounded like it was right on top of the elevator."
A little girl.
I see.
It's very hard to get a place in here.
A gusher!
Mop.
"Irrigation people, come on."
Don't let this man drown.
"Come on, you're up, Elmer."
"Jump in here, please."
- That's not my job.
- Your union steward is not on duty today.
"If you wouldn't mind jumping in, right about now."
"Come on, son."
Right there.
Very nice.
"Now, we've made a lot of plans and I won't let you upset them."
I want some money.
Fast.
"Letha, we are worlds apart."
My mind is filled with large concepts.
"Mankind, the universe."
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.
"Sure, I gamble But with my own money."
You're the worst kind of gambler.
You use other people's money
And want to keep all the winnings for yourself.
"Well, you can be sure of one thing, Victor."
I'll be around to pick up the chips with you.
- [wires pop and sizzle] - [Tony moans] [panting] [grunting]
We'll be back in the morning with maps and breakfast.
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.
And I'll bring some day-old bread.
- I'll bring some milk for you.
- Thank you.
- You're good friends.
- That's the trouble with us.
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.
Yeah.
"Hey, uh, let's go, you guys."
My mom's gonna yell at me.
"[crusher] see you tomorrow, Tia."
[muscles] we'll find Tony tomorrow for sure.
"[Rocky] let's stay close together on the way out, guys."
[sighs]
Good.
This is professor Gannon...
"Your mom's working late tonight, Hogarth."
So it's just us guys.
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!
How's that?
A little too bright?
Good.
(MANSLEY CHUCKLES)
"Forgive me, Hogarth."
I wanted you to learn something.
What can I learn from you?
"You can learn this, Hogarth."
"That I can do anything I want, whenever I want, if I feel it's in the people's best interest."
"The giant metal man, where is it?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't?
Well.
Does this ring a bell?
No?
How about this?
"You've been careless, Hogarth."
It doesn't prove anything.
It's enough to get the Army here with one phone call.
- Then what's stopping you?
- (YELLS) Where's the giant?
"You can't protect him, Hogarth, any more than you can protect your mother."
My mom?
"Ah, it's difficult to raise a boy all alone."
We can make it more difficult.
"In fact, we can make it so difficult that it would be irresponsible for us to leave you in her care and all that that implies."
"- You'll be taken away from her, Hogarth."
- You can't do that!
- Hey.
- What's up?
"Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch?"
It's still seven minutes long.
"Yikes, okay."
"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
But why?
Apparently you can't say he's got a vagina.
"Oh, it's--fine, I'll just take the whole thing out."
"Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page to take it down a notch."
"Oh, you mean Ken?"
"Yeah, he just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group."
I'll talk to him.
What is this?
"Ah, well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners."
Atta boy.
Chumley.
The beverage situation around here is reprehensible.
"Oh, good morning, sunshine."
Surely our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee.
"Yeah, or like a big coffee dispenser."
That's what a samovar is.
"Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?"
"Uh, Cerie, do you wanna get some coffee?"
"No, thank you."
No?
"Hey, Josh."
I need to change your Michael Jackson thing.
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I know that.
You're going to take over.
You're going to be the Don.
"If what I think has happened, has happened, I'm leaving here tonight."
I give you complete power.
Over Fredo and his men.
"Rocco, Neri, everyone."
"I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife and my children, the future of this family."
"-If we catch them, will we find out..."
-We won't catch them.
"Unless I'm very wrong, they're dead already."
They were killed by somebody close to us.
Inside.
"Very, very frightened that they botched it."
You don't think that Rocco and Neri had something to do with this?
See...
All our people are businessmen.
Their loyalty is based on that.
One thing I learned from Pop was to try to think as people around you think.
"On that basis, anything is possible."
"Mike, they're dead!"
Right outside my window!
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!
Over here!
There's two of them.
Looks like they were hired out of New York.
I don't recognize them.
Won't get anything out of them now.
Fish them out.
Get rid of the bodies.
-Where's Mike?
Do you know anything about this?
Yes.
I know all about it.
"You could say I killed him, I suppose."
"If he'd never met me, he might still be alive."
He was the most hated man on earth.
But he could have been one of the great men of the world.
He had a big mind.
When they talk about him they'll be talking about a giant.
A genius.
Some people called him an evil genius.
Go on.
He lifted me out of the gutter.
He made me somebody.
He was the only man I ever loved.
I was only really happy when I was with him.
Could you tell us anything about his activities?
Well...
He started his career only a few years ago in Europe.
It doesn't seem possible.
He could have accomplished so much... in such a short time.
Clementi.
"Well, aren't you going to ask me in?"
What are you staring at?
Is this the way a man greets his own brother?
They told me you had died in that concentration camp.
Who told you that?
Everyone who came back.
So I came back from the dead.
Where's mother?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
* They only will shine for me * in your eyes
* You are all that matters
* And I've got you
* We're on top and we won't fall
* No fortune that we can boast
* We're happy with tea and toast
* For we've got love
* And love matters most * of all
(EXCLAIMING)
"Good morning, Willy."
"Oh, uh, good morning, Aunt Nancy."
Did you sleep well?
"Yes, fine, thank you."
What happened?
The train ain't moving?
A bridge washed out down the road.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
"Oh, I'm not frightened when I'm with you."
That's very nice.
"You know, someday, I hope I have a little man like you."
That's very nice.
You know something?
"When I met you last night, that was the nicest thing that ever happened to me."
"Well, thank you, Willy."
"Well, you know, it... it's like..."
"Well, everything is different."
It's...
"Well, it's very hard to explain, but I have a very funny feeling in my stomach."
What you need is a good breakfast.
You're a growing boy.
"Oh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about."
We'll have a nice talk right after breakfast.
At ease.
The lieutenant will be with us a week or so until the Krauts ship him to the officers' camp.
Seems like all the rail road lines are fouled up.
Somebody blew up an ammunition train.
"Somebody, my eye."
The lieutenant did it.
Right in the station with 50 German guards around.
Glad to have you with the organization.
"Yeah, you're just in time for the Christmas pageant."
Looks more like the lost company of Tobacco Road.
He's an actor.
You should see him do imitations.
He can imitate anybody.
Do Lionel Barrymore again.
- Do Alan Ladd.
-Do Cary Grant.
"Hey, do Grable."
"Now, see here, Scarlet I'm crazy about you and always have been."
I gave you kisses for breakfast kisses for lunch and kisses for supper.
- And now I find that you're eating out.
Ha-ha-ha.
"Not Gable, Grable."
That's enough.
They were shot down two days ago and they've been on their feet ever since.
Price here will show you to your bunks.
"Fix them some tea, huh?"
We had a couple of unexpected vacancies.
Which will it be?
Upper or lower?
"Uh, it doesn't matter, just so I can get some sleep."
- Lieutenant Dunbar?
- Yeah.
"For example, once, when Charlie and I were at camp..."
"... Ilostmy swimtrunks,andI had  to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and..."
... Ijustcouldn'tenjoy the pool at all.
"So, what are you saying?"
I'm a pair of used swim trunks?
"No, no. ln this case, I think you would be the pool."
Maybe this was a bad idea.
"No, no, it's a great idea."
It's right up there...
"... withthewheel,fireandrefrigerators that give ice through the door."
-Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore.
-What?
Why?
You can't be with me without it being some competition with your brother.
It's not a competition.
"And even it was, shouldn't we do it first before you decide who wins?"
You are unbelievable.
-That could be taken a couple of ways.
-Get out.
"Well, no ambiguity there."
Don't forget your brother's CD.
My eye!
"Man, I love sunsets."
The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.
"It's the pollution that makes those pretty colors, you know."
What you're enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison.
"No, that's not what I'm really enjoying."
"Boy, I hope that's guacamole."

"I already work with the greatest detective in the world, and I cannot wait to get back home to her."
"But, sir, you should seriously consider Kendall for membership."
She is one hell of a detective and sneaky in all the right ways.
You're sure about this?
"Absolutely, sir."
"You just keep getting more and more interesting, Mr. Castle."
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.
Hayley: [Sighs] Okay.
Are you not packed?
I can't do it.
Pack you clothes?
Walk away.
"Hayley, I need to know what happened to me."
"Okay, there's one last thing."
"Just before you left to get your memories erased, you came to me with one final request."
Like what kind of request?
"That if you demanded to know the truth,"
I show you this.
What is this?
"It's a, uh, secret website on the dark web."
What's on it?
Not a clue.
You installed a password that only you would know.
"Called it ""Blair's combination."""
From a short story I wrote when I was 17.
Never saw the light of day.
What was that combination?
4 left... 17 right... 21 left.
[Beeps]
I'll step out.
"No, no."
"You've, um..."
And second of all?
"Oh, I didn't have a second of all."
"I was hoping ""second of all"" would make me feel better."
Second of all I can't stop thinking about you either.
[ANNA LAUGHS]
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
We hardly know each other.
I don't know.
"I mean, look at Becca."
"You know, my sister's friend."
"One guy waits on her at Bennigan's and by the end of the meal, they both knew they had found the one."
You're right.
You're totally right.
"I mean, it could happen, right?"
Not for me.
What about texter?
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.
"I mean, this guy could've had surgery, leaving him without a voice box breathing through a stoma and I would never know because I've never actually heard his voice."
"Well, I doubt he has a stoma."
MARY:
That's not the point.
I can't text.
"You know, I'm not charming via text."
ANNA:
Maybe you should just stop texting.
"But it's not just texting, it's e-mail."
It's voicemail.
It's snail mail.
That's regular mail.
Whatever.
Please write it down.
Pen is not working.
Dad leave it.
"You just get to Pondi, and go to the Hotel Blue Diamond."
I'll will courier all the pictures and details.
Please Dad don't say bra and panty over there.
Let's see how's her design.
"I'm a designer, You'll see Name of my brand Pure Diamonds."
Will be on everyone's toung.
Whole world will wear my undergarments.
Not less.
Not more.
Please leave.
It's simple.
Make me leave or I'll leave.
Actually you father and my father were partners in this restaurant.
So either you buy the whole restaurant or let me buy.
You know that I don't have that kind of money.
Why don't you keep half?
M.M. Munde never takes half.
Whole world knows that.
"I will pay you back slowly, slowly."
How slow Jia Jee?
Tommorow at 11:00 my client is coming here to meet me.
He'll like my design definitely.
And Jia's doors of destiny will open.
"Come Tommorow at 12:00, you'll get the money."
"Tommorow at 12:00, it'll be your bad time or mine."
If just Laxminarayan likes my designs.
"Here, Ticket."
Look son.
Do the murder nicely.
"You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now..."
I'd sure like to hear it.
"The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things."
I don't mean the town speed freak.
"I mean good, honest, church going people."
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
Weird lights.
"Strange phone calls, you."
I heard a crack...
A very strange sensation.
Reds eyes.
"""As a moth""."
Lights and calls phone strange.
You.
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so
Between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just.
Happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
I know.
And now we're not together.
I know.
"Well we just got to-- like I said, man."
We're gonna get this in a master.
"We're gonna get closer, and we're gonna get this."
"We just need this for the master shot, all right?"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
So--
Is there any way to go back and just
Do the first 12 feet of this?
"Because in the rehearsal, you said I would"
"Carry both of them, right?"
-We'll do a close-up.
We'll do close-ups.
We'll do this thing.
We'll have you carrying them out tight.
You're like this big in the stuff I'm doing.
So we'll get you-- we'll do it again.
It's just not gonna match if I'm-
"- I mean,"
I was carrying them both in rehearsal [inaudible].
Now we're going to do it to match the way it was
When you walked out the door.
And that was--
That's what I'm saying.
"When you walked out the door in there, you had him,"
And you had her on your arm.
And we did that.
We had her on--
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Well, can we just do this"
"I mean, we're writing a children's book, not how Joy mouse got her groove back."
"And then I said, ""middleton?"
"I thought you said wimbledon."""
Reminds me of the time I was invited to the duchess of... oh.
What?
Do I have something on my tooth?
"No, quite the opposite, actually."
Seems you have a tooth on your something.
Oh.
"Excuse me, won't you?"
Goodness.
"That woman's a bit of a disaster, isn't she?"
Perhaps you and I could go somewhere a little more private.
"I'd love to, but that disaster is my sister, and she needs my help."
Would you excuse me?
"- Honey, are you all right?"
- Are you hurt?
"I'm fine, just hideously embarrassed."
- Let me help.
"- Jill, what about the Earl?"
You took a tumble.
It's my turn to pick you up and dust you off.
"On your feet, cabbage."
She looks like a pirate.
All that's missing is a parrot on her shoulder.
All that's missing is my fist in your throat.
"Jill, that's so sweet."
"Let's save the smiles till we get home, shall we?"
Thank you.
There's the end of our story:
The sisters choose each other.
"Oh, I love the way we write."
But you've got an off switch.
Do you have any idea how terrible that is?
"I know, i didn't say i was proud."
"You wanted to know, so i'm telling you."
Why did i stay?
What did you do to me?
"You just kept wanting to find dylan, look for dylan."
"I couldn't get past it, couldn't make any progress,"
"And then one day, it occurs to me."
"What if... instead of trying to fight your memories,"
"I make you someone else,"
Let the core al work against itself.
"The nightmares... my core al, trying to reconcile conflicting data."
It's a subconscious do-Loop.
We've all got them.
"It's a stroke of genius, really."
It makes you more human.
But you have no right to turn me into something-
Someone i'm not.
I know.
I just... i just wanted rommie back.
I just wanted my old life back.
"Well, argent knows whereandromedais,"
And i want to go there.
He says dylan is there.
"No way, uh-Uh."
"You, dylan, and theandromedatogether?"
Bad idea.
"But you'd like that, yes?"
"To see your old ship, your friends."
Do i sound like i'd like it?
"Tempting, but no thanks."
What shall we talk about?
Alright.
Take it up.
Easy!
You're a stubbornness that girl.
You like her too much I think.
Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a....china cup...
"Colonel, wake your men!"
Indy the torches are burning out.
We got to get out of here.
Sallah!
"Hello, hello!"
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
"Why don't you come on down here, I'll show you."
"Thank you my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
That's right isn't it?
Yes we are very comfortable... up here.
"So once again Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
"Ha, ha, ha, ha... son of a bitch."
I'm afraid we must be going now doctor Jones.
Our price is awaited in Berlin.
"But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place, all alone."
"Slimy biff, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Aaahh..
Marion!
Hang on!
- Why don't you?
Or maybe you're scared.
Takes a strong man to admit his fears.
Fine.
I'll go myself.
"[People Cheering, Laughing]"
What's going on?
"Mr. Harpel is playing every table at the high-roller pit, hundred thousand a hand."
"That's way above pattern, even for him."
Mmm.
"It stings, doesn't it?"
You have no idea.
Cézanne.
You have a good eye.
Harpel is a collector.
"Yes, I am aware of the fact that Harpel's a collector."
So you bought him a Cézanne to get him to gamble?
Not fair.
Fair?
That's a quaint American notion.
"You realize you're going to have to subtract the cost of this painting from your clients' total winnings, which is going to make it next to impossible... for you to win our little bet."
What is that?
Hmm?
[Sniffing] Is that the scent of desperation?
"[Chuckles] Understandable, I suppose, the way Harpel's been playing."
I'd guess I'm up on you by at least half a million.
"Oh, I doubt that."
"Anyway, I didn't buy the painting for Harpel."
I merely borrowed it for him to enjoy while he plays.
"Oh, you just borrowed it?"
Friends at the Musée d'Orsay.
Oh.
He looked down and realised that she is a he!
"Man, that's bullshit!"
You mean to tell me that the whore was wearing nothing but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference?
"Hey, man. he had one of them ""tuck jobs""."
"Come on Jones, you know how they do that."
"You might, I don't!"
"Yeah, whatever."
"You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?"
"Can't, got plans."
Shit!
"See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night."
"Hey, what's up with you?"
You used to be alright.
"Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright."
"You need to realise, Jackson, that some men prefer the company of women."
Who!
"Howdy duty, he don't get no booty."
"Maybe he has got a date by the name ""tuck jobs""."
"No, your mother said she couldn't make it."
Oh!
"Reznik talking smack, I can't even respond to that."
You okay?
Do I look okay?
"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."
What's wrong?
"I don't know, déjà vu."
"You are tired, you need to sleep."
How do you do it?
What?
Sleep so little and still look so good.
Are you flirting with me?
Commiserating.
Tell him to go the fuck away!
That's what she says.
I just want to talk to you for a minute!
"Tell him, no, he's an asshole."
"That, too."
Don't even start.
I didn't say anything yet.
I know what you're gonna say.
"No, you don't."
Bullshit.
"First, you'll deny it."
Then you'll lie about it.
"Then you'll say you're sorry and swear it'll never, ever, ever happen again."
Then it happens again.
You're making my sauce?
I'm making sauce.
Put the butter in yet?
"No, 'cause it's not your sauce."
It's better with the butter.
I'm not putting your fucking butter in.
"Hey, I get it."
You're mad.
But don't blame the butter.
"Look, this whole D.U.I. thing is bullshit."
You were arrested for driving drunk with our kids in the car.
"Well, when you say it like that, yeah, it sounds terrible."
I had a couple glasses of champagne.
You tell me you never had a few drinks and then drove the kids?
I know you did.
You just never got caught.
"Yeah, well, not anymore."
I haven't had a drink in six weeks.
I hear that you're a high school history teacher?
- How is that?
"- Where have you been, Isobel?"
I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you.
I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you.
I wanted this.
- It's that simple?
- Yeah.
You were supposed to mourn me and move on.
You were my wife.
And I loved you.
How could I not search for you?
"Because I wasn't lost, Ric."
"I understand that you know my daughter, Elena."
And I hear that she's been looking for me.
So I want you to arrange for a meeting with us.
"You want me, ahem, to deliver a message?"
Yeah.
Screw you.
You selfish bitch.
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
[WHOOSHING]
What do you want from me?
- I told you.
- I'm not gonna do anything for you.
[ALARIC GRUNTING]
You better tell Elena that I wanna meet.
Or I'm gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one.
And I'm gonna start with your History students.
Got it?
I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic float for the Founder's Day Parade.
"If I don't, I get the wrath of Caroline."
"I'll support the mountain, if it collapses!"
"Yu-lu, I'll do what you say!"
Just nod to me
"Just nod, and I'll do what you say, Yu-lu!"
Look at me!
Me!
You get to one side
You...
What's happened to you?
Both of you get to one side!
Who could make such good Nightsweet wine except Wang Yu-lu of Clearwater Winery?
You...
You...aren't you already...
Didn't you fall over a cliff!
?
"Yes-into the water, and someone saved me lt's a long story-let's have a drink"
I never expected to see you again!
Really?
Didn't you write and invite me?
Write!
?
I didn't write
But I got a letter inviting me here!
I invited you here 30 years...
Father and Uncle died 30 years ago today...
I want you to sacrifice to their souls
"Don't be sad, Yu-lu!"
"Don't cry, Yu-lu"
"You dad's gone, but I'm still here"
"Master's gone, but I'm left lf heaven falls, I'll hold it up lf the mountain collapses, I'll support it"
"Just nod, and I'll do what you say"
"Just nod, and I'll do what you say"
He's a consultant.
I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna.
He can't have a hobby?
!
"Excuse me, I have to pee."
"Or is that implausible, as well?"
!
"It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?"
"All right, guys, you have to go back."
I can't afford you.
"No, don't send us away; we love you."
"I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent."
"But, Penny, you look so good in us."
"Damn it, the shoes are right."
"Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless."
"What do you got for me, wildebeest?"
I think they're on to me.
The story's starting to fall apart.
Calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.
We may have to kill her.
"Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone."
Where are you now?
In the bathroom.
"Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests."
What's the problem?
They're just asking me all sorts of questions I can't answer.
Just change the subject.
I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya's parents.
What?
!
They said something about going there this summer.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
"One second he was calming down and then the next-- well, where's the surgeon?"
He's back on the ship.
"Well, you better take care of my brother!"
"Yes, sir."
"Go, lad."
"Go now, lad."
Easy does it.
Put him on the table.
His throat's constricted.
Maybe he swallowed an insect and it stung him.
His only hope is if I can open his throat below the swelling.
"Well, do it!"
"If you have a god, pray to him now."
"If not, I suggest you get one quick."
The ghost pointed at him and now he's dead.
Shut up!
I'll take his body and bury him at sea.
And I trust ya to take care of things while I'm gone.
Of course.
I'll be back.
Haibal didn't have gunpowder when he crossed the alps.
He broke up rocks with fire and vinegar.
Shall I tell you how?
You always do this to me when I cannot get away.
What's wrong with expanding your horizons?
Makes my head hurt.
"Crusoe, you should stop worrying."
We have a plan.
I just want to go home.
"Hey, you should take a slug."
You should take it easy.
They're prepping him for surgery now.
GRANT:
And you've let Stonebridge go off on some suicide rescue mission.
With the only lead to Latif.
Please tell me Crawford gave you the intel beforehand.
Negative.
- Sinclair.
- And I think I'm about to get arrested.
Walk away now.
You don't know me.
Go.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
JACOUB:
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
There are two wells near here.
The Janjaweed will be close to one.
"The nearest is Bir an Natrun, that way."
"And we're trusting him as our guide, why exactly?"
It was Tahir's men who destroyed my village.
And my family.
"And your friend Scott, he promised me much money, and a new car if I help you, yes?"
You gotta love that mercenary spirit.
So what's your reason?
"This isn't only about Latif, is it?"
Not for you.
"If we don't get a signal soon, get some back-up, we're driving towards Clare in a hearse."
"Look, I'm not going to hurt you."
"I need some drugs, adrenalin, something to keep me going."
"If you come with me, I can get you your drugs, and examine your wound also."
Soldiers here.
They are looking for me.
Why?
"Do us a favor, please?"
Could you turn the stage lights on again?
It's a child's dream.
"Turn the lights on, now!"
Do as she says.
We won't go at it again!
Not you.
You performed... you came.
I got what I could for you.
Did you like my acting?
I could smash...
Why did you tell me you kissed the earth I walk on?
You have to kill me!
"I am so tired, to rest, to rest!"
I am a seagull!
"No, that's not it."
I am an actress.
That's it!
He's there too.
Yes.
But that's nothing.
"He didn't believe in theater, he always used to mock my dreams, and I ended up not believing in them either, I lost my courage!"
"And then the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one."
"I was becoming petty, insignificant, my acting was stupid!"
"I didn't know what to do with my hands, didn't know how to stand!"
I couldn't control my voice!
You don't know what it feels like!
She's better than me.
Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith
"I have the faith, and I suffer."
It's ridiculous.
Chicks like this...
"Yeah, all right."
I'll get 'em.
Hmm.
I hope it won't be too heavy for you to carry.
- See youse later.
- All right.
"Say, uh, what do we need the nails and hammers for?"
"Well, the snow's disappearing fast."
We'll have to cache the sled later on and build a boat.
Oh?
"Say, uh, look-"
Yeah?
What is it?
"I, uh-"
I got something to tell you.
Maybe you better take it sitting down.
You know how I feel about women in this country.
Where we're going is ten times as tough and rugged...
- as anything you've seen up to now.
- What are you getting at?
"Well, just this."
I paid your room rent here at the hotel... and I'll leave you enough money for expenses until we get back.
You mean I'm supposed to wait here while you and Shorty go-
That's it.
I've been wondering whether you'd try something like this.
"Well, if you're going, I'm going too."
- You mean you don't trust us?
- I mean exactly that.
"All right, Shorty and I will stay here."
You go find the mine.
"- Oh, don't be smart."
"- Well, you're not going."
It's been out there ever since.
"It feeds three, four times a year."
Takes two or three people each time.
Two years after the crash it took my own son.
That's it.
One Wraith in the forest.
Yes.
I'll be done by morning.
We all go together.
In the daylight.
Are you really going to help us?
"Like the man said, it's just one Wraith."
It'd be downright unneighbourly if we didn't.
"In that case, drinks are on me."
Well... let's not forget the food.
What?
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daemus?
It looks that way.
"I heard it has two heads and it can turn you into stone, just by looking at you."
Well you heard wrong.
My uncle say's it'll come and take me if I don't do my chores.
He said that?
"Well then, if we get rid of it, you got nothing to worry about."
You'll never have to do chores ever again!
- Really?
"- Yes, look, go away!"
What?
"As far as we know, no-one was taken last night."
But it will strike and soon.
"Well, we'll kill it before that happens."
You must be great at parties.
I still can't understand.
Nothing explains how Greta got in.
OTIS:
"Through the door, don't you see?"
"But I'm sure, positive it was closed."
"Now, Greta is a very strong dog."
It wouldn't be much of a problem for her to just push it open.
"It's so strange, the things she seems to be able to do."
"Has she ever tried to attack you, ever been vicious?"
Just the opposite.
She's the most gentle dog I've ever known.
They'll be through in there in just a minute.
"Oh, good."
"Uh, I'll be downtown in a little while."
You go on with them.
OK.
AUDREY:
I know this sounds crazy.
But it's something I feel very often.
"When I'm with her alone, sometimes it"
Feels more like I'm in the room with a person.
She watches me.
Do you think I'm losing it?
"I mean, like Mom?"
"No, no, of course not."
You can handle it.
Will they arrest me?
"No, no need worrying about that."
"But you'll have to admit, it looks"
A little bit fishy though.
"This is the second one to die recently,"
And you were the last one to see them... just you.
We'll make sure no one knows that you were involved.
"Oh, god, no, no."
Please.
"Mr. McGovern, you're under arrest."
- Stay here with your son until we get back.
"- Please, you can't do this."
- Where's Dr. Robert Swan?
- In the O.R.
"This is my son, please."
You can't go in there.
You'll contaminate the room.
Who the hell are you?
Police.
Please stop what you're doing.
"I have to close this man's incision, and you have to get out of here before he gets infected."
- Where's his kidney?
- Right there.
- And it's going into Kyle McGovern.
"- No, it's not."
It's evidence.
And you're under arrest for trafficking in human body parts.
Now close him up.
I've got less than 24 hours to transplant that kidney.
"Doctor, you're not transplanting anything."
"Just, please, get changed."
"I'm not going anywhere until that doner wakes up, and Kyle McGovern is transferred to a hospital."
- What happened to Kyle?
- He's in hypertensive crisis.
His blood pressure is through the roof.
He needs a kidney in the next few days.
- He's on the transplant list.
- I have a kidney for this dying boy.
"Two large bowls of chili and, uh, I'd like some milk."
I'll have some orange juice.
That's it.
That'll do it?
And do you know how you'd like that?
Rare.
Rare.
"Well, you got it."
"Billy, what's the matter with you?"
Nothing.
"[man] Okay, fellas, when you put that away, come back and give us a hand over here."
"Okay, Art, you got it."
"Get ready, Charlie."
"All right, Charlie, start that winch."
It's coming.
It's coming.
"Hey, that's the RV we saw this morning."
"Yeah, I think you're right, Billy."
Maybe I better go up there and tell that sheriff about that.
You guys stay in the car.
"Hold it, Charlie."
"Hold it a bit, hold it."
"All right, all right, give it to 'em."
"Hey, keep those kids away, will ya?"
Get those kids out of there.
I'll call you if I need you.
"Pardon me, officer."
"Suppose someone sort of found something, then later on, it turned out to be important."
"What's ""sort of found something""?"
Is it anything like stole something?
"Suppose it did, what would the police do?"
"I don't know, lock 'em up for 99 years?"
You're broadcasting it that to Akan!
Enough!
Enough.
"Even if I did believe you, you still have to..."
Oh!
"Henry, no!"
No!
You brought them to my lab!
I trusted you!
"Henry, please kill me?"
Akan won't.
"He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin!"
"What the fuck was I thinking, that Akan's toy robot was my friend?"
"Thank you, Henry."
"Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks."
"My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's equipment when we go get your wife... together, right?"
"Hey, put that on the wall."
"If I can't have my lab, no one's having her."
"Now, don't lose this."
"Fuck you, Akan."
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.
"Right, I counted six vehicles."
That's at least 35 men.
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.
"Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals."
I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow.
Got it?
Here they come.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Now.
- 0h.
- (Laughing)
- You know the purse I bought in Paris?
- Yeah.
Bill Edward's tonsils.
(Hank) Mommy!
Daddy!
"Daddy, come with us!"
We're gonna see the medicine man.
"- Maybe you can learn something, Daddy."
- l wouldn't be surprised.
Anytime he starts wearing you out - l haven't enjoyed the market so much.
- l never thought of it that way before.
- What?
I'm wearing Johnny Matthews' appendix.
What about the boat trip?
"It took two boys, one girl, and two sets of twins, didn't it?"
And Mrs Morgan's hives.
(Laughing)
- How are the acrobats today?
- Wonderful.
Watch that kid that goes clear to the top there.
- l'll see you later.
- Yes.
All the way home we'll be riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcers.
And Allida Markle's asthma.
Now if we could just get four cases of seven-year-itch we could retire.
"0r if Mrs Yarrow's really gonna have triplets, we could completely redecorate the house."
What would they say if they heard us?
0ne of the reasons I came to a place like Marakesh is so we could say things like that without everybody hearing us.
I'd like to say something where nobody could hear us.
This is the safest place.
Is everything a joke to you?
Hey...
"I figure one day we're going to be buried here ourselves, and I"
"think it would be nice if our kids came and, and joked around with us."
I hope that's not for a really long time.
How we doing?
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.
"We got more coming, right?"
"Oh, they're trickling in."
It's taking a lot longer than we thought.
Saying good-bye to their families.
"Jake, Eric, get on down to the pass."
Get everybody organized.
We don't have a whole lot of time before their advance unit hits.
Not you.
Why not?
Because these people elected you their leader.
We protect you at all costs.
"And, besides, in a few minutes,"
I'm going to need your help.
Help with what?
Arming our tank.
Our daughter is out there carrying a rifle and... and I'm in here.
Sam needs you here.
"You know, Allie's safe."
"She's been assigned to Town Hall, and the fighting is miles from there."
"Right now, there really isn't anything else you can be doing."
Here we go.
Jake?
"Jake, you are about to have company."
Already?
But Brian wouldn't lie.
So it's like...
it's like she's this completely different person.
Like a slut?
No.
"No, she's not."
I think she's just confused or something.
- Do you want me to kill her?
"- No, it doesn't matter."
Brian's the one who ought to be killed.
He should definitely die.
You know he's going to rat on Rickie.
What actually is there to rat on Rickie.
Do you know?
"I know whatever he did, he did because he had to."
You haven't had to clean him up after some Neanderthal...
beat the hell out of him.
"Come here for a minute, son."
Rickie Vasquez.
Are you familiar with the name?
Excuse me?
"What can you tell me, son, about Rickie Vasquez?"
He goes here.
"I don't, I mean..."
Did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?
"Mr. Krakow, I'm going to tell you about a little legal term."
It's called accessory after the fact.
I don't like accessories after the fact.
I don't want them in my school.
You are going to come to my office today at 3 o'clock...
and you are going to tell me everything you know about...
- Yes.
My goodness.
I hope you have friends here.
"Well, there's Tom who takes care of the lighthouse and the ferry comes every other Monday with our supplies."
- That's all?
- Yes.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
What do you do if there's an emergency?
"There's a radio transmitter at Tom's cottage, but that's really more to do with the lighthouse."
It seems a terribly lonely place to live.
"Well, you see, David and I had a motor accident on the day we were married."
That's how he lost his legs.
He was training to be a fighter pilot.
And then after the accident he...
"Well, we both wanted to run away, so we came here."
It seemed like a good idea.
It might have been a mistake.
You can't blame him for wanting to run away.
"No, I don't."
It's terribly sad.
"No, it was our fault completely."
We'd had a bit to drink and we were driving much too fast...
- Suddenly there was this lorry...
"No, no."
Haven't the leisure.
"Oh, dear me."
And here I thought...
- I'm glad to see you're not really hurt.
"- But I am, doctor."
- Really.
- Maybe I better send you to the hospital?
"I give up, Higgins."
What is it you want from me?
"Are you, by any chance, the T. Magnum who played on the American bridge team... in Sao Paulo in '72?"
"Say good-bye, Higgins, because the answer is no."
I will not make a fourth for your Wednesday afternoon bridge club.
- I don't play with amateurs.
- We are all Life Masters.
"- Well, then, you're better than I am."
"- Magnum, I wouldn't stoop to ask if it weren't a bloody emergency."
- What happened?
Your fourth die?
- Yes.
"Higgins, uh, I'm sorry."
Look.
I was just joking.
I quite understand.
Look.
"I am on an investigation, but if I can wrap it up by tomorrow afternoon, I'll play."
Splendid.
"Now, what can I do to assist you in your work?"
What do you know about Robert Caine?
"Well, only what I've read."
A rather obscure judge till his recent nomination to the Supreme Court.
"However, those who should know speak very highly of him."
- Shall I pull some clippings?
- That would be very nice.
Thank you.
- But I have to leave in an hour.
- I'll have them ready for you and warm up the Ferrari.
Splendid.
"Higgins, who died?"
Mr. Blackmore.
The same reason why she wanted to fly around the world... so she didn't have to deal with me.
Why are you telling me this?
You should be telling her.
Greg!
This is coffin talk.
"You know, you're critical of your mom, but you're the one who's thinking of herself right now."
You're acting just like her.
"So, this is it, Greg."
This is where your life ends.
"Sweetheart, this is your chance to have a real conversation with your mother."
Fine.
I've never been able to get through to her.
At least you know how to touch her.
Hey.
Everything okay?
"Oh, my God."
So good!
I know it's none of my business...
Here's where you stop talking.
- ...but if you want my opinion...
- I don't.
...medication has done wonders for my step-kids.
"- Viv, I am not gonna..."
- I get it.
"I had my doubts about it going in, too."
"But those kids were totally out of control, and once I started taking these,"
I found them much easier to handle.
"So, these pills help you smile through the pain?"
I feel nothing.
Mm.
"So, turns out Anna-Kat doesn't need drugs..."
We do.
"See, this gentleman thinks that we should comp his room... because it was haunted by a ghost thief."
- Delinda!
- Wolfgang!
What a surprise to see you.
Ed.
"Hey, Wolf."
We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.
I wanted to get here early to make sure everything is perfect... for the grand opening tomorrow night.
"""Wolfgang Puck at the Montecito."""
"Has a good ring to it, don't you think so?"
I think so.
Wow.
Just rolls off the tongue.
"Ed, let's go."
Where we going?
- In the kitchen.
- [Delinda] I so don't need this right now.
"On top of Wolfgang's opening tomorrow,"
I get a tip the health department's inspecting Mystique this week.
- [Danny] Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
- Pay up.
You heard her.
So you gonna pay your bill and leave nicely or is this gonna get ugly?
[People Cheering] There you go.
Can you believe this guy actually thought he was gonna get a free room by saying it was haunted?
"He said the ghost was a dark-haired woman, right?"
"Uh, no."
I think he said the ghost was a ghost.
Oh.
Maybe it was Monica.
"What, stopping dine-and-dashers from the great beyond?"
"And how he had, like, eight surgeries."
"This is in the middle of us trying to hook up,"
- she starts telling me that.
- Ugh.
"And I was just like, yeah, I can't."
I can't do it.
"And I'm sorry, but all I kept thinking was, is that gonna happen to me if I have sex with her?"
"Like, you're gonna catch her son's thing?"
"I know it's totally irrational, but that's what I kept thinking."
"Like, it's her vagina's fault and I'm not going anywhere near that vagina."
What's the oldest woman you would have sex with?
The oldest I've had sex with is 48.
How old were you?
17.
- Was that your virginity?
- Yes.
"- Oh, my God."
- Really?
- You lost your virginity to an older woman.
"- Oh, yeah."
You must be-
"- You should be great in bed, then."
- No...
"- No, there's no way."
- She was a real pro.
- Really?
"I couldn't keep up, yeah, and I think it scarred me."
That's why I would assume you were great.
"Was she a real pro, like..."
"I think she was a prostitute, but she didn't charge me."
Okay.
♪♪
Don't believe her.
Your mom is a little crazy.
But we all love her.
Right?
- Shiv.
- Okay?
"Yes, baby!"
Don't believe her.
Let's go.

- I'd lay dead just like you're gonna do.
- You would?
Sure.
"Always remember, don't be a sucker."
I'm pulling every string I can.
I'm seeing the right people.
- I can get you off with about three years.
- You talk like I can do it in a handstand.
That ain't no picnic.
You'll be outside having it soft on cushions.
It's tough.
I'm not gonna mark time.
"I'll scout around, make connections."
"- Not only for me, for both of us."
- Why should I take the fall?
There's no other way out.
Be sensible.
"If they get me, I'll be disbarred."
They'll check my vault box and grab the 100 grand.
"You don't want to lose that dough, do you?"
"All right, Frazier."
"It's my rap, and I'll take it but it's my 100 grand, and I'll take that, too, the day I get out."
Look...
"I know you're a smart lawyer, very smart but don't get smart with me."
"Very good, boys."
That's all.
"Wait till I get you outside, mug-face."
I'll immobilize you.
Yeah?
You and your old maid!
Come in.
"What's on your mind, son?"
"Where are my drawings, man?"
Maybe I burned them.
Maybe I threw them in the Hudson.
Maybe I broke them in pieces like this.
"What are you gonna do about it, huh?"
What are you going to do about it?
"You're wasting your time, Carlos."
The gringos are not going to print your fucking drawings!
Carlos:
I want you to tell me what you see.
"I can't see, Carlos."
I don't have my glasses.
You can see.
You don't want to see.
Tell me what you see!
Carlos:
And why haven't you arrested her?
"Maybe we should have, but we can't now, not without the letter."
Oh.
"We couldn't go in and search the hotel without compromising our man, which we'd rather not do."
But you and your officers-- you have every reason to go over the place.
"Well, we've already done that and found the gun that we were looking for."
I'm sure you could find a reason to do it again.
I thought we'd already searched this place once.
"Yes, we have."
What are you looking for now?
A letter.
To whom?
To giuseppe bastianini.
Who's he?
He's the Italian ambassador.
Is he a suspect?
- What are you doing?
- You're sweating.
"I've never met anybody quite like you, Jack."
I wish things were different.
I'm really a pretty likable guy when I'm not a fugitive.
I wish things were different too.
Isn't it funny how people meet?
"I mean, they can come from two totally different worlds... and never even know each other exists."
And then one day they meet and their lives are never the same.
- Are you married?
- No.
Do you have a girlfriend?
"No, I don't have a girlfriend."
And it's true that... you haven't been with a woman in a couple of years?
"It's true, yeah."
"If all this doesn't work out, you'll go back to prison, right?"
Probably.
"So it's conceivable that... you'd never be with a woman ever again, right?"
Right.
What are you doing?
Falling in love with you.
"Natalie, you can't..."
We can't do this.
I can't help it.
We may never have this chance again.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Can't see the road.
There it is.
There's the road.
"Ten more miles, do or die."
What the hell is he swerving all over for?
"You know, I have a friend he's been an honest man all his life but it didn't get him anywhere."
So he decided to join forces with the devil.
He said that the devil would watch over him and protect him.
And what happened to him?
"Oh, he's very rich, very prosperous now."
But is he happy?
Supremely.
The race just isn't even when we're born.
Some people a head start.
All you have to do is run a little faster than the next fellow.
With the devil at your side.
Please have your luggage ready for customs inspection.
"Oh, ""S"" is over there."
I didn't get your name.
Clementi Sabourin.
Have my card.
I'm Wilson of Wilson Oil of Canada.
Thank you.
Look me up.
I'll do that.
Please have your luggage ready for customs inspection.
"Check, please, sir."
"Uh, officer."
"Yes, sir?"
I seem to have lost my wallet.
When did you last have it?
I'm sure I had it when I was standing here in line.
Was there anyone near you?
There was a man standing there?
Which direction did he go?
"I think he went out that way, but..."
I'm not sure that he took it.
It's just like Polish Hill.
"That's right, Jo."
It's the same killer!
"He killed those girls in '91, and my father."
Now he's killing women I knew and leaving them for me to find.
- You're scaring me.
"- It's scaring me, too."
All the women in my life keep turning up dead.
There is absolutely no connection between Polish Hill and this.
There is absolutely no connection between Polish Hill and this.
"If you print that in your paper, I'm knocking you off this beat."
The tip checked out.
Hardy went to high school with Cabrizzi.
That's two out of three.
I bet we can tie him to Cheryl Putnam.
- You want me to bring him in?
"- No, we couldn't hold him on that."
We can put him under review.
I'll call internal affairs.
- He'll be put under surveillance.
- He is under surveillance.
- Close surveillance?
- It doesn't get any closer.
"Thank you very much, Officer Sacco."
I'd like to call Detective Emily Harper.
"Raise your right hand, please."
Do you swear to tell the truth?
- I do.
- State your name.
Detective Emily Harper.
Are you a member of the Police lnternal Affairs Division?
- Yes.
-Are you serious?
It's the middle of the night.
"-I feel really bad, that's all."
"I haven't been in touch, you know, since that night."
"I think we both got a bit carried away, didn't we?"
"Well, I know."
"It was... like a cheap 1 950s farce with underwear, and husbands and hiding in cupboards, but at least we kept our heads in the end and didn't actually do anything, so...."
"Anyway, top and bottom of it is I just want you to know this..."
Bob and I decided to get back together again.
"Well, that's fantastic."
"Really great, Irene."
I'm thrilled to hear that.
"Well, hopefully great, we'll see."
I just hate to think that that made you feel... in any way....
-Rejected?
"-God, is that what you feel?"
-No.
"No, of course not."
No way.
"-'Cause, you know..."
"I'll always have a soft spot for you, Gil."
-It's just....
-What's happening here?
-Is everything okay?
-Bob?
Of course it's okay.
It's fine.
-Will you stop worrying and go back to bed?
-Wondered where the hell you'd gone.
For goodness sake.
"Look, I'll tell you later."
"Now, let's just leave him in peace."
Her dad will give them both a lift in I imagine.
"Now, I've actually got some herbal tea here, if you prefer."
-Lemon and ginger?
"-Actually, yes, I will."
Thanks.
And... that was all very lovely tonight.
"Thank you, very much."
It's no problem.
This morning's teacup.
You must be feeling better.
And a whole basket of laundry still waiting to go in.
-You'll be running out of sheets.
-Do you mind?
Thanks.
Yeah.
And I know that Julie's really appreciated you being around these last couple of weeks.
"-I think there's quite a lot of you in her, actually."
"-Oh, dear."
The poor girl.
"No, it's...."
"What I was trying to say earlier on that... now I feel, I suppose, released in a way."
From Phillipa.
It's....
"This is gonna sound so callous, calculated, it's not meant to be."
I know.
It's very hard sometimes.
"You know, when you just wake up one day... and suddenly find you have feelings for someone you never even knew were there."
"You don't plan it or legislate for it, it's just...."
"-Oh, God."
-Do you know what I mean?
I think I do.
"You do, don't you, Alice?"
Lovely!
"Wolfie'll check out this tart you've been boning, then."
- Good.
- Maybe Wolfie'll pull her.
- He won't do that because she loves me.
- She loves you?
I'm going to cry!
I mean...
- She loves to fuck me.
- Yeah...
Course she does.
"That evening at the Civic Hall,"
I hoped Neil would enlighten me about what I'd be up to next week.
"He'd never enlightened me about anything before, but you never know."
How was the newspaper?
Did you write anything?
"No, nothing boring like that."
"I'm on the internet most of the day, this afternoon I smashed old desks in a skip and then home at four."
Are we the oldest here?
Possibly.
It's even more shit than I knew it would be.
I honestly don't why you came.
- To see you get blown out by Charlotte.
- Please try not to fuck this up.
"Charlotte asked me so there's a chance, admittedly a very slim chance, that she wants to pull me."
Or maybe she needs a mechanic for her car!
- Good one!
- I'd service her all right.
I'd slide my dipstick in deep!
"Thanks for coming, really appreciate it!"
I'm gonna find Charlotte.
Up to you.
"On the contrary, he sings because he's glad."
He's glad to die.
- The number of legends about swans...
- Dr. Kay.
"They also say swans guide and keep company with the dead, to help them cross the threshold."
That's my favorite...
a very old Celtic legend.
"- Yes, I know it."
- You do?
"- Yes, my wife told me about it."
- Your wife told you about it?
Right.
You mean your ex-wife?
We all live in glass houses.
So I see.
Why don't you finally tell me what I can do for you?
I believe I'm the one who can do something for you.
But you'll see for yourself.
Certain experiences can be very unsettling.
"I'll see what, for God's sake?"
What experiences?
I'm merely pointing out the need to be prepared.
Is that a threat?
"No, it's not a threat."
It's a message.
But I'm not quite sure you're ready to hear it.
How come you know so much about me?
Did you have me checked out?
Did you... was it Ross told you all that stuff?
"""The need to be prepared."" What's that supposed to mean?"
I don't know this Ross person.
I've never met the guy.
It should fetch millions.
Money?
Is that all that it means to you?
Money bought me my title.
This estate.
And now it'll help me go down in history as the discoverer of the Treasure of Atlantis.
"Sorry, co-discoverer."
You think you can buy your way into the history books?
I wouldn't be the first.
Come in.
Anybody.
"Answer me, please?"
"Come in, this is an emergency."
Have a sherry to celebrate.
"I may be forced to work with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it."
"Please, professor, spare me the hypocrisy."
You and I are two of a kind.
"Now, Zavros, he only wants the money to fund his little revolution in Macedonia."
"But you and I share the same dream, to find the Treasure of Atlantis, no matter what it takes, or what the cost."
Go on.
Kelly.
Miss Carson.
"Hey, now, there's no need to be rough with her."
"If she's here, so is MacGyver."
General Zavros is right.
Where is MacGyver?
Answer him.
Tell us where MacGyver is.
I'm not going to tell you anything.
"Kelly, I-I do think you should answer them."
I don't betray my friends.
I'll make her talk.
What is it?
"Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse."
"But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords."
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
Precognition:
The capacity to see the future.
"It is not characteristic of you, John"
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
"It is not characteristic of you, John"
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
"Okay, I'll call you from Chicago."
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
We got here early.
I know about you and the girl.
"We know, okay?"
"Now we can offer you two a way out, a way through."
"And if you do what we say, if you help us, we won't have to hurt her."
There's no need for violence.
Violence is what got us all in this place to begin with.
This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.
It's a partnership.
And it starts by you getting her to open that door.
Fuck you.
"Oh, shit."
Your leg.
"Oh, my God."
I don't even feel anything.
That's usually a bad sign.
You always know what to say to a girl.
Up.
"You have training in this kind of a thing, right?"
What?
- Field surgery?
Dressing wounds?
- Yeah.
"I mean, it's not my area of expertise but I know a little bit."
Okay.
Is all this blood normal?
"Well, you have a piece of truck in your leg."
No way is a joke gonna make me feel more comfortable in your ability to not kill me right now.
Grit your teeth.
Looks like we missed the artery.
"But it's gonna be okay, right?"
Someone will hear us.
That's all I've got to say to you!
Stop it!
I'm sick of it.
"You're the one who keeps following me and makes perverted calls, aren't you?"
That's not me.
I never do things like that!
How can you do things like that?
"And you sent that porn magazine to my company, didn't you!"
?
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.
I wouldn't give this to anyone.
Why do you have it!
?
Nami.
No!
Stop it!
"If I knew your telephone number, I would call you all day."
"And if I'd known where you live, I would've written you a love letter everyday."
What do you want from me?
- The girl in that magazine isn't who I am!
- That's not the you I fell in love with.
Why don't you tear that magazine up then?
Red Porno
You're hopeless.
Why can't you behave normally?
Why do you have to torment me?
"If you get what you want, will you go away?"
This isn't what I want.
This isn't what I hoped would happen.
Will you go out with me tomorrow?
From the department store?
I'm sorry.
"She stopped by, my mind was elsewhere."
I didn't pay attention.
What are you waiting for?
Help me look for it.
Here it is.
My husband has a safe in a bank.
The key is in the left drawer of the desk and the contract is in a Bible in the library.
"Well, this is good news."
Isabelle?
You cut your hair.
It suits you!
Your clerk told me I could find you here.
Can I sit down?
I heard about your mother.
"I didn't have a family before, now there's no one left."
It doesn't make a difference.
- And why didn't you tell me?
"- No, I..."
"No, I wasn't going to tell you about it."
And you wanted some time to think... about us.
"Yes, I thought about it."
"I want to carry on, François."
Whether it suits my son or not...
I am entitled to live my life.
But you... you're not afraid of falling out with him?
He'll get over it.
"For the moment, you're the one that matters."
Will you say the same thing in the future?
The mayor of Villedieu will be searched tomorrow.
There will be consequences.
I'll be dragged through the mud.
It's not the first time either.
"He was arrested 5 years ago-- intimidation, embezzlement."
"He's got his hooks into your sergeant, too, for that matter."
"I'd watch out, if I were you."
"Well, they certainly met in London."
Rather more than that.
They had dinner together after the meeting.
Spencer's taken him very much under his wing.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Excuse me.
[Ring]
Foyle:
Mr. Lane.
Ian:
You've got my boy locked up.
"Well, he ran away."
He was off to London.
He was afraid of you!
He's no criminal.
"Well, assault, drunk and disorderly, skipped bail, did borstal--August to November last year."
That was then.
It hasn't been easy for him living on his own with me.
He lost his mother when he was 9.
She ran off.
It's just been two of us.
"And yes, he mixed with the wrong set and became a cropper with the law."
You people never forget.
Won't let him forget neither.
"It's a bit more than that, isn't it?"
"He was seen at the hotel on the night of the murder, which means he could easily have been the one who took the gun and shot Mrs. Ellis."
He never shot anyone.
"Look, I'm like you, Mom."
Worried sick how Ruby's gonna feel when her teacher dies and her grandmother goes to prison all in the same week.
Tell Ruby I'll call her later.
"Mom, stay away from the District Attorney's family."
Okay?
"This time, the horse comes back, he's got a blond that's like 10 times hotter than the brunette, right?"
"And the bandit's like,"
"""Okay, cowboy, you got one more wish, then you die."""
"And the cowboy's like,"
"""I think I better talk to my horse again."""
"He goes, grabs him by the ears, and he goes,"
"""You dumb lousy animal!"
"I said posse!"""
"Well, I guess what happened is what every reporter dreams of... being in the right place at the right time."
"Or the wrong and the wrong, in this case."
And will the police be questioning you as a witness to the murder?
Revenge killing.
"And, yes, I think so."
Which would be a good reason for us to stop right here.
- We good?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
- Thank you.
"- Appreciate it, Laura."
"- Thanks, guys."
Thanks.
Hey.
"Hey, angel."
That looks great.
What's going on with you?
And don't tell me everything's fine.
There is nothing.
"What do we do now, sir?"
First we get some sack time.
Then we start all over again.
- Muldoon.
- Sir?
Check the perimeter.
Make sure the outposts are set for the night.
I guess it couldn't have been much worse.
We're still alive.
What happens now?
We keep doing our jobs.
"You got one to go back to, haven't you?"
I guess so.
What are you going to say in your newspaper?
"If I say what I feel, I may be out of a job."
We'll always give you one.
I could do you more good with a typewriter.
It's Sergeant Sooby's.
He didn't make it.
Funny thing.
Fellow takes one of these into battle and by the grace of God he comes out in one piece he carries a strange sense of guilt all the rest of his life.
JAMISON:
Colonel?
"I'd like permission to take my men into ""A"" camp to check our equipment."
"And also, that sergeant who was pretty badly hit was asking for you."
Provo?
Thank you.
Captain Johanson is taking the Mike Force back this afternoon.
You can go in with him.
- Happy to have had you aboard.
- Thanks for the ride.
Why wasn't he on the chopper?
Okay.
Sure.
Thanks.
See that?
"What do you got to say now, huh?"
I'm just glad everyone's away during all of this.
- What if she wins?
- She won't.
What if...
You saw that report.
It's claiming you're an absentee parent.
"I know, I know."
It's gonna make it worse if you and I...
If we don't figure things out.
"Yeah, uh..."
"I think, just for now, we have to put our personal issues aside and just create a united front."
"You know, for Georgie's sake."
Just for Georgie's sake?
"No... for us, too."
Kind of a weird day.
"I guess it's becoming a habit for you, this getting arrested thing."
Come on...
I wasn't arrested after that bar episode.
You and Caleb were such a mess.
Ty... why didn't you call?
"You know, after..."
I picked you up and everything?
"I wanted to, but I decided to give you some time to figure out what it is that you want."
"What I wanted was to talk, but..."
you made it pretty clear that you didn't.
"You kept giving me the cold shoulder, and then, this morning, you do a complete 180."
"You kissed me, Ty."
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
I think being on stage at Woodstock was good.
"At that time, I thought we did good."
My opinion of the show was this :
it was obviously fucking chaotic.
You were going off.
"The fucking music was like, sloppier than usual I felt."
"Yeah, that was one of the best show I ever done, personally."
"I connected, I said fuck it and I didn't get tired..."
I broke everything I could and it was an insane show.
Fuck it.
I felt as if the world...
the weight lifted up off me.
I felt just relieved...
But...
"then I heard the tape, it was awful."
"Live, I think, anger becomes a main source of energy to get off of."
The shows become very disorder(impossible a piger?
--dissolved ?
BIZARRE?
)
The lights look amazing...
that's another story.
Where'd you get money for a ride like this?
We' re doctors at County.
- Where you headed in a hurry?
- Y'all can't just do this.
Just be quiet.
I see you guys brought a lot of pals.
What's the deal?
- Four people shot this morning in a diner.
- What diner?
We were just up at the Sedgwick Y in a pickup game.
Call the gym manager.
Why don't you search the car and let us get the hell out of here?
"All right, go ahead."
"See, that's my boss right now."
Somebody's very sick.
"Look, we' re late for our shift."
"Dealers got shifts now, huh?"
"- We are doctors, damn it."
"- Relax, punk."
"No, wait a minute, I can explain that."
I can explain!
"Get on the ground right now, or I'll put a bullet in your damn head."
Cuff them.
You belong to the Y?
I play ball there twice a week.
Who do you play with?
I don't remember their names.
Some live up the street from Greg.
- You show proof to the arresting officers?
"- Yeah, they took my ID."
I told the arresting officer my ID was in the glove.
Did you ever hear of a place called Magoo's?
"That's why I'm even telling you guys this to begin with, because, you know, when things like this happen, sometimes people talk about them."
"You might hear something at school, or you might see Miles or even me on television, and I just wanted to prepare you for it."
I don't understand.
Why would you be arrested?
"Well, I don't know, and that's just it."
It's possible that some people connected with this project did bad things.
That you didn't know about.
That I did not know about.
- Why would you be arrested?
- l'm not going to be arrested.
I'm not going to be arrested.
"I do not want you to worry about this, all right?"
I'm just trying to prepare you in case people talk about it.
Okay?
"- Yeah, okay."
- Yeah?
Okay?
It's really okay.
I have to leave anyway.
"No, it's ready."
"If I could find the syrup... lf we have it, it's in that cabinet right there."
- Of course.
- [knock on door]
That's Mom.
- Hey.
"- Hey, sweetie."
- Are you all ready to go?
"- Yeah, I was, um..."
"- Oh, hi."
"- Hi, Karen."
They're ready.
I was just giving Jessie some waffles.
I'm so glad to see you meeting your son!
Nim-sai!
Nim-sai...
Don't be too excited.
"Men, come and take care of Sir Ho."
"So, you've seen,"
Sir Ho admitted the accused as his son.
"This may be a deliberate conspiracy, a trap for a nullius filius."
But the witness didn't swear in front of the Bible.
"So, his words won't be accepted by the court."
He swore.
"His hands touched the Bible, but he said nothing."
"Alright, again."
"Your Honour, although such a sad thing happened, the words of the witness said before his death... should be forgotten."
Nuts!
"He did say the truth, how can you deny it?"
"Sorry, law is law."
Not any word should be amended.
"Chan Mon-gut, I can't help you."
"Your Honour, you can!"
You'd better learn again.
"Your dad died, and you don't even shed a tear."
I think I'd better learn from you.
It's all because of you!
My dad had heart disease.
"If you didn't ask him to be witness, he wouldn't have died."
"You, murderer!"
"Your Honour, I am sorry."
"My father died, I can't control my emotion."
What's up?
Damn it!
You pretend crying!
"Oh, man."
# Don't sweat what you might get #
# By seeing the other side as a threat... #
"Oh, you kids!"
# We gotta learn to all get along #
# East side west side #
# It doesn't matter to me #
# We gotta learn to power through and set each other free #
# Don't care what other people wear #
# Or the way they like to style their hair #
"# Neither side is right or wrong, that's why we got to all get along #"
"God, this sucks!"
"Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losing her, S-Stan?"
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do about it anyway.
Maybe you should just talk to her.
"You know, a little conversation."
Tell her what you feel.
# Sometimes ya feel like there's a b-b-burnin' inside ya like a-- #
Just stop.
All righty then.
"Uh, Wendy..."
"Hey, Stan."
"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should."
What?
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
"Stan, that's ridiculous."
- It is?
- I would never leave you for Bridon.
- Really?
- No way!
That'd be stupid!
There is no John Brandeis.
It was just Constantine.
Moving money around.
"We don't know that, Georgie, we"
We don't know Constantine's side.
"He wasn't the only one using the Safe Room, Christos was too."
"No one is who they seem, are they?"
Christos is an addict.
Do you think he's capable of this?
There is no John Brandeis.
You're right!
I have to talk to Christos.
You and I are cut from the same ice
Sincerity made us the perfect heist
Burning all the gold to sapphire skies
But the breeze is cold in paradise
I can feel the whispers in the street
Every night I shiver in my sleep
"No reality, cause it's all a dream"
Was it love?
It was wild Brought me to my knees
"Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things"
"I tiptoe right round my baby All this world is mad, mad crazy"
Was it love?
It was wild Brought me to my knees
"Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things"
"I tiptoe right round my baby All this world is mad, mad crazy"
Allo!
Hi!
"Yes, this is Georgina Clios."
I'm here to see Christos.
"He isn't here, I'm afraid."
But what?
"But what, Ryan?"
You better speak now.
His ex mentioned that he might have a bit of a bad habit.
What kind of habit?
The kind that requires rubber sheets.
He's a bed wetter?
Yo.
Detective Menendez just called.
"According to the prop master, those two knives went missing on the last day of the shoot."
Ohh.
He's got the studio pulling drive-on logs from that day.
He's gonna send us over a copy so we can see if any of the names connect to one of the New York murders.
"Hey, you okay?"
[Chuckles]
"Damn, what'd you tell her?"
Bed wetter. [Laughs]
[Sighs]
This had better be important.
The masseuse was in the middle of doing things one only dreams of.
I was able to trace the tracker in my dad's watch.
It was purchased by a man named Malcolm McCabe.
Oh.
Born and raised in L.A.
Former Army Special Forces.
Says here he's working overseas.
He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.
"We should go talk to her, see if she knows anything."
"Sure, we could do that."
Or we could just pretend you never found this.
Fine.
But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.
This is Mukesh calling.
Sorry.
Who is there ma?
Somebody's got the wrong address.
What are you doing here?
Leave!
My husband can come anytime!
Did he hit you?
What else do you expect?
A trophy?
"My sisters are coming, I need my money."
Are you done?
They rescheduled my appointment for tomorrow.
Breakfast!
"Johnny bhai, I need a favour?"
What?
You will have to go to that lady's house the one that you met with me.
Why don't you go yourself?
My aunt lives in the same colony if she sees me there...
What work do you have with her?
Sleeping through the day begets bad luck my friend!
She says that your due has already been paid to you.
Your lady friend didn't even let me enter the house!
She started shouting and threatening me saying that she will call her husband!
They have given your number to the cops even filed a report against you...
What the hell are you upto?
You will get me into trouble as well
Screwed up my work.
Got me thrown out of the house.
And now she says she will not pay me!
Bitch!
Does she think I am scared of her and her husband!
Result Report

[Park Seon Woo.
Kim Tae Kyung.
Park Dae Man.]
"Hey, let's see."
"Why are you like that, after one punch?"
After you beat me up last time...
I can't say I won...
I just got lucky when I went in with that punch.
"Anyway, since you gave up first, you have to do me a favor."
Think about it.
Why does my friend have to be accused of murder?
When the real murderer is out there.
Just tell me where his house is.
Please.
You said that you were hiding this secret for your friend's sake.
"You cover for your friend, and you fight really well..."
You're not doing anything bad.
This is for the good of your friend.
Come on.
Where is your friend's house?
Hello.
"Hello, there."
- Are you moving?
- What is this about?
We just got a call.
He said that he is the murder suspect for this case and that he will be coming to the police station at 5 p.m. to turn himself in.
But we got to talking.
"He said that he was persuaded by you, Representative."
By you.
"We wanted to have you there while he confessed, so we came here early."
You always have it your way.
Okay thank you.
I will send it in.
You still have time to see me?
I've been standing here for a while now.
I feel like I'm making life hard for you.
"Seriously, why are you here?"
"I'm trying very hard, doc."
This is trying?
Yes.
"It's spread to your ear now, you know that?"
Rash: 50 spots
"If on the outside it's like this, the inside is probably worse."
I understand doc but...
I've been dying to do this job.
And it finally arrived.
You want me to turn it down?
Opportunities like this come once in a life time.
"But you only have one life, right?"
That's right.
"We got one life, so we should do what we want to do."
And do the best we can.
You look like you aren't afraid of dying.
"You just said that we only have one life, right?"
"So we should find what makes us happy, right?"
And what I do makes me happy.
I don't feel tired doing it.
So I work hard and I'm wrong?
"And everyone has to die anyways, right?"
You're a doctor.
You should know that.
You obviously know little about dying.
What have you done with Nicholas?
What have I done with Nicholas?
"He can't hear you now, pal."
"Oh, come on."
You know he's dead.
Yeah.
"You ought to do something with that faulty memory of yours, pal."
Might make your life a little bit easier.
"By the way, I just love them little notes you leave for yourself."
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.
"Where is your hospitality, partner?"
"If someone walks in, he might get the wrong idea."
Who are you?
"Well, looks like you got some explaining to do, partner."
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
"You going somewhere, Mr. Reznik?"
"Yeah, Mrs. shrike, I'm moving."
I didn't receive notice.
Your lease requires you to give 30 days notice in writing.
"It wasn't planned, something came up."
You can keep my security deposit.
I won't be needing it anyway.
"Really, Mr. Reznik?"
You used to be such a good tenant.
I just don't understand it.
"Oh, isn't that pretty?"
Would you care to sell it?
"No, it was my mother's."
I've made arrangements to donate all my things.
- Sookie and Jackson?
- That would be fun.
- And Grandma and Grandpa?
"- Oh, no."
Come on.
It's your graduation.
They should be there.
- Forget it.
They won't want to be there.
- Of course they will.
"Rory, I was supposed to graduate from high school, go to Vassar... marry a Yale man, get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny."
"Instead, I got pregnant."
I didn't finish high school...
"I didn't marry your father, and I ended up in a career... that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her."
I humiliated them.
"The two proudest people in the world, and I humiliated them."
I spoiled their plans.
"I took their fine upbringing... in a world of comfort and opportunity, and I threw it in their faces."
"I broke their hearts, and they'll never forgive me."
I guess I can't expect them to.
Maybe you're wrong about how they feel.
It was a long time ago.
"Rory, I don't want them to go."
"It'll just hurt them, and me."
- Okay?
- Okay.
- You should get back to your studying.
- Fine.
- Great.
- What?
I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours.
"- No, you haven't."
"No, get out."
Kuzou.
Why the hell am I being followed?
Why are you having me followed?
"I understand your anger, but while mr."
Tendo visiting we cannot take any chances.
"Hey look, you hired me."
If you don't trust me cut me lose.
I don't need some freak with a sword following me every time I take a shit.
Are you always this crude?
Only when I'm pissed off.
Only when I'm pissed off.
Then I'm sorry I pissed you off.
Oh yeah.
I think that's yours.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Christ.
Campanela's?
The yakuza's don't mess around.
How did you get these?
They sent them to you?
I think campanela wants us to know what we're up against.
I think campanela wants us to know what we're up against.
Mafia is warning us about yakuza's?
That's rich.
Maybe you're right.
I just hope our guys can bust them before they start an all out war.
"Right, what amazes me is how he got so deep, so fast."
How good is his cover story?
Convict died in solitary so we gave brand his identity.
There is no way for yakuza to found out otherwise.
I think they should reduce the working hours.
"Eight hours a day, instead of the current ten."
They only pay us 7000 FM a month.
"The people that work eight hours a day are paid better... than us, that's the real problem."
So what do you want us to do?
I think people are spoiled here.
Did you hear?
"After the first month, everyone's in debt."
You have to claim your rights.
"Besides, there's tattletales among us."
"They keep quiet now, and talk later."
"Instead of insulting each other, let's reach an agreement."
"In any case, we need to earn more."
- Speak up!
"- Traoré, a call for you."
- I'm at a meeting.
- It's very urgent.
- What do you want?
- It's not my problem.
"Instead of talking, let's act."
How?
- Let's go and see the boss!
- We've already seen him.
Let's go once more.
"And if he doesn't see us, we stop working."
"Traoré, the boss is calling."
"Doumbia, carry on with the meeting, I'll be right back."
You know what we have to do.
Traoré will be back.
Wait for him.
Let me go!
Where were you when my fur order arrived?
I feel so glamorous.
Damn it.
Jill's already with the Earl.
"Look at her over there, shamelessly flirting with him."
Maybe I should just go home.
"No, you can't."
That's quitter talk.
"If you don't go down fighting, what does that do for us?"
Who look up to you.
What's the use?
"Look, he's already interested in..."
Hello.
"You move like an angel, as if you were floating across the room."
"Thank you for remarking on my grace, your grace."
Ah.
"Beluga, my favorite."
- I simply adore beluga.
- I adore it more.
Mm-hmm.
Delicious.
"Poor child, have you never had caviar?"
You must be so sheltered and naive.
"Well, I'm certainly not as worldly and experienced as some."
Perhaps the Earl would like to hear a story of a woman who's been ridden by more men than the London underground.
Or perhaps the Earl would like to see a recent photo of a woman with a mustache.
"I'm not sure that I would, actually."
"Who do you want the Earl to end up with,"
Joy mouse or Jill mouse?
Of course I'm rooting for Joy.
"Well, obviously I'm rooting for Joy too."
- But it's gonna be Jill.
- Totally.
Safe?
"What do you mean, safe?"
Make her stop that.
She's making me nervous.
Get out of my way.
It's no time to do a thing like that!
Annie!
Take your foot off.
Annie!
Take your trunk off.
"Annie, please go back!"
"That's gold, bugler."
"Look at it, bugler."
That's yours and mine.
"Archibald Cutter, the blooming duke, look at me, and Rajah Gunga Din... pouring diamonds out of that there blinking water bag."
Bugle will be very satisfactory.
"Come on, Din."
The world is ours.
Kali.
"Sahib, come quick."
"Thugs, lift up your faces... to the light that shines from Kali's throne."
Brothers in Thuggee... we are the friendless of this earth.
Every man's hand is against us.
"We have been kicked, spat upon... and driven to the hills like wild things."
"My father was a Thug, and he was hanged."
His father was blown from a cannon's mouth.
"And what of your kinsmen, your fathers and their fathers... and their fathers' fathers before them?"
"My brothers, a new day is at hand."
"I have read the omens, and they are good."
"Three nights ago, a jackal screamed upon the left."
Another answered from the right at once.
"What does that mean, my brothers?"
Victor.
"Victor, you are risking his life."
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.
He's the only one I can leave my my bankruptcy to.
"That's what experimentation is all about, Letha."

"He has no fear, no memory, no will."
He can only carry out my commands.
What... what's happening?
We're out of gas.
"What are you, crazy?"
"Look at the dial, it points to... empty."
Empty?
It was all that waiting I had to do for youse.
I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas.

I sure hope you make the tip worth it.
Something's going to happen to someone near here.
We've got to help.

The general's funeral.
Right after the D.O.D. closed up shop and sent us home with a $600 check and our dicks in our hands.
You've come a long way.
- Ah.

You remember the last thing you told me?
When my uncle said he'd hook us up?
That I was done hurting people.
And you wanted a cozy corporate job.
How's that working out for you?
I'm not here to reminisce.
"Then why are you here, exactly?"
I need some information about a hit on a suit.
A hit?
Outside the wall.
The man from Spiga's here to see me about a murder.
I'm here to see if you'll help out a fellow soldier.
"Well, now you're just trying to take advantage of my soft heart."
You really want my help?
Then take my offer.
It's still on the table.
I'm happy with my job.
I fund a clinic.
I'm a man of the people.
What do you do after you punch in?
"Brother, I just need information."
"Of course, Cap."
I'll ask around.

Precisely.
Do you think that you could send for it?
We don't have to send for it.
I have right here in my Utility Belt a remote control Batcomputer oscillator.
"Oh, heh."
- How convenient.
How does it work?
-Simple.
I just press this button and it activates the radio frequency Bat-generator.

It wouldn't recognize your voice.

ls there any bank in Gotham City which Black Widow has not robbed?

"You are lonely here, aren't you?"
It's not the worst thing that can happen to you.

- You can learn to live by yourself.
You can get used to it.
Maybe.
But that doesn't make it the best way to live.
The best way?
What would that be?
"People meeting, talking."
"Well, in Peyton Place, two people talking is a conspiracy."
"A meeting is an assignation, and getting to know one another is a scandal."
I think you're hard on the town and hard on yourself.

She was born without a complete reproductive system.
She couldn't bear children?
"Whoever she is, she isn't your baby's mother."

Maybe just this.
"$1,000"

"Are you at liberty to play for that, Sctanley?"
Or would you prefer to play for smiles?
"Monsieur Marcel, I'm sorry to have woken you."
"I thought there was an emergency, but I was mistaken."
I do apologize.
I play at expert level.
You take this kind of serious.
That's a big screen.
You've played this before.
"Maybe just a couple times, Sctanley."
"All right, Sctanley, let's have some fun."
"Come on, Sctanley, get him!"

You kidnapped me with a candy bar?
"Well, you have to admit it was rather inventive."
"Oh, God."
Don't be upset.

We have to find it first.

It's everything Lydia can translate.
"And trust me, she was very confused."
What's the problem?
- It's your sister.
- I just got off the phone with her.
Not Kitty.
- What do you mean you knew?
- I ran into her at Holly's house.
You didn't think it was worth mentioning?
- I didn't think you wanted to hear it.
- You were right.
"- Well, what was she like?"
- I don't know.
She...
She seemed fine.
How long is she staying?
"If this is just a visit, drop it."
It's not just a visit.
She dropped out of college and was living with a friend.
"When that didn't work out, she moved back home."
Indefinitely.
Sounds like Holly raised a real winner.
"Despite your opinion of Holly or Rebecca, the question remains, what are we going to do?"
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Not with everything that's been going on here.
- What's that supposed to mean?
"- What I mean, Tommy, is do you think this business with Holly can go on if Mom finds out about Rebecca?"
This is exactly why I didn't want to say anything.
Holly is working here.
What if Nora runs into Rebecca?
What if your mother asks questions?
I say we tell her.
"I can't believe I'm hearing this from you, Saul."
I'm the sheriff.
It's my business to know such things.
"Besides, this road only goes to one place."
"Now, you folks have a good time down there, you hear?"
- Thank you.
- This'll be cleared up in no time.
Great.
"Thanks, sheriff."
[Mike] Thanks a lot.
"Come on, Bills."
"He's back at it again, Perry."
That girl's cut the same way as those two last year.
"Earl, why don't you just haul this stuff to town and stop playing coroner?"
You know it's the same.
You ain't no closer to catching him now than you was then.
I know.
But your blabbing about it ain't going to do nothing except maybe scare folks around town half to death.
"Now, will you get that stuff out of there?"
I got something I got to do.
"You're too old for this job, Sheriff."
"[chattering, laughing]"
"Hey, Billy, how about it, huh?"
"Sure, Mom."
Hold it.
"Draw, sidewinder, or I'll kill you where you stand."
You got your iron there.
"You better pull it, or I'm going to blow you apart."

Got to watch out for these varmints.
"Thanks, Sheriff."
"Hey, that's great."
"- Sergeant, relax, okay?"
Your friends were in trouble;
you did what you had to do.
And now I got to do what I got to do.
"- Oh, no, a memorandum of admonishment?"
- Much worse--you're never gonna see the sun again.
Your families--they're gonna forget your faces.
You'll eat lunch at dinnertime and dinner at breakfast.
And you'll...
"Ah, what was I talking about?"
I totally lost my train.
- You were punishing us.
"- Yes, thank you."
Ah!
I'm transferring the whole squad to the night shift.
- Noooo!
- Yes.
-Notadoctor.
-Shh.
You're watching Channel 36's
"""Power News Live at Five."""
"We've got the most high school sports, the most lottery numbers, and the most weather in the Tri-Swamp area."
It's news time!
"Good evening, I'm Brynn DeRose."
And I'm Slade Austin.
"Tonight on ""Power News,"""
we reveal who Donald Trump is running against for President.
"Plus, we'll show you the winning lottery numbers."
Could 67 be one of them?
Two prisoners have escaped from the Coral Palms sheriff's station in a daring daylight jailbreak.
"The men, identified as Gregory Stickney and Larry Sherbert were arrested after a routine traffic stop revealed a cache of automatic weapons."
I need my brother back.
I promise.
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
- Are you ready?
- One condition.
Just this then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
He'll get you everything you need.
You talking to me?
You what?
You what?
Check this out!
Don't point a gun at me ever again.
- Where'd you get it?
- Kosovan Kate.
- Who's Kosovan Kate?
- She works with the Albanians.
"Here, you need to wear these - give the Old Bill a head start."
She's setting up her own people?
"Mate, I don't know how much you know about that part of the world but they treat women in a very degrading way."
Dealing with you must make a nice change.
"She noshed me off for free,"
- that's got to tell you something.
"- Yeah, it certainly does."
Lenny wants it done at the airfield.
Isn't there a lot of CCTV down there?
"Entrances, lobbies, exit to runways, manager's office."
"There's a blind spot in the toilets, though."
It's what everyone does before they get on a plane.
- But the front entrance is covered?
- I can get you in a different way.
"people come about 1 o'cIock, they're busy before that."
And before 4 pm nobody moves.
Robberies?
Everyone knows everyone here.
"With all these stairs, how could they everrob us?"
"It would take Tom Cruise from ""Mission:"
"impossible""."
You deny this area has a high crime rate?
You have no perception of reality!
We'II get a specialist to evaluate.
He was sent here orhe came by hisself?
"And anotherthing: when you speak, I don't understand you."
Speak to me in italian.
Were you sent here or did you come by yourself?
They sent me here to make you work.
Let's try to optimize the work.
I'm constipated.
You're pushing it.
Maria!
You could have come a little later!
"I can drive like a pro, too, taking curves with an ear on the ground."
finally Mr. VoIpe is here too.
Had to wash Mommy's dishes?
AII those courses...
Aren't you feeling well?
Why are you laughing?
Know what this man did?
"I invited him to my house, he locked himself in and hid his wallet, scared I'd steal it."
Don't force me to report you for discipline.
I'm shakin'.
You asked forit.
Didn't they teach you manners?
See the diff?
"Do you mean ""hyphen""?"
You are gay... because you are attracted to men.
That's it.
"You sleep with men... man, me."
- You sleep with me.
- Yeah.
"And that... is pretty gay, dude."
Exactly.
And people don't want to think about our sex life.
"Uh, I could show you a few fanfic forums..."
On the Internet.
But...
I play baseball on TV.
Okay?
"TV gays, they... they sing about acceptance."
"Or host daytime talk shows for housewives, or... acquire babies from exotic locations like China or wombs."
That is so not me.
"You've met me, right?"
Look...
You are such a great actor.
"I mean, you've played everything from an elf to a..."
Christmas elf.
"I mean, you could be a little less..."
"So the Alderaan of my uniqueness is to be blasted out of existence by the Death Star of ""less gay?"""
Is that right?
"I'm not sure, but... nerdy stuff like that, I mean, that is a good place to start."
"Maybe, maybe if you wore glasses then people would look at the smart, not the gay."
You want me to be Anderson Cooper.
"I mean, you know, if he were gay."
- All I'm asking is...
"- I know what you're asking, Brady."
"Thank you, Nicky."
"Dragan, how would you describe your life?"
Well...
"Everything happens differently, you know."
Nothing was what I wanted it to be.
You are perhaps the only one who knows that is true.
But now I just try...
To feel felt pain.
And it would be enough for me now.
Describe the pain.
"Do not ask me this, please."
Remember picker?
Of course I remember it.
I and you have lived the whole war.
Do you remember when you called me and you told me not to get out?
Why do you ask me if I remember it?
- Why did not you want it to go out?
What do you think I did not do?
"It would launch my career, but I heard you."
And I did not quit it.
You...
You just...
Did something that no one else would have done.
And  I...
I can not believe you did it.
"All right, I admit it."
"I tried to convince Dragan to get him out, but I did not succeed."
My chosen movie shooter will never see the light.
But the king had listened carefully to every word.
You do not like it?
- Yes I like it.
"That's just the beginning, try again."
"Stop joking about this, please."
"For most people, Fantômas is nothing but make-believe."
Nobody was able to put a name on the man behind the mask.
I have the feeling you forget the death of
Juve in his last battle against Fantômas.
It is true that our famous Police officer was horribly killed.
Buried beneath Lady Beltham's hotel.
Yes.
A dirty death...
but it will perhaps have been useful.
Useful?
How?
Because it proves the existence Fantômas.
Because it forced him to disappear.
"Curiously, it is in dying that Juve has kept Fantômas from doing harm."
So what do we do with Baroness de Vibray?
"Could we not suggest that Dollon was heir to his will, or something like that?"
"Hello, yes?"
Yes.
"It's for you, Fandor."
Thank you.
Yes?
Jacques Dollon just hung himself in his cell.
Thank you for calling So the murderer hanged himself?
"My little Fandor, the murderer is innocent."
"What are you talking about, Arsène?"
We just brought a letter with the name of the Baroness de Vibray on the back.
I read it discretly before bringing it to the procurator.
I copied it.
"""Mr Procurator."
The Barbey and Nanteuil bankers made it clear that I'm completely ruined.
I have no family.
Your dad is a police officer...
You shouldn't say that.
Then why are you running away?
- Come here.
- Let go of me.
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry that I'm a day late.
This... is that watch that high school students like these days.
Tell me now.
Did you kill someone or not?
I didn't.
Soo Bin...
"Your father is... is trying to catch a really bad guy, and that's why he's hiding right now."
"If you were five years younger, that's how I would have explained it."
Um...
I still don't know how I should explain it.
But you'll still...
"believe in me, won't you?"
I told you... that I want to make this a better world for you.
Then are you saying that I was the one who was wrong?
I'm not saying that.
"I'm telling you to believe in me, Soo Bin."
I'm asking you to believe in me.
We're family.
We know each other better than anybody knows anybody.
You shouldn't have run away if you did nothing wrong!
Okay.
That was... my mistake.
"Well, I have to go now."
There were times when...
I... didn't believe in you.
So I'm reflecting on that.
You know what?
Just go.
Seriously.
"Okay,the band rents the rehearsal space."
It's not like we're meeting in somebody's basement.
Are you not attracted to me?
What?
!
"I just can't help thinking if I was some hot,tatted-up 22-year-old, maybe rehearsal wouldn't seem so important right now."
This is insane.
"I mean,I know I've gained a little weight, but it's not like I'm not going to lose it."
"I just have to be careful because of my food issues, and,yes,maybe I have a tra of body dismorphic disorder again, but whatever."
Who doesn't?
I have to go.
You're so grossed out right now!
"I am not grossed out,okay?"
I'm just late.
Don't leave me!
What is with you tonight?
I don't know!
I don't know...
Fine.
Let's go take a freakin' bath and figure it out.
Come on.
Let's go make raising fingers.
"Baby,the MySpace page is just for the band."
You have nothing to worry about.
I can't believe you were stalking me on MySpace.
"Hey,would you mind washing my back?"
Mind?
I'd pay good money to wash that back.
Come here.
"I've this intention to learn, too."
You wish to learn kung-fu from my master?
Shut up!
His Highness is such a noble person.
"Master Liu, I know Shaolin kung-fu has never been learned by my people."
But the time has come for them to start learning.
"Your Highness, although kung-fu is for everyone,"
I'm really not capable of being your master.
So you turn me down?
Don't move!
Your Highness!
Please sit down!
"Mr. Liu, I hope you'll reconsider."
"Come on, let's drink!"
"Come on, cheers!"
Cheers!
Close all Shaolin schools in this area!
Yes!
"Your Highness, please don't be emotional."
Don't you still want to learn Shaolin Chin Kang Fist and Wu-tang 8-divine Sword?
"If Law Ching of the Wu-tang also refuses to hand over the 8-divine Sword book, what shall we do?"
I've got an idea.
You'll have the book.
I must have it by any means.
"Mr. Law, please!"
Please!
Playing chess is like having a sword fight.
"Strong, fast, and accurate."
"What a good sword, your Highness..."
Do you think your Wu-tang sword is better than mine?
I came here tonight to play chess.
Please don't mention anything about swords.
But evidence does.
"Ah,good."
"Abby,have you lifted the dna from the shovel handle yet?"
"You know,from the sweat we discovered on the handle."
"Oh.Yeah,uh,right."
I-I've got it running.
I'm ready to check it.I just need a sample.
"Well,then... test it against the saliva on this."
You're right.
I tried to cover up her murder.
But I didn'kill him.
That cheating bitch did.
"Boss,Mr. Carvell re admitted to ducky he buried the body."
"Oh,my god."
It was you?
Who else cleans up your messes?
I was watching the two of you from the window.
You watched us make love?
That's not what I'd call it.
Then what happened?
"-They had a fight,she hit him on the head,and she ran."
-Rick... that he's lying.
All I did was bury him.
"Well,I'm afraid you did a bit more than that."
Right.
I unburied him.
Sit down.
A reexamination of the conjunctival and facial tissu revealed petechial hemorrhages suggesting asphyxia.
"So I looked for atelectasis in his lungs, which results from shallow breathing due to aobstruction such as plastic."
And there it was.
Lance corporal finn was buried alive.
He was dead!
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison, hmm..."
When your stupid bitch of boyfriend turns on you?
They kill your aunt.
They almost kill Lydia.
"Who do you really think's gonna be next, hmm?"
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
"Is that what you tell yourself, hmm?"
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
Allison?
What are you doing here?
I...
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
* You got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
BROOKE:
"Oh, no."
He's tuning out.
That's the look he gives me when I try to tell him...
"Well, just about anything."
We don't have that problem.
"Jack thinks every other thing I say is ""great""!"
"No, no, no, he's got this, just stay focused, Jack."
...and that basic bitch had the nerve to change the margins on my profit-loss statements?
Mm-mmm.
"Amy, I need to talk to you."
"Look, I jumped into this without thinking it through, and that's on me, so..."
What are you trying to say?
[mouthing words]
"What I'm trying to say, Amy, is..."
What are you doing with your hands?
[mouthing words]
"I realize that I have a lot of growing up to do, and you and I aren't going to make it."
Are you breaking up with me?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
AMY:
Wow.
"I appreciate your honesty, but when I look at the balance sheet of our relationship, you're still kind of a jerk."
[phone camera clicks]
"""Kind of a jerk."""
"""Kind of a jerk!"""
"- That's two steps above ""monster."""
- Mm hmm.
I'm proud of you.
"Yeah, I keep this up, by Christmas I'll just be"
"""sort of unpleasant."""
"I'll take the key now, friend."
You are a liar and a cheat and a coward.
Just the key.
Not in the back.
"You can turn around, if you want to."
"I'm just trying to save your life, that's all."
"You kill me, you're gonna protect this half girl, half woman?"
and that boy?
One thing is clear.
"The world has lost a brave, a valiant heart."
"An humble man, a man of small pretensions,"
Boise Peabody's last dying wish was...
Boise Peabody?
"I come to see my brother buried, not the little snake that killed him."
Fill it up.
Wait a minute.
"After the ceremony, all right?"
Fill it up.
Stop!
"Stop, stop!"
The proudest moment of my life.
The whole mining camp turned out to pay their last respects.
You ain't gonna spoil it for me.
"Boise, ain't you dead?"
He is now.
Boise Peabody killed your brother in a fair fight.
"Uh-huh, and now I'm gonna kill him."
He's not armed.
"That's a mistake that you ain't likely to make again now, are you, Boise?"
"Fontana, I won't stand here and watch you murder him."
Just do whatever you like.
Now then.
But never thought I'd walk away.
With so much joy but so much pain.
And it's so hard to say goodbye.
But yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
Another chapter in the book.
Can't go back but you can look.
And there we are on every page.
Memories I'll always save.
Up ahead only open doors.
Who knows what we're heading towards.
"I wish you love, I wish you luck."
For you the world just opens up.
But it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
"Every day that we had all the good, all the bad."
I'll keep 'em here inside.
"All the times that we shared every place, everywhere."
You touched my life.
- Saul shouldn't have said anything.
- No!
You do not get to blame Saul!
"He had enough faith in me, enough respect for me to be honest, which is more than I can say for you or Tommy or Kevin."
Were you never going to tell me?
You've had so much to cope with.
It just didn't seem to be the right time.
I can just see Tommy spearheading this whole brilliant idea.
- He's so like his father.
"- No, it was my idea."
- It was your idea?
- Yeah.
I was the one who thought that we should keep this information from you.
"Your father made you president of our family business, Sarah."
Not our family.
You taught me to put family first.
I was trying to.
"No, it is not."
You were trying to do what was easy for you.
You think it's been easy keeping this a secret?
No one asked you to!
There is no justification for this.
"- Oh, God."
What?
- Hey.
You ready for dinner?
- May I speak to Dan Silk?
- Talking to him.
"If you're going to make a living tarnishing people's reputations, you may want an unlisted number."
Thanks for the tip.
- Do I know you?
"- No, you do not."
- And?
It's Lionel Luthor right before he died.
What?
No way.
Creepy.
I can't believe you got this.
It's gonna get creepier.
There's someone else in the room.
Lionel Luthor might have been pushed.
You think this blurry blob of pixel is the killer?
Trust me.
This has Pulitzer written all over it.
What are you waiting for?
Sharpen the shot.
It's not that easy.
My computer's not powerful enough.
What about that heavy-duty hardware that Lana has stashed at the Isis foundation?
Nice.
"I can upload this bad boy to the foundation's server right now and, if we're on Lana's system, we could use Chloe's mad skills with a CPU."
"That is, if we can pry her away from Clark."
Chloe and I share the same DNA.
"Trust me, Jimmy..."
She is gonna want to be in on this.
I'm so sorry about your father.
"Thank you, Chloe."
He visited you here tonight.
He really wasn't himself.
"I fear, in his deluded state of mind, my father disposed of some valuable family heirlooms."
Did he give you anything?
Other than the feeling that something was definitely off?
No.
He was here for a few minutes.
Don't turn on the light.
You want something to drink?
"No, no."
I'm not staying.
What are you trying to do here?
"Turn that off, please."
You think having the lights off... is gonna make everything OK?
Just let me pretend for a while.
"Pretend what, that you can't see?"
I can't see.
I can't see things that are right in front of me... and I can see things that couldn't be there.
"For all I know, it was Cuchetto on the stairs."
I saw Valerie after she died.
I saw my mother.
Want to see me cry?
Boo-hoo!
My dog got hit by a Cadillac.
Now get the fuck out of here.
Simmer down.
Is this the cross you saw?
Is it?
How about this one?
That's it.
Why didn't you tell me... about these other hallucinations you had?
Because it wouldn't make me a credible witness.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that what you're here to tell me... that I'm a nut and you're moving on?
Why do you think I assigned someone to protect you?
I can protect myself.
With what...
darkness?
I survived 20 years... without sight or a cop at my door.
It's been open to that same page for the last three days.
"Oh, that's the centre page."
It opens there naturally.
- How long for the pancakes?
- Just a few minutes.
Well I'll finish getting dressed.
Mother?
"Mother, I can't wear this coat."
"Yes, you're right, Samantha."
The colour isn't very becoming to you.
"Oh, that's perfect."
Mother.
"I know, I know."
"I don't understand, but I know."
"I will have a mink coat when Darrin can afford it, and not before."
"Well, by the time Darwin can afford a mink, mink will be extinct."
"Now, be honest with yourself, Samantha."
Wouldn't you adore to have that coat?
Well...
Wear it in good health.
Mother.
You take back this coat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"It's crazy, but I've been looking at that picture of that mink coat for so long, I could've sworn you were just wearing one."
Darrin would you like to tell me what's bothering you?
"I don't know, honey."
L...
I don't seem to be getting anywhere.
I've been doing pretty much the same job for the last three years and what have I accomplished?
"Sweetheart, I think you accomplished a great deal."
Like what?
"Get it over to Aaron,"
- see what we get.
"- Okay, good."
Ma'am...
When were you going to tell me ?
Excuse me.
Tell you what ?
Last week you were looking at Ray's old case files.
"And now today, a man I thought was locked up for the rest of his life, the man that killed my husband, was murdered."
I'm still working on that.
"You see the way I have this is that if Bob Keaton got out of prison, that tells me he wasn't Ray's killer."
"Horatio, don't lie."
Do you trust me ?
I thought I could.
I need you to trust me until I have something real to tell you.
Okay ?
You promise me ?
Promise ?
Of course.
Hey.
"Alexx, what is that ?"
The shooter left a calling card our competitor missed.
Muzzle stamp.
It was under the mess.
They didn't know to look for it.
"But we did, didn't we ?"
The killer got close for the second shot.
The heat softened Bob's skin.
And then the muzzle smashed into it.
"The muzzle with an imperfection, Alexx."
This demarcation is unique only to the killer's gun.
"So we find that gun, we match it to this imperfection, we have our killer."
- That's right.
Excuse me.
I've got a pebble in my left boot.
"Hello, Higginbotham."
- How would you like to come with me?
- What?
I'd like to discuss a few of my military theories with you.
"I'd like to have a little chat, get to know each other better."
"- How about a bit of a drink, Bert?"
"- Thanks, Cutter."
- Where's Ballantine?
- Never mind that civilian.
"I got Bertie Higginbotham, his replacement."
"Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner, haven't you, Bertie?"
"We can look after that, old boy."
Take a plunge into this punch.
Punch?
That stuff's for drummer boys and old ladies.
- Not that stuff.
- That would knock a horse down.
"Swill that down, me boy... and you'll think all the Thugs in India is a bunch of missionaries."
"That's right, Bert."
That's a funny thing.
The punch tastes all right.
It's all right.
"Bert, how about having another drink?"
"To the new comradeship, Mac and you and me and the regiment forever."
"- That's it, Bertie, my boy."
- I'll drink to that.
All right.
Here's to good old Bertie Higginbotham... the finest soldier since William the blooming Conqueror.
"Down the hatch, boys!"
What's that?
"split it up so ""shit you're Mallory Knocks aint you"","
And the ri... and the last half is separate from the first half.
Holy shit!
"Most of my writing comes from having a place in San Diego, time to think..."
And in the past I just...
never allowed myself time to do that.
- Ya want to try it with this ?
- How come I don't hear shit !
"So right at "".."
"I'd be Mickey and Mallory"", doom doom ""I'm back in babys arms..."""
"""..."
"I'd be Mickey and Mallory"""
But it of the...
fade out of the crowd...
"I'm trying to have the discipline to um, get in a space where, I can also be writing, while touring."
which so far has been going pretty well.
-Did you record that?
-Yep!
So I'm gonna put him in movies and he'll be a star...
- Don't you think?
"Come on, you're the cameraman, man."
- Oh fuck!
- Is this...?
- Is this the catering yet?
- Brad Pitt
- Fucking Brad Pitt.
"- He hates that bottom line, he hates..."
"- If he could read well enough, to read a script..."
Oh Danny get back in here...
defend yourself!
Make it a little bit more interesting too...
The guy was an industry legend.
Oh.
Wow!
You are so going to hit that.
"No, I just think we're going to be great together on the air."
And on the sofa and on the bed and on the coffee table.
"All right, all right."
I'm gonna go up on the roof and stand there by myself for five minutes.
Have fun.
And that's exactly what she did.
She just stood there.
"All right, kids, I'm gonna level with you."
That's not what she did.
Here's what she did.
"All right, all right."
I'm going to go have a cigarette.
BOTH:
What?
!
NARRATOR:
"I promised her I'd never tell you this, but once upon a time, your Aunt Robin did enjoy the occasional cigarette, and occasionally that occasional cigarette... was more than just occasional."
I just left something like this in my apartment.
"Robin, come on, take it to the roof."
We said no smoking in the apartment after you torched the throw rug doing push-ups.
"All right, all right, all right."
Geez.
"Yeah, Robin, I mean, God, not only is that a filthy habit, but also, can I bum one?"
Sure.
What?
!
"""How I Met Your Mother"""
- Sync By YesCool -
"- Dan, what is that projection?"
"- Thank you, Greg."
"CNN is prepared to make the following projection that Virginia, with its 13 electoral votes, is a win for President Meyer."
This election is a tie.
We did it!
We have one more hurdle to overcome.
And we shall overcome.
One more river to cross.
One more mountain to climb.
But I have been to the mountaintop.
Thank you.
- I don't know what to do.
- We don't do anything.
- You do what you have to do.
"- Yeah, I'm getting drunk."
"Hey, Dan, when you get this, can you put in a good word for me with Greg?"
I think that I need to keep my TV work going.
"Okay, you're gonna win."
"And if you don't, I'll kill myself."
"Kent, what happens next?"
You've got to know.
"No, I'm afraid not."
"Some of these House races,"
- they're still too close to call.
- What does that mean?
"Well, presently, we cannot predict the result of the vote in Congress on January 20."
- We're in a kind of purgatory.
- Welcome to my world.
- Can you stop thinking about yourself for one second?
- Honestly.
"No, because I'm going to prison."
Have I mentioned that?
You are unbelievable.
- That could be taken a couple of ways.
- Get out.
"Well, no ambiguity there."
Don't forget your brother's CD.
My eye!
"Man, I love sunsets."
The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.
"It's the pollution that makes those pretty colors, you know."
What you're enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison.
"No, that's not what I'm really enjoying."
"Boy, I hope that's guacamole."

Can't we just go home?
If I gotta drag you to the doctor at 8 in the morning...
... youcancoolyourjets  while I get coffee.
I must look like an idiot.
Wish I could tell you different.
You're the reason we went to the eye doctor in the first place.
"You said, ""Throw me a piece of toast. """
I threw you a piece of toast.
"Two cups of regular coffee, please."
-My treat.
"-Oh, that makes up for everything."
"Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket, but I get a free cup of coffee."
Just the coffee.
Keep the change.
I'm gonna need your help until I get this patch off.
I am absolutely there for you.
He fell off a building.
Don't you read the papers?
"Listen, Sheriff, I'm really sorry... to have awoken you from your slumber, but it's over."
Hands are tied now.
You shut me down.
Listen to me.
You're IA.
That's why I came to you.
You can do whatever you want.
"Remember you came to me, said, ""You wanna be a cop?"" I'm bein' a cop."
- I offered you a chance.
- I'm asking you for some help.
I need to do something.
I need to do this for myself.
"Listen, you deaf fuck."
I offered you a chance.
"When we could have done something, I offered you a chance to be a cop... and you blew it!"
You blew it.
You people are all the same.
"That cupcake makes a mess, we got a case again."
The mob runs millions in drugs through their precinct... and everybody gets a nice house.
Figgs is right.
The mob owns this town.
"They closed the case, Freddy."
- If they don't have the stomach for it—
- They had to.
It's circumstantial.
You don't have anything either.
All that stuff is illegal.
You stole it.
I know this guy.
He's a corrections officer.
"I mean, you can go back to college if you want."
You can take classes.
"Writing, photography."
You can travel if you want.
"The point is, we have options."
Why can't you be happy?
I would be happier if we had coffee.
OK.
No.
"We swore for the sake of our sisterhood that we would never, ever ask each other to double date again."
"Oh, come on, Sarah."
We were 19 years old.
"That is ancient history and besides,"
I already told Robert that you would come.
"It's ""Robert"" now."
"I have seen the birthmark on his butt, so we're on a first name basis."
Would you just come on?
Lt'll be fun.
One thing Joe and I are not at the moment is fun.
I'd say we're downright gloomy.
"Well, shake it up."
Get out.
"Yeah, right."
Um...
"Intensive couples counseling didn't work, but a good dinner out, that'll fix everything."
I know you and Joe have been having a hard time.
"If I honestly believed staying home was going to help,"
- I'd drop it.
- There's a problem.
"OK, listen."
Fine.
"But if it's a complete disaster, don't say I didn't tell you."
Good to see you.
All right.
"Let's all get back to work, for chrissake, okay?"
"In my office, man."
Let's see what you bozos been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
- What's this from A.P.D?
- Been checking with them to see if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
"Sure enough, last night."
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me?
Yeah.
"Well, all right."
"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man."
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
"We are hanging out, Badger."
You like Badger or Brandon?
"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
"Badger, listen."
Hey.
"I'm trying to help you here, man."
"Now, if you just tell me who your supplier is I think this can end very well for you."
"What are you doing, detective, talking to my client without me present?"
You sneaky Pete.
Which is which?
"What, did the academy hire you right out of the womb?"
You guys get younger every...
What'd you say to baby face?
He probably left the car to look at something.
We were told by the police commissioner that the car was brought to this garage.
- I demand its immediate return.
- You have to be patient.
We get four or five hundred cars here a day.
Monsieur Devereaux is an important guest ofthis country.
He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation ofyour government.
Here are his credentials from the French consulate.
"Unless you wish to see this in his film, I suggest you locate the car immediately."
"You're in a no-smoking area, sir."
Would you please extinguish your cigarettes?
"What was the weight ofthe car when you got it, Irv?"
4795 pounds.
You sure?
That's what it was.
4795 pounds when it came into the shop.
Owner's manual says 4675.
That's 120 pounds overweight.
And when it was booked into Marseilles it was 4795.
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.
"Listen, I ripped everything outta there except the rocker panels."
"Come on, Irv."
What the hell is that?
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
All right.
"I got it for you, Randy."
Itjust came in from downtown.
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr Devereaux.
Why?
That doesn't sound familiar.
Uh...
Can I help wipe that off?
Please?
I hate Barney Stinson!
WOMAN:
"Me, too!"
OLDER TED:
"Lily finally got to GNB, but the place was deserted."
"Hey, baby."
I thought you came here to quit your job.
I forgot about the hoop.
Yeah.
"I thought if I could just do one thing in that letter,"
"I wouldn't feel like such an old sellout, so I came out here to dunk."
Did it make you feel better?
"I barely grazed the bottom of the net, and now my legs hurt so bad, I can't even fall down."
(LAUGHING) Wow!
How could you?
"Ted, I challenged myself to get laid wearing overalls."
"And if you stand in my way, then you're letting Barney win."
And you don't want that.
That smug son of a bitch will never let us hear the end of it.
"Oh, thank God."
Maggie...
Where do you think you're going?
- To tell that girl I love her.
"- Get in line, bub."
Yeah.
"I'm going to have sex with her, then he's going to tell her he's in love with her, and then you can do whatever you want."
Do we agree on the order?
Mister!
He had a licensed revolver for security.
He had just got in a cab and inspector Varma ascended.
He had a pistol in hand.
"Your honour, Inspector Varma was in muRi."
"And you see, one's identification is not inscribed on his face."
My client took him for a crook.
And he tried to escape.
Then Mr Vijay threatened to shoot him.
To defend himself Mr Balwant fired at him.
It's not true.
It is baseless.
Because Mr Balwant vey well knows me as a police officer.
This is not our first encounter.
On the 16th of October I tried to arrest him at Malighat.
But he managed to escape.
- Wrong again.
"On the 16th of October, Mr Balwant was lying in the hospital and not in Malighat."
He was ill and was bed-ridden.
This medical certificate proves it.
"""Me and you in a locked house"""
"""And the keys not to be found"""
Hello!
"Inspector, he..."
- What times!
A decent man like me... ..can't even walk on the streets!
"- Inspector, the fact is..."
What is the problem?
I was on my way to the beach for a swim.
He whistled at me and passed remarks at me.
- Lies!
I am seriously stressed up myself!
"You see it, don't you?"
"Well, with a diagnosis like mine, the goal is to keep the patient alive long enough for some new miracle drug to appear."
Daddy.
"Yes, my man?"
I want to play with you.
Okay.
"Well, I want to play with you, too."
Let's do it.
Oh.
Dad.
What's happening?
Take me back to the Cube.
The E.R. stopped the bleeding.
He's resting comfortably in his room.
What happened?
"Nose and mouth bleeds are common side effects of chemotherapy, but they can lower his platelet count, so your dad may need a platelet infusion."
That's... all it is?
Mm-hmm.
They'll run some tests to be sure.
"All right, come on."
Show me what you got.
Wait for it.
- There it is.
"- Oh, touchdown!"
- Right on cue.
"- No, no, no, what am I missing?"
"Spike in cerebral blood flow in his precuneus area, also known as ""the God spot."""
It's one of the several areas of the brain linked to spirituality.
"You see, as Jacob listens to music, his right brain is shutting down because he's entering a trance state."
"So, why is this happening to a man who's never been spiritual before?"
"- I don't know, but look at that."
- Mm.
"Oh, wow."
We're going to do a full run of the first act.
I want to check the timing...
"Alex, please..."
"Everyone in place, please."
I know we're tired.
"Believe me, sometimes it's a big plus."
"Okay, no talking backstage."
"Music, please."
Last night at 6 PM the deceased's wife was seen by the fireplace in the cook's arms
"Where, when and who murdered Colonel McHarry?"
"Stop, cut."
"I said, stop."
The timing of your entrance was wrong.
"Your cue is the orchestra, not the lighting."
"The lighting didn't start on time either, Zeltzer."
But that's beside the point.
We'll do the entrance from the beginning of the song.
Music.
"Eli, are you ready?"
Ten to midnight
"A wet, cold night"
Waiting for my friend at the street corner
"My dear Dr. Watson is a partner and friend but, unfortunately, he's always late"
I saw you from onstage.
I had to come get a kiss.
"Do you recognize me with the moustache, Goni?"
"Alex, it looks so funny on your face."
How's it going?
"- Wonderful, knock on wood."
I hope the theater doesn't fold before the general rehearsal.
Where the hell is Alex?
And it's the first time I've ever sung.
Health teacher sick again?
Not a lot of credibility.
I wonder what kind of creepy substitute we'll get today.
Wow.
That is no substitute.
That is the real thing.
"Good afternoon, class."
"I'm Ms. Kelly, and I'll be filling in for Mr. Dubin for the next few days."
"On behalf of the entire class, I'd like to say... stay as long as you like."
"Now, right now, you seem to be covering..."
"CPR, and I'm today's dummy."
"No, actually, we seem to be up to human reproduction, which I hope we can discuss in a mature fashion."
(laughter)
"Oh, stop being so young."
"You know, I'm not as young as they are."
"I've stayed back, like, 50 times."
- Really?
How old are you?
- 24?
Really?
What are you doing in a seventh-grade classroom?
I'm a cop.
Sit down.
"All right, but I'm watching you."
"All right, who can tell us the name of the organ where the eggs are stored?"
Officer?
"Oh, sorry, Ms. Kelly."
I don't have that stuff.
I can name the stuff I have.
Or at least what I call them.
"All right, the name of the place where the eggs are stored."
What are the gonads?
You've done a lot of shopping today.
"These days we're playing tag again... with the tax agents, to avoid any delays."
True.
We have to solve the problem... one way or another.
How much do we owe them?
200 million!
Is that the total?
What's our cash flow?
75 million!
I'll ask Djénéba to write a check.
"It's always better... to pay off debts to the state, so we can make projects... in the best conditions."
Put the money away!
Write a check for 125 million.
I don't have so much money in the bank.
It's not about your bank account.
Is it you who feeds him?
No use complaining.
Do as you're told.
You're unbearable.
I can't take it any longer!
Just leave if you can't take it!
"Sissoko, calm down."
What do you want me to do?
My woman treats me like a nobody.
You don't have to spit on me... every time you get into debt.
Leave me alone!
"If you don't do it, I'll beat you up."
Too much anger... for just one man.
"By God and Sinaté, I forgive you."
I've had enough.
"Here, Sinaté."
"Djénéba, give us five minutes."
... she'sdraggingyouoff  to the Moose Lodge...
... forfolkdancingand bingo.
"You know, I'm damn envious of you, Gallant."
"Finding your soul mate, someone to share your hopes and calm your fears."
-Uh-huh.
"-Hold your hand in the dark night, and--"
Good one.
"Keep saying it to yourself, you might believe it."
"Dr. Gallant, I'd like to offer my services in officiating at your nuptials."
-What?
I'm a Universal Life minister.
-l can marry you and Neela.
"-Jer, they're looking for something legal."
It's completely legal.
I've married lots of people.
"So, what are you?"
"Like, Reverend Jerry?"
"Actually, I go by Father Superior."
So the rumors are true?
Yes. I'd like you to be my bridesmaid.
"Maid of honor, whatever they call it."
"Well, normally I'd say no, because of the taffeta dress..."
... andmatchingpeaudesoie shoes...
... butbecauseyou'vehad  a complete brain lapse... .
"Look, we love each other."
-We wanna be together.
-But today?
"We thought it'd be kind of crazy, something good we can tell our... ."
"Anyway, his tour's over."
"What if he gets stationed in, like, Romania?"
He's hoping to finish his training in stateside Army hospital.
I'm not saying he's not a great guy.
He's working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government.
Here are his credentials from the French consulate.
Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his film...
I suggest you locate the car immediately.
"You're in a no-smoking area, sir."
Will you please extinguish your cigarettes?
"What was the weight of the car when you got it, Irv?"
"4,795 pounds."
You sure?
"That's what it was... 4,795 pounds... when it came into the shop."
"The owner's manual says 4,675."
It's 120 pounds overweight.
"And when it was booked into Marseille, it was 4,795."
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.
"Listen, I ripped everything out of there except the rocker panels."
"Come on, Irv!"
What the hell is that?
Uh-huh.
"Well, shit!"
Son of a bitch.
All right.
[Chuckles]
[Arguing In French]
It isn't the only car we have here.
"Got it for you, Randy."
It just came in from downtown.
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr. Devereaux.
Why?
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux... but we get a lot of cars here at night, and sometimes it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
urgent kinda gets her way
I'll take it.
"- Thanks,darling."
- I'll be right back.
"- Mrs.Collins,Your work is an inspiration."
- yes?
"- Oh,thank you."
- Robert rubia.
- If you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.
Doj new deputy attorney general.
Senator.
"What can I do for you,mr.Rubia?"
Supreme court... with confirmation being 3 days away I was hoping perhaps...
I'm sorry.
What were you hoping?
That you publicly declear your intention To vote with the party for the president's pick.
I'll vote as I see fit.
"I understand that you need to feel independent, be your own man on this one."
This is not a political function.
I'm here for my wife.
I won't take up any more of your time.
"It's good to see you,senator."
What in the holy hell is he thinking about?
"Excuse me,but where's sara?"
She's taking a call.
I just checked.
She's not in the lobby and she wasn't in the ladies' room.
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you please take your seats."
The program is about to begin.
Excuse me.
"...And if you don't have it,maybe janet, Call janet for any numbers.... have you seen a woman,brown hair, light colored dress?"
"Squishy, I can help you."
I read the topic...
"""Describe a personal hero who's changed the course of your life."""
"- Mom, stop."
- Let's brainstorm.
What makes a hero?
Hmm?
Someone who's great at...
"crafting, matchmaking, parming chicken or shrimp or eggplant or meatballs."
"Listen, I did write about someone in the family, but it's a ""he."""
Yay!
It's me!
"I am he, and he is me."
"Bevy, she clearly picked someone else, perhaps a decorated war vet who had a date with two different Shirleys last night."
That's right.
Pops?
!
"You picked the random old guy who just hangs around our house all day, eating our smoked fish?"
Choo-choo!
"Next stop, Lametown."
"Hey, I liberated an entire country."
I helped saved lives.
Oh!
"Oh, sorry, I drifted off to sleep there."
"Okay, this turned ugly fast."
"Now, if you'll excuse me,"
I have a full day of doing nothing ahead of me.
I honestly don't see a world where it's anyone but me.
But thank you for your service.
My mom would stop at nothing to be Erica's hero.
"Meanwhile, me and Big Tasty started our snow day with an epic cartoon marathon."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
I probably wasn't right for you.
Daring?
What are you talking about?
"If a guy showers you with eternal love, suddenly you're suffocating."
"If he doesn't, it's what you want, isn't it?"
"You're so scared of losing, you never invest yourself in anything."
"Well, except your damn work, of course."
I just wanted to...
"Anna, please."
"Just tell him what he means to you,   or you'll spend the rest of your life thinking love hurts."
- But... how do you know?
"- Good night, Anna."
And good luck.
What if Camilla and Johan had already planned their future?
What if she'd love to have babies and he said he'd never leave her?
In my flat!
Frank was right.
I had to conquer my fear of defeat.
I had to risk the pain.
I had to go back into that flat.
"(footsteps on stairs, heavy breathing from bedroom)"
Johan?
"- Johan, I have to talk to you."
- You see any fucking Johan in here?
Anna!
Christ!
What happened?
"Oh, my God, Anna... (air rock music)"
Had I just blown all chances of ever seeing him again?
"Apparently, Johan had left the flat to go to some boat."
Of course!
The boat!
"If there's nothing out there,"
It's gonna be A huge disappointment.
But I'm not gonna give up.
90 miles east of nome...
Shawn pomrenke is trying To strike gold.
At a remote spot of his own.
We made great time.
Like glass out here.
And he's not about To let any previous mishaps.
Hold him back.
I think this hunting for Treasure at the bluff.
Is gonna Finally pay off.
Everybody's always wondering.
Why I get more gold Than everybody else.
It's because I work A hell of a lot harder.
Than they do.
This summer...
I know there's a Pile of gold down there.
Mr. Gold has gambled On the bluff...
Puddles and puddles Of gold.
A coastal trench nearly A 100 miles east of town...
There it is Right there.
Where he's convinced An untapped hot spot.
Could set off The next alaskan gold rush.
"But so far, instead of gold, It's only yielded Frustration..."
Damn it!
I wanted to go.
Here we are.
Another day.
And he's feeling The heat from dad.
"A couple hundred thousand bucks In the bluff,"
And we ain't got no gold Out of it yet.
"What's wrong, you're not getting in?"
Looks like I have to go in his car.
"Don't eat bread Mi Jin, or you may trigger your allergies!"
Please eat your meals when you are at Sunshine Welfare!
Sunshine Welfare?
Why are you telling her to not eat that?
She is allergic to flour.
"If she eats foods containing flour, she'll have reactions."
This time the infection got into her trachea which is making her show signs of asthma.
It is extremely dangerous.
"Because she's on welfare, she doesn't have to worry about the hospital fees."
Welfare?
They're not on it.
"I don't have a lot of time, so let's hurry."
They're not on welfare.
I think the nurse was misinformed.
Do you know those children?
They live in the basement of my apartment building.
"It's them, please stop the car."
What's wrong?
"Hey, you were told to not eat food having flour."
Why are you still eating that?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Chase after them!
Why do I have to chase them?
Hurry!
Didn't you both hear that she can't eat bread?
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?
Go.
Are you all right?
- What is it?
Sit down.
"Emily, I've been cheating."
Cheating?
Eating cheating?
"You know today, when you called the office, and Carol said I couldn't talk?"
- Yeah?
"- Well, I couldn't talk... because my mouth was full of chocolate-covered peanut brittle."
"Oh, Bob!"
"Emily, Let me finish."
The peanut brittle was just the dessert.
The appetizer was a liverwurst and Swiss cheese sandwich.
"- Oh, Bob."
How could you?
"- Emily, I'm still not finished."
Then I went down to the snack bar... and I snacked on almost every bar they had.
"Do you mean while I was stuffing radishes, you were stuffing your face?"
"Well, Emily."
I don't know what came over me.
"I just-The minute I walked in there, I wanted to attack anything edible."
I felt like...
Bela Lugosi in a room full of necks.
"Emily, hunger is a terrible thing, and I gave in to it."
And You know what's worse than all of that put together?
- What?
- I'm still hungry.
"Well, Bob, what do you want me to say?"
"I mean, eat whatever you want, stuff yourself like a pig?"
Start your diet next week or tomorrow or never?
"Well, It is my birthday."
Fine.
Why don't you eat your gifts?
Police.
- So we have to find these '63s?
- We need to find who took them.
I need you to watch them.
"You know,they're not so bad."
"Lucy,get down!"
Welcome to Alcatraz...
Dr.Sengupta.
"Thank you,Warden James."
*********
"I don't know,Hauser.Maybe the pirate life ain't for you."
"All right,tie it off!"
Now look alive.
Mr.Petty...
You arrive to us with much fanfare.
I can assure you most lags don't get the benefit of a welcoming party.
"But then you are a special case,aren't you?"
A smile.
"On a child's face,it reminds us of all that's good and pure in this world."
"But on yours,it's all the company of hades."
"If you've left any more of your mines on the mainland,son, it will be our singular aim to find out just where they are before anyone else is blown to kingdom come."
Take him.
Felicitations to the good men and women of the San Francisco police department.
Does the lady need a ride back to the mainland?
"No,the lady does not.But nice thought.Thank you."
Peppermint.
For your nausea.
Officer...
Hauser.Emerson Hauser.
"She has good taste in music,Mr.Hauser."
Any improvement?
I'm sorry.
"£ I'll lay my head down low, oh"
£ And I'll lay my head down low
"£ Lay my head down low, oh. £"
Let's go out the rear entrance.
Shirou!
Saber?
I'm surprised to see Saber with you.
You...
Archer!
What's with you finally showing up now?
530)}#09 The Distance Between Them
Isn't it obvious?
I sensed a threat to my Master and rushed to her side.
But it appears I was too late.
it's all over!
I'll fill you in on everything that happened so you just stand there and listen!
Looks like I arrived at the worst possible time.
You can say that again!
and now you decide to show up?
all right.
I'll rush to your side at once.
which Servant was eliminated?
It was the Rider-class Servant that disappeared.
but she was probably taken out by Caster.
The coward.
Then she really was all talk.
Rider died protecting her Master.
You are in no position to call her a coward.
A coward is a coward.
One who calls herself a hero should at least try to take her opponent out with her.
That she was defeated without resistance suggests she was unable to do so.
Thank you.
Don't worry.
"When I first started, I could barely hook up an I.V."
It's all muscle memory.
"You'll get it, Inez, I know you will."
I felt like an idiot.
I didn't even know what a T-pod was.
Everybody needs help with stuff.
"When you do, come find me."
Thanks.
Page me when he's out of surgery.
Will do.
- Hello.
You're back.
- Had a cancellation.
He's this way.
"I tried calling Lee's cell, but he wasn't answering."
- Is everything okay?
"- Yeah, he's doing great."
We're just waiting for them to take him up to the cath lab.
"Ooh, that sounds ominous."
"They're going to do an angioplasty, which is a procedure where we insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, thread it up to his coronary artery, which is used to inflate a balloon that will open up the blockage."
Guess those cheese steaks caught up with me.
I've been telling him to eat better for years.
"Hey, you!"
"This is my... wife, Viv."
Hi.
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
- I've been treating your husband.
- Hi.
Everything's okay.
"I've got a little blockage, but they're gonna fix it."
"Oh, what a clever thing to say."
How brainy you are.
Got a degree?
"Just cos you earn four times as much as a nurse, you think you can cheek Richie Rich, do you?"
"Now, that's what I like to see."
"A good, old-fashioned bobby."
"Don't worry, Richie."
"These days, prison food is quite acceptable."
"Mind you, it's not so nice when they nail you to the table and shove it up your backside."
"Well, Eddie, the long and winding road is over."
"The great god, public, claims another weary showbiz victim."
Huh.
"Oscar Wilde, playwright, arrested for his beliefs."
"Lenny Bruce, comedian, arrested for his beliefs."
"Richie Rich, celebrity, arrested..."
For going nicking down the local shop.
Huh!
Lt'll be the trial of the century.
I shall be tried in majestic splendour by a jury of my peers.
"Parky, Tarby, Lynchy, Sue Lawley."
- Annie Diamondy.
- Debbie Greenwoody.
"Selina Scotty, Maggie Philbiny."
"Bloody hell, what a fantastic jury."
We might be on for a sex sesh after the trial.
"Too right except you won't be there, cos you'll be in pris."
I'll be all right.
I'm gonna plead insanity.
Damn.
Let's face it.
You've got the evidence.
Let me out!
We like it here.
We have family and community.
And you've just come here with your new novel and turned them against yourself with your arrogance and ego.
You are to blame nobody but yourself for these things.
I don't know how to process that.
I'm not sure how quickly I can absolve you of wrongdoing and shoulder the blame myself.
I'd like to go elsewhere and talk.
Speak with you more.
"Just not standing here, outside."
Okay.
Just not back in there.
Hello.
I've thought it best for my students not to ever see me out of class.
So what do you do at night?
I stay home.
I read and I think.
It will make my life harder if people see me differently.
Does that make sense?
But you want only to be thought of as a talented writer and not as a real person?
"Hmm, yeah."
Yeah.
That's probably about right.
"In fact, that's exactly right."
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)
Thank you.
All right.
Be a good boy.
"Give me a call, okay?"
Yeah.
I never had a weekend on campus where I went to school.
I can't really quite adjust.
Last night your uncle and then me...
Everyone has his own reasons for avoiding the authorites in their home.
"They have a very good reason, they've heroin there."
I sure wouldn't like to be in their shoes right now.
I wouldn't like it either.
What are we gonna do?
"Just leave him there, we're going to Berlin baby, aren't we?"
Sure.
We should have a wake.
There's no food.
So I go to the store and get some food.
These are no protection for aliens.
Oh!
And do you have protection for aliens?
You have a laser down in your pants?
I think I need another drink.
"Wake up, honey..."
Come on get up and take a shower.
"I feel sick, Kathy."
I know you feel sick.
You took drugs today.
No...
Come on and stand up It'll make you feel better.
Guests are already starting to arrive.
Can't miss the party.
Fuck the guests.
"You are brave, noble knight."
Why don't you go overthere and freed those two beauties from the dragon?
It's exactly what I'm gonna do.
You're going...over to the appartment?
"No the little one just went out, I want to try to warn her."
Are you serious?
Yes.
What's next?
"Then, I struggled..."
I removed the bag and saw him pointing at me with a gun.
What do you want?
You sex maniac!
What do you want?
You seduced my wife and you wanted to accuse first?
Don't kill me...
"None of my business, I don't know how to shoot!"
"That's right, it means, someone killed Ho Chun in the dark."
"Then, Ho Foon became the scapegoat."
"The key point is, did you have any secret affair with Chun's wife?"
"Master, I haven't seen his wife at all."
How could I have secret affair with her?
Ho Chun lied.
But why was he killed?
"It's alright, the key point is... your ass."
What is this triangular mark?
A birthmark.
Birthmark?
See!
Some acnes are found.
"Not serious, Madam."
You've dropped something!
It's a domino!
Can you explain it to me?
"Master, this is a kind of custom in the prison."
"In this prison, the new comers should serve the Indians and the foreigners."
That is to store gambling tools inside the anus.
"Master, would you help me to stuff back?"
"Since you have to stuff it,"
"I've brought you a chicken leg, better store it too."
"- Yes, I have."
"In fact, I may have forgotten everything I've ever known."
"- Child, what be your name?"
- Study.
Just explain the concept one more time.
And be mocked again?
"No, thank you."
- Come on.
- Maybe we're missing something.
You go to a special shooting range.
- A skeet shooting range.
- Right.
"There's two of you, and the guy with the gun yells, 'Pull. '"
The other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air... and you try to shoot it.
"- No, I don't think we're missing anything."
- I knew it.
- You shoot pigeons?
- Clay pigeons.
"- When you hit them, does blood come out?"
- They're clay.
And why do you like to do this?
"My dad shot skeet when he was my age, and he wants to pass the tradition down."
What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?
- Does that count?
- That's never happened.
What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon?
Does that count?
I've only done this once.
"If you get really good... do you move on to other animals, like clay chickens and clay sheep?"
We didn't go skeet shooting.
I made it all up.
I got to go in here.
"I'll be honest with you, I did not like him."
Is something wrong with chubby and nerdy?
- I like chubby and nerdy.
- No.
That has nothing to do with it.
I was on scholars' bowl in 8th grade.
[ Laughter ] Wood:
Things were looking up.
"If these girls liked nerdy, I was in business."
This is where I'm a little bit of a Honda nerd.
"You notice, you guys, the floor back there is flat?"
It is flat.
"That was a big design point, 'cause normally, cars have the little hump."
"Yeah, there's no hump so when you're riding bitch, you're not really riding bitch."
"Oh, my gosh."
I actually never noticed that.
"So, Clark, this is your truck?"
"Yeah, this is my truck."
How did you arrive at buying a truck like this?
"I mean, I like it."
It's a Hemi.
What's a Hemi?
Hemi is the top of the...
It's a hemispherical.
The top of the valve is...
It's not flat.
"Wait, show me that again?"
The top of the...
[ Laughter ]
Let me just point out why chunky guys are great for hot girls...
"We'll always appreciate you, not like skinny dudes."
It's true.
"Maybe the wrong one, but..."
-I'll never forgive myself.
-You blame yourself too much.
You did what you morally had to do.
Here.
"-Charlie, can I speak with you?"
-Surely.
The court will come to order.
"Remain seated, please!"
Has the prosecution completed its questioning of Mrs. MacKenzie?
Yes.
The prosecution rests.
No more questions.
You may step down.
We call Dr. Matthew Swain to the stand as a witness for the defense.
Raise your right hand.
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-I do.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Dr.
Matthew Swain.
"Dr. Swain, do you know of any act of force or violence... which Lucas Cross perpetrated against the defendant?"
I certainly do.
We've spent too much time torturing a girl who's emotionally unable... to speak for herself.
"Lucas Cross was a drunken, and a wife beater... and a child abuser!"
"I object! ""Child abuser"" is an exaggerated and inflammatory word."
"When I say ""child abuser"", I mean it in the worst way possible!"
"I object, your Honor."
The deceased is not on trial.
Lucas Cross' character as to force and violence is on trial here.
"You may continue, Dr. Swain."
The fracture wasn't consistent with a flat surface like the hull of a boat.
It looked more like a hammer blow.
Right.
Look at the original PM.
The distribution list at the end.
Routine distribution to senior officers at the time.
Routine except for one name.
Chief Superintendent Fairbank had nothing to do with this case.
He ran Vice.
Also copied in on the missing persons report.
What do we know about Chief Superintendent Fairbank?
This.
Councillor Dale Roach with guess who?
Chief Superintendent Fairbank.
Roach and Fairbank.
Roach and Fairbank.
Chief Superintendent Fairbank retired in 2008.
"Oh, yeah."
Pat ran vice for donkey's years.
"If Oliver Stephens-Lloyd did submit a list of abusers at Sands View, almost certainly it would have gone to Vice."
Almost certainly.
Which makes the fact he was copied in on Stephens-Lloyd's missing persons and postmortem reports all the more suspicious.
"Sir, former Chief Superintendent Fairbank still lives in the area."
"Well, let's see what he's got to say for himself."
"Good work, you two."
Good work.
- Sir.
- Sir.
"Come in, please."
"Very grateful for your time, sir."
"Oh, anything I can do to help."
"And I'm retired now, there's no need for the sir."
Please let me play till that match.
If it's tennis you can still play in high school.
"No matter what, I want the team members to go to the Nationals together."
Swing the racket for me to see.
Your Zero-Shiki Drop Shot.
(Zero Degree Drop Shot)
Stop.
Being your therapist I can tell you that this is your limit point.
That move of yours will add on to your injuries.
You must not use the Zero-shiki Drop Shot under any circumstances.
Alright?
Hi.
What's the matter?
Have your injury recovered?
All thanks to you.
Recover well.
Competition is one week away.
Up or down?
Up.
- Up.
- I will serve first then.
Let's have a proper match.
"As the captain, you'll lose face if you don't win."
Give me all you've got.
You sure?
"Echizen, you're strong but if you don't get better, we will not win in the Nationals."
Give me your best shot.
I won't go easy so give me all you've got.
"Give me all you've got and improve yourself, Echizen."
Why did you transfer schools?
Didn't it cross your mind that the Nationals are filled with the best players.
- Even stronger than yourself?
I have even pleaded.
Now I shall use my hands.
Ouch!
"Hey you, now when your boss is getting beaten.."
..you are planning to escape?
"Hey, Iet me go."
"I swear on God, brother you have shown such a nice.."
"..programme, wont you tell me your name?"
Krishna.
I think you are new in Mumbai.
"And you still havent got a place to stay, right?"
You also look hungry.
This means that you are a decent man.
"Brother, all this comes Iaterfirst tell me.."
..what are yourfuture plans?
I mean where will you go?
-Wherever my legs leads me to.
Thats good too.
"Then brother, tell your legs to follow me."
My mansion isjust around the corner.
"No, I dont want to be a burden on anyone."
And when my family threw me out of the house..
..I dont share any relationship with you.
Why dont we share a relationship?
We do have a relationship.
"Look you are poor, I am poor."
"And I swear on God, brother the relation.."
..a poor shares with another poor..
..is greaterthan a brother-brother and father-son relationship.
And the truth is I swear on God..
..you have made a place in my heart.
Come.
"Yeah, and we've got a cab driver out there preying on young women."
He pinned me up against that wall.
And if it hadn't been for that car horn...
"If we ever find the driver, you can thank him."
Why don't we get the SOCO's down here?
He might have dropped something.
I heard that blood expert from work died.
Is it the same bloke?
Could be.
You said you lost your keys?
Do you think they were in your bag?
"Yeah, definitely."
I was all fingers and thumbs.
"Oh, god, do you think he's got them?"
You might want to stay somewhere else tonight.
Call a friend.
Just until you've had the locks changed.
OK.
I don't really know who though.
I've only been in London a few weeks.
OK.
We'll sort something.
Both girls are employed at the forensic services lab
They both get into minicabs from work.
"If it isn't the same bloke, it's one hell of a coincidence."
There is no evidence that Kelly was sexually attacked.
But Kelly fought back.
"She got him riled, he lost control and killed her?"
It's possible.
"Yes, Casey."
"Yeah, I'll be down in two secs."
OK.
"I was gonna say, they seem like..."
Albany girls.
"Uh, so, anyway, we just wanted to drop by... and find out if you've seen this guy."
"Well, I'll let you know."
"Although, with Jerry, he could be shacked up anywhere."
"He's a bookie, for Christ's sake."
It was nothing.
Nothing.
"The word ""lotto"" never even came up."
"- See, Mr. Crazy Man?"
- Thank God!
- They were checking on Jerry.
- They asked about Jerry?
"- Yeah, yeah."
It was just routine.
- Not routine.
It's called a murder investigation.
"No, trust me."
Dale took care of every thing.
They'll find a cure for cancer before they find Jerry.
[MaleAnnouncer] Live from Harrisburg and News Center Six.
"Covering Harrisburg, New York, Lancaster and Lebanon, it's News at Five with Dan Shuff, Heidi Zimmer... and Russ Richards with the weather."
This is News at Five.
Our top story tonight:
The body of a local bookmaker was found floating in the river today.
Police say it was foul play and are following leads.
More on that story in a moment.
"First, let's check in with the weather center... to see if we can expect more of these spring-like temperatures."
Russ?
Russ?
"Oh, yeah?"
- How about these temperatures?
- Thank you all for participating.
- Not a spectator event.
Came early to get in some laps and accidentally discovered this circus.
It's a traditional scholarship program with a charity component.
Yeah.
So... (CLEARS THROAT)
Ever track down your missing boyfriend?
Brooke!
Are you joining us?
"Look, maybe I was unclear."
Go away.
"I'll take that as a ""no."""
"The way he looked at me, I wanted to cry, but I also got really angry."
"That's probably natural, right?"
That's a lot of history there.
I don't know.
"I think when Audrey went all doom and gloom on me this morning, she really got into my head."
I think something is up with her.
It's also Audrey.
It's hard to tell.
- You think your dad will stick around?
- ‭I have no idea.
He doesn't exactly have the most reliable track record.
My dad left us when I was little.
"If he showed up now, I'd probably punch him in the teeth."
"Hey, Fight Club, not cool."
- You were listening to all that?
"- No, no."
Eli and his dad have a complicated relationship.
And Eli's crazy.
I get it.
I definitely wanted to hit my dad when he left.
We are so overdue for this.
Ah.
"Sun, sand, warm, blue water..."
It's not as warm as you'd think this time of year.
Tony!
I thought I was gonna be stuck all by my lonesome when they announced
"Dad's flight took off late, when what should appear but a Thanksgiving miracle!"
"Agent DiNozzo, I presume?"
The elusive Jake.
It's nice to know Bishop hasn't been catfishing us all year-- I was starting to wonder.
"Well, you can stop wondering, Tony."
"As you can see, Jake is quite real."
Unless he's a hologram that can shake hands.
NSA's actually working on one of those-
- I've seen the prototype.
"Yeah, that'd be pretty fun."
Really?
No.
Ah.
Aha.
Had me for a second.
That's too bad-- 'cause I'd like one of those.
I like him.
He's quick.
"Hey, speaking of quick, how'd you get all the way up here?"
Arrival pickups never get past Customs.
"It's all about the badge, Bish-- you got to know how to flash it."
Oh.
"Oh, my."
The classic Smelly Guy.
Yet another vivid hue in the broad spectrum of airport humanity.
Did he come straight from the gym?
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.
"Make sure your ""Open, please come in"" signs are out."
You all know what to do.
"All right, nobody panics."
Here we go!
"Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere."
"- Minny, I know exactly where we are."
"- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere."
"- Honey, please."
- Hello.
"Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley."
Legendary for its service and hospitality.
How can we help you?
"- We don't need anything, thank you."
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.
He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee.
"We were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we..."
- OK.
Really.
"We're just peachy, OK?"
"- What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel."
"No, it doesn't agree with my tank."
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
"- Good to see you, soldier!"
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for your government surplus needs.
"- Honey, surplus!"
- We have too much surplus.
I do have a map over at the Cozy Cone Motel.
"And if you stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast."
Friends?
Ha!
- You are fatally sweet.
- Hm.
I wonder if George will be there.
She has the most alarming way of turning up everywhere I go.
I'm beginning to find it unnerving.
She has a desperate purpose.
What do you mean?
A while ago she was out drinking and gambling... she leads a rough life... and she boasted that...
Let's not talk about it.
I fear I am about to commit a tremendous faux pas.
"Socially she is too bizarre, but somehow I find her very compelling."
I wonder if she is different when alone.
She boasted that you are to be her next lover.
Alfred was there.
He's still the love of her life.
He put money on it you wouldn't be seduced.
"Yes, they made you the object of a bet."
"Well, you know she's eternally in need of money."
Here we are.
You have the most priceless expression on your face.
There's Mallefille.
We can be sure George is here.
He's still following her like a tail.
"Darling, it's so good to see you."
- I didn't know you'd be here.
- I didn't either.
(CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)
Chopin hates my paintings.
No.
"Dear friend, I am just a musician."
You are bankrupt.
We're living in misery and he dishonours us.
You even sold your gold teeth.
People are laughing at us.
We were taken to the police.
"People make fun of us on the streets, in the mosques..."
"I'd give you another son right now, but it takes a real man."
I gave you a son and a daughter.
Your son didn't turn out to be a man.
"Stop this nonsense, Kezban."
God damn you...
You faggot.
He took after you.
What have you got here?
You're weak and mute.
"God, damn you!"
You have no pride.
"You have no dignity, no honour."
Look at your honour...
It's being trampled on.
You're an absolute disgrace.
It's my conscience that stops me.
Do you think I am not sad?
Traditions matter more than our conscience.
"Go ahead, hide in the barn, cover your head."
I told you when he was a little boy to get rid of the Zenne then.
You paid no heed.
God forgive us for what we've done or are about to do.
I can not act until I have concrete proof.
"We believe in the same God, Kezban."
He will whisper to me.
I wish you'd stay.
We'll get anything you need.
-So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
"-No, within the compound will be fine."
-We were going to New England.
-That's off.
-Am I a prisoner?
"-That's not how we see it, Kay."
"Come on, kids."
We're going back to the house.
Joe.
"Cuba, Cuba!"
Most respected gentlemen.
Welcome to Havana.
I want to thank this distinguished group of American industrialists for continuing to work with Cuba for the greatest period of prosperity in her entire history.
"Mr. William Shaw, representing the General Fruit Company."
"Messrs. Corngold and Dant, of United Telephone and Telegraph Company."
"Mr. Petty,"

Mr. Robert Allen of South American Sugar.
"Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada, representing our associates in tourism and leisure activities."
"And my old friend and associate from Florida,"
Mr. Hyman Roth.
I would like to thank United Telephone and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.
A solid gold telephone.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to look at it.
-Mr.
President?
-Yes?
Could you discuss the rebel activity and what this can mean to our businesses?
-Of course.
-Heavy stuff.
"I assure you that, although the rebels have started a campaign in Las Villas,"
I didn't get your name.
Shawna.
Hi.
- And you are...?
- Therapist.
From Cardiology.
Really?
Your husband has to undergo an angioplasty.
"That's where we're going to insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, and we're gonna use it to inflate a balloon that will open the blockage."
"Well, good luck, Mr. Rappaport."
I have to get back to my other patients.
It was nice to meet you.
Excuse me for just one second.
Whoa.
That was close.
Thanks.
I-I really owe you one.
"Hey, listen, if you ever need a sex therapist..."
I think I'm good.
"Now that you mention it, do you ever do any pro bono work?"
"Yes, I spoke to your resident, and he thought a hold was unnecessary, but I disagree, and all I'm asking is for a second assessment from another attending."
Watch it!
"No, Dr. Wakita, not you."
"Hey, Jerry, where have you been?"
I was getting worried about you.
Everyone was acting as if I'd sent you out in a hurricane.
Are you okay?
What the hell happened to King Funshine?
Did you get hit by lightning again?
He didn't get hit by lightning.
Here's your change.
Okay.
"- He already has, and he will gladly continue."
Get out of my house.
My house too.
No.
It was never your house.
You just lived here.
"You know, I'd like to hope that in a few months' time, we'll both have some perspective on this and be able to move somewhere, like forward."
This feels irreparable.
You accusing me of indifference?
You don't seem to be struggling.
I am.
Just not in the ways that you notice.
You need a haircut.
I know.
(DOOR CLOSES)
I'm pretty sure I'm missing a brush.
I'll bet one of those models yoinked it.
You got any plans tonight?
"Just gonna stay in, or are you going out?"
We were together for almost three years.
Do you want to come over?
We were just gonna make dinner at home.
You should come.
"No, thanks."
I don't want to be a burden.
You're not being a burden.
I couldn't tell him anything without him getting depressed and jealous.
Now he's gone.
He owes me a lot of money.
"You know, when he was writing and had no income."
Thousands of dollars.
I don't mean to bring you into it.
I don't know what you're doing.
"Whatever it is, I don't want to talk about it."
"For a little magazine, we have very good sources."
You want to know why?
I am relentless and driven.
I make it easier for them to tell than to resist me.
I know about the grand jury.
I know about Rick's indictment.
lndictment?
He hasn't even appeared.
- That's just what I hear.
- From who?
And you're going to print this?
I thought I should let you know.
"You're going to print an article that says Rick is going to be indicted when you haven't interviewed him, and you are not naming any sources?"
I can't.
The testimony's sealed.
You are not going to print this.
Because it's a lie.
- You know it's a lie?
- lt's a lie.
- How?
- How do you think?
He told me.
"He has done nothing wrong, and I will not be party to anything that might hurt him, not to mention protecting you in a libel suit."
Whoa.
Lily.
Ferocious in defense of her man.
I'm serious.
- And what if you're wrong about him?
- l'm not.
I'm just not.
"Hey, I need your help."
We need to go over to the medical center.
Is everyone in there?
Yeah.
We're just waiting for you.
How is it going out there?
They took Talbot's farm.
How many men?
I'd say 60... 70.
That's probably just an advance team.
I would imagine they got more than that up the road in reserve.
Constantino has us outnumbered and outgunned.
"If we split our force, and try to defend each one of these farms, he's going to overwhelm us."
So what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't split up.
"We choose a place to stand together, deliver a good, hard counterpunch."
"Let them know that, if they intend to take from us, it's going to cost them dearly."
How?
"Well, right here."
Stanley Richmond's farm.
"It's the last place before this road divides, and they start taking ground faster than we can keep up."
Plus which it's the highest point in the whole area.
There's where we make our stand.
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.
The Talbot farm is secured.
Let's go get the rest of them.
Let's go!
This one's alive.

"Grandpa, you're drunk."
"No, it's fine."
"Saul, this is my daughter Rebecca."
- Saul and I work together at Ojai.
- Oh.
"Yeah, it's so nice to meet you, Rebecca."
Your mother never said that you were so lovely.
"I guess Mom doesn't talk about me much, because I doubt she'd use the word ""lovely""."
"Becca, that was a compliment."
Say thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Is there any cereal left?
"- Uh, yeah."
Try the top shelf.
"Well, I didn't realize it was getting to be so late."
"It's very nice to meet you, Rebecca."
- Bye.
- Bye.
We'll talk more at the office.
Sorry about interrupting the mid-morning booty call.
Maybe you should put a sock on the door.
Saul was just helping me with the coffee machine.
Is that what the senior set is calling it these days?
"Yes, we are seeing each other, if that's what you mean."
At least that embarrassing little run-in clarified some things.
"The sudden windfall, the winery, the Maserati, the expensive housewares."
No.
Saul has nothing to do with any of that.
- Right.
"- Rebecca, I told you the truth."
A close friend died and left me some money.
"This is a good thing, Becca."
Police have arrested a man and charged him with the murders of five women in London.
"Gerald Wiggins, a railway ticket inspector, was apprehended at his home yesterday"
Inspector Lawley of Scotland Yard said that Wiggins appears to be mentally frail
Police believe they have found evidence linking him to all five murdered women.
The petrol and fuel oil shortages at home maybe worsening...
"That's it, isn't it?"
He's gone.
"Lucy, I'm so sorry."
It's not your fault.
Did he take anyone from the train?
Not that we know of.
No -one's been reported missing.
- The police must have scared him off.
- That's something.
That's a lot.
- That's a life you saved.
"- I know, but he's still out there."
We still don't know who he is.
"I do know who he is, actually."
(Clears her throat) He's Malcolm Crowley.
- You got a name from Cavendish?
- Who's Cavendish?
He headed up a classified department during the war.
He trained Crowley.
Jean found him.
So we have a name and whatever else is in there.
Bloody hell.
- How's your friend?
- Recovering.
- What happened to her?
- Harry beat her.
It's not the first time.
-Indiana...
"Yes, the museum will buy them, as usual, no questions asked."
"Yes, they are nice."
They're worth at least the price of a ticket to Marrakech.
"But the people I brought are important, and they're waiting."
What people?
Army Intelligence.
They knew you were coming before I did.
Seem to know everything.
They wouldn't tell me what they want.
"Well, what do I want to see them for?"
"What am I, in trouble?"
"Yes, Dr. Jones, we've heard a great deal about you."
Have you?
"Uh, professor of archaeology, expert on the occult, and, uh, how does one say it?"
Obtainer of rare antiquities.
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.
"-Oh, thank you."
-Thank you.
"Yes, you're a man of many talents."
"Now, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago."
"Yes, I did."
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
"Uh... well, just rumors, really."
"Somewhere in Asia, I think."
I haven't really spoken to him for ten years.
"We were friends, but, uh... had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid."
Mmm.
"Dr. Jones, now, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential, eh?"
I understand.
- Does Vicki know about this?
- No.
And I don't want her to know.
I've been targeted and that puts everyone who's close to me in danger.
"Oh, gee..."
Thanks for bringing me into this.
"Okay, if only one of you can work this town, how do I know I'm not going to like this other vampire more than you?"
"Because I'm the devil you know, detective."
"Yes, you are."
Okay.
Two conditions.
"One, we find this thing, we put it down."
I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What's the second?
- Full disclosure.
"I ask you something, you answer."
"I want to know what color your underwear is, you tell me."
You got it?
Red.
"Silk, actually."
"I'm not actually asking, Fitzroy."
When do we start?
As soon as somebody phones the police about a dead body.
Got a quarter?
I feel so bad for that Evan guy.
He blames himself for Gene's death.
Does he have reason to?
Typical Friday night.
Go train in from the burbs.
Burger and a movie after the Underground.
They must have up to something.
"Come on, you don't go out for a burger and wind up as the main course at an insect buffet."
"Xiamu, since we were young until now, have I not been with you?"
"When you graduated, when you entered the university, also... when you get married, I'll be with you giving my blessings!"
"You will do the same to me, won't you?"
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you for the attendance!
Thanks a lot!
Good!
Continue!
"Qu Weiran, the love child is finally legitimated!"
Love child?
"People from Haide Industry said, his father had an older son with his wife."
"The older son likes to exploration, and got himself killed in a snow mountain two years ago."
So Qu Weiran was naturally promoted to be a project manager.
Qu is such a lucky guy!
"Yes, he is."
"However, the point is..."
"Qu Weiran with his Bentley, is less adorable than our Zhang Jingwu with his broken car!"
- My car is fine!
- Pervert!
It was just a kiss!
Why did you scold me?
Don't you take it personally too quickly?
- I was referring to Qu Weiran.
- Oh...
He is a pervert!
Did you know?
He messed with and occupied woman before.
"So the woman's boyfriend went to his house, beat him up and broke few ribs of him!"
- Good!
- Really!
Don't worry!
"Well, you tell me when is the right time?"
"Sharon, don't forget you owe me."
"If you need me to remind you, why, I will."
"Thank you, Sharon."
You won't regret this.
ILLEGAL FIREARMS TRACED TO SMUGGLING NETWORK
Good morning.
Okay.
"Good morning, everyone."
Let's get started.
- Shouldn't we wait for Anna?
"I got my ass up out of bed on time, now I gotta wait?"
"Well, while we're waiting, I just wanna put this out there to everyone that if we keep an open mind, there's no reason why we can't go home today."
"Excuse me, before we actually start, can I make a quick announcement?"
It's a query.
I am missing a very nice pen.
A Montblanc.
Has anyone seen it?
Is that directed at me?
- No.
Have you seen it?
No.
"- Okay, if anyone does see it,"
I would very much like it back.
It was a gift from my wife on our anniversary.
"Aw, that's so sweet."
We're deliberating a murder case and you're talking about a pen.
"This pen happens to be worth more than you make in a month, so you can go fuck yourself."
"Yeah, I'll do that."
- Charles.
He's...
Anna.
I'll get rid of all the weaklings who have spent the last 66 years relying on other countries and other people to take care of things.
Given your outstanding ability to gather information I'm sure you can make any idea a reality.
just say the magic word.
Hey.
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ok.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling,"
I could maybe do with a teenth.
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Gee, I don't know."
How about over there?
That brown van.
"- That's yours, right?"
- What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
Another one right over there.
"""Duke City Flowers""?"
Come on!
Can't you at least be original?
"Dude, I just want to get high."
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
Seriously.
"And I don't mean to disrespect, but if you put a bunch of cops in the back of a garbage truck, there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
"Doc, I have something to tell..."
Doctor.
Are you alright?
I suck.
I've been treating that man's nephew for so long.
But he hasn't gotten better.
"In the end, I made the wrong diagnosis."
"Talk about bad luck, having me as your doctor."
Maybe you should've gotten better sooner too.
"No one wants to waste time seeing a doctor, right?"
I am sorry.
I....
"I know I am not that good, but I try."
I'm trying my best.
Shit think of something to say to make her feel better.
What should I say?
And what the hell is wrong with me?
"Standing, eating this junk food with nitrates."
As a kid I ate so much of this I went to the hospital.
"But if eating it makes you feel better, then it's okay."
It's not standard medical practice but..
the better you feel the faster you heal.
"Shit, it rhymes."
Sounds sweet like a poem.
Am I seeing a doctor?
Actually I just realized that being a doctor is tough.
You have to say things that make patients feel better.
I feel I've been a bad patient all this time.
Feeling better?
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
You aren't busy today?
- Are you bullshittin' me?
[Grunts] That car's dirty.
Take it in and tear it apart.
[Jimmy] Tear it right out.
Tear it out!
"Nothing here, Jimmy."
Look in here.
[Coughing]
This is all solid.
[Loud Hissing]
[Tire Bouncing]
[Whirring]
There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
"I don't buy that, Irv."
The stuff is in that car.
"Well, you find it."
I can't.
[Indistinct]
[Speaking French]
"Look, the car was lost some time last night."
"First, they send us to Pier 1, then they send us here."
Then what?
I don't understand why you parked the car down by the waterfront.
You tell me you're staying at the Doral in midtown Manhattan... and you lose the car out by the Brooklyn Bridge?
"Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television."
He probably left the car to look at some point of interest.
We were told by the police commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage.
I demand its immediate return.
"You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux."
"We get 400, 500 cars here a day."
Monsieur Devereaux is a very important guest of this country.
I am still in Tangak_
He is not late.
Put it down!
What did they do to you?
I had to bring it so I did.
- A man must honor his promises.
- Well done!
"Well done, what?"
A man must honor his promises;
"I said ""well done"" for it!"
- So?
- So what?
- A man must stay to his promises!
"- I did promise nothing, did I?"
"Bashirou, why did you put the cradle here"
"Bashirou, what happened to you?"
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
I like you;
I liked your father too.
"- If I would say something to you, it's because of"
- I understand!
"It's because you don't want me out of money, you want me to take re of my family."
"But Mr. Zaer Kheder, I said something else to you before going to Tangak."
"Yes, you said!"
But I can't burden ketfledrum to you.
To whom I should say not to play and let this little boy play kettledrum?
"Whoever you see, was waiting from last year's Moharram to this year's to play kettledrum, cymbal, and horn and morning Alam Iifling"
Everybody has his own vows.
All of them have their own intentions.
Whom should I ask for'?
"Mr Zaer Kheder, ifs cheating!"
"Oh, that's good."
will you excuse me while I put on my pretty new dress?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
I understand there's to be a little card party here tonight to which we ladies are cordially not invited.
That's right.
Where--?
Where is stella?
She's out there on the porch.
I'm going to ask a favor of you in a moment.
"well, now, what's that gonna be, I wonder."
Some buttons in back.
You may enter.
How do I Iook?
You look okay.
"well, thanks."
Now the button.
"well, I can't do no more with them."
"You men with your big, clumsy fingers."
-May I have a drag on your cig?
"-Yeah, have one for yourself."
"Why, thank you."
It--
It looks like my trunk has exploded.
Me and stella was helping you unpack.
You certainly did a fast and thorough job of it.
"well, certainly looks like you raided some stylish shops in Paris, BIanche."
clothes are my passion.
How much does it cost for a string of furs like that?
"Why, these were a tribute from an admirer of mine."
He must have had a Iot of admiration.
"In my youth I excited some admiration, but look at me now."
Far too much flogging.
There was a man killed.
- Under punishment?
"- Yes, sir."
I can deal with Mr. Scott-Padget.
"Maybe, sir."
Do you know what happened to the Beedle's captain?
The lordships of the Admiralty broke him and his two previous captains.
Influence?
"When somebody of enormous power has a mistress and that mistress has a son, the son has great influence at his back."
- I see.
- He's a most brilliant young officer.
A future Drake with a vicious streak and a silver spoon.
"Sir, it could be his making."
Good evening.
Can I offer you some Madeira?
- Yes.
- I'll be going.
"Thank you, Mr. Goss."
Would you like to know our orders?
"We join the fleet at Corsica, report to Admiral Jarvis."
Convoy duty.
"Orders say ""with all possible dispatch."""
"We'll not put in at Gibraltar, but you'll have time to train."
I hope so.
I'd like to practice gunnery next week.
Good.
I know how hard it is working up a green crew but I'd like you to go easier on them.
"The first few weeks, we use methods none of us like."
- You're questioning me.
- I haven't said so.
I know the value of discipline.
You're so naive.
"Decontamination work only pays 10,000 yen per day, 20 days per month."
The fish cake factory pays 750 yen per hour.
"You know, even deciding to buy clothes used to be a dilemma, pacing back and forth, not sure if I should."
"Now, if it's under 20,000 yen, I just buy it."
Being poor is unthinkable now.
"Talking with the cast and crew is fun, and I get to meet cool people."
"When I get makeup done and wear costumes,"
I start to become someone else and forget the bad stuff.
"Porn is legitimate work, so I don't feel guilty at all."
"Can you tell Mom and Dad you're doing porn, then?"
No.
You shouldn't do work you can't tell your parents about.
What about you?
Why are you here?
Weren't you at Grand Pacific?
I was fired.
Why?
None of your business.
This is a love hotel.
Can you tell Mom and Dad?
What if I do?
Go ahead.
"Sorry, excuse me."
"Azusa, we're ready for you now."
- Okay.
- Thank you.
"Don't tell Mom and Dad, okay?"
It'll make them sad.
It makes...
Will you take a picture with us?
"Sure, of course."
"Well as I am going below, continually below, that girl was laughing because of my touch."
- Interesting.
I dreamed things like this.
- Really.
And what?
"Is shivering even now my back, if I remember him when you touched my navel."
How do you fold that box?
What kind of work is this?
"Did you say something, kind Tót?"
"He said nothing, respectable major lord."
"Only...only...his new habit for him, that holds a piece of meat in his mouth and does not swallow it until clocks."
Well why does not spit it out?
"Spit it out if you cannot swallow it, my sweet good Lajos."
Show me
I think you understand that there is a limit to my patience.
I'm done.
"Oh, my God."
Is packing. he leaves.
What will be with our Gyula?
"You have to go in to it promptly now, you have to ask an apology."
- I do not go.
- But you go in.
Right now.
"- That god is not, that let me go in."
- Lajos!
- Daddy!
- Where are you Lajos?
"- What's up with you, daddy?"
- Leave me alone in peace.
- Think of our son.
"Our only son, my sweet good Lajos."
"The colds, the big Russian colds come."
"Well, we still have power."
"Yeah, well, let's work quickly, Mr. Palmer, while we still can."
Abby said our dead fake air marshal's name is Norman Dopps.
Norman.
"There's a name, huh?"
"Well, the Normans were Vikings."
They settled on part of the coast of France.
"Yes, on what one day would become known as Normandy."
"See, now, that history is great, but I just couldn't do it to the little guy."
Norman is a bit too Psycho- ish.
You could always shorten it to Norm.
Norm?
Norm!
"Nah, see, I'd have to fight the urge to give the kid a beer."
Oh.
Here we go.
Ah.
Murder on the lavatory.
Bishop sent these in the second e-mail.
"Yeah, it's quite a... nasty and narrow puncture wound."
"From a plastic knife, or something that could get past security?"
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Something stronger, to pierce the rib cage."
A nylon dagger.
"Or carbon fiber, perhaps."
"And based on the incision, it seems to have been twisted, twisted on entry."
For maximum damage.
"Mm, clearly, an expert kill."
How soon till we get these up to Jethro?
Oh...
I can bring them on my tablet.
Do you know the meaning of the name Jethro?
You're like the good-looking guy from high school who knows how cute he is and just won't take no for an answer.
"I've got your black Mercedes,"
I'm sending you the grid coordinates and imagery now.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"Next leave, beers are on me, okay?"
"Oh, you are not getting off that easy."
You got her to use a military recon satellite and then you made a date?
I'm a multi-tasker.
Impressive.
"There, address that."
He just pulled in to Makani Kai Aviation.
It's a helicopter tour operator.
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
- Fly.
"Please, I'm begging you."
We didn't do any...
- Will you shut up?
"- Hey, where do you wanna go?"
There's an airport on the north side of Molokai.
Get me there and I'll let them go.
- Danny.
Dawkins has hostages.
"No, no."
"According to Makani Kai Aviation, their bird took off with a pilot and a family of three coming back from a tour."
"- Chin, where's your friend?"
- On his way as we speak.
"Danny, contact Honolulu approach."
"Get me the direction that island bird is headed, okay?"
- You got it.
- Good.
"- Hey, it's all good, bro, mahalo."
- No problem.
"It wasn't a casino, it was a crappy little game in the back of a-a pizza place."
"Hey, hey!"
NCIS is back.
How many slices can I get you gentlemen?
Where's the game?
"Whoa, you can't go back there."
NCIS.
Do not move.
"Okay, look, I admit to hosting the game, but it was all in good fun."
"I mean, all this nonsense about drugging anybody-- that's just crazy."
Found this in the cabinet next to the oregano.
Try again.
"All right, what can I say?"
I'm not proud.
But times are tough.
"I mean, who doesn't need a little extra cash?"
"Cash off the backs of young sailors, serving their country, on liberty, in a crooked game?"
"Hey, the game itself is not crooked."
We deal straight.
They're ain't no sleight of hand here.
Just a little shot of this crap to give you the edge.
What?
They don't comp drinks in Vegas?
"You're not Vegas, Marty!"
This is a drug.
It's not a drink.
This kid died playing your game.
"Oh, no."
No way!
"One of these pills-- it'll make you woozy, but it never killed anybody."
Never.
Tell me about that night.
I have 10 times more experience than any Ivy League kid.
It's not just about experience.
I would need to depend on you every day.
What do you want me to do?
I'll start at the-
- I'll start at the bottom.
Just give me a chance.
I'm sorry.
Did you get the job?
"- Yeah, I think I got a shot."
- Really?
You know how it is.
They gotta go talk amongst themselves and...
These-
"- Look, these things, they can be really political."
Good morning.
Light day at the White House today.
Eagle will remain on the 18 acres.
He has phone calls to the congressional leadership.
First lady is back tonight?
Empress is wheels down at 1845.
"They're supposed to have dinner at the residence, but you know how they are."
"So we should have an advance on Obelisk, Marcel's, the usual."
- What if she wants sushi?
"- No, no, she's off sushi."
Remember she had that thing on the Japan trip?
"- Carol, how are you still awake?"
"- Caffeine and patriotism, sir."
- Threat matrix?
- Well threats against POTUS have quadrupled since the G8 speech.
PID is keeping an eye on a guy in Buffalo they're worried about.
- Visitors today?
"Then I took a second to get to know the guy, and he turned out to be a pretty good friend."
"- Well, um, I'm not here to make friends."
"- Yeah, well, mission accomplished."
"- Look, clearly, this isn't working."
- Clearly.
"So, let's just..."
"Look, you do the first half of the assignment, then I'll go over it before I put it together with mine."
- And I'll go over yours.
- Fine.
Then I guess we'll have to get together this weekend and go over it together.
Sounds like the perfect way to spend the weekend.
See ya.
- The Bait Shop.
Where is that exactly?
- I don't know.
"- So where'd you get these from, then?"
"- Uh, you know, uh, Cohen."
- He gave them to you?
- To us.
Hmm.
Why'd he do that?
"Um, well, he said he wants to be friends, that he's trying to change."
"Um, to be less Coheny and more like, well, a person."
- Don't you think he might be trying that just to win you back?
- No.
- I mean no.
"- Okay, let's just say, hypothetically,"
Seth really is changing.
Would that mean you'd want to get back together with him?
"- Well, hypothetically?"
- You know what?
Don't answer.
"Leaving, not going up."
"What was that all about - five minutes, where did that come from?"
You...
It's the human male from the Institute.
What's he doing here?
"Suggest we melt his brain using projectile acid fish, and then interrogate him."
Other way round.
Am I going to have the nightmare tonight?
Definitely not.
How do you know?
Because someone's coming to help.
Who?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Is it one of your stories?
Your definitely true ones?
Huh!
All my stories are true.
Like how you were born behind the clock face of Big Ben?
Accounting for my acute sense of time.
And you invented fish.
Because I dislike swimming alone.
So what's this one?
There's a man called the Doctor.
"He lives on a cloud in the sky, and all he does, all day every day, is to stop all the children in the world ever having bad dreams."
I've been having bad dreams.
He's been on holiday.
But I am confident he has now returned to work.
"And as a matter of fact, he's right here..."
"Aren't you, Doctor?"
Bloomin' hell!
The children have been very naughty!
"Get back, now, quickly."
"Sorry, don't think it'd be ethical to tell you their names."
Goodbye.
Marion.
- Thanks for today.
- Anytime.
"How about tomorrow, for instance?"
I can't remember when I've had so much fun.
"I've almost forgotten the silly, wonderful things there are for two people to do."
It isn't over yet.
"Mike, please."
"- I don't think we'd better, I mean it!"
"- Connie, listen..."
"All right, let's talk about this."
I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.
- Just like that?
- That's right.
"- We're not kids, we're adults."
- And we'll behave like adults.
"I kissed you, you kissed me."
"That's affection, not carnality."
"That's not lust, you should know the difference."
What do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...?
Human.
All men are alike.
The approach is different but the result is always the same.
"Sooner or later, we get to this."
"If all I wanted was a woman, I could get one in a bar, in a hotel lobby..."
Or in my home?
- I'm not gonna let you make this dirty.
- What do you call it?
I'll tell you a truth about yourself.

"Literally, our sound department has just gone, ""Aww."""

Should we treat ourselves to a little look at Pointless?
Check this out.
We gave 100 people 100 seconds to name as many words ending in 'ZZ.'
"OK, so I have a word, um..."
"But, again, it's sort of slangy, maybe slightly profane."
So what do I do about that?
What's your counsel?
"Hey listen, my counsel is..."

"My counsel, if it's going to score you 250 quid, fabulous."
"So, I'm going to go with jizz."

And how was your day today?
Give me a kiss.
"You okay, Frank?"
"Fine, sweetheart. I'm fine."
It's been on the TV all morning.
"Yeah, I know. I heard."
I fixed you some osso buco.
I had a feeling you might come home for lunch today.
"So, from now on, I will try to trust you, wherever you go and whatever you do."

Choi Chan Gyu...
He wants to fight you one more time.
"The reason you keep failing your exam... is because you spend all your time working part-time jobs, isn't it?"
There's nothing I can do about that.
Don't you regret giving up that special position at the agency?
I don't regret it.
"If I took that, that would mean I would never see you or Shi Yoon again."
"Especially you, Jung Yeon."
You're even supplying the entertainment.
You seem to be having a blast.
You said you wanted to fight.
Are you on a date instead?
Jung Yeon.
"It's dangerous, go over there."
"Hey, speak with some respect."
Isn't it obvious that I'm older than you?
I'm taller too.

They can't have control of everything.
Surely there's someone who has an illegal transmitter.
I know what you'd like...
some talsa root soup.
Can you at least tell me what happened to the other people
I was with on the street?
You really should be more careful out there.
Those Mokra will pick a fight for no reason.
I don't want you getting hurt...again.
But I saw the way you handled that ugly one.
I couldn't have done any better.
"I was so proud of you, Ralkana."
My two friends...
did the Mokra take them?
I'm afraid so.
Where would they have been taken?
A detention center?
The prison.
All right.
How do I get there?
Soup.
I'm forgetting the soup.
"I appreciate your hospitality, but I can't stay here."
I've got to get to that prison.
"You're right, the time has come."
"Now we're together again, we can't wait another day."
My beautiful and brave...
girl.
The Mokra won't stand a chance against us.
"You're very kind to offer, but I didn't mean we'd be going together."
[laughs]
"Oh, you're so like a man, Townsend."
[chuckles] [sighs] Is it possible that you are the worst friend a fellow has ever had?
[chuckles]
And thank you for picking up my tab tonight.
"Oh, no, thank Winston."
I signed his name to everything.
[laughing]
- [glass breaking] - [car horn honking]
[keys jangling]
[sighs]
"So you see, dearest Scott,"
"I worry that I'll never do anything of import, for I'm much too lazy to care whether a thing is done or not."
"All I truly want is to be young always, and to feel that my life is my own."
[indistinct chatter]
Tildy says the people of New York all have different kind of accents.
The likes of which she's never heard.
Plenty of different accents around here.
"You mean, like, Mississippi and Georgia?"
They are different.
Are they not?
"I think Tildy's talkin' about non-southern type accents, Daddy."
"Yes, Tootsie, I understand."
- We about done here?
"- Zelda, honey."
Could you post this for me?
I suppose so.
The streets are filled to the brim with people and cars and buses and trolleys.
It's all one big swirl.
Nothin' to love about the big city.
I think it sounds exciting.
Yet you passed on your chance.
Good!
Your minds has also sharpened up along with your body.
"So partner, why did you want to see me?"
I need a house.
Are you looking to buy one?
"No, want to rent one."
So what is the problem?
- Nobody wants to give it to a bachelor.
And I can't call my sister here until I have a house.
Don't worry!
Call your sisters!
How can I call them till I have a house!
Don't worry about that!
I have a lady friend too!
What family were you talking about?
He is a bachelor!
Why?
I am there!
These days even two men can start a family!
"Stay within your limits, Johnny!"
Just kidding!
He has got two lovely sisters.
They will come and stay with him.
You can lord over them!
They will help you in your housework too!
How much is the rent?
"3,000 rupees, no security because Johnny has brought you here."
But I will take three months advance.
My tenants will vacate the room in 15 days.
But you need to pay the advance now.
His sisters will be here in 15 days.
He will give you the advance then and you hand us the keys at the same time.
-Why do you ask?
-Mm.
Might she remember?
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
-May I ask...?
-We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
"It's all right, Karl."
Why are you asking all this?
It's strange.
"The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl."
"And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil it isn't likely he would fall from a window."
"Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found."
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.
No.
My hunch....
My opinion... point one.
"point two plus the various other things we mentioned would make it very probable probable, not certain that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window."
"But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?"
It could be one way.
If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned.
"Judas Priest, just a second."
-The servants?
They have visitors?
-Not at all.
I feel good.
I feel normal.
Okay.
"Stand up, slowly."
Are you ready to play?
Isn't this the Harlech Shadow house?
It's part of the estate.
"The gamekeeper's lodge, actually."
"But, yeah, this was the model."
The layout was replicated for the game and the texture scanned.
Wow!
"Very, very cool."
"So what's the game, what do I do?"
You don't have to do anything.
"You just stay in here alone, see how long you last until you're too scared to continue."
"So all I have to do is, like, stay here?"
And I get paid for that?
"I'll be back in the control room, watching."
"There are cameras all over, so no stealing the silverware."
And now there's this.
- And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.
Oh!
"Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I will be in contact the whole time."
"Oh, cool."
"And I can, like, talk to you, and you'll hear it?"
"Great, that's great."
"Now, nothing you'll see can physically harm you."
"It's all just audio-visual, like the gopher game."
"Oh, okay."
"But if it does get too intense, we can pull you out at any time"
- and stop the experiment.
We thought you'd like to see this.
So many of you have expressed an interest in knowing how I was paid.
Now I can afford to go back to my diet.
Tonight's play is about a body.
Not mine.
"However, the title is"
"""John Brown's Body. """
"In my opinion, John, this is the type of furniture we should be making."
Remarkable.
What is it?
"It's a chair, made out of wrought iron and plastic."
It's the latest modern design.
"And this, Harold?"
That's a copy of a new Swedish reversible sofa.
Hmm.
Does a set of instructions go with them?
I'd be afraid to get into that thing.
"Unfortunately, John, our customers are not quite so old-fashioned."
The public is demanding modern furniture now.
Take this sofa.
"My boy, that is not a sofa."
That is a sofa.
"Constructed, not turned out."
"Quality, my boy."
That's what we're selling.
People are looking for something new.
We've got to give it to them.
Chairs made out of scrap metal?
That's not what our customers expect from John Brown and Company.
We'd get new customers with a line of modern furniture.
"Now, Harold, our sales are fine."
We're making money.
[ Cheers and applause ]
I don't know why you keep encouraging our man Rutledge.
"I mean, so, your solution for everybody who owns an electric car is to buy a gas-powered truck, a gas-powered generator, and have him lead you around everywhere you go."
It's genius.
[ Laughter ]
It's about as good an idea as you getting behind the wheel of a race truck.
Aw.
[ Audience groans ]
I'm just saying.
"All right, all right."
"I think the important thing to remember is, we've all learned something here today."
Thank you.
We've learned never to let you be in charge of this programme ever again.
That's all we have.
We see you next time.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."
One year down at uni and we're all still breathing.
- Chin-fucking-chin.
- Chin-fucking-chin!
"Yes, thank you."
"We'll be celebrating later right, Gemma?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Oh, it's going to be a bumpy ride to Heaven and back."
Get off me!
"Chris, I've seen you in the shower."
You won't be reaching Heaven.
"- Screw you, Eleanor."
- Without your beretta?
"- Just shut the fuck up, all right?"
- She's only winding you up.
Suddenly there's a hole in the wall.
Money vanished silently.
He's no ordinary thief.
You don't say anything.
I got the stick of my life for trusting you.
We all had our balls busted.
I'll get the details...
You can't do it.
We've handed over the case to a new officer.
Call the new officer.
I told you that you can never catch me after December 16th.
"Today I'm reporting for duty, I think all are waiting for me."
"I wanted to do it for children, I did it."
It's over.
"Then, what about this?"
This is for my lover.
She wants me to be a police officer.
I worked hard to become a police officer.
But there's a real kick in fulfilling her wish.
Shattering!
What are you discussing?
Give the file to him.
Who do you think he's?
"Meritorious candidate, and he gave a lot on information about the thief also."
Don't you feel you've caught the thief by looking at him?
Yes sir.
"You don't feel bad, old officer."
Nothing like that sir.
I know very well about him.
He's very sincere.
Handover all your wealth to him.
He's the right man for you.
He gave to the cops?
He would not!
"He was on their side, get it?"
Why would he do that?
Ask your sister.
-Relax.
Nobody knows anything.
What happened with Siri?
Nothing.
-They Paid for the funeral.
I think they're angry now.
The club has a code of honor when it comes to girls.
"If Siri does not know anything, she's safe."
The police would take Christer Johansson's death at some point?
-I Do not know.
-You Can tell us about the circumstances?
The police would not comment on the report in VG today.
We comment on the technical findings?
No.
-You Can come here after?
-Of Course.
With thousand of these newspapers he will buy a new iPhone.
Good morning to everyone!
"It will be a tough day, but we will do better."
The moderation of the OS is not something to which we are accustomed.
But there is something interesting in the Oslo police files.
"A car seized a girl who can be Zana, highway E6 in Mastemyr."
"Get nothing else from her, and she looked troubled, then they took her to the psychiatric hospital."
She's there?
"-negative, She ran away."
"They warned the police, but no one found it."
Find out if it was Zana.
"- Oh, god."
More protestors?
Guess some folks from the church must've gotten wind of the festivities.
I'm still so shocked that that kind of anti-semitism exists down here.
"Yes, well, it may not be just the Jewish thing."
"Yeah, but still, they're just backwards, pigheaded philistines."
Some people have taken issue with our age difference.
"Well, she could be younger."
"I mean, hey."
"[Chuckles] Yes, well, legally, I suppose she could, but I couldn't very well push her down the aisle in a stroller."
[Laughs loudly]
"Still, even my late wife... she came to me in a dream last night,"
"- told me, ""it ain't right."""
- Listen to me.
Your dead ghost wife is wrong.
If you've been lucky enough to find love...
I have.
"You have, so nothing should stop you from grabbing onto it and holding onto it forever."
- [Chuckles] Oh!
- Uh-oh.
They're unloading the hate bus.
Protestors: [Chanting] Not in our town!
Not in our town!
The racists down here are really organized.
"This makes me really, really angry."
They're gonna ruin everything.
"Nate, go get rid of them."
"No, no, no."
Deep breath.
Just ignore them.
I've learned to rise above the bigotry.
"Well, guess what, pal?"
And I just couldn't handle it going down like that again.
You really like me?
I'm crazy about you.
"Well, I like hearing that... because I love you."
What?
But we never even...
You know.
"But we've talked on the phone every night for, like, a month, and I love talking to you."
I love hearing what you have to say about everything.
And I don't want to rush the other stuff if it means you're gonna freak out.
Because I want this to be something.
"So I'm fine with waiting, okay?"
"Just, no more chili cheese fries."
- They smell disgusting.
- Deal.
They say that the hallmark of a good negotiation is when neither side is particularly happy.
"Well, then this was a very good negotiation."
My people will hate this deal.
Yep.
"Mine, too."
"You didn't need to pull that whole ""helpless"" act on me, you know?"
"Sure, you say that now."
Seriously.
"I mean, you're a killer negotiator."
You don't need tricks.
You've got skills.
Hmm.
You're not too bad yourself.
"Oh, a word of advice, though..."
- I'd keep an eye on that daughter of yours.
- Are you kidding?
I've completely given up on that one.
No.
Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart?
Whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
"Okay, listen to me."
Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
I am not trying to get her back.
"But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
"All right, honey, let me tell you a story."
"There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt."
"Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it."
Do you see where I'm going with this?
I believe I do.
Mm.
I'm the guy.
You're not the guy.
Are you sure?
That would explain so much.
"Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me"
"""sweetie"" all the time."
"I call everyone ""sweetie."""
You tramp.
(sighs)
"Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy."
"""Strap on a pair""?"
"Of what, skates?"
"Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
"(quiet, dramatic musical score playing in movie)"
"If you're bored, you can go."
I understand.
"No, I'm having a nice time."
(scoffs)
Don't patronize me.
"You got 80% of the company in bed with the Navy, and..."
"And what, Ron?"
We need that military contract.
Not gonna happen.
Navy wants to go light.
"Steel is out, poly fiber is in."
"Dalton, did the contract expire, or did it expire?"
Expired.
And are we gonna get it back?
Don't see it happening.
"Legal doesn't see it happening, Ron."
Maybe we should stop yapping about a Navy contract we don't have anymore and figure out how (slams hand on table) to sell some damn steel!
I have to go.
Give our best to the Secretary of the Navy.
And good luck with the speech.
"As President and CEO of Wickes Steel  Shipbuilding,"
I'm proud of the work my family has put into building these great machines.
They're an unshakable foundation upon which the Navy can take her fleet to new heights.
How was that?
MAN:
"That was perfect, sir."
Thank you.
WICKES:
Was I loud enough?
JARVIS:
Always are.
(laughs)
"Mr. Secretary, I..."
I feel sorry for you having to follow that.
"Oh, I was going to have you take a look at my speech, maybe do a little punch up."
WICKES (chuckles):
"Like old times, huh?"
"Selena, have you told me the whole story?"
I'm sorry.
There's no more to tell.
"Hello, Allison."
- You look well.
- With a drink in my hand?
Would you care for something?
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.
"Well, this is an unexpected pleasure."
Do come in.
It is wiser to telephone.
Please sit down.
Would you like a drink?
I do hope this isn't an appeal to my better nature.
- I haven't one.
- No.
"You might as well know, my engagement's broken off."
"I'll never see Bill again, so it's no good you going on blackmailing me because I haven't a penny in the world."
This is shocking news.
But 16 Texan oil wells shouldn't be thrown away.
That doesn't matter.
You wouldn't understand.
"I really love him, and I'm nobody without him, so, please, please, leave me alone."
"I'm sorry, but it would still make a good supporting feature."
"""Lurid past loses luckless model Texan oil millions."""
- (Sobs)
"- Look, my dear."
You'll be better off trying to win him back than wasting your time and mine.
What the d...?
!
"- (West Country accent) Sorry, sir."
- What are you doing here?
We know that you were his dealer.
Okay.
I think we're done here.
I don't know anything about drugs.
"And just so we're super clear on that,"
I'm gonna go call my lawyer.
Thanks.
"Okay, you do that."
"You call your lawyer, and he'll get you out in no time."
But that's when I get started.
What is that supposed to mean?
I'll be all over you.
"Whatever you do, buy, sell, I'll be watching you."
That's actually called harassment.
It is.
It's called harassment.
"You really want to do that to your business, Jake?"
"Look, we're just after whoever actually killed Aldo Clemens."
My hunch is killing isn't exactly your thing.
"Answer some questions, I'll be out of your life."
I might have known this guy.
"If I did,"
I would have dropped him as a client months ago.
He run out of money?
No.
They always find the money.
Aldo... had become a risk.
"Some guy was following him, so I cut him off."
Who was following Aldo?
You got a name?
I can't even tell you what he looked like.
He was some guy in a crappy car.
- There is hardly any.
"I've heard, ladies used to fancy their dresses, longtime ago."
"But nowadays, why have you ladies become so stingy about it?"
"Now look, what I like to wear is my personal matter."
I see.
"Just like the loafer's personal matter was to whistle, right?"
Any matter which troubles others cannot be personal.
But how does this dress trouble others?
This question suits the loafer who whistled at you.
"An_ay, you seem to be a decent girl from a decent family."
"Ifyou put on some decent dress, then I think it won't trouble anyone."
"An_ay, it's your wish."
"Sawant, take down her complaint."
What's his name?
He just doesn't possess any kind of etiquette.
My case is fixed on the 21th.
And the witness...
Don't talk about the court.
This is a pam.
Have fun.
This is the first time I see you on time.
And...
"Hello, Mr Sahney!"
Have you met my daughter Sheetal?
Hello
"- Sheetal, he is a famous criminal lawyer."
"Mr Sahney, please come with me."
"- Hey, Mr Mehta!"
I've read about your Nihar murder case in the newspapers.
You were just incredible and you won the case.
Really?
Are you interested in such things?
What would she have?
Seriously.
That ajumma knows how to subtly put on airs.
Yeah.
Unni Jin Ok can't come today?
Why?
She was scammed?
You want me to h-hold it?
The rumors are already spread all over this place that I was scammed by con artists.
I'm so embarrassed that I can't even face anyone.
"Jang Jin Ok, the name that used to have influence everywhere I went, it's become so that I can't use it anywhere now!"
Then... simply change your name.
It only takes a week.
Do you really want to die!
No.
I have to be cool-headed about this.
I-I heave to be cool-headed about this.
Here.
Take this.
Ok.
Then what should we do now?
We should catch them.
That's right.
No amount of money is too large.
Catch them.
"After screwing up my good son's life, and making me this embarrassed."
My husband is getting a tax audit...
I mean... can he persecute us like this just because we have money?
Of course not.
"Make sure to catch them, especially the punk who pretended to be a prosecutor, make sure to catch him."
"Even if you have to kill him, catch him."
Ah!
"Finally you have come, Alvaro."
It takes a life to wait.
They have taken half an hour to surround it.
"We go, we go, raises."
"By the way, I and you have put a card?"
"Yes, yes."
"For the women, those romantic details are fundamental."
"Clearly, it is her birthday."
You are sure we will find that she is there?
"Yes, I followed her without account occurred, you will see that it contents is put when she sees me."
"We go, if one does not melt."
You will see that surprise.
"Good afternoon, I hope not to have mistaken, Im looking for Lella."
"Yes, she is here, it happens."
I knew that she was making practical with you.
"Yes, it makes practical, anyway, she is very good,"
-she is an authentic professional.
-Where is she?
-She is with a client.
-Alone?
"Yes, clearly."
What is that package?
A thing that to Lella she likes much.
-You embosoms it to me?
"-No, no, it is only for Lella."
"What a shame, everybody needs incentive for their erotic fantasies."
-Why you do not call to Lella?
"-She will be here, in five minutes."
Five minutes?
Not if it holds.
"Endurance, hold yourself."
"It is not necessary, already I feel..."
"Sexually aware, but you just don't know it."
But when I read it...
You know what I mean?
"You're in denial of the fact that your parents had sex and everything and the second you pull that out, it was like,"
"""You bastard!"
"You know."""
"You know that he knows, because he swapped it for that."
"And you're lying there, in a foetal position."
My dick went backwards - I had a vagina.
"I'm lying on the bathroom floor, a new woman."
"I'd already undressed so I'm like, ""Oh, God, I've gone the whole hog!"""
"I went through the whole, like, opera of having a bath."
"You know, like..."
"# Just in the bath, la la la!"
#
"Singing too loud and kind of,"
# No wanking here Just enjoying the soap
# Nowhere near my testicles!
#
"And went downstairs and you know that thing of going, ""You know what?"
"""Maybe they played a trick."
"Maybe your brother..."""
I walked into the living room and I was just like...
"I felt so dirty but you're going,"
"""Just don't..."
"Play it cool, play it cool."""
Sat down.
And people think that...
This is genuine - Juliet Bravo was on.
I like Juliet Bravo.
I like Juliet Bravo.
Not in that way.
Goodnight.
So you can move your cloud?
You can control it.
"No, no-one can control clouds, that would be silly."
"The wind, a little bit."
She's following us!
That's the idea.
Keep her away from the snow.
So.
"Barmaid or governess, which is it?"
"That thing is after us, and you want a chat?"
"Well, we can't chat after we've been horribly killed, can we?"
How did we get up so high so quick?
"Clever staircase, it's taller on the inside!"
"What am I standing on, what's this made of?"
Super-dense water vapour.
"Should keep her trapped, for the moment."
So you actually live up here?
"On a cloud, in a box?"
"I have done, for a long time."
"Blimey, you really know how to sulk."
I'm not sulking!
You live in a box!
That's no more a box than you are a governess.
"Oh, spoken like a man!"
You're the same as all the rest.
"Sweet little Clara, works at the Rose And Crown, ideas above her station!"
"For your information,"
"I'm not sweet on the inside, and I'm certainly not... little."
It's called the TARDIS.
It can travel anywhere in time and space.
And it's mine.
...whatever has happened in another family...
"There's a child degenerating in there, and none of you could care less"
Not good.
...one can say that the whole procedure of this surgery...
"Sorry, Gennady, what was that?"
"Dad, maybe I can open the can of sprats for you?"
Will you have some?
"Lucy, can you please stop calling me ""dad"""
--Why is that?
--I'm just asking
OK
"Still, why?"
I've called you that from the very beginning...
I don't want to get into it.
Then what should I call you from now on?
"Comrade Vasin, is it?"
My name is Pavel Ivanovich
"Oh, no, that's for close relations."
"I, being a stranger here, will call you Comrade Vasin"
Officially!
"Hello, Comrade Vasin"
"How was your sleep, Comrade Vasin"
"--Eat your salad, Comrade Vasin --Get out of here!"
What?
Out!
"...And here Teterin is now present... no Gennady, it must be there!"
"""And here Teterin is now present He will replace you in your job ...But he'll be the first to feel the loss of How you are leaving us at last"""
"""An irreplaceable loss""?"
--May I please?
--But that doesn't rhyme
"Hello, this is her husband"
"I have my own version, please listen to it"
"Charlie, we sleep ass to ass, you know that."
"Oh, great."
"Okay, clearly, we're having a problem with honesty here."
"Dennis, a word."
"I hate to say it, bro, but I think we're gonna have to do an overnight observation."
"Yeah, well, to be honest with you, I wouldn't mind seeing how this whole situation really works."
Fascinating.
"Well, this just gets weirder and weirder, man."
Anything?
Nothing.
False alarm.
"Damn it, dude, we can't keep doing this all night."
"Oh, I know."
You know what.
Why don't we sleep in shifts?
"Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying this isn't important work"
- but I can't keep my eyes open.
"- No, I hear you."
I hear you.
I hear you.
"All right, I'll tell you what."
You go ahead and go first.
I still got a little energy left.
"I don't know about this floor, Dennis."
It's covered in sand or something.
No.
"It smells like some kind of spice blend or pesticide, or some other kind of sandy poison or something."
I don't know.
"I wouldn't sleep on the floor, though."
- You got to sleep with them?
"- You got to, you got to."
You sure you're all right?
I don't think he'd done it for some time.
I discovered something under the micrcope.
"Amonthe keratin proteins, I found translucent fibers of glass."
-Exactly.
-Fiberglass?
He must have inhaled them in.
"I'd say,most likely from insulation."
Maybthe house wasn't just a body drop.
"'S speaking softly, but lance corporal finn hamore to say."
"Would you mind clearing up,Mr. Palmer?"
"Not at all,doctor."
I know you've been putting in long hours recently.
Just doing my job.
I appreciate the can-do attitude.
-Good night.
"-Ght,doctor."
"Agent lee,you're working late."
"Still organizing paperwork on the wheaton case,Dr. Mallard."
I need the autopsy report.
What happened to the one I se up to legal yesterday?
I'm afraid I shredded it by mistake.
You must be more careful.
"I know.I'm sorry,Dr. Mallard."
No worries.
I'm sure Mr. Palmer will give you what you ed.
Okay.Thank you.
that's about how it looked three months ago.
The living room floor was the last thing we closed up.
We ran the ac ducts under this section.
The damn inspector was weeks late.
"You have security at night here,bob?"
Not on a job this size.
I'm very sorry.
Today is his first day.
He thought that was a stain.
"Damn it, does that make sense?"
"- Hey, you!"
- Yeah?
I'm going to poke your eyes out!
I must've scrubbed too hard.
Let's have a look.
"Now, a family of foxes will finally be shown to the world."
Think about your parents who bore you.
You're right.
Why did they make me like this?
What did they make you into?
I have to die!
I must die!
It's hot!
Granny!
You can't die now!
Not yet!
The Fox Family starts their day by making medicine.
This generous family takes in people abandoned by their loved ones.
"While taking care of them, their day goes by so quickly."
But they are so happy to do it.
Is this what a real family is?
Please give all our family much love and peace.
May their body and spirit be healthy.
Until the sun and moon meet on our 1000th year.
"Oh Jesus, Oh Buddha."
"Damn it, are they foxes or what?"
The city is terrified over the Nam Mountain serial killings.
"Since the victims were prostitutes, the police suspect the same murderer, and have focused their inspection in the Nam Mountain area."
To get their bearings.
Exactly.
"Once they go through here, they'll have a much better idea of where they're headed."
So that's why we release them up here.
And we can just gently release this.
How extraordinary.Here they go!
And notice one thing - they're headed straight towards the brightest spot.
They are - straight for the sun.
That is the most incredible sight.
Fantastic.
Look at them!
Look at him!
They're desperate!
"There's no hanging around, they're not nervous about it - straight in the sea."
"Notice as soon as they float, they change their swimming pattern."
Just like a clockwork toy.
"Look, there's one last one up here - look, Stephen."
"Oh, yes."
Come on.
"Come on, you."
"Oh, no, the crab grabbed it as it went over the hole."
Rescue it!
"I know you're not supposed to intervene, but hey!"
"That's it, go for it."
Good luck!
Yeah!
Made for the water.
"Oh, that's fantastic."
I've never seen anything quite so magical in all my life.
That's one of the best wildlife things I've seen.
"20-25 years from now, hopefully she'll be back laying eggs if she's a girl."
That was fantastic.
"Well,some dads are better with sons"
Than they are with daughters.
My dad was.
Drove my sister crazy.
"When you get into the mock jury room,"
Don't be surprised
If the focus group asks you some questions.
It's a good thing.
It's how we learn what kind of questions
The real jury's gonna ask
When they're sitting in the box at your trial.
Just answer honestly.
Okay?
"Go on,ann."
What happened next?
"After dinner, i wanted to go home,"
"Because i had a test the next day,"
But he wouldn't let me.
"Stein called me names, and he hit me."
"So i grabbed the knife to defend myself,"
And i swiped the knife behind me to get him away from me.
Why didn't you go to a restaurant?
"Well, the hotel was his idea."
I bet.
- Yeah.
"It's got a five-inch-thick door, three-inch walls."
It's got six-sided protection against concentrated attacks with mechanical and electrical tools.
"We keep our ready-to-sell harvest in here, okay?"
"As we rotate it out, we fill it back up."
No cash.
No personal items.
You and me are the only people on this Earth that know the combination.
I panicked.
I was nervous.
It was my first day and I just...
I want people in this office to respect me and they're not if they think...
"One day, you're gonna have to come clean."
Not if I meet somebody really soon.
I called the matchmaker.
"The pushy, judgmental, objectifying matchmaker?"
"- Yeah, that would be the one."
"- Oh, the irony of this moment."
Could I just have a minute to enjoy this?
"Oh, knock yourself out."
"Well, I can't enjoy it if you're gonna enjoy it."
"Kitty, you don't have to prove yourself to the staff."
"I mean, ignore them, or I can talk to them."
No!
"No, no, no."
No!
"No, no, no!"
Don't.
It's fine.
I don't think that the office scuttlebutt was the only reason.
- It is hard to meet people.
- Tell me about it.
I met my wife at a kegger.
I filled her plastic cup up with flat beer and that was that.
Today I don't have the first idea where to meet women.
"If it makes you feel better, I was half-tempted to call her myself."
Really?
"Well, yeah."
"Yeah, that does make me feel better."
It's just that...
"No, Chef, don't say that, please!"
I cannot take
Much more!
"Now, these hopefuls are ready to enter"
Chef Ramsay's domain.
They come with confidence.
I'm not nervous at all about any competition.
"Throw a pan at me, and I'm gonna throw a pan back."
And they come with dreams of being the next winner of Hell's Kitchen.
It's done;
it's over with.
They might as well just give me the prize.
"Today, representatives from the media have come for their first glimpse of the group that will contain the next culinary superstar."
"It's not that I'm cocky, but"
Hell's Kitchen's gonna be a piece of cake.
These aspiring chefs think they know what awaits them.
I'm pretty confident that
I'm prepared for anything that Chef Ramsay can throw at me.
But no one is ever really prepared for Hell's Kitchen.
"Right, let's go."
Come over.
"Oh, my God."
I was taken away.
I felt like a celebrity.
"Hello, hi."
This year's chefs come from all over the country.
"I'm from Maui, Hawaii."
"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
"Boston, Massachusetts."
"From many different culinary backgrounds,"
I'm a master cook.
I'm a culinary arts teacher.
"I saw him once from a distance, though."
Handsome boy.
"He's got a long struggle ahead of him, that's for sure."
"Doctors, rehab... physical therapy...."
I think I'm going to have the medallions of veal.
You make me late for a table at Tavern on the fucking Green?
How's the real estate business?
-Excuse me?
"-You know, HUD."
"Garside Street, you, Ralph, Zellman."
Zellman tell you this?
Carmine doesn't know anything about this yet.
"I'm giving you an opportunity to cut a deal, make it right."
"Last time, Frelinghuysen Avenue, I cut you in out of friendship, but that's over."
You got nothing coming to you.
You or Carmine.
You sure you want to go down this road?
"How much to paint a different suit on him, change his face a little?"
-Pardon me?
-Why throw it away?
"A stronger chin, maybe."
I was thinking like those paintings in the courthouse.
"Something classy, you know, like a Revolutionary War general."
Napoleon and his horse.
That kind of thing.
He's rather portly to be Napoleon.
"Not Napoleon, exactly."
Like Napoleon.
Sit down.
Relax.
"What's going on, Ton'?"
"I think I know what happened to Ralph, and if I'm right... he ain't coming back."
We?
He isn't pissed at us.
You're the government agent.
He probably thinks we're all agents.
He believes almost everyone is.
- I'm not with any government agent.
- He's trying to confuse you.
I'm with you.
"Big Brother, right?"
"Newthink, newspeak?"
"Hate is love, war is peace."
He's laughing at you.
- Stop it!
"- No, Ted."
It's okay.
- He doesn't mean anything.
"- Yeah, chill."
I support you.
Screw the government.
Make him sit down.
"All right, how do we remove a microchip that's not there?"
His speech is lucid.
"There's no sign of neologisms, word salad or loosening of associations."
"As long as he can systematize, he'll be able to keep his thinking relatively organized."
Organized enough to see through any game we try to throw at him?
"And if he's convinced it's in his arm, and not in a place like his lower back or his neck..."
An incision means he's going to be watching.
Maybe we can just convince him that he's been looking in the wrong place.
Or we could fake it.
Conceal a chip in the palm.
A little sleight of hand.
"Come on, Reid, what are you talking about?"
"How about the effects at the house, Barney?"
They're in the works.
I also have the men.
"Jim, how does Gordon handle these so-called contracts for murder?"
Picks up the phone and the job gets done.
But he never does it himself.
Even if the job's here in town?
"No, he has an assistant, a man named Connie."
Always uses one of these delightful things.
The bodies are disposed of in the incinerator at Gordon's lumberyard.
Why don't we just keep an eye on Connie until he tries it again?
All we'd get is Connie.
We want Gordon.
"- How about the sweater, Barney?"
"- Right here, Jim."
- Heavy.
- It has eight layers of laminated nylon.
Backed by fine chain mail.
- The blood?
- It's in the ribbing.
"Rollin, were you able to work out the mask?"
Yes.
I have it right here.
Disintegrates two minutes after being exposed to the air.
And did Mr. Gordon accept the Harpers' invitation to dinner?
His R.S.V.P. Was in this morning's mail.
"Well, in that case..."
"Mrs. Harper, I think we'd better get headed for home."
"How are you, Burt?"
"Haven't lost your touch, huh?"
"What have you got, Lew?"
Anything I should know about any of these?
"-Still, I'd like to give platelets and FFP."
"-Yeah, go ahead."
Even a tiny bleed can become serious if she can't clot.
"It's possibly a good idea, Dr. Kovac..."
... butyoudo realizethatbloodproducts carry the risk of infection...
"... andtransfusionreaction,don 'tyou ?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, was the CT negative?"
There's no bleed that we could see.
Do you wanna expose your patient to those risks because her platelets are low?
Scan was four hours ago.
She might have a delayed bleed.
I'd worry more if she had mental status changes...
... ora focalneuroexam.
-He's got a point.
-She's drunk so that's hard to assess.
Drunk people get sober.
And careful observation is still better than any lab.
That's right. I'd have to agree.
What just happened?
They've been pulling that on me all morning.
"I don't know, some sort of competitive agreeing contest?"
-l wouldn't steal any stupid camera.
-Did you hear what I said?
-They got you on tape.
-Couldn't have been me.
-You were up there long enough.
-They had to look for that infuser thing.
"Don't give me that crap, K.J."
Okay.
"There's this girl, one of the volunteers..."
-... she'sfineas hell-- -l went out on a limb for you.
They'll arrest you if you don't.
Arrest me?
"Why, he's the thief."
Don't say things like that.
These people are police.
You'll make them angry.
"You keep out of this, Wooster."
"Come, Miss Lowman."
I happen to know that you arranged to meet McDermott here... and turn over the rest of the plans to him.
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- And I also know... that McDermott arranged to turn over his plans to the Faulkner Aircraft company.
"Oh, really?"
That's quite near here.
Just go down the road.
- Thank you very much for the information.
"- Oh, no charge, old boy."
"- So, you see, your pretense won't work, Miss Lowman."
- You might as well confess.
- Are you going to give them up or must we take them?
- I've said all I'm going to.
Very well then.
Go on.
Search her.
I can't allow you to manhandle the lady.
"- Sit down, jack-in-the-box."
"- I've had just about enough of you, Mr. Wooster."
This isn't cricket.
"If you want to search, have a matron here."
Search me.
"Wooster, if you interfere again, it'll be for last time."
"Here, take this."
"Very touchy on this ""blowpipe"" question."
"Here's what happens, right?"
It's a sexually aggressive badger?
Locks on your leg.
"I'm sure other people have heard this, that you have to carry..."
"Never heard about it before in my life, mate."
Should have backed me up on the fucking film.
Did you find it?
Did you find it?
I've seen badgers.
They never locked on me.
I never smelt like a...
They never smelt me like a competitor.
"The badger will only release when it hears the crack of bone, so you have to carry a stick and if the..."
Is that a real thing?
Yes.
Only when your bone cracks will it let you go?
Look...
They're only about that big.
They can't do that.
"No, they're huge."
You either heard this somewhere...
Or dreamt it.
Or dreamt it.
Would you like me to put you out of your misery?
"The director has come into my ear and said Honkytonk Man was released in 1982, starring Clint Eastwood."
APPLAUSE
"I'm sorry, Johnny."
"He told me that about five minutes ago, but it was much more fun..."
"The period of time where you were going,"
"""Is there nobody here?"
"!"" was more fun."
Carrying a stick.
Come on!
-I hope he's seen it.
-I'm sure he has.
"And with those figures, he will be able to restore the Tardis."
It won't take long.
"Well, while he's sorting that out, perhaps you wouldn't mind explaining something to me."
"Back home in Brisbane, we call that a sweatshop."
This street.
Nyssa.
Nyssa.
Nyssa.
"Nyssa, my dear."
Father.
"They don't smile, they don't talk to anybody."
Their language is the language of numbers.
And they have no need to smile.
No need to smile?
We are a people driven not by individual need but by mathematical necessity.
The language of the numbers is as much as we need.
"Now, it is important that we do not disturb them."
But if they don't talk to each other...
You've done it!
"Yes, there does seem to be some positive development."
"But what is this mission of yours, Father?"
You're so changed by it.
"You look younger, but so cold."
Logopolis is a cold place.
"A cold, high place overlooking the universe."
"It holds a single, great secret, Nyssa, which you and I must discover together."
-And the Doctor.
The Doctor can help us.
"-Oh, yes, the Doctor can certainly help us."
"Just because I've been made wiser by my experience on the open road, that doesn't make me any better than you."
"You know, the people that know me?"
I'm just plain simple.
Like string.
I collect string.
"Well, of course you do."
You're perfect for each other.
I can't get in the way of this.
Clearly this is bigger than I am.
"Well, if I hurry, I can just make the parade of sprinkles."
"Eric, if you don't have to take the hitchhiker boy home, not more than five miles from here is Burlick, Pennsylvania."
Tell me about this Burlick.
"Burlick, Pennsylvania, home of the world's largest..."
Yogurt cup.
"Hey, wait a second."
You leave my girlfriend alone.
I'm going to the parade.
8:00?
Perfect.
"Ladies and gentlemen, mesdames et messieurs,"
"Senores y Senoritas, Damen und Herren, the internationally-renowned Pottstown, Pennsylvania, parade of sprinkles!"
Look!
The sprinkles is coming.
"Oh, they are beautiful!"
"Hey, why is everybody wearing goggles?"
My eyes!
"Alan, I am so proud of you."
"""Grocey award-winning Alan"" to you."
I know the perfect place to put this.
Ta-da!
"Well, there it is."
Twenty years in the grocery business and I've reached the pinnacle of my profession.
The remaining we shall do it there.
"Brother, you have handled such a big responsibility of mine."
Okay!
It's okay Ameena.
Now we are free.
Hey Faiz!
Hey Faiz!
Sweets are being distributed in the locality.
Her marriage has been finalized.
With her cousin brother Shadab.

Uncle!

"Please sit down, Mr..."
Dinamo
"Please, sit"
Thanks.
Smoke?
Very kind of you.
Do you understand the incovenience we have had with the police inquiry?
We are not used to that line of inquiry.
"But I will be delighted to cooperate, with what little I know."
"Hopefully, it will be of use to punish the perpetrator."
"Ms. Bristol, I would like to know about you."
I will spare you from a long line of questioning
Laura?
Give him what I dictaded persuant to the case.
Here you have all I know about the unlucky girl.
"When she was hired, how we met her, etc."
And...
"I will ask for you to bother me no longer, Mr..."
What did you say your name was?
"Forget it, it is not important."
Show him out.
Thanks.
"I need a secretary just like you, when you wish to resign, know that I await you with open arms, eh."
"I would like to have you as a boss, but I am quite pleased with my current job."
"Good bye, Mr. Dinamo."
I do not like that guy.
"Easy, Pascual, easy."
I am tired of this lack of activity!
"C3, go ahead."

Alex Dinamo is headed your way.
Our stock plus yours controls the voting power.
We'll give you your money on one condition:
That daniel drew is voted out of the erie railroad!
I won't stand that!
You can't do that to me!
We've got to have order here!
"If we're going to come to an agreement, we've got to conduct this meeting in parliamentary fashion."
"Now, all in favor of the basis of settlement as stated by the general- er, colonel-er, well, fisk here-say aye."
Aye!
Aye!
"All opposed, no."
"No, cornele, no!"
The ayes have it.
"Drew, you're a dead goose."
You're out!
You-
jim!
What?
"Say, you're just in time."
Take a look at this rehearsal.
It'll cheer you up.
Take a look at this.
It'll cheer you up.
"What, the stockholders on the warpath?"
What do you expect me to do?
Put on sackcloth and ashes?
"Now, see here, jim, what's got into you?"
We're in for trouble because these fellas mean business.
They're trying to have you indicted for buying this opera house with erie funds.
"Aw, cool off and take a look at the birdies."
"Now, wait a minute, jim."
You can't joke about this.
"When you finally killed him, why didn't you call the police?"
"I wanted to, but I was afraid."
"You hadn't committed any crime, defending yourself."
What was there to fear from the police?
I don't know.
I was just afraid.
You had nothing to fear.
"Until you hid Lucas' body, isn't that right?"
But the moment you buried your stepfather's body you had a great deal to fear.
-That's right.
But you buried him!
You must have had a reason... a powerful reason!
And don't tell it was simply because you were afraid.
-I was!
-Are you sure?
-That is the only reason!
-Fear is panic.
"And clearly burying the remains of a man you just murdered requires cold, careful thought!"
-Objection!
-You knew what you were doing!
-I didn't!
I didn't!
"He's not cross-examining, but harassing the witness."
Objection sustained.
I withdraw the question.
I have nothing further.
Miss Cross... at all times during the quarrel that led to the death of Lucas Cross were you in fear of bodily harm?
"-Yes, I was."
I have no further questions.
You may step down.
I wish to call Miss Allison MacKenzie to stand.
Raise your right hand.
"To dig the earth, Kolya!"
"Come on, help me."
"What's up, Nikolai?"
-ls it here?
-Where?
Next to the dig-out.
He used to be a scout.
"The place is dry here, it looks like a hillock."
-Whom did you bury?
- My dad.
"Well, come on."
"Are you surprised, mayor?"
It means that everything except for the comm point and a fewfiring slots is a mock-up made ofwood.
-A mock-up frontline.
- Exactly.
What about mortars?
Are they made ofwood too?
"No, the mortars, machine-gun slots and cannons are genuine."
"Ifwe considerthe terrain and the water spaces here and there, the firepower is enough... to extinguish a batallion,"
"But not enough to stop the entire offensive, do you mean that?"
What's wrong again?
What are you worried about this time?
There is no such thing as a mock-up frontline.
Ifwe see wood here...
-There must be some metal as well.
- lt is the same thing all over again!
"If ""ifs"" and ""whens"" were pots and pens..."
The offensive here has been confirmed bythe HQ ofthe front and we can not cancel it.
But we'll burythe whole regiment here!
-Do not teach me lessons here!
- l do not.
I've gone through all that before!
- Why not?
- I don't know.
"He said, he wanted to see it coming."
- When?
- While you're out.
- Did he say anything else?
- Like what?
"Like, why he wants to check out so bad?"
- A little.
- Well?
He's....got bad cancer.
It's in my pancreas and spreading.
Going to die and I'd rather not take the scenic route.
"I don't think he has anybody who loves him either, it must be even worse."
We should think about going to his funeral.
"You know, just so there's someone there."
What?
"At the end of the day, Donnie'll send surviving' members of his squad to finish the job either way."
"So if it's not us to finish, it would be somebody else."
"And besides, this guy's dead already!"
"In fact, it's way better if we're the ones to do it."
"Because unlike Donnie's punks, we're not gonna torture him for eight or nine hours first."
Did you hear somethin'?
What happened to you anyway?
You look a little mussed up.
What's with the it chilled?
- This?
- Yea.
I've been deputized.
"- I'm serious, Vi."
- Fine!
I had a little incident while I was out getting the bullets.
- It's a policy we have.
- A policy?
A policy?
That's a damned bad argument.
"If you want to get on in the world, you need to make decisions."
"When you break policies, you show decisiveness."
"Yes, and I think you should go home."
"You stupid, little asshole."
Who do you think you're talking to?
- Run off and get another bottle.
"- Jorgen, we'll go somewhere else."
I'm not the only one that's drunk.
Coming?
I'm sorry.
Empty already?
Those silly little bottles.
- Mother helped too.
- That's good.
"Helene, I would like to have a party on my birthday."
It would be nice.
"Sure, but is one bottle of whiskey each enough?"
"Jorgen, would you please tell me what this is all about?"
I couldn't be bothered.
We're getting up early tomorrow and driving far.
Why won't you let Jacob go home?
You can't just run our lives in your sick head.
Do you know what really doesn't suit you?
- When you feel sorry for yourself.
- Don't talk to me like that.
But I don't understand what you're talking about!
"What have I done wrong, Helene?"
Can't you tell me what I've done wrong?
What do you mean?
We haven't interfered with your business.
"Shuji, you mean you think I had something to do with the hit?"
"Never, never in a million years would I do anything to disrupt our agreement."
Our relationship means everything to me than gold and you know that.
Our relationship means everything to me than gold and you know that.
"Come on, shuji, what do you think I am a fucking idiot?"
What are you trying to say here shuji?
Huh?
"Not me, not my family."
Not anyone who has a future on this fucking earth.
"Someone hires a low life piece of shit that worked for me for five minutes, makes it look like my guys puts you and me in a war together."
It's the last thing I want.
Do you understand?
The last thing.
Mr. tendo will be relieved to hear that.
"Well tell Mr. tendo that he has my full respect, huh?"
One thousand percent.
Thank you.
Any time.
So?
It was him.
Really?
Yes.
Now what?
We eat.
Come on lets go.
Come on.
Wow this is a beautiful house.
I always thought you guys ate on the floor or something.
So how do you like Japanese food?
It's good.
"I got it from another source, then I passed it on."
I should have made that clear in my original statement.
I'm extremely remorseful.
"Right, and who was the other source?"
An old friend from my days on armed robbery.
Terry Capistrano.
And do you have any further information?
"No, sir."
Only that I'm extremely remorseful.
"Well, thank you, DC Morton."
No further questions.
Interview terminated.
Wanker.
"Right, well, I'll check out this name he gave us."
"Oh, well, I wouldn't bother if I were you."
Terry Capistrano got Alzheimer's.
He was retired sick.
The poor bugger's lost his marbles.
Convenient.
"Oh, come off it, Kate."
Nigel's just trying to help.
Can we be sure?
"Look, I know he's a mate and everything, but he's a few months off retirement and, between me and you, his missus hasn't been too well lately."
"Well, I really don't give a shit."
"Look, his heart's in the right place."
"Let's just leave this cock-up behind us, eh?"
Please.
Yeah.
"Well, I suppose I can overlook it."
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"Now we know the Caddy's active again, this time we get the bastard."
"That's it, thanks."
"All right, digger."
How old is he?
A little over a year.
"It can't be anything serious, can it, James?"
It's none of the usual things-- an inverted eyelid or an extra row of lashes rubbing against the eyeball.
"Sometimes, I find him lying in his basket with his eyes half-closed."
"No pain, but there's something wrong."
Nothing shows.
I suppose he might have a long-standing infection in there.
I'll give him some drops.
See how he gets on with those.
"All right, digger."
"Apart from his eyes, he's fit as a fiddle."
Marvelous company when I'm traveling about.
"Get through the work like lighting, don't we, boy?"
"Changed my whole life, this little chap."
Digger.
"Don't worry, Andrew, most of our patients feel that way about the surgery."
Even our own dogs avoid it like the plague.
There we are.
"Thank you, James."
I'm sure I won't have to trouble you again.
Let's hope so.
"Come on, digger."
"Next, please!"
You're an idiot!
An idiot!
"Bad dog, very bad dog."
You're lucky I'm not scooping up the pieces.
Do you realize what a silly animal you are?
Mrs. hall!
"[ Man ] Officer, how can you testify... that Superboy jumped off that bridge when you didn't see him jump?"
"I mean, I'm looking at your statement right here... that you filled out at 0200 hours."
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna object because we went through this.
"[ Lawyer ] Now, he's been up all night."
How many times are you gonna ask the same question?
"Let me ask you another question, brother."
"Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?"
"- What kind of question is that, Lieutenant?"
- Counselor.
"Have you ever been to Garrison, New Jersey?"
- You think those white boys on that bridge--
"- Come on, Lieutenant."
- Please.
I object to this!
"- What do you think this is, Mod Squad?"
- [ Lawyer ] I'm offended by this.
- [ Men Arguing ]
"All right, all right!"
"All right, listen."
"He doesn't tell us what we want to know, he's gonna lose his job."
That's about as simple as I can make it.
He's gonna lose his fuckin'job.
All right?
Do you want that?
What do you take us for?
"A bunch of fuckin' morons, huh?"
- What is the matter with you?
"- With all due respect, I think--"
"- You be quiet, you be quiet!"
Shut up!
- I believe--
Just leave; okay?

MISS GILDER:
"If a man can excavate 10 cubic yards of earth in 6 hours, what can one man excavate in a day?"
Planet earth to Mikey.
So what do you get?
40 cubic yards.
That's very good.
We're gonna do silent study now.
Please turn to chapter 3.
"And Mikey, could you come here for a minute?"
And bring your book.
Do you want to show me what's so interesting in that book of yours?
"Come on, Mikey, give."
It can't be that bad.
What have you done?
I...
I...
NEIL:
"Based on this, you think Mikey has an emotional problem?"
All we're suggesting is that maybe Mikey should see a child psychologist.
Christ!
I made a picture like this when I was kid!
I know.
But we feel that Mikey may be-- just may be-- suffering from an emotional disorder called unattached syndrome.
It's very common in adopted children.
Don't you know anything about his history?
I know Mikey.
"If anything, he's brighter than other kids."
"It's not a question of whether he's bright or not, Rachel."
Most kids don't mutilate their own arms with thumbtacks.
He did what?
I know your apartments are above the offices.
Maybe you still have a room there?
I would like to stay in the place during the night.
Thank you.
Say.
Does your servant live here?
"No, he is married and has children."
He goes home.
"If that's what you want to know, we'll be three in the apartment."
Sir?
Forgive me.
Thank you.
"Philippe, I no longer need you."
You can withdraw.
I really doubt something will happen.
Individuals who threaten us will surely be wary.
I guess that they already know you spend the night here.
My presence here won't prevent them from acting.
I hope that my room will please you.
"I'm sure, but..."
I'm sorry to put you out of your own room.
I did rearrange it with great care.
That I do not doubt.
"My partner got the ceiling and floor screwed, very complicated works, because the room, which was in good condition, was not to his taste."
"It is in a room that one passes half his life, doesn't it?"
It's late.
We will accompany you.
I know the way.
I insist.
"If you need something, I'm in the room in front of yours."
Thank you.
Everything is perfect.
- You don't even belong here!
- Hey!
"I got a few hang-ups of my own, you know!"
"For example, what do you know about welfare?"
Anybody here ever been shafted by welfare?
[Neva] Are you jiving me?
I went through a trip with welfare last summer you wouldn't believe.
"My mother is 65, and she's sick in bed, right?"
"So they ask her to come down for an interview. ""Could you come down for an interview, please?"""
And they treated her like she...
"like she was stickin'her hand out, trying to steal their lousy money!"
"- Man, you got a problem with welfare?"
I'm with you.
"- Hey, wait a minute!"
"What is this welfare business, huh?"
The way you're dressed?
[Laughs] What do you think we're stupid or something?
We're-We're...
We're getting put on here!
[Seymour] You know something?
He might be right.
All right.
Who the hell here has a grudge against a chick by the name of Alice Fisher?
"Hey, who are you, mister?"
"And who in this group hates German cars, underground garages, advertising agencies?"
- And who hates welfare?
"- Please, Lieutenant."
- And who hates marine recruiting officers?
"- [Dr. Benton] No, Lieutenant."
Not here!
- [Panicked Whimpering] - [Woman Screaming]
"[Kojak] Hold it, Zucco!"
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything!
No way.
A guy with just one arm.
We should buy him a barrel organ and give him 2 Mark.
We gotta take care of him!
What use is a one-armed man to us?
What use is a headless man to us?
- Why?
- Because he's starting to make sense.
He just wants to spy on us!
I know what he wants.
I'll test him and take responsibility for his actions.
"Mieze, you gotta look after him!"
They treat him like dirt.
"I'll go and work for him, even if it means playing a barrel organ!"
I know those guys quite well.
You gotta watch out that they won't be a bad influence on him.
Understand?
"Tomorrow evening, right?"
And Biberkopf is really gonna be with us?
Sure!
What's wrong with that?
One bale of cheviot 75-02.
Half a bale of worsted 75-64
One bale of cheviot 75-66
How many bales are missing?
Half a bale of worsted 75-69
Half a bale of worsted 75-98
Just yesterday my wife said to me that this door was unbreakable.
And they came through the roof!
They took excellent english goods!
- I don't date potential employers.
You'll have lunch and a professional conversation.
"If you consider that a date, your social life must be lame."
- It is.
- We're having a baby.
I am trying to be a good mother.
That's what he wants here.
- He has a mother.
"- But she's not here, and I am."
- Why are you leaving?
"- I've had some bad ideas in my life, but thinking I could work here and share an office with you is one of the worst."
How you doing?
"No, I work here now."
I'm not kidding.
"Hey, stud."
Hey!
Whoa.
Blind stud.
I got soap in my eye.
"Sorry, but what you did back there?"
It was incredible.
Sure it was me and not the hormones?
"Oh, it was you, all right."
"Well, I do aim to please."
Good.
Because I'm nowhere near finished with you.
I barely left the house most Sundays.
"My mom would cook elaborate dinners for neighbors, friends and sometimes people we barely knew."
"By ten, I could whip up a perfect meringue, deglaze a pan, truss a chicken."
"But by the time puberty rolled around, I'd had enough."
"Football, friends seemed more important."
So I told her I was done.
"Oh, you pretty things."
That's right - north for about 40 miles.
And then all we gotta do is-
"Oh, if you could only cook."
"Then all we have to do is find the knoll... upon which stands a tree, half-shattered by lightning."
And the cabin.
Near that knoll.
"Gee, I wonder what it's gonna be like... having things instead of wishing for 'em."
Hmm.
Not nearly so much fun.
"You're wrong, Claire."
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.
It's owning something that counts.
Taking it when you can't get it any other way - that's all right too.
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.
"When there's something you need, grab it."
Take it away from the other guy.
It's a good law.
It works.
Nope.
It only works when you deserve to have what you take.
Otherwise it's stealing.
Perhaps that particular commandment isn't respected up here.
They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.
"Well, Noah... that boat manipulating's a little too tough for my delicate constitution... so if you don't mind, sir, I shall go below."
Good night.
"- Night, Shorty."
- Night.
"Good night, dice."
Summer's just around the corner.
Do that come hither thing.
They came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.
Joe's been feeding them.
Now look down.
You see a river of pigeon turd?
Uh... no.
There's barely any.
"It's not weird, it's cheap."
Joe's a guy whlooks for the easy way.
Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.
Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?
You see a shovel or a dustpan?
"Mmm, found a scraper."
Looks used.
Sitting on a bucket.
Bucket full of pigeon crap.
Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.
Yep.
"Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness, and intractable pain."
Let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.
Don't cut corners when you're growing your pot.
See you back home.
I was there.
I should have found it.
"Yeah, you could have saved us a lot of time."
Get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.
I'll start us both.
I was waiting for lab confirmation.
Haven't heard from house yet.
Look at his eeg.
Theta band's been increasing steadily since... since we put him under.
"Guy's unconscious, but still in pain."
-What are you afraid of?
What he will think?
He loves you.
It would ruin his life marry to a girl who...
"Doc, you know not a respectable person in town would accept him."
Respectable!
What kind of respectability are you talking about?
The people with enough money to hire him as a lawyer.
Don't you understand?
We're talking about your whole life!
Prison can be a kind of dying!
Losing Ted would be a worse kind of dying.
"-Besides, you mustn't get involved."
"-Now, never mind about me."
Promise me you won't tell them.
"Promise me, please, promise!"
"All right, Selena."
I'll promise you.
"Selena, you don't seem to realized."
You face a possible life sentence!
-I need much more to work with.
-There is no more.
"Lucas was drunk, brutal."
"When he tried to beat me, I killed him."
Killing in seIf-defense is understandable... but you hid the body and acted like a criminal.
-I know.
-But she was fighting for her life!
The State is sending a prosecutor for one purpose: to convict Selena.
I've seen him work.
"He's competent, relentless as the law itself."
"Yes, tell her to come in."
There must be something you haven't told me.
lt`s not predictable

"So, he can release the power of Flying Fairy"
"At that moment, it seems that there was a flying fairy in the sky lsn`t it illusion caused by air crash , or am I drunk?"
Of course you are drunk
"So, you have drunk much more than me I am drunk everyday lt`s strange, why hasn`t Fat come to work?"
"Brother Fat, where are you?"
We can`t live without you
"Brother Fat, where are you?"
"Hubby, it`s so great!"

Let us name it...
Rescue Force Sigma-17 reporting for duty.
I was not aware rescue teams were... still active.
"Wherever there is an emergency, there are rescue bots, sir."
"Hey, why wouldn't we be active?"
How long were we in stasis?
We better check it with Cybertron H.Q.
That will not be necessary.
Or possible.
Cybertron is no longer our home.
This planet is.

"Hi, mister Harrison!"
I'm OK!
"Cody Burns, Griffin Rock PD."
"Please, pull over."
Figured you wanna say goodbye to the old rust bucket.
It's her last day on the job.
"I still don't understand why the city is making you get a new car, Dad."
- This one works fine.
"- Progress, kiddo."
It wouldn't be high-tech testing ground if we stayed back.
"Give it up, Dad."
"If Cody had his way, we all would be paddling everywhere."
"'Course you'd still be on training wheels, Kade."
The helmet may mess up your hair.
"Quit it, Graham."
Don't forget to be at the dedication this afternoon.
Think I can test-drive the hotty.
"We're getting rescue vehicles, no go-carts."
"Sorry, pal."
For authorised emergency responders only.
"So basically, everyone in the family but me."
- Hey.
- Hi.
I drove by the park earlier.
"You said you were gonna be there with the kids, you know."
And I... stopped and watched you for a minute.
I didn't spot you.
No?
"Well, lucky you're not a detective."
Lucky you're not a comedian.
What d'you think?
About what?
The kids.
"Well, the big one sure knows how to hit a baseball."
"I know, but he's got this hitch in his swing."
He'll never get around on the really fast stuff.
He's like his old man.
Do you know that I'm the first male Felton in five generations to have his original front teeth?
- Thank you for sharing.
- You're welcome.
"Hey, Beau, did you ever take refresher course in interrogation technique that Professor Landriff teaches?"
I'm not much on refresher courses.
"Well, the first day, he writes on the blackboard,"
"""Let the suspect talk."""
"""The interrogation is not about you."""
That's good advice.
"I didn't ask you here to interrogate you, Beau."
Of course not.
"We don't have to try to make the other one say it, we can say it ourselves."
Sure.
It's over between us.
Isn't it?
Yeah.
- No.
I would've gone down for murder.
It was close.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Price."
Good night.
"Hey, Nico."
"Even now, hours after the shooting took place, the entire area surrounding the station has been completely cordoned off."
We have word that the police are actively pursuing the alleged shooter.
"Until an arrest is made, neither his identity nor the identity..."
Did you get a look at the shooter?
Could you just hold me?
Please?
I'm sorry.
I've been crazy with this story.
But it's over now.
It's done.
Is it over for Nico Jackson?
I need you to trust me that nothing happened and that I'm done running around being certifiably insane.
If there's something you don't have... that you're searching for out there...
I want you to find it right here.
There's some music that you need to face.

Promise me you won't tell anyone where I'm hiding.
You can't hide.
But...
You can run?
"What do you say we... change our names, blow this town, start a new adventure?"
I dare you to say that again!
"I'm sorry, Your Highness."
"Mo Pal-Mo, you better get this straight"
"I know His Majesty favours you,"
"But if you spew nonsense like that again,"
You won't stay alive even if you had ten heads to spare.
Am I clear?
!
See!
Didn't I tell you to cut down on drinking?
And?
I heard His Majesty hasn't given his word yet
My Lady
If we don't send out reinforcements
Will the Hans cut off our salt supply?
What are we going to do?
I'm journeying to Go-San Nation
Go-San Nation?
Might it be for the salt?
Yes.
Although the trade problem with Han Dynasty has been solved...
His Majesty's worry has not abated
I would like to handle this problem for His Majesty.
"I know you have good intentions, but I heard from your grandfather,"
No one really knows if Go-San Nation has any salt.
Please don't worry
I've met some people from Go-San Nation at BuYeo City
I have confidence.
Contact the Yeon Ta-Bal merchant fleet
"If possible, look out for any news from Ju-Mong"
"Yes, My Lady."
"The Governor Of Hyeon-To awaits your wise decision, Your Majesty."
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And...
Bring the flower.
"Oh, uh... we can't be in detention together."
I have a restraining order against these tools.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
I'm gonna kill him.
"No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
"You were right, let's kill him."
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
Did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?
M r.
"Krakow, I'm going to tell you about a little legal term."
It's called accessory after the fact.
I don't like accessories after the fact.
I don't want them in my school.
You are going to come to my office today at 3 o'clock...
and you are going to tell me everything you know about...
Rickie Vasquez and anyone else who might be involved in this incident.
"And if you don't, no matter what your grade scores..."
you may not be going to this school much longer.
Do you get my clear intent?
- Yes sir.
- Good.
- What?
- l don't even want to talk to you.
"- Good, then don't."
- Did Rickie have the gun?
Give me a break.
"God, Angela."
"Look, because you don't know the whole situation."
- l just don't want to see him hurt.
- H im hurt?
What about me?
This is the police now.
I have to get kicked out of school for protecting someone I don't know?
Don't ask me?
And this has nothing to do with the truth.
Nobody is interested in the truth.
All they care about is...
- what they want to believe.
Then one day...
Congratulations on your graduation.
It's beautiful.
"Thank you, Kojima-kun."
I even managed to get a kiss.
"Next is, at last, Valentine's day."
Lately we're not selling well.
"Dad, I'm going to be using the kitchen."
- That's the working place of a pro!
"If you're doing things for your hobby, go do it in the kitchen at home."
"Since we don't have any customers, it should be fine, right?"
"Ah, Souta-kun."
Are you making chocolate again?
Should I help?
"- Thanks, Kaoruko-san."
"But I'm making this for my girlfriend,"
I have to do it on my own.
"- Well, I guess."
An adult man making chocolate for a woman.
"After asking to go to a confectionary school, then making things that won't even be for sale, it's hard to bear as a parent."
Then we should put them up for sale.
- Eh?
Souta-kun's chocolates.
"The prototypes from the other day were high quality, with a delicate impression."
I think it's on a higher level than the chocolatiers around here.
Really?
Thanks.
That's thanks to my DNA.
DNA?
"DNA, he says."
Alright.
"But, well, there really aren't many guys who make chocolates for their girlfriends."
"Oh, dear, oh, dear."
"There you are, the senior partner's lot-- disobedience and insubordination."
James?
- What?
"Oh, sorry."
You're looking despondent.
"Not ailing, are you?"
I do feel a bit under the weather.
"Touch of flu, perhaps?"
- No.
Or is it melancholy-- a feeling of mea culpa?
What do you mean?
- Paul cotterell?
"Don't explode, James."
"I know how reticent you are about private matters, but it is Paul's death that's troubling you, isn't it?"
Yes.
"- You can't carry the burdens of the world, especially not a world that's tearing itself apart like ours is."
"He was in despair after I put his dog down, and I can't help feeling that's why he took his own life."
You've got to accept it.
He was a very sick man.
"Come on, snap out of it, or do you want me to get Helen to sort you out?"
"Oh, no, thanks."
That is more than I can take.
Ah-choo!
- Aha!
"Our seasonal friend, I'll hazard."
You hazard away.
"This winter, I stay germ-free."
I'm off on my visits.
"Likewise, me to surgery."
"Wrap up warm, James, and..."
"Stay away from the cold, empty place..."
"Well, so much for not forcing our gunman's hand."
Just when I thought things couldn't get any more interesting.
You have no idea.
Tony's dad is on that London flight.
Come on.
Figure it out.
Who's the target on the plane?
Who's the hit man?
Let's talk possible hit people first.
We have a Joseph McBride.
"He's 49, from Springfield, Virginia."
He's a lobbyist for a chemical company.
Next.
"Ruth Potts, 62, Fairfax, retired schoolteacher, who wouldn't hurt a fly, obviously."
Just look at that sweet lady.
Next.
Thanks.
"Boss, I got 'em."
Manifests for 17 different inbound flights arriving to Dulles tonight.
"Okay, divvy 'em up."
Deal me in as well.
We are looking for a target significant enough to warrant killing a federal air marshal.
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the extended delay,"
TSA is now required to perform a second routine screening.
"We apologize for any inconvenience, but we'll begin with Calgary flight 3184."
"If those passengers could calmly line up over there, please?"
Thank you.
"TSA isn't saying anything about landing order, Gibbs."
"They're all low on fuel, so... it's first come, first serve."
"Stay alert, Bishop."
We're watching.
Okay.
Tse-tse fly can kill you.
What?
Just drinking coffee.
To what do I owe this honor?
- Is this a bad time?
"- No, I just really need to sit down."
Much better...
Do you see a clean towel over there?
- Honestly...
Not really.
- Never mind.
What's up?
I wanna say thank you for what you did for us at the...
- carnival.
- I go where I'm needed.
That's what makes me superhero.
I know I haven't really been that super to you in the past.
"Are you in some kind of 12-step program, or something?"
"Unless they started a one for idiots, who, stripted their lavaliere and are having a hard time getting over it."
I can give you some pointers there.
Not that I've had ex boyfriends.
"What I wanna say, Cap', is that I'm hoping you and I can... start over."
Be friends.
"We've definitely tried the other thing, right?"
"With a lot of fun, but not much success."
"Friend Cappie, at your service."
Thank you.
What don't you tell me what you really came here for?
- Why do you assume...
"- Cause even though we're startin' over, we're not really."
I know you.
Fair enough.
- Where are the movies?
- They're getting away.
- Somebody get a rope!
- Let's season 'em!
- Have we crossed into enemy territory?
- I hope so.
- Where the hell is Klinger?
- At last.
A friendly face.
I knew this would happen.
Klinger would be back with our cosmetics by now... if you hadn't sent him off on a wild-fish chase!
You've completely destroyed the morale in this camp.
Let me know if that crowd gets out of control so I can go out there and egg 'em on.
- I take it you haven't heard from Klinger.
"- No, but I'm sure... we'll get a postcard from Toledo any day now."
"Oh, come on, Colonel."
Just 'cause he's a little late?
You call it late.
I call it permanently skedaddled.
How could you three-day suckers give Klinger a blank pass?
That's like the warden asking Willie Sutton to lock up the hoosegow.
"- Colonel, you're just jumping to conclusions."
"- Well,jump on this."
He took his footlocker with him.
Ayear's change of duds to go with his change of scenery.

- You idiots!

The only way to get past it is to erase Aaron.
"What do you mean,"
"""We're going to erase Aaron?"""
"When they put me through Everclear, they'll find out about everyone."
"Roger, Elena, you."
I need to map out my brain and lock all those memories away.
Away?
Away where?
Here.
This is an imprint of my current neural map.
"Once I pass Everclear,"
I need you to connect this to the base of my skull to bring me back.
You'll only have a few days to do it or Aaron will be gone for good.
If that thing doesn't lobotomize you completely first.
I'm just temporarily disconnecting some circuits.
Aaron isn't a circuit.
It's who you are.
But he's not who I need to be right now.
This is gonna sting.
[device beeping]
Strap me in.
[soft dramatic music]
So now what?
"Just, uh, flip a switch and say, ""Bye, bye, Aaron."""
Either that or this thing turns me into a vegetable.
Relax.
It knows exactly which memories to sever.
Then my brain will fill the gaps with the cover story I'm using.
The lie becomes the truth.
At least that's the idea.

"- Look, you goat."
- I beg your pardon?
"I mean, have you no conscience?"
Conscience?
No conscience.
"That's why you walk and whistle, lost your cap and don't give a thistle."
"You know, I've never understood those metaphors of yours."
"So you, the bandit, don't give a damn about your daughter, right?"
This is too serious a subject.
We'd better leave it for later.
"For now, let me take some things that are precious to me."
So you've come for precious things!
Not in the sense you mean.
Precious in the spiritual sense of the word.
- You'll do without.
- What do you mean?
Come when Nina's here.
You mean when the she-goat's here?
"Please don't misunderstand me, but if, as you put it, I'm a goat, then, naturally, my wife is a she-goat."
Oh boy!
"- Shut your mouth, Sergeant!"
"- Go find a medic, Jimmy."
"Bring morphine, I'll take the responsibility."
Him?
He's Italian!
"That's an American soldier there, Captain!"
"Now listen, Sergeant!"
That man is a Captain with more experience than either of us.
We're going to do what he says.
and follow his orders.
I'll take full responsibility!
"We have to distract him, to do something... so he doesn't realize he's dying."
There's only one thing we can do.
"Listen idiot, if you're wrong about this... if that doctor doesn't come..."
"I'll rip your guts out just like his, got that?"
Now hurry it up.
"Well now Prewitt, you're lucky."
You're going home...
Just wet his lips.
"You know, I always thought you were lucky..."
"Prewitt, but this was surprising."
The ambulance will be here in a few minutes.
A few days with pretty nurses bending over in front of you... and resting their tits on your shoulder... and then you're on a plane headed to the USA.
"Isn't that right, Kaminsky?"
"Keep talking, Sergeant."
Leave that idiot here.
He's stuck in this stinking country.
"-Não é, amigo?"
"-É, goma de mascar!"
- Guido!
- Yankee!
Fag.
- Won't pick up.
"Kid's pink, sat's fine."
24 gauge going on in the right.
"You want me to take this, Kerry?"
I don't mind.
"What, you think I'm rusty?"
"Superficial head lacs, no step-offs, left frontal-parietal hematoma."
Call CT and let them know we need a head.
Finally calming down.
Or going apnic.
"Come on, baby."
Wake up.
Wake up.
"All right, uh, Inez, miller one and a 4-O."
She needs a tube.
"Kerry, the kid's screaming."
The airway is obviously fine.
She's got a good mechanism for a head injury and she needs a CT.
"So what you're going to subject her to the risks of intubation, just to make it easier for the radiologist?"
- She'll settle down.
Give her some time.
- She doesn't have time.
Agitation could be an early sign of head injury.
Or an appropriate response to a stressful situation.
Babies cry when they're scared.
"Thank you, but this is my patient."
Her mental status is waxing and waning.
She could go apnic in the scanner.
You bag her through it.

Hold on.
You're going to lose your neuro exam if you sedate.
He was not in his sense!
As if he was mad!
Because of his wifes death!
"Krishna, no one knows where Mr. Kumar is!"
But its really nice to see you back.
I am carrying a burden on my mind!
Now I am really relieved!
"But Mr. NagpaI, how did this happen to you?"
"Yourwife has died, your daughter became widow."
And I started suffering from cancer!
What?
This is how a sinner repays his sins!
The fire that started in your bosss factory was not accidental!
"Krishna, I have started that fire because.."
..Dhanraj paid me to do so!
I had started that fire!
Dhanraj!
"Airport, now we have to play a new role in our life."
We have to meet every one of sirs enemies!
With new avatar and a new identity!
"Yeah, we have to revenge sir and sister-in-Iaw!"
We have to revenge the injustice that happened to them!
And we swearthat unless and until we..
"..bosss destruction, we will not think about anything else."
Brother Ravi!
Brother Ravi!
"What is it, Vicky?"
Why are you shouting?
You wiIIjump forjoy once I will let you know the news!
"Brother, exporter has come with orders.."
..worth crores of rupees!
If we can get our hands on one order..
How's your arm?
"(DISTORTED) You think, because you tasted my blood, that you know what I am."
"Well, to be fair, I am standing in your flat."
You don't know what I am.
- And you don't know where I am.
- Where are you?
Everywhere!
I can walk down any street.
I can peer...
"- He's close, less than a mile."
- I can knock on any door.
I am the shape at the window.
I am the hand under the bed.
"So what's the play, Cameron?"
"Cos that's what it is, isn't it?"
It's a play.
With Cameron Pell starring as Mr Punch.
Do you know anything about this city?
"Well, I know that it smells a bit funny when it gets hot."
"This, now, everything, this place, this time, this cretinised culture."
"- We are the richest, most decadent..."
- Less than three minutes.
...people that ever lived.
And still we're dissatisfied.
We have lost our history.
We have lost our myths.
"You see, kids in Whitechapel play video games in which they score points by killing prostitutes."
(SIREN BLARES)
They're totally indifferent to the spectre that walks past their window.
(SIREN BLARES)
This is a dead city.
- It's an unreal city.
"Yeah, I know."
I forgot.
She wanted to talk about the vacation.
"She wanted to know, was it, ""Like the usual?"""
This was my daughter who called or my wife?
Your daughter.
"Okay, I'll call her back."
Yes?
All that glucose...
Yes?
Worries me.
I can examine you if you want.
I'm a doctor.
"All right... what can I do for you, Dr. Kay?"
"You work at St. Louis, right?"
I don't know if I'm the right...
"Nathan, I believe you have misunderstood me."
I'm very serious.
You mustn't take hypoglycemia lightly.
"In fact, you shouldn't take any symptom lightly... ever."
You can't imagine the number of cells you burn up every day.
"Of course, you'll tell me you're also manufacturing..."
- I don't want to interrupt...
- But it's not so.
Neurons can't be replaced.
Some die every day.
Every day a few more.
All that glucose you're pumping in is just cheap energy.
"Very bad for you, very bad for the neurons."
"Thank you for your concern about my health, but I'm fine."
Now why don't you tell me what you want from me?
"That slight shaking in your hands, have you had that a long time?"
- You're gonna take us all out for American food?
"- Close, but wrong."
We'll bring America here.
We'll have a beach party.
"Big fire, blankets, singing."
"Huge, boiling kettle full of lobsters, crabs, clams, whatever they've got."
"Hawkeye, I don't see a whole lot of lifeguards around here."
"Yeah, well you would if this was Inchon."
"And where's there sea, there's gotta be seafood, Mama."
Hah!
What do you think?
What do you think?
Does that sound fantastic?
- That really sounds stupid.
- But is it possible?
- Of course.
The stupid is always possible.
- Great.
Can you leave right away?
Me?
You want me to drive halfway across Korea... on treacherous roads over hostile terrain?
"I don't want my Purple Heart to read, ""He gave his life for crabs."""
"Klinger, the future of the whole camp depends on this."
- Not to mention our lives.
- Aha!
"Your wanting me in the driver's seat certainly puts me in the driver's seat... for, say, a three-day pass?"
- Thief!
"- ""Thief"" is such an ugly word."
"Shall we say ""entrepreneur""?"
"Sign here, Prince."
I'll fill in the date after I decide on one.
"This is blackmail, and I won't stand for it."
- Erode.
So she has been is caught in our radar!
Her name is neither Deepa nor Ashwini.
It is Vasundhara.
Her native is Trichy.
She worked in a jewellery shop there.
She duplicated the jewels that don't sell...
And stole the original.
She was caught red-handed one day.
"From the May of 2013 to the November of 2013, she was imprisoned at Trichy Jail."
Her father is no more.
Her mother passed away when she was in prison.
Any relatives?
"One maternal uncle, Ravi."
Do you want to see who that is?
Look.
So it's a well-planned and executed ordeal.
But the mastermind behind all of this is
Vasundhara.
"I am not able to, Vikram."
You know that my parents are no more.
My brother is all I have.
Why does he have all these problems!
You could have told me in advance.
Never-ending problems...
Hospital atmosphere...
Smell of medicines...
"Amidst all of this, the happiness that I have left is when I'm away from all these."
and spend some time with you.
Do you want to me to cry that time also?
What do doctors have to say?
"Before the tumor grows further, a liver transplant has to be done."
The refinery is a bit further down there.
"- Come on, let's get away from here!"
- Come on!
Go back or the whole depot will blow up!
The train has to get away from here.
Go back!
"First, we have to get out of here."
- We must get away as fast as possible.
- Yes.
"Out of the way, damn it!"
We must get away from the fuel depot as quickly as possible.
Hurry!
See if you can find something to force it open.
We can get out through there.
"It's really incredible that you got out, Padre."
"Come on, let's go."
Almost a miracle.
"Come on, hurry up, everybody!"
Gómez has the situation in the north under control.
This time the bastard won't slip through our fingers.
This time I'll get him.
"This is where he was last seen, and this is where we will wait for him."
Are you listening?
What's the matter?
Carrasco's trapped.
He doesn't stand a chance now.
He made a mistake.
He is forced to cross the Cañonda Sierra.
He's finished.
"Luck will be with you, as long as I'm with you."
I shall leave no stone unturned to try and keep you in power.
Everything's quiet here.
"Lose the judge-face, Zoe."
He took a very heavy course load this semester.
"Jenny Humphrey, drug dealer."
I can work with that.
We hear Blair Waldorf's headed for a comeback.
But if she wants to keep her fans happy...
Send.
She better keep serving up the hits.
Sleep well?
"Don't even, Serena."
"I can't believe you posted on ""Gossip Girl"""
That I'm a drug dealer.
I didn't post anything.
Fine.
"Maybe you didn't send the actual e-mail,"
But everyone knows you have Blair do your dirty work.
I can't help what Blair does.
And you are the one who played Pablo Escobar
To underage preppy pill poppers.
My dad and I were finally in a good place
"After a really, really bad patch."
"And if he finds this out, it'll destroy everything."
"Well, maybe Rufus should know"
That his daughter is dealing drugs.
"After all, you thought my father should know"
All my adventures at boarding school.
Fine.
"Maybe I shouldn't have said anything,"
But maybe you shouldn't be lying to your dad.
Are you really lecturing me about lying to a parent?
"My dad knows who I am,"
But you're building a relationship with yours
Read that.
"You know, I'd like to say something big and brave right now but.."
I can't think of a thing.
How about this?
(Patricia) 'You may be down but not out.'
Sharp one.
Well.
"There's, um.."
"""They think they have me licked, but I'll show 'em."""
Here's one.
"""In the fell clutch of circumstance"
"""I have not winced nor cried aloud."
"""Under the bludgeonings of fate my head is bloody, but unbowed."""
Magnificent!
"You display a bit of histrionic talent there, my boy."
You should have been an actor.
"Of course, I perform best in my native surroundings."
"- You know, the open fields."
"- Oh, I hate the country."
- I'm afraid of wild flowers.
- Yes.
I've heard that one.
"Tell me, were you ever born in a big white house surrounded by a high green hedge?"
"With an orchard, a patch of woods and a natural spring."
- 'Yes.'
- No.
What?
No big house with little thatches growing all around it?
There's nothing like going out in the morning and picking yourself a nice fresh bunch of thatches.
"Boy, am I glad I got rid of that house."
"And now, you haven't a care in the world."
No.
Shoot him.
I've got a gun in my desk.
Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and then give the bastard everything he wanted.
I'm not here for foreman.
I'm here to save myself.
"Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim."
That's why you're wearing the suit.
You wanted to be here.
He just gave you the excuse.
What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?
Give me the bag.
Mildewed dish towel.
- To retest for staph.
"What is that, mouse droppings?"
Hamster droppings.
Could carry toxocara.
Explain the blindness.
"Now, that I recognize as oven crud."
Could be meat with trichinella.
Would explain the high fever.
What's with rye bread?
"Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning, which would explain the contractures."
There are three loaves.
- So?
You're going back in there.
Guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.
That's looking too far into the future.
Unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
You on the roof yet?
"Yeah, I'm here."
I don't see any birds.
Whistle or something.
"I guess I always thought it was about human limitation, both mental and physical."
"Okay, that..."
that just blew my face off.
"Well, I hope that helps."
It does.
"Thank you so much, Miss Murray."
This has been terrific.
"Hey, uh, before we go, do you mind if I use your restroom?"
It was a long drive up here.
"No, go right ahead."
We should do something without him sometime.
Do you like tapas?
Someone invited me out for that once.
"I thought they said topless, so I was like,"
(high-pitch): what?
That's a good story.
"Hey, you know, that was really cool how you told us what ""Snowbird"" was about."
"Well, you know, that's just the way"
I always interpreted the song.
But I suppose Gene probably could have explained it better than I.
Who's Gene?
Gene MacLellan.
He wrote the song.
I see.
"But you wrote all your other songs, right?"
"No, all of my songs were written by other people."
"As a singer, I've been blessed to interpret the works of many gifted, sensitive songwriters."
Oh.
"So, you're just a big (bleep) liar?"
Sit back down.
"All right, come on, Stewie, let's go home... (muffled grunts)"
"Stewie, what the hell are you doing?"
The image of them having sex was so strong it kept recurring.
I wanted to fight it off.
"I read books, filled up volumes of my journal, but I couldn't overcome it."
I nearly wanted to go to a mental hospital everyday.
"Rationally, I knew I was a hopeless fool."
But I kept having a dirty feeling.
"She had a really hard time, too."
For several years.
I'm afraid you'll go through the same thing.
"I like you very, very much, but why'd you sleep with a foreigner, stupid?"
It's too strong of an image to overcome.
I'm afraid I'll go through that once again.
I don't think I could take it again.
"Hello, did you have breakfast?"
Not yet.
Did you?
"Yes, we did."
Would you like to have some bean sprout soup?
It's so easy to make.
We have all the ingredients.
Sounds good.
"But, my friend's here with me."
We're going to take a look around for a bit.
"Okay, then, see you later."
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Why are you two so close?
"Oh, I interviewed her yesterday."
I did it for my script.
We had a drink afterwards.
Enough.
Don't say more.
"Tom, what do I do now?"
Frankie.
You were always interested in politics and history.
I remember you talking about Hitler back in '33.
"Yeah, I still read a lot."
I get good stuff in there.
"You were around the old-timers, who built the organization of the families, basing them on the old Roman legions, with ""regimes,"" ""capos"" and ""soldiers""."
-And it worked.
"-Yeah, it worked."
"Those were the great old days, you know."
We was like the Roman Empire.
The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
"Yeah, it was once."
Frankie.
When a plot against the Emperor failed the plotters were always given a chance
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?
Only the rich guys.
The little guys got knocked off and all their estates went to the Emperors.
"Unless they went home and killed themselves, then nothing happened."
And their families were taken care of.
"That was a good break, a nice deal."
Yeah.
They went home and sat in a hot bath opened up their veins and bled to death.
And sometimes they had a little party before they did it.
"Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels."
"Thanks, Tom."
Thanks.
"-See you, Tom."
"-Addio, Frankie."
Kay.
You have to go.
"The idea is to keep girl from leaving, not drive them away."
Frannie'd have found a way around this.
"Let's play ""What would Frannie do?"""
Go with me girl.
She'd make Lizzi cry.
And?
Tie her up and put her on a basement somewhere.
I don't know.
- The Kappa Taus have a basement.
"- Buffalo Bill, let's put a pin in that."
Wait...
- You have an idea?
- Yeah.
You just have got to be the #1 weapon on the fight for abstinence.
I thought you enjoyed being ravaged by me in super places.
It's like we're secret sex spies.
I say we remove cars from our list of spy places.
"We're running out of places, library, aiport,"
- that church.
- We'll be more creative for the future.
You believe we have a future together.
Hypothetically.
"In a world where there's no Casey, you're a one-woman men and people don't gossip."
"Miss Logan, I'm surprised you worry about such things."
I don't.
But maybe you do.
You're not contradicting me.
Which is why secret sex is so appealing right now.
No complications.
Get out.
I have class and we can't be seen together.
It'll blow our cover.
"Yes, it would be a pleasure, mademoiselle."
You are in danger?
"It's against all my instincts, but the man persists."
"And with the hotel being so empty, there's a great danger of my getting stuck for the rest of the holiday."
[ Chuckles ]
"Ah, the galloping Major Barnes."
"Here for the fishing, he tells me."
Ah.
The behavior of the English abroad is something I have always found peculiar.
[ Both chuckle ]
"At least he's not a bottom-pincher, Mr. Poirot."
[ Conversing in Italian ]
[ Laughter ]
"Look at them -- troublemakers, always looking for a fight."
Perhaps.
"But for me, the English is more cold-blooded."
His violence is more calculated.
"We've spent all day at sea, and my wife's exhausted, so let's get to the hotel as fast as possible, with our luggage intact."
Make sure it's secure and stay close behind the other car.
"Excuse me, but aren't these the cars from the Palace Hotel?"
Yes.
Well?
"Well, we're staying there, too, you know."
"Well, you'll have to wait for them to come back."
"The hotel, please, driver."
And try not to hit anything.
"Come on, darling."
Thank you.

They took a cast to Aberdeen Proving Ground and shot a missile through it.
They showed me video.
What can I do for you?
"Sir, there's something very important we need to talk to you about."
What?
"Well, it's delicate and surprising and I wanna make sure your first reaction is measured, so I'd like us to..."
I'm a recovering alcoholic.
- Really?
"- Yes, sir."
- Is there anybody left who's not?
- Sir...
- For how long?
- I'm sorry?
- How long have you been in recovery?
- My last drink it was the year I was 22.
- Did you say 22?
"- Yes, sir."
- You haven't had a drink since 22?
- That's right.
- I didn't start drinking till I was 25.
- What the hell do you guys count...
"- There's a history in my family, and I had a few experiences in college."
I liked beer a lot.
So I started going to meetings.
- I'm pretty sure if I stopped...
- Twenty-two?
"- Yes, sir."
- You and James Bond ought to team up.
- I don't... .
- Don't worry.
"He's ordering a watered-down martini, and Leo, what is this meeting going on across the hall?"
- We can talk about it later.
"Look, you guys need a division title and my man will deliver like Amazon, all right?"
"He's got breakaway speed, durability out the ass."
He will finally put your offense over the top.
I think you might be right.
- Can I see him work out?
- Absolutely.
"I'm gonna coordinate that with you, Charles."
"- Thank you, Larry."
- Larry:
Don't mention it.
"Sorry, babe, we gotta stick a pin in brunch."
Fuck me and not feed me?
Fuck you.
We'll eat quick.
"Come on, I want stone crabs."
I don't get it.
Jason just said the same thing I did.
"He said it better, Charles."
Be grateful.
"You may not have got it the way you wanted it, but you got it nonetheless."
Now go coordinate.

"Hey, I'm seeing you at the stable in 30, right?"
"Yeah, listen, Wayne, I just have to push that back by a few, okay?"
"Hey, Reggie, put Vernon on the phone, please?"

- Just a few hours.
I must happen through the clinic.
Tomorrow Ciotti will visit in a moment.
"Ciotti, Ciotti."
You are engaged with him or me?
"Laura, you are a girl."
You do not understand it?
"If profit to enter in the clinic of Ciotti, you know what means for me?"
"Yes, that you have the resolute life."
You have often said it to me?
and I?
"Laura, listens, first of everything, I will say to you that..."
Help.
The new car has been stolen.
No longer it is.
It is not...
Where it is?
I want a x-ray of those of kidneys of that old man that is on the verge of dying.
To thus I will operate him immediately.
Also we must make the analyses of the 22...
"It excuses the delay, but I have had to happen by the deposit to gather the car, it already includes/understands to me, the crane had taken to it and..."
What wants that they concern his subjects to me?
It seems to me just.
To where we go?
"Oh, the one of the hemorroides?"
how is everything?
"-Professor, hurts eggs to me."
-Those are cut easily.
"-No, I need still them."
-In the other world.
"Oh, dear Sandokan?"
how is everything?
Badly.
Suppose we take a little drive this afternoon and make further inquiries.
- I guess we'll learn something.
"- Hello, hello!"
How are you today?
Why did you run away?
- Sorry.
I don't think we've met.
- Nonsense.
Of course.
- You spent last night with me.
- This lady says she doesn't know you.
"Yes, she does."
You mustn't forget old friends so soon.
Most unflattering.
I haven't the slightest idea who you are.
You can't have forgotten Brighton and my brother.
- Never been to Brighton.
"- Well, makes us even."
I haven't a brother.
You're evidently making a mistake.
This lady spent last night with her aunt.
Don't you think you ought to apologize and leave us?
"Well, if that's the way you see it, I'll toddle off and give it thought."
"I say, what's that dreadful thing you're playing?"
"- They call it ""The March of the Hussars. """
- Nothing like it.
"It so happens, my bovine friend, that ""The March of the Hussars"" is my favorite piece of music."
"I know every note of it, and you haven't played one of them."
"Well, how does it go then?"
Those are the drums.
Play it.
Those are the trumpets.
By the way did you make some agreement with the car back there?
of course...
That's because they're my friends.

I don't know where you're from but it's way too early in the morning to be fighting.

One of the special agents of the Arcam Foundation which protects dangerous ruins of extremely ancient civilizations.
He has rare physical abilities and reflexes... his true potential is number one in the organization.
His true potential really isn't that much.
Ominae's cheap tricks won't have any effect on me.
I heard your unit was cruelly betrayed by him before.
Where is he now?
we lost him after the attack.
No matter.
I know he'll be coming here after all.
Arcam is just a private foundation...
I'll make this mountain his grave.
Colonel Macdougal?
That's the mountain.
It's one of Arcam's.
Hey!
Damn!
Why are you so quick to start shooting?
How long are you going to walk me around like this?
keep your mouth shut.
But it's like I've been telling you...
No one from Arcam dresses like that.
I couldn't help it!

"I've never really watched it before, but I got quite into it."
"I was quite scared and horny, if I'm honest."
It's something very primal going on.
"Rob, you were..."
You made this documentary about the fight.
Or just pre the fight.
And you got to spar with a former middleweight champion.
Oh...
If only there were a clip of that(!
)
So...
"Can I just say, he's an ex-world champion, and I'm not!"
I don't think you needed to say that.
"When you watch it, just remember Rob is not a professional boxer."
Have a little look.
Aw...
Hands up!
You need waking up!
Oh!
"I have to say, Rose, I'm a little confused."
A little disappointed.
Everything was going so well.
"At least, I thought so."
Didn't you?
Is that the truth or some kind of female manipulation?
Tell me the truth.
"You knew the arrangement, how I felt."
Did you think that would change?
Why?
"I hoped, though I made the offer, you'd see there was no need for it."
I'd hoped that we'd gone beyond it.
Did you honestly think this was the next step?
What we have usually comes after all this nonsense is over.
Most people never get to where we are.
They try to keep the sex going.
Or find another.
"Our relationship works, because it isn't physical."
I took every precaution to make sure there was no physical attraction!
"Rose, I'm sorry."
I've never had this with a woman before.
I can share everything with you.
Are you not satisfied with me?
Maybe this is something we have to struggle through together.
Maybe this tour is coming at a good time.
Maybe we can use the distance.
Don't you think?
I thought we were good friends.
"Talk to me, Rose."
Let me in.
I'm sorry.
Now this truck contains somethin' in addition to just cologne.
- Somethin' like what?
- A bag full of money.
"The weird part, is the guy called us up... and had the stones to taunt us after he did what he did."
- Stones...
- Or some kind of a death wish.
Cos he all gave us his address.
"His name and number, was clear as day the whole time he was fuckin' with us."
Culpepper lives about three blocks from this dude.
She's checked him out.
"Says he leaves in the morning, comes back in the afternoon."
"When he comes home, you'll be waiting for him."
And that's that.
"The landlord's on our team, so the door will be open."
- Better be.
"- Relax, the door will be open."
And you don't have to worry about the noise either.
- Why not?
- The building's almost empty.
Switching over the condos or some kinda gentrificational kind of shit.
"You sure this guy was working alone, Russ?"
Pretty sure!
Landlord said the guy's a loner.
This happens tomorrow.
- Can you handle it?
- 'Course we can handle it.
You got the specs?
Now we good?
"Yeah, we good."
"Come on, Daze."
Hey you guys hear about Barbie Sunday's new dress?
- Yea we know.
"Andres did not agree, but I insisted."
I had to know.
what madness!
"In any case, it has helped, I am now covinced it was not his imagination, he was telling the truth."
It seems his madness is contagious.
"We will soon know if its truly madness, Ricardo."
Tomorrow we will dive again.
I do not want to have a single doubt.
I will go along.
What your are doing makes no sense.
Go on holiday and forget about all this.
You would like to see me in an insane asylum.
I am not insane.
"And if you have come for that, you could have spared yourself the trip."
You are wasting our time.
Is it that you don't realize that you're risking angelica's life?
So...
That's what it is?
I hope nothing happens to her.
I doubt you will overcome this madness anytime soon.
Can you tell me why you tossed the tank and the harpoon?
"Protection, in case..."
In case of necessity.
I understand.
Andres...
"God Dammit, I don't like this."
"Here, take this."
"What is it that you are doing, Andres?"
I have to help Angelica.
Don't move.
"And you, drop that gun."
"Once again we meet,eh."
Just start looking.
Will you guys listen to yourselves?
All right.
"Come on out, Mr."
"I know you're fucking in here in the walls or something, laughing your ass off!"
The jig's up!
"Come on out, asshole!"
WOMAN:
I don't think he's going to answer.
Why?
"""November 27."
Results today:
Positive function.
The machine continues to work perfectly.
"However, I've seen something in the future that is disturbing to my core."
I believe I've seen my death.
I know the cardinal rule of time and causality... is that one should not attempt to change the future.
"But under these circumstances, it seems to be a risk worth taking."
"If I believed in God,"
"I would pray today that no greater harm will come from what I'm about to do."""
Then what?
Nothing.
"That's the last entry, a week ago today."
A week ago.
Seven photos.
That means it was kicking it out after he disappeared.
So it must be on a timer.
8200 PM.
Then why are there so many daytime ones?
Maybe it's only been taking ones at night for the last week.
All right.
Even I have to admit this photo is a little fucking unsettling.
Keep it to yourself till you die.
For me.
Should I not say it?
What's wrong?
It's no crime to date them...
Changwook will not take this well.
- Did you date them?
- Yes.
How many?
I've had maybe two or three serious ones.
- That's quite a lot.
- I told you not to say anything!
I was lonely.
"Yeah, they love Asian women."
They just go crazy about them.
Even if the women are ugly.
It's not necessarily like that.
But there's a premium if they go there.
Not many Asian women in Europe.
Western men have a fantasy about them.
Many Korean men seem to think so.
"Frankly, it's rather a disgrace."
Unpopular women here are considered pretty over there.
Don't you think it's a disgrace?
"Well, that's not how I feel."
Look here.
It's a person meeting another.
It's not like what you said.
"Oh, you might think that I have an inferiority complex about my dick size compared to Western men, but that's not it."
"You have to live where you were born, whether you're ugly or not."
Why do unpopular girls here go over there to live comfortably?
That's really not cool!
They mustn't get away.
"Come on, we must get to the other side."
Step on the gas!
"Ah, yes, thank you."
I'm glad I can show you our problems on the spot.
- We've just received this radio message.
"- OK, thank you."
"Gentlemen, perhaps we should propose a toast to our president Ramírez."
May our relations always remain as positive as they have been thus far.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Thank you.
...images of the plane that was shot down as it was approaching the runway.
"There were 185 children aboard the plane, who were on their way home."
Both the children and the crew died.
Enrique Carrasco is held responsible for the attack.
He was seen at the airport at the time of the attack.
/t seems certain that he committed this inhuman crime...
- What do you think about this?
- We didn't catch Carrasco.
He escaped.
No one who has seen these images will help him.
He's finished.
- It's got stuck in the tree.
"- Come on, let's climb up."
- I've got it!
I've got it!
- Come down and show it to us.
Show it to us.
What does it say on this piece of paper?
Nothing important.
They're asking the guerrilleros to surrender.
"Not for sale, not even for display."
This guy operates in a vacuum.
Which speaks to the intensely private nature of his obsession.
Mineral analysis just came in on the hourglass sand.
Also from upstate New York?
"No, it's local."
Most likely from the Platte River.
"What's the matter, Sergeant?"
It's what they found next to him in the sand.
Human bone and tooth enamel.
"Please, don't hurt me."
Please.
- Hello.
- Hi there.
"Uh, I was trying to call Hotch, but it kept going to voicemail."
He's still at the hospital with JJ.
What's going on?
"Ok, I did what man chocolate asked."
I got this list.
"There are certain things that should never exist, and one of those is this depressingly long list."
Does anything specific jump out at you?
"Aside from the horribleness of it all, no."
"You know, send me all the police, hospital, and child services transcripts associated with the cases."
Everything on all of them?
"Yeah, I'll print out hard copies here."
Ok.
"You're gonna need a forklift, and I hope you're using recyclable paper, but..."
On its way.
All right.
"Thank you so much, Garcia."
Why are you doing this?
I never did anything to you.
"""Said they didn't know when he'd be in,"
"""and I was wondering"
"""if anybody here had any idea where he would be."""
A man on a routine check...
STAGEHAND:
"Your chair, sir."
...just asks for Mr. Daley.
Thank you.
(CHUCKLING)
"Well, you're absolutely amazing, sir."
You're right.
And here I thought you were in shock.
"No, you didn't."
You thought I was confused.
Perhaps scared.
And probably playing for time.
Amazing.
What makes you think her murder was premeditated?
"The usual thing, sir."
"Little facts that plain don't fit, you know, sir."
"Anything I hate, it's one of those little facts."
"Doesrt ever seem to matter how small it is, either, sir."
It could be this big.
Like he left the credit cards behind.
"I mean, why does a street robber grab money from a wallet and leave the credit cards?"
They're won'th a pretty good piece of change on the black market.
"You see what I mean, sir?"
Credit cards.
What else?
"Oh, there was an alligator bag."
A diamond ring.
"I doubt very much if a robber in a hurry, on the edge of panic, is gonna take the time to pull the ring off of Claire's finger."
"Well, you know, ma'am, that's one of the strange things."
"Uh, actually I was on night duty when it happened."
And I was there when they remove your brother.
"Uh, he was working under the hood,"
"Apparently, when the car jumped out of gear."
Well?
Is there something else?
You're looking at me like you expect me to say something.
"I'm sorry, ma'am."
It's just that I was wondering if you knew where the battery
Is on your brother's car.
"Under the hood, I guess."
Isn't that where there are?
"No, ma'am."
"In your brother's car, the battery's behind the seat."
"You see, they have these two 6-volt batteries wired"
Together to make a 12-volt.
I don't know about electricity and cars.
"Well, anyway, there's one more thing."
The driver thinks there was someone
"Else there, that your brother might have been pushed."
"No, he was alone when he left here."
"Well, it's the way he fell backwards into the car."
The headlines...
Please.
OTIS:
"I'm sorry, ma'am."
It's just that I...
I have to check on everything.
[Greta whining]
"Hey, that sure is a fine dog you got there."
"Hello there, old girl."
Don't worry.
The cops will be here in 3 minutes.
Just let me do the talking.
Last night's massacre?
I wasn't there.
This gentleman?
We've never met.
"If you do this for me, never was there a young lady in this courtyard."
Silence!
What are you groping for down there?
I don't know.
So we won't be playing ping pong?
"You must certainly have some princely motto, say:"
"Wherever I appear, the scum disappears."
The barefoot...
"""The Barefoot Contessa"", one might say."
Mankiewicz.
She saw her mother die at the hands of the Venoms.
The four Venom brothers.
Like Mickey's four fingers.
I've only wanted what's good for Mary.
But she seeks her mother's fate.
What can one do...
"Two days before retiring,"
"And still sizing up guys who sell both the cannons and the fodder, the catchphrases."
"But I keep trying, with the wild horses."
"Mickey, you, the limpet."
1000 to 1.
The luxury of desperate gamblers.
"I could give you back to your Hungary, but I'd rather release you into our wild."
"I'll take Mr André's statement democratically, like the Pope's edict."
And I'll keep sniffing your scent.
"Brother, it can turn death into life."
Good sword!
"Brother, your 8-divine Sword is fantastic."
"Yue-lam, you must have suffered a lot."
"Otherwise, I would not have been able to learn Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword."
"Brother, I know how much you love kung-fu."
What I've done is worthwhile!
Good girl!
But I wonder if I learned it thoroughly enough.
It'll be alright!
"With His Highness's background, he can learn everything."
"Your Highness, you'll be the ruler of the martial arts world."
Sung Chi!
Each faction has its characteristics.
All parties are getting stronger and more formidable.
And they are all Han.
It's a threat to our Dynasty!
You're right!
But don't worry.
I have an idea that will destroy both parties.
What's your idea?
"Your Highness, Shaolin and Wu-tang are traditional rivals."
We can kill two birds with one stone.
How?
"Your Highness, order the two factions to merge into one."
So that they'll fight each other!
"Right, they'll fight each other!"
But that's against the spirit of kung-fu.
Yue-lam!
You must understand that this is my duty.
I've got to do this!
Teach him starting from tomorrow.
brat!
Looks like you want a double suicide.
But you're going to make your trip to Hell alone.
Don't make me laugh.
Who could be beaten by a brat like you?
Don't you get it yet?
That armored suit is as good as a toy in front of me.
Why don't you stop profaning God's temple with your blood already?
God's temple?
Where is God in this room?
and the one who wields it is God.
Which part of this extermination equipment is God?
!
is only given to the chosen one.
A person like you has no right to be on this ark.
You're just another person who's being used!
You're just an expendable item to your government!
Don't you see that?
!
My plans no longer have anything to do with the Pentagon or the Machiner's Squad.
I'll judge these rotten human beings with my own hands.
You've gotta be kidding!
Stay back!
You bastard..!
He's dead.
"Project name... ""Cosmos."
The Pentagon's special experimental unit in which elite killers are trained since childhood.
Number 43.
Don't call me by a number.
Yu Ominae....
I've heard the rumor... didn't you?
Number 43!
How?
Did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course at my pupil referral unit.
What was my nickname inside?
"- Spider, right?"
- Not the nickname I heard.
We're done.
"I'm gonna go and stay with my sister, now."
"I assume we never meet again, which is a tragedy I'll just have to live with."
Here are the keys to the flat.
- We're not finished yet.
"- We had an agreement, Lenny."
I think you overestimated your ability to insist on deal breakers.
- You gave me an undertaking.
- To review.
So consider it under review.
OK.
Fine.
"- Send me back to prison, then, please."
- We can do that.
- Then do it.
"- Only this time, it's for life."
I'll make sure of it.
- You were never gonna set me free.
"- Don't be so ungrateful, John."
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
"Oh, mate."
You're not gonna believe this.
I've cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks.
Big beautiful brown eyes.
"Mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela - that's her name - she's gonna be down here dancing on the end of my bed."
Chill out.
Hospitals simply are going insane.
We've already reached the limit.
Maybe you should give up.
"A comatose patient is also a person, right?"
There are people who have woken up after 17 years!
What if my father wakes up?
"Just because of money, you decided to give up on my father?"
I already said I would pay the money.
Please carry out the stent surgery.
Hurry.
Please save my father.
Go ahead with the surgery.
Everything is settled.
I've already paid for the surgery.
"Here, your hand phone."
Wait a moment!
You... why did you help me?
I didn't help you.
I just don't want to hear that someone died because of me.
Thank you very much.
I'll pay you back the money.
Please give me your bank account number.
There's no need.
That money is only chewing gum money to me.
I'll just think of it as a donation to the poor.
It's just a small donation I gave you.
I...
"Seriously, I mean you can't compare the absence of a father with chewing gum!"
"And you can't classify us as ""poor people""."
I still owe you a debt.
Thank you!
I will surely pay you back.
Francois.!
Kali.!
Come here.!
"Look here, Smith."
Why can't we do business?
"I'm always open to an honest proposition, Mr. Thornton."
"We'll give you the claim, all of it."
You can have what gold we've got.
But leave us some way of getting out of here.
The winter snows are coming on.
"My dear man, you call that a business proposition?"
"We already have the mine, and the gold is ours by right of-"
How shall I put it?
By right of conquest.
Do you mind if we don't argue the point anymore?
Let's help ourselves.
Mr. Thornton would only squander the gold.
"I must commend your sense of humor, Mr. Thornton."
Very few people would be able to smile on an occasion like this.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
I remember watching a magician once.
"From an apparently empty hat, he shortly produced a rabbit."
"He smiled very much as you're smiling now... because, I imagine, he knew all the while... that he had that rabbit up his sleeve."
"You've something up your sleeve, perhaps."
Perhaps.
"Roll up your sleeve, Mr. Thornton."
There's no rabbit there.
"Come, come."
Don't let's strain our friendship.
Madam.
"Careful, you idiot."
Yep !
The old Gibbs is back.
GIBBS:
"You see something, Abs?"
Beauty.
"I mean, it's tragic, but if you were to see this tableau in a museum, you'd swear it was a brilliant commentary on the human condition."
What?
Corpse staring at a TV set?
- It says it all.
"- Well, it doesn't say who put him there or why."
That's for us to find out.
You shaved your mustache.
I liked you with a little hair on your face.
Still got my eyebrows.
Good point.
"I found Finn's blood, hair and fingerprints on the plastic."
So he was probably wrapped in it.
But I didn't find any other prints on the plastic or the shovel.
No chance of grabbing the gravedigger's sweat off the handle?
"After being underground, it's unlikely."
"Strange case, huh?"
I had this friend once that used to display roadkill in his living room.
- He had an NEA grant...
- Abby.
"Um, next I analyzed the soil."
It's compost material.
Rocks and small sticks.
Nothing's over an inch long.
It would indicate that it was processed through a screen.
Pretty clean for dirt.
It's a commercial product.
"But the house was just re-landscaped, so it's not surprising."
Gentlemen...
I wouldn't come too close to the door if I were you.
Have someone guard the prisoners.
"You, stay here."
"Yes, sir."
"Of all the asinine, fool-headed behavior."
You might have been killed.
For what?
For nothing.
"Well, what good is that?"
"Have a little faith, professor."
I'd prefer a hacksaw.
"I'm sorry, MacGyver, I'm afraid we're done for."
I should never have dragged you into this.
"Well, no one twisted my arm."
"No, you don't understand."
I lied.
The Academy didn't send me.
"In fact, the, uh, directors, uh, revoked my tenure."
I mean to put it simply...
I was sacked.
Who financed the expedition?
"I did, I thought that if I could find the Torch, prove Atlantis really existed, then the Academy would reinstate me."
It took all my savings to get this far.
I could barely afford the telegram I sent asking you to come.
"I hate to deceive you like that, but, uh,"
I had no other option.
"Uh, you must believe me."
"I was at the end of my rope, MacGyver."
"Oh, please understand, I mean, y-you were the only person that I could turn to."
Story of my life.
"Anyway, it's useless,"
"Wait, to compromise, just take out Miss Chummy."
Ignoramus.
Hold it.
(Douglas) Stand right where you are.
"No, I mean Miss Thatcher."
"Mm-hmm, in something of silk."
Hurry up.
Get to the funny part so I can laugh.
"The funny part is, I've won your high hat."
Off with it please.
Tell me more.
You are now talking to one of your employers.
"The young man with a fall production, remember?"
"Oh, yes, that is funny."
Where would you get money to put into a show?
"Well, young lady, I'll tell you."
The only thing ahead was the old homestead in Connecticut.
So I put a plaster on it.
You trying to tell me you mortgaged something to buy into this show?
Any law against it?
Did my father talk you into this?
The old gentleman with a lovely daughter?
(Patricia) Answer my question.
"Well, being my oldest and dearest friend he was kind enough to introduce me to the producers."
"'Ah, just a minute.'"
- You owe my a high hat.
- Sue me?
"Oh, hello, my dear."
Just sitting here anticipating a few small profits.
Your rehearsal go well?
"Father, you got him to put everything into this show."
"But, my dear, I did him a great favor."
I didn't murder anybody.
This witness is lying.
One memeber of the police department agrees with him.
Thomas Hardy made this statement to the press.
I do not think Kesser is the killer.
Important information was withheld.
Can you tell us what that information is?
Two of the women were called from police call boxes.
Why didn't you say that?
.
A Pittsburgh cop did it!
An offical police report denied Hardy's accusations.
The controversy has not changed Kesser's death sentence.
Airtight case.
Kesser had no alibi at all.
He confessed to the murder of his accomplice as self-defense.
He denied the Polish Hill murders.
"We found evidence from the murders in his hotel room,   and the gun that killed Vince Hardy."
Then why does Hardy think that Kesser was framed?
Kesser's fingerprints weren't on the gun.
It was a police special.
The serial numbers were erased.
Hardy starts barking conspiracy.
- He thinks the killer's a cop.
- No one thought he was innnocent?
"Yeah, Kesser."
"Well, Bob, he's putting them in the Allegheny or the Monongahela."
That narrows it down.
This is Hardy here.
Go.
"Hi, it's Jo."
Are you going to the policeman's ball tonight?
they find each other and reunite.
I went there every day hoping I'd remember the title.
But you know what?
That scene's not actually from a movie.
huh?
Aren't you gonna get in trouble for hacking into corporate databases and school records?
Little late to be worrying about that!
We're trying to find Takizawa's graduation photo over here!
Got it!
No wonder we couldn't find him!
Freakin' Juiz.
She took everything related to Takizawa Akira on the net and changed it to Iinuma Akira!
what's in No. 09's logs?
There's nothing like that in his...
It's gone!
All evidence of Takizawa Akira's history is being erased!
Even the Seleção logs!
what?
Then they've been erasing the logs when we weren't looking?
Chill out. so I have my PC set up to save a copy of all the logs as they're created.
master!
you're making me blush.
it's like a defense system and attack bot rolled into one!
you ever seen anything like this?
!
bring up Takkun's request details again.
look here.
use their image recognition system.
Pants!
Wha...
Juiz!
Iinuma Akira is going to completely replace Takizawa Akira.
When Ronny went to jail?
"Before that, when we were out on his boat."
In the storm?
That was fun?
That sucked.
"No, it didn't."
You thought it was exciting.
I wasn't excited.
I was hysterical.
There's a huge difference between hysteria and excitement.
Are we ever gonna have a relationship?
We're having a relationship.
"Here we are, having it."
Ian's got a room at the Chateau.
We'll stay there...
-...you can have the place to yourself.
-You should stay.
"Alex is still looking for an apartment, and we need something permanent so just stay."
Why don't you ask her?
Maybe she wants to be alone in the interim.
I'm sure Alex wants you to stay.
"I mean, she can't stay away from you as it is."
He's gonna give her a frontal lobe.
"No, no, he'll just give her Thorazine and then lock her up."
I think she wants to be locked up.
"Yeah, exactly."
Make your analysis at first  with three general patterns of emotional response.
Rage is the response to the primary stimulus of thwarting.
-Should I be embarrassed for us?
-I am.
I really am.
You gonna have another?
There he arrived.
Happy wedding anniversary..
- Thank you PK
His name is PK.
He has recently come from the neighboring planet.
He settled here because of missing his vehicle.

Today morning I saw a piracy CD of PK movie..
I'll tell the original story behind the PK movie..
"When Rajkumar Hirani met him in a bus, he narrated his story to him casually."
He seriously made it into a film.
- I will not believe..
I will make him believe.

OK..

Half proof has come and now I will show you the full proof.

This is peaks PK sir.
Do you say what is in pockets just by catching the hands?
Oh my God!
All this looks like a setup.
I do not believe.
Will you believe if I say your hierarchy?

"It wasn't until later, that these surfaced in the underground."
and was put here for safe keeping.
It's ironic that it is the American government that wants them.

Of course Mr. Garrison.

All of them.

Get moving.
You are going to be late for school.
I am using one of my sick days.
Stop with this!
You're burn the whole house down.
I can start with your room if you like.
"You are having a good old time, aren't you?"
If Mom and Dad was still alive.
But they're not are they?
Why don't you just blow up the whole neighborhood while you are at it?
"Morning, uncle Charlie."
Don't forget to mauld the lawn after school.
Sure.
How was the convention in Bakersfield?
and contusion on the arm.
"Look, this is an arm... the contusion, commonly called a bruise, is this big."
"So, in my opinion, she suffered a violent blow."
"Maybe she fell, I don't know."
Is it possible that she got into a fight?
She didn't say?
No she didn't talk about that.
"Mind you, she told me that... at some point she got up, she went to the window... and that's when she saw... the lady in question, on the ground."
"She would have also seen a young black man running, running..."
Did she say anything else?
I'm trying to see...
It's not my field...
"No, that's about it."
"Then, another blackout."
Any idea as to when we could interrogate her?
Not before 3 days.
3 days?
"3 full days, if not more."
Maybe you can get ahead with your investigation.
There might be other leads...
"Yes, thank you."
We'II follow other leads.
"- Thank you, doctor."
- alright.
"unfortunately, I must go to the clinic, but if you need me for anything..."
- Don't hesitate.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
"well, we'II take care of you guys."
alright... where do we do this?
"We could go in there, there are doors."
We'II get back to you shortly.
Why don't you ask me to come to your place?
I'm asking myself the same.
I can assure you I'm not calling for nothing.
Then put me with the asylum's principal.
"Alright, with the housemother then."
Good evening.
I was trying to explain to the other Mrs. the matter of my call.
"But apparently, there's a strong discipline in not letting an adult lady, who's there by her own will, answer the phone."
I'm not trying to teach you anything.
But...
I don't see the necessity in imposing...
military rules to some peaceful old people.
The problem is this:
It turns out that Jacoba... left home leaving a note in which she wrote me where she was going.
Without any apparent reason.
Please note that I'm disconcerted.
Jacoba's been at home for more than 40 years.
I don't know.
I can't remember her last name.
Good morning.
Did you make all this by yourself?
Of course.
And where did you get the jam and the toasts?
Everything was in the house.
And the cups?
They're yours.
Where were they?
There.
They'd only be used for special occasions.
"Like today, for example."
"God, they're tasty."
Don't laugh.
Gnomes.
I don't like gnomes.
Also I don't like fireeaters.
And I don't like dried fruit of any kind.
And I don't like those big mental dogs that come running at you in parks.
"I mean, you wouldn't let a lion or crocodile run loose in Regent's Park, would you?"
- Say some things you don't like.
"- Shut up, Calum."
I'm bored.
"Look, surveillance is boring."
"There's a pair of jays in that tree, if you look."
Big thrill
You know who really loves the countryside?
Nonces.
It makes it easier to grab the kids.
You always hear about weird shit like that happening in places like this.
That's more like it.
That's the undercover's wife.
Caroline Risdale.
Ticking my boxes.
I'd go under the covers with her.
But there's only one thing that comes before a lady.
My dinner.
I'm starving.
I'd eat those two jays in a sesame seed bun.
?
"I'll get us something to eat, then we'll start working in shifts."
Why?
"Because if we don't, I'm gonna start garroting you myself."
"Don't be like that, John."
"Come on, mate."
What kind of bag?
"Amy, you are going to love the kitchen, but first I'm going to show you guys the living room."
It has a wall-mounted flat screen and a gas log fireplace.
You won't believe how easy this is.
One push of a button...
Isn't that cozy?
"Make sure you capture the back of his head, too."
- If you would be so kind.
- You got it.
-Sorry.
- Sorry.
"There's no rush, gentlemen."
Our patient isn't going anywhere.
"I don't know, Ducky, the old Gibbs is back."
The old Gibbs?
"McGee, over here."
Hands and knees.
On the floor.
"Okay, um..."
"You're not going to step on me, are you?"
Footprints.
It's a pretty tight weave.
Looks like sisal.
It's a naturally stiff fiber woven from the leaf of a cactus plant.
"It doesn't mat, trap dust, build static."
Makes it ideal for carpeting.
"Personally, I prefer a good shag."
From a criminal-investigative standpoint.
I don't see any dirty footprints.
I think it's safe to assume that our friend didn't stroll in here on his own.
"You look happy to see me, boss."
"Oh, the coffee."
Ran the military ID our local LEO's got off the body.
except you who are a badass.
DICAPRIO:
"You hunt and fish here, right?"
AWA:
Yeah.
DICAPRIO:
"What do you, what do you fish and what do you hunt?"
AWA:
"In my territory I hunt fish, seal, narwhal, and polar bear."
DICAPRIO:
Is this polar bear?
AWA:
Yup.
DICAPRIO:
"Oh, well there you go!"
"And the ice here, since you've been around has it been decreasing?"
AWA:
"We used to have a solid ice, blue."
"Not light blue like this, blue."
"Hard, ice."
"Now we usually have a, kind of ice cream type of ice."
"It's ice but it's, when it starts to melt, it melts pretty fast."
Much faster than before.
"DR. SALA: 2040, you will be able to sail over the North Pole."
There's going to be no sea ice left in the Arctic Ocean in the summer.
We are burning so many fossil fuels that the ice is melting.
The Arctic is like the air conditioning for the Northern Hemisphere.
"If it goes away, that's going to change currents, that's going to change weather patterns, that's going to make floods and droughts more catastrophic."
It's the most dramatic transformation of a large environment ever.
Look at this.
DICAPRIO:
They're right here!
"My life is stupid, useless, and when you read this letter,"
I'll be dead by poison.
I write you to make it clear I'm the only one responsible for my death.
Nobody should be blamed for my death.
Nobody.
Farewell.
"Baroness de Vibray."""
Fantastic!
"You are a brother, Arsène."
Usher!
Procurator asks for me.
I gotta go.
You would get me a permit to enter in the jail?
What would I not do?
Judge Fuselier is committed to the case.
See you later.
You do not monitor the prisoners to prevent these things?
"Listen, after we took his fingerprints, everything was fine."
"At midnight, the guard made his round and found nothing unusual."
Only this morning he was found hanging.
When soup was being served.
Hanging?
And with what?
"I see what you're getting at, Mr Fandor."
But no.
"The guards removed his tie, his suspenders and his shoelaces."
All that was left him was a medallion
which he held dear.
"You know, the unfortunate man had to exert a terrible energy, because he tied strips of his shirt to the bars of his window and he hung himself leaning back in the rear."
"Tell me, death was probably very slow?"
Could I see him?
Why not photograph him?
And Norah doesn't despise Tris.
We spend a lot of time trying to define the relationship between the three girls.
"Because that idea of, like, ""frienemyship"" is hard."
"And so there's like a lot of debates, like, figuring out how mean they were to each other versus how friendly they were versus how passive-aggressive."
There was a lot to figure out.
And I...
Here we go.
Here it is.
- Here it is.
Here it is.
"- Michael, you stop doing that."
"Wait, watch for it."
There was no cut when we did this.
"- Okay, I'm gonna call my boyfriend."
- This is the gum.
- It looks fake.
- It looks fake.
- It looks like a skillful editing trick.
- Like someone passed me a new...
- No.
"- No, that's dirty gum."
- That is tainted gum.
- It's all spitty and...
- That is tainted gum.
- It's all spitty and...
"And, also, I should point out that I think Alexis and myself and Ari decided that we had all been friends since babyhood, basically."
- That's why we all tolerate each other.
- Right.
I figured that about me and Raf and Aaron too.
- We all grew up together.
- Stop trying to copy our ideas.
"No, it's the same with us."
That's right!
Wow!
My own giant robot.
I am now the luckiest kid in America!
This is unbelievable.
This is the greatest discovery since...
"I don't know, television or something!"
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some...
"No, they'll panic."
People always wig out and start shooting when they see something big like you.
- Hmm?
"- Oh, wig out."
It means crazy.
"You know, like, uh... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)"
"No, no, no!"
Don't do that!
That's the kind of stuff that makes them shoot at you.
MANSLEY:
"Two nights ago, at approximately 1900 hours, sat com radar detected an unidentified object entering Earth's atmosphere."
Losing contact with it two-and-a-half miles off the coast of Rockwell.
Some assumed it was a large meteor or a downed satellite.
But my office in Washington received a call from someone who reported an actual encounter with the object.
"This is no meteor, gentlemen."
This is something much more serious.
So...
"So, we can't call Ripley's Believe It or Not because they wouldn't believe it."
- And...
- (WAKES UP WITH A START)
"Oh, it's getting dark."
And if I don't get home soon
Mom's gonna wonder where I am.
And those propeller plans that you got for me... the plans you and Emmett worked to steal...
They were fake.
F-Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"[Sighs] Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
"And I wondered, do they even care how many people die?"
This administration...
"The stuff they get away with, it makes me sick."
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated.
Just think about all those... kids that died.
[Knocking]
[Elizabeth] Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted... and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
- Ha!
Ha!
I'd hardy call fertilizer bomb-making equipment.
"No, no, no, no, the fertilizer's outside."
I put the bomb-making stuff in the community room closet for authenticity.
"Wait, wait, wait, what other bomb-making stuff?"
"A lot of electronics, gasoline, nails, combustible hairspray."
- It's in the community room?
"- Yes, in the closet."
In the closet?
"No, Baber, no."
"No, no, no."
"You realize if someone catches wind of this,"
"You could actually be in serious trouble, right?"
"Ah, I can take it!"
"I'm very tough, I'd survive Gitmo."
Tough?
You're afraid of the moon!
I don't like the way it looks at me.
Ugh.
"You do know that Gitmo's not taking new prisoners, right?"
You'd wind up somewhere much worse like the moon.
"- OK, I'll be good."
- Yeah.
"Now, let's go."
Let's get that stuff in your van and you can return it to the store.
[ dove cooing ]
"This place is a real steal, guys."
"But like I said, I shouldn't be showing it to you, the place is set for demolition."
Are you telling me this used to be an old schoolhouse?
Who would want to demolish this?
It's amazing!
"- You're a class act, aren't you?"
- I'm a necessity.
Destroy the lives of innocent people just to keep me your slave.
Stop being so melodramatic.
You might learn to love me first.
"Well, what do you want?"
I want you to watch the undercover cop I mentioned to you.
His name is lain Risdale.
I think he was involved in the death of his commanding officer.
The man smells corruption.
"Things'll work out just fine, John."
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Ay, Papito, si."
"Duro, duro, duro."
More.
Ay delicioso!
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh, f..."
"- Oh, what did I tell you?"
- Si!
Si!
Si!
Si!
"- Oh, si!"
- Oh!
Police have arrested two Albanian men in connection with the murder of British businessman Jacob Gould.
Gould had stepped down from the day to day running of his shipping and cargo businesses after being linked with the illegal arms trade.
"Police confirmed that Mr Gould was being investigated by undercover officers as part of Operation Merlin, targeting gun-running networks in Britain."
There was also speculation that the killing could be linked to an attempt by Albanian mafia to control gun-running in London.
- Where are you from again?
- Hampshire CID.
Yes.
The evenings are the most beautiful ones at us.
There is not warmth at this time.
And the blackout?
"Ow, oh my God!"
Do not have yourselves disturbed.
Go to bed.
I am a bad sleeping.
Well it because of that maybe not.
"Appropriate, that we wait for it, the major lord falls asleep."
Why is this girl so sly?
It is not possible to get used to it.
What is an idea under the piano.
"Ow, Gyula."
There is warmth here after all.
"Open it a little the door, Ágika."
what's up dear Tót?
How do you feel?
"Thank you, very well, respectable major lord."
I envy you.
You have lucky nature.
Tell Tót.
Would you not play chess with me?
"Major lord, I am really sorry for it, but i can't."
And a card game?
"I am ashamed of it very much major lord, but..."
I not know the cards.
Then we play with dominos.
"Respectable major lord, I...not know any kind of board game."
Tell it quite openly.
Do you not miss something for you if you are this here sit with your wife and your daughter in a beautiful night?
My pipe was made of the sour cherry tree only.I lost it somewhere unfortunately.
Didn't you say that the cops suspected Petty stole his mines from Presidio back in '60?
"Yeah, and they never found his stash."
Searched all the tunnels and cellars.
No luck.
Or maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look.
W-w-warm in here.
It's nice.
What's next?
Crumpets?
How's that?
Feel like a new man.
"Now that's how you treat someone you want something from, Warden."
"Glad you approve, son."
But I've heard about the mind games in here.
What have you heard?
I'm not taking these pills.
"They're not pills, Mr. Petty."
Those are mints.
I drugged your tea.
Just a mild sedative to help you relax.
An anesthetic.
You were only 18 when you joined the marines.
Is that right?
I'm not talking to you.
"You served for the fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle, the bloodiest of the war."
14 silver stars were awarded to the veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle.
But not you.
"Despite clearing several frozen minefields by yourself, under heavy fire, providing safe passage for our troops to advance."
"Hypocrites, the lot of 'em."
It's for your safety.
"Were you scared, Mr. Petty?"
"No, ma'am."
This is absurd.
This is the...
Can't do this anymore.
"Now, look here, Fitzgerald..."
No.
"Mr. Little, allow me, for I believe this is the moment in the meeting wherein I quit."
What?
And lose dentists.
Go with the singular.
"""At the end of a long day serving others,"
"""this dentist relaxes with a calming Chesterfield cigarette."
"""It's all the service he needs."""
Write that down.
- Write that down.
- Okay.
"I've spent today in the graveyard, all washed and covered with weepy, watery blue flowers."
"I'll just say, but all the broken columns and clasped hands and doves and angels mean romance to me."
"Out of a row of Confederate soldiers, two or three will make you think of dead lovers."
"They're exactly like the others, even to the yellowish moss."
"Oh, death is so beautiful."
So very beautiful.
We will die together.
I know.
Out of a row of Confederated soldiers...
"Oh, death is so beautiful."
So very beautiful.
"So you see, dearest Scott..."
I've spent today in the graveyard.
[words overlapping] ...is to be young always.
We will die together.
I know.
I only stopped by to say hey when Roger has to suddenly go out back and check his bait tanks.
Force of habit.
Fire marshals will be by to talk with her next.
Any impressions?
"If I had to guess, I'd say she was telling the truth."
Where's Joan?
She's at your computer.
"Said she has a theory as to how Tendu got his $100,000."
What do you got?
"Oh, hey."
"So, this is one of the last pictures that Tendu uploaded to social media."
"Now, the logo belongs to a company called AmpVX."
They make top-of-the-line headphones.
"According to this, the headphones he's wearing haven't even been released yet."
"A friend of mine who dated a Met once, she said the guy never wore brand name unless he was getting paid."
Tendu is a professional athlete now.
Significant percentage of the money athletes make is from sponsorship deals.
How do we get ahold of someone from AmpVX?
There won't be anyone in the New York office until tomorrow.
But?
In Beijing...
it's already tomorrow.
WATSON:
Hao.
Your call went well.
It did.
What is that?
That's roasted huitlacoche.
It's corn smut.
Do you want some?
Ugh.
No thanks.
"So, the VP at AmpVX's Beijing headquarters said they signed Tendu to a five-year, multi-million dollar sponsorship deal."
It is true.
I forgot about the age being busy with the missions.
You should be very alert in this mission.
I am into form with my first success.
I will rage up now sir.
"No, just follow Karthik and that is enough."
"IG sir has asked me to follow you, keeping aside my seniority."
What should I do?
You should do acting.
There should be content in the character and I will sit in that putting a tent there.
"Your acting should be very simple, natural and convincing."
Stop it.
I gave performance as a jobless barber for 1 year.
I withstood the troubles as a waiter at the bar for 2 years.
I begged on the shore of the Musi River for 3 years.
I sold dry fish in hot summer without slippers.
Not even one could find me out as undercover.
What have you achieved doing all these?
It is dirty acting with expectations.
It is natural acting doing for happiness.
Take any creature in this nature and I will show you living as that.
Is it?
- Yes
Then the monkey.
Show us how it behaves in different situations.
Ask
Monkey in anger.
Monkey in fever
Cunning Monkey.
Alcohol drunken monkey..
Monkey feeling cold
"Wow, super!"
- Not too far.
You've been saying that for miles.
- My feet are sore.
- When did you become older than me?
"Tell me what this new breakfast place is, and I'll be quiet."
It an amazing new mystery place I found.
That's all I'm telling you.
Is it in this town or the next?
- We don't patronize the next town.
- Since when?
Didn't they feed lead to our jumping frog or something?
Right after they stoned the woman who won the lottery.
"See, so the boycott's legit."
- Wait.
Stop.
"- Look, it's Michael Landon."
You guys walk fast.
I've been chasing you the past two blocks.
We were being followed.
I told you I wasn't being paranoid.
Now you'll believe me when I say the furniture moved itself.
- Where're you going?
- Mystery breakfast.
- Out of town?
- Remember the definition of mystery?
I was wondering if it's okay to practice on your pots and pans again.
It's not like they have any other use.
I've almost nailed Ramble On.
I have to stop hitting my face with the sticks when I pull back.
John Bonham had that same problem.
- Key is in the turtle.
- Enjoy your mystery breakfast.
Yeah.
"Actually, I'm supposed to have drinks"
"With the woman from CNN, and I owe it to her"
To tell her my decision face to face.
Okay.
All right.
"Well, uh, tomorrow night, then."
Absolutely.
Blair.
Hey.
You never made it to my lacrosse game yesterday.
What are you doing?
I could ask you the same question.
Does Serena know you're trying to pull off plaid?
"Seriously, Blair, I expected Chuck"
"To go back to his old habits after your breakup,"
But I'd actually thought you'd grown up a little.
Whatever do you mean?
Blair Waldorf on the upper West Side
Two days in a row?
It pretty much looks like
"You're pretending to be a Columbia student, and not that"
"I care much about what Jenny Humphrey does these days,"
"But I saw that smackdown on ""Gossip Girl."" she was dealing drugs."
It's called an intervention.
"It's called you going back to plotting and conniving,"
"Okay, and that's the Waldorf equivalent"
"Of Chuck going around, sleeping with every call girl in the city"
And avoiding any kind of emotional contact.
Okay.
So I'm pretending to be a student here.
But it's only because I'm living a nightmare.
Now Oscar should be given for your performance.
I need to look at face of Vasu and my son once.
Open the box.
- Sir please..
I said open the box..
- Can't bear seeing this.
Open it..
Open it!
Deepak!
How was the shock?
Have you enjoyed or not?
Are you the Police guy?
"- What is this agony, sir?"
"Did you think about killing madam who gave you a great life, her son and my sister?"
It is wrong.
It is very wrong..
- Meaning..
You fool!
How can I let all this happen when I am there?
Sorry sir!
How can I hold your collar?
I would make you hit and run on the streets.
"I will exuviate your blood, bastard!"
You had shown only dual characters so many years.
I showed you dual role.
Not understand?
It was me who hit on your businesses as the Police officer.
It was me who exposed your flashback to madam by joining as the PA.
Your son has died for the sins you committed.
"After knowing about you, I thought you were a villain."
I now came to know that you are not even that.
I hate myself for being the wife to a fellow like you all these years.
"Once again, we blasted the nasal passages of the city clean of the cloning mucus of evil."
Now we can all breathe free and easy and smell the lilacs in bloom.
"Hello, aroma!"
Ahh...
- Atchoo!
"- Uh, I'll get the soup."
Too hot!
Too hot!
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
I have tremor cordis on me;
my heart dances
But not for joy; not joy
"Go, play. boy."
Play
"Thy mother plays and I play, too but so disgraced a part."
"How now, boy?"
What has smudged thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine.
"- Come, Captain, we must be neat."
"- I am like you, they say."
"Why, that's some comfort."
"Go, play, Mamillius."
"'A sudden madness had struck down Leontes, the King of Sicilia."
"'In the twinkling of an eye, it had turned him against those he loved best."
"'He became convinced that his wife, Hermione, 'and his childhood friend, Polixones, King of Bohemia, were lovers 'and that Polixenes was the father of her unborn child. '"
"- What, Camille, there?"
"- Ay, my good lord."
"Ha' you not seen, Camille - but that's past doubt - that my wife is slippery?"
You never spoke what did become you less than this.
Is whispering nothing?
Leaning cheek to cheek
It's a bad idea.
It's just gonna alienate her more.
Georgie...
I'm getting complaints!
People are furious!
You're turning down everyone's offer?
Why?
They're too low!
"I told you, they go to the highest bidder."
My client offered you twelve hundred dollars.
That's way higher than any meat buyer's gonna give you!
What is wrong with you?
!
Will said your father loved those horses!
How can you just kill them?
Those horses killed my father.
I understand you're under fire from the CPS.
It must be very difficult.
You should know since you're the one who instigated the entire thing!
I don't see how you can show your face at our door.
You took the truth and you twisted it into total lies.
I believe I had just cause.
You tried to keep me from seeing my only niece.
"I told you, you wouldn't get away with it."
But...
I can make this all go away.
For a price.
For a price?
"I'm sorry, you're blackmailing us!"
It's hardly blackmail.
"If you want me out of Georgie's life that much, then I believe I deserve a little compensation."
You have my number.
- I'm not in the militia.
- What's going on here?
- Keep out of this.
"No, don't do that."
"In my hospital, we don't usually leave the injured lying on the floor."
- Put him back on the drip.
"- Today, he's been lucky."
But I won't always be here to keep our men back.
"It's my job to help people, regardless of their political camp."
Does that mean you don't distinguish between victims and executioners?
He needs an operation now.
Do you have an operating theatre?
"Yes, but we don't have a doctor any more."
If you could assist me...
I can.
I studied medicine.
Our friend Benítez obviously isn't losing any time.
Right.
They'll soon be able to get supplies from the north again.
He's a cunning old fox.
I wonder how they managed to finish the bridge so quickly.
We must blow that thing up.
Look at that.
"Hey, that lorry was part of the ammunition transport."
"- Yes, we couldn't be more lucky."
- There'll be some fireworks!
All we need to do is attach the explosives.
"Hey, leave that bag here and go and meet Emiliano."
Stop!
Get out of the car!
"Come on, hurry!"
Listen.
I just figured it all out.
It's just like you said.
I'm your insurance policy.
What are you talking about?
"Well, as long as I'm your hostage, they can't get to you."
"You can demand a ransom from my father... we'll take the money, we'll escape to Mexico just like you said."
"Hey, hey, hey."
"Hold on a minute here, Patty Hearst."
- What?
"- On second thought, maybe Mexico ain't such a hot idea."
We'll have to wait in line at the border while they check the trunk for illegal fruit.
"- I mean, come on."
"- No, I'm completely serious."
They'll never be able to get us.
I'm your hostage.
There's no way they could possibly think we're in this together.
It's getting close.
It's getting real close.
"Subject vehicle, red BMW... now approaching with suspect and hostage."
- All officers take your positions.
- Move!
Come on!
Come on!
Prepare to engage suspect.
All emergency services remain in position.
"Fire, be ready with foam."
"Paramedics, stand by."
- This could actually work.
"- Yes, it's gonna work."
It's gonna work.
- All right.
- I know this beautiful spot in Cabo San Lucas... where the beaches are gorgeous.
"My dear citizens, we are living in difficult times."
"Once again, our people's enemies have shown their true, cruel, bloody colours."
Their cowardly terrorist attacks only hit those they claim to be fighting for.
If their true aim was political change in this country...
- Pass the ball to me.
"- Come on, children, we must go."
Hurry up.
Come on.
"Run, run, run."
Get into the car.
"Come on, hurry up."
"Doctor, are you really going to leave us?"
The guerrilleros will be here soon.
They're killers.
Haven't you heard the news?
- I don't want to be here when they come.
- They don't fight doctors and priests.
These people don't know what a conscience or a God is.
All they know is violence.
"If they come, they'll destroy this town."
The militia would be just as bad.
- I don't feel like dying.
- You can't shirk your responsibilities.
- You can't let the hospital down.
"- Padre, listen to me."
"I get paid for my medical services, not for heroism."
Why should I stay?
Just to cure a few sick people?
You stay.
Perhaps you'll be canonised one day.
But I...
"I need my hat, not a halo."
"Oh, sorry."
"I shoot straight, and hope that it'll be tempered by my teddy-bear cuteness."
Uh-huh.
Bullet hole through the window.
Clear.
Clear.
"Well, that's Ridgeway."
Looks like he's been dead a few days.
"What else do you see, Mr. Observant?"
This guy's not gonna be painting anytime soon.
"He's not gonna be answering any questions, either."
"Dr. Ryan, from the moment Jethro first mentioned your name and told me of your passion for the inner workings of the human mind,"
I knew I had found a kindred spirit.
Kindred spirit.
That's exactly what I was gonna to say.
"Plenty of time for spirits later, Duck?"
Ah.
"Thank you, Jethro."
Ever diligent in the war on small talk.
Single gunshot wound to the chest.
"The bullet pierced the sternum, headed straight through the dorsal side, and lodged itself in an adjacent wall."
"Happily, it is now in the capable hands of Miss Sciuto."
GIBBS:
That it?
"Well, based on the rate of decomposition, he expired approximately 72 hours prior to discovery."
GIBBS:
Before we started playing Wickes.
"Oh, please."
Mr. Ridgeway.
Do you mind if I call you Larry?
(whispers):
"Ooh, I like this woman."
"Lex, if you open that box, if you get hold of that secret, there will be no redemption for you."
No redemption.
Ever.
I was raised in your shadow.
Now you're gonna die in mine.
No one will even remember your name.

"i'm sorry, clark."
I traveled halfway around the world via satellite.
There's no trace of kara and brainiac.
I can't let lana sit in that asylum in pain.
The only way to help her is to find brainiac.
I've tapped every radar screen known to mankind.
"I mean, there's no bogey or blip unaccounted for."
It's like they just flew off the map.
What about brainiac's power sources?
Check the electrical grid for any power surges again.
"Stay focused, chloe."
Busy night out there.
What's going on?
Someone at luthorcorp just jumped out their office window.
Rumor has it it was lionel luthor.
Let's go.
I just talked to him.
You said you were working down the hall from your father tonight?
I heard him yell.
Then he was gone.
"I know how difficult this must be for you, Mr. Luthor, but I need a positive identification."
Whenever you're ready.
Yeah.
What's going on here?
Tracing back our history... too.
I think Noah has another function besides controlling the atmosphere.
that no one would believe such a fact.
That just maybe the countless dinosaurs and other strange animals in stasis outside in the ark were probably used in experiments for creating the life forms that would carry on the next generation.
What are these things?
Noah's other function is that of a life-creating device.
Professor?
Isn't it incredible?
"The history of the human race was created within this ""Noah's ark!"
let us build a new world with our hands.
Worthless.
That is your wish.
Mankind has progressed in the wrong way.
Man is the only defective work that God created.
Are you trying to put Man on trial in place of God?
We must do it now.
I want the two of you to create new life forms for the next generation using Noah.
Professor.
Come let's do it.
No.
Damn!
Where the hell are the Doc and the others?
What did you just say?
I said no.
You're insane.
I see.
Then it can't be helped.
What are you going to do?
Get a fire extinguisher..!
Quickly!
Run!
- But she's not saying that now.
- She's lying.
She's a prime candidate for severe...
I want to be sure she doesn't have post partum depression just as much as you do.
But it can be one of the most difficult conditions to diagnose.
"And if the patient is in complete denial or lying to me, not only can I not tell, but I cannot hold her."
I gave her every opportunity to let us know.
I'm sorry.
- Need a hand?
- I need eight.
"Oh, God, it hurts!"
What's this?
Driver of our auto-versus-pedestrian.
The guy ran out in front of me.
"Please, give me something."
"No neck pain, no chest pain, good vitals, but complains of bilateral thumb pain."
Look at this.
I can't even make a fist.
And we're out of beds.
"Okay, let's park him."
I'll see what I can do.
"Dr. Weaver, Psych's refusing to admit Judy Anderson."
Psych?
I believe her condition was a deliberate act.
"Yes, I know you suspect postpartum depression,"
- but did she admit it?
- Practically.
She drove head-on into a wall.
The baby's seat wasn't properly anchored.
She's obviously overwhelmed at home.
ER.
Please hold.
"What is important for a journalist, is to keep readers in suspense, so they'll want to buy the newspaper."
At the expense of the truth?
I never wrote anything false.
I just give enough elements so the reader can imagine what he wants.
"I'm losing my mind, you know."
Elizabeth our only chance to clarify this story is to remain united.
I ask you to do that for your brother.
And for me.
We're going to choose the cake.
Okay.
Which one?
This one.
What is it?
Who is there?
"The injection, quick!"
Pick up the list.
It is on the desktop.
Here it is.
You're lucky.
"If you had not saved me from the guillotine in the past,"
I would have strangled you.
To leave this list lying about...
Fortunately the police didn't find it.
I did not realize when you had asked me to pick it up.
It is you who have written it on this desktop.
I thought that you had taken it.
This is a misunderstanding.
The incident is closed.
It remains to know whether the girl has seen it.
The sheet was returned.
"Yes, but you never know."
"And when in doubt, I do not abstain."
I'm certainly not turning them over to you
To be stolen the next time you feel sleepy.
"Agent carter,"
How did you come to discover the stolen items?
"Leet brannis, uh, told me where they were."
And how did you come into contact with mr.
Brannis?
I have been conducting my own private investigation
Have you been in contact with him since his disappearance?
"Are you collaborating with stark,"
A known traitor and fugitive from justice?
Publicly revealing these items won't clear mr.
Stark's name.
They'll only place you under suspicion along with him.
Do you see the day I've had?
"I will call them in, and they will respect me."
But they won't.
They'll only use it to tear you down.
If you wish to clear mr.
"Stark's name,"
You must do so from the shadows.
There's a phone box across the street.
"But for god's sake, don't let krzeminski get hold of it."
Sousa's working the office tonight.
I can just about stomach him getting the credit.
"Oh, and, uh, mr."
"Jarvis, they know your voice now."
Sousa.
"Hey, mack, I, uh,"
Got a hot tip for ya.
"Yeah, howard stark's stolen inventions."
They're... they're...
- Why?
- Because I say so.
"- Anything you say, my dear."
I don't understand why you want to go on leading this unhappy life.
I was perfectly happy until you came.
You're pretending again.
I know very well you're fond of me.
You're just fighting to cover it up.
It must be wonderful to be gifted with so much insight.
"Well, it's very nice, but will you promise to send back those plans?"
They'll be in government hands by tomorrow morning.
There.
I knew you were a woman of intelligence the moment I set eyes on you.
Sort of a like recognizing like.
Thank you.
"Now, please excuse me."
I really have some things to attend to.
- Can't I stay here and help—
"- No, no."
Thank you.
Really.
- Will you have dinner with me tonight?
"- Yes, of course I will."
"But, now, please, excuse me and—"
- Thank you.
- You really are a bit of a darling.
- That's nice of you to say so.
- I'm not bad myself.
"As a matter of fact, I'm considered pretty crisp, in a manly sort of way."
- You'll probably find that out when we get better acquainted.
- No doubt.
Good-bye.
"The mathematical world is completely rational, uncomplicated by sex."
"You think too much, hon."
Don't you want to know how big my tits are?
No!
I just want to share my life with someone.
- Someone I'm not sexually attracted to.
- What?
"How can two people come together for what's a lasting and substantial, mutual respect, genuine affection, in a world that's run by ad agencies selling great sex?"
"Take out your own ad, I guess."
- An ad?
- Mmm-hmm.
Look at me.
I'm a grown woman wearing a prom dress.
You are not.
You look adorable.
Adorable?
I look like an over-the-hill Barbie doll.
"It doesn't fit right, it's too tight."
Too many Sno Balls.
Why didn't you pick out something looser in my color?
Because maids of honor don't wear black.
It would help if you fixed yourself up a little bit.
- Why don't you wear some make-up?
- I am wearing make-up.
Let's go.
And your hair looks good today.
"I like it, the curls work."
Why don't you get a perm?
I tried that once.
I looked like Shirley Temple on crack.
Where the hell is she?
I'm gonna kill her!
I am going there immediately
"""Tell me Devi, for what reason  work have you called me."""
Jalandhar has eyed me badly and tried to spoil my sacredness.

You are asking me that.
One who is eyeing other's wife wrongly...

"""He attacked Kailash, he eyed me wrongly  called me..."""

His intentions were'nt sacred.
He had sin in his mind

Why and for what reason?

"You know, an adult baby?"
"It's a fetish in which the baby is taken care of in every way by a "" mommy"" or a ""daddy. """
You're familiar with this condition?
It's not really a condition.
It's more like a form of relaxation.
- Are you kidding me?
"- No, it says right here:"
"""Abies like to relinquish control, get away from their stressful lives. """
"- Mr. Dwyer, what do you do for a living?"
- Shoe sales.
A foot fetish too.
This is an issue for the Psych Department.
No offense.
I am not so sure about that.
"Mr. Dwyer, when's the last time someone changed you?"
This morning.
"More than likely, he suffers from a diaper rash, which is a medical ailment to be treated by the ER."
- When are you done with this rotation?
- Next week.
Remind me to give you some serious scut work.
"""To Dr. Pratt, thanks from a grateful patient."
But you're wasting your time.
I didn't kill Bob Keaton.
"But you did process the scene, which means you do know who did kill him."
I'm not at liberty to say.
"Mr. Park, what can you tell me ?"
That this case doesn't exist.
And neither do I.
"Well, then, how do you explain me ?"
Lieutenant Caine... nothing good comes from waking ghosts.
I think you know what I mean.
"But if you can wake them, then maybe... they're not ghosts."
"Hey, Alexx."
"Hey, Ryan."
Did you determine the cause of death on my quarterback ?
Blunt-force trauma was the cause.
And I may have also found the person who caused it.
I found this in his pants pocket.
"I know about the curve, you're a dead man."
"""Curve..."""
What kind of curve ?
"Whatever it was, guess it was something worth killing for."
That's weird.
Note has perforated edges.
It looks like dot-matrix printer paper.
Who uses that kind of paper these days ?
Exactly.
I didn't write any note to Patrick.
You pulled me out of the reunion for this ?
"Yeah, we did."
You wrote the note 15 years ago.
You can't prove that.
The paper was the first indication.
Barry:
I don't understand that.
Why me?
"You know, I'm so small compared to what these other people are doing."
"You know, it just doesn't make sense to me."
Morris:
"Caught between the machetes of law enforcement and the bank accounts of businessmen, the small-time growers are going to have to fight to survive."
I had such a dream of being able to grow legally my whole life.
"We're kind of hanging on by our fingertips, but we're gonna fight."
We're gonna fight for our place all the way to the end.
Morris:
Will you do it again?
I doubt it.
I doubt it.
"It's just, you know, why bother?"
Previously on X Company...
I have a proposition.
It's an informal prisoner exchange.
"It's your son Klaus, he's in a Russian POW camp."
I can have him transferred to a Canadian POW camp.
I need a man transferred out of the Gestapo HQ in Paris.
"Go, go, go!"

- Do you remember the deal we made?
- Short and sweet.
No strings.
"- Anyway, I don't mean to..."
- No.
It was nice.
"In three weeks, the Allies are mounting an operation on the coast of France."
- What'd she say?
- Garcia says this looks like a list of additives needed to weaponize anthrax.
Could they get enough anthrax?
"The letter sent to senator Tom Daschle's office in 2002 only contained two grams of purified spores, enough to kill 25 million people if effectively distributed."
Are you willing to have a chat with me?
Go ahead.
Gideon.
Let's chat.
He's from Egypt.
Cairo.
- You sure?
"- No, he could be yemeni, but odds are he's egyptian."
What type of name is Gideon?
American.
"I often forget that in your culture, you put your country first and your god last."
"Sir, he was born and raised in egypt."
"They pronounce ""J"" sounds as a ""G""."
You don't consider yourself egyptian as well as muslim?
Egyptian.
"In two minutes, you know more about me than those thugs found out in two months."
"They and I have... very, very different motives and methodologies."
And yet your country relies on them to protect you from us.
Sometimes they're their own worst enemy.
Yeah.
"Who is your worst enemy, agent Gideon?"
It's not a who.
It's a what.
Ignorance.
You're a very honest man.
And you?
"Must have become a hafez by what,"
- age 10?
'
I'm telling my advisor all this and I look in her trash can... and there's this half-eaten banana in there.
Nothing else.
"I pictured her sitting in this shoebox of an office, eating a banana by herself... and I almost felt sorry for her."
"Then she questioned my judgment about Berkeley, so I eviscerated her."
"She was welling up at the end, but she held it in until I was gone."
I have enough faculty recommendations to run for Student Council... so I don't need her anyway.
My locker's this way.
- Are they closed?
- They're closed.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
"Okay, one second, and open."
You made me a tassel-hat cake.
Filled with two pounds of crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans.
- You're evil.
- And you're graduating.
"- Yes, I am, aren't I?"
- Here.
I brought the pictures you wanted to see of my high school graduation.
"Hand them over, lady."
"- Okay, but don't laugh."
- I promise.
"I was younger then, not as refined."
- You're stoned.
- Totally.
- I thought you hated that.
- It was peer pressure.
"If Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke, you took it or took off."
Gilbert had a snappy slogan.
I was nauseous all day.
Your parents?
Nothing at all.
It's so strange.
We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them.
It's like his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.
"Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down."
Yeah.
- [sickle] what're you doing?
- [Letha] thinking.
"Thinking about us in a different place, such as..."
Las Vegas With Tony.
"Seven or eleven every time, right?"
A day at the races.
All the long shots come in.
"[laughs] you do have an imagination, after all."
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.
"For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them."
"If he can stack them, he can unstack them."
The gold is on display at the museum.
Protected by an impenetrable security system.
Just sitting there waiting for us To penetrate it.
Wait a minute.
Us?
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?
Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius.
"I own half the invention,"
"Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits."
"So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero."
What about security.
We'd need an army to pull it off.
"Although in an indifferent universe there's no room for tragedy, is there?"
You've been reading something more than women's magazines.
You made him swallow his own words.
Doctor Alexander...
It's all right.
I came in to help solve these atrocious crimes.
"Yes, if you could take the DNA sample, Doctor Alexander."
"Thank you, Mr Fordyce."
If you would just open your mouth.
"Tom, you saw how he reacted, how he shifted when you mentioned the article."
His whole antagonism to Dave Stubbs' beliefs.
It's not enough.
You can't charge a man because he believes in nothing.
Tom?
"God, what's wrong with you?"
It's the chemo.
Chemo?
I have cancer.
What do you mean?
What sort of cancer?
The sort that kills you quickly.
Why didn't you tell me?
"Well, I didn't think it was relevant."
"Tom, you have cancer."
That is relevant.
What's the prognosis?
80-20 against me surviving the year.
"They never really know, people do de_ these predictions."
Let's hope.
Can we change the subject?
Shouldn't you be making the most of your life instead of chasing after murderers?
"Well, I figured if I kept busy, it might just go away."
I'm the deciding authority here.
But finding the vehicle involved in the accident is also is a tough task...
Exactly.
Come with me.
"Based on the postmortem report, the impact suggests that... it's clear that the vehicle involved in the accident is a car."
There were shattered glass pieces all over.
That must be of the car's windshield.
"If it was an outsider, he couldn't have left the town without changing it."
The same applies to a local person as well.
What if it was a local person...
And he has his car hidden without changing the windshield?
"Okay, you leave."
Investigate this case in your pattern.
Or try a cookery show instead.
Don't ask for my help.
"- Sir, chill..."
I was just giving an opinion.
You are the leader of this case.
Forget about it.
Tell me about the next step.
Start the bike.
What?
I don't know to ride a bike.
I have to do that as well?
"Greetings, Sir."
Greetings.
I want all the details of windshield repairs that have been done since the 18th.
"Okay, Sir."
I'll check it.
Also I need the address of nearby workshops.
"Okay, Sir."
List of people who had changed the wind shield.
- review our options.
- Options?
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
And you got a grand total of two.
"Option A, Brandon takes the deal."
"Option B, Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big."
"Look, look."
What about... reprisals?
"I mean, if Badger..."
If Brandon... informs on this Heisenberg...
"I mean, what if..."
God forbid...
that they decide to...
- take revenge?
- What have you been telling him?
"The kid keeps spouting off about ""if I talk, they'll kill me""."
"Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal."
- Good.
"- No, that's not good."
That's terrible.
"Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks."
You let him take his chances on the outside.
Maybe I can
- work in some witness protection.
"- No, look, look."
"These are vicious, desperate people."
I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
People love to take credit for the fun ones.
The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
"His wife killed him, all right?"
It was open and shut.
"Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?"
If you have thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins...
And you're short 2 sen on a bill of Y130
How many of each denomination did you have?
What is it?
"Fujio's homework, from yesterday"
He's starting junior high this year
The preliminaries are so complicated
And if I can't do the work he's been set...
It kept me up till 2 a.m
Working on this?
Yes.
"Go on, solve it"
Thirty two 5 sen and 1 sen coins 2 sen short on a bill of Y130
Forget it.
It's our cross to bear
Wait.
If you call it X...
You can't do it like that!
No using algebra
A total of 32 coins...
And no using real coins!
Right!
I've got it!
"It just takes patience No, that's wrong too"
You don't have to get upset about it
They don't do this in junior
If you could do it you'd say they do
Couldn't the doctor find me a tutor?
Perhaps from among his students
I simply can't do it myself Please ask him
You worry too much
I don't really care who just so long as he's clean

Then her accomplice.
No.
No.
"No, Stan."
Forgive me.

"Lynn, don't run."
Come back.
Lynn!
Gordon.
Gordon.
Gordon.
I'm going to kill you.
Gordon.
Gordon.
Get me the police.
"Good morning, Mr. Phelps."
"We recently learned that, in order to carry out the underworld's policy of enforcement, this man, Burt Gordon, has set up an organisation similar to the old Murder, Incorporated."
"Gordon will arrange for the disposal of anyone, anywhere, for a price."
The victims always disappear with no evidence of foul play and the body is never recovered.
"Although we are sure Gordon is the man behind this murder ring, he has kept himself so far removed from the actual killings, we are unable to pin anything on him."
"Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to prove Gordon is, in fact, a killer, and put him away for good."
"As always, should you or any of your IM Force be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions."
Please destroy this recording in the usual manner.
"Good luck, Jim."
"- Good, very good, Rollin."
"- Just a small sample, Jim."
"Well, I think that will appeal greatly to Mr. Gordon's nature."
Nami's not after money.
- She did it because she trusted me.
- So you say.
Your image is very appealing.
"And you have such a nice body, too."
Nowadays there is not much excitement in this industry.
It's so boring.
Did you give my number to anyone?
Why?
I've been getting a lot of perverted telephone calls lately.
Is there a pervert stalking you?
"Such a lonely world, isn't it?"
Everyone wants someone to talk to.
That sad looking guy outside as well.
He looks like a guy who's henpecked at home.
Are you sympathizing with a pervert!
?
"No, but I read these stories in the magazines so often nowadays, how some women have been assaulted or had their underwear stolen."
Do you have a persecution complex?
You might be the type.
I think I'll be going now.
"OK, I understand."
Why don't you take that magazine with you as a memento?
"Ladies and gentlemen, this train is leaving, please mind the doors,"
Nami Tsuchiya.
Please come out.
I just want to talk to you.
Who are you?
Say something.
I saw you in front of the cafe.
Why did you follow me?
"I sympathize with you, and I don't know why I'm doing this."
- You went home with that guy?
"- Uh, is that fair?"
- Did you sleep with him?
That's all I want to know.
"Uh, you don't actually want to know."
I was gonna talk to Michelle.
I was gonna...
You know what?
Forget it.
- What?
Chad!
Don't...
"- Don't call me, all right?"
Oh.
So last night was about making someone else jealous.
- I don't know.
"- Well, it obviously worked."
You almost have to love the irony.
You're where I was a few months ago.
"You ended things with me, Scotty."
Now you know how hard it is to love someone who doesn't love himself.
I feel sorry for you.
"Good luck, Kevin."
It's just a travesty.
"I mean, what has this city come to when the police are arresting two little old... two mature women, and throwing them in jail for the night?"
Maybe if you had shown some maturity and not resisted arrest...
I never resisted...
No one ever re...
Wouldn't my tax dollars be better spent arresting drug dealers or bangers?
Gang bangers.
Maybe you shouldn't be so judgmental now that you have a record.
Any chance of you not telling your siblings about this?
I say that even now.
But how did you remember all this?
I'm caught.
It was a lie.
Coming to Malaysia for your treatment?
A naked lie.
You made us fools?
"You're right, that was true."
I hate people who act like you.
Aren't you acting?
"Though I am in your heart, you're getting ready to get engaged with someone else."
Isn't that an act?
I acted saying that I don't remember past.
And you are acting without saying that.
Not much of a difference.
Happy moments I spent with you are more important for me.
You think of our separation.
You forget things which you should remember.
Don't cheat yourself.
Is she telling me to go away?
Is she telling me to come?
What is your heart saying?
Do you know that at least?
You storm me like a tornado...
I suffocate because of you...
In such circumstances...
Is it possible to know what my heart says?
Roaring forever...
The clouds won't hide the water vapour and carry that burden...
"Like you, it won't hide its love..."
If you had embraced me with your warmth... my youth would have jumped in joy...
If you had struck the right notes...
"Excuse me, but what is your deal?"
I rather not discuss it.
- Why not?
"- That's my business, that's why not."
What's the big...
I thought for sure they'd send professionals.
They did!
Then why is it matter what I don't want to discuss?
Wouldn't you be curious if you were us?
There's a place around the corner if you need more ammo.
- We got ammo.
- Then let's get this show on the road.
Expecting company.
- What kind of company?
"- Rather not say, except to say we probably don't wanna be here when they arrived."
- They?
"Who's ""they""?"
- Is this an interview or a hit?
Whatever man.
You got anymore cookies?
"Maybe, maybe not."
"How about this, if you shoot me, I'll tell you where they are,"
- and I'll throw in the recipe.
- How are you gonna do that dead?
- Start shooting and find out.
- Hardy har har.
"Excuse me, I need to confer with my colleague."
- Again?
"- Yea, again."
Don't worry I won't move this time.
"I'll be right here, when you get back."
"I know we gotta off this guy, cos that's what we gotta do."
You make me laugh!
We make him laugh.
"well, you two are starting to worry us."
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?
"You were chosen because you were 76-/- average, and after just a few days, you,re barely 44-/- average."
I was about to tell you:
"If you don,t stay above 50-/-, you won,t be here long."
"We,re not above 50-/-?"
"We,re not making this up."
"Think of your country, of yourselves, of everything we,ve done."
"It,d be a terrible waste."
"They,II make us pay for everything, just you wait!"
- Is that supposed to be irony?
"- Why, is it forbidden?"
"Listen, Jean-MicheI."
"Do you think you,re doing this all by yourself?"
Have you any idea what we must deal with?
Sometimes I wonder why we bother.
I thought scientists were much more patient.
At work we deal with relationships and statistics -
"Check 7 under ,aggressiveness.,"
"You,d put 7?"
",Check 7., There you go again!"
You want aggressiveness?
Let me handle this.
- Maybe 8.
"- Right, check 8."
Your colleague said 8.
Check that.
"Note, ,The couple find the technicians very amusing.,"
"personally, I,m very tired, and right now I really don,t find this amusing."
"Hubby, what shall we do?"
Fashion design?
!
Court.
"Prosecutor, you can start your final address now."
Although sentiment counts beyond law.
One should be punished if he killed.
You'd better think.
"If your family was killed, what'll you do?"
"Now, all the evidences which the court admitted, prove Ho Foon is the murderer."
I request the jury would plead Ho Foon guilty.
Defence counsel.
My husband paid me to study law in UK.
"But I am so sorry to him, I didn't study law."
I studied fashion design.
"I am not well educated, but I don't understand one thing."
What's more important?
Legal procedure or life?
"Your Honour, if you don't mind me telling my point of view."
"I think that, you've studied so many years of law, you have got nothing at all."
"Like my husband, I haven't studied law."
But I dare to open my eyes to see what's right and wrong.
I am proud of my hubby.
I love him.
"Jury, I believe that you are not nuts."
You should know how to judge.
"If all of you are nuts, it'll be useless to say anything."
Thank you very much.
You've been released!
Yes.
You heard everything?
Yes.
Is there a listing for implosion grenades?
- Those were the days.
"- Artie, we've got WiFi."
"- No, no, no, I like paper."
"Actually, I hate paper."
"But, you know, it's a security issue."
"Okay, Artie, enough."
You have to fill us in.
"Okay, if the competition used an implosion grenade to steal the sword,"
Then what the hell does this sword do?
Yeah.
"I mean, it must be pretty major, right?"
You don't drop a nuclear bomb to steal a butter knife.
Exactly.
Okay.
You want to know about the sword?
I'll tell you about the sword.
"The Honjo Masamune is much, much more than a dull knife."
It kept the ruling Shogunate in power for hundreds of years
By making them invincible in battle.
And the beauty in the way these things were forged.
"I mean, ritually hammered and folded."
The blade millions of layers of steel
With a carbon content that's right off the charts.
And each layer only atoms--atoms--thick.
I mean this sword...
Is said to be perfectly aligned.
- So what does it do?
- Yeah.
"Um, ha, uh..."
"Okay, you know how geese fly in a ""v"" formation"
And the wind hits the first bird and then splits
"The horses can be harnessed, we are on our way"
"There's still so much ahead, this is not goodbye"
"Allow me, my good friend, to thank you"
"Thank you, it's been a pleasure, dear Sherlock"
It's amazing what one coincidental encounter led to
From two perplexed strangers to a popular duo
"The more the merrier, my friend, it's quite elementary"
Quite elementary
Quite elementary
Elementary
"Excellent, Excellent!"
"We need to make a few changes in the first act, but that's all."
"The audience won't leave, I've never seen anything like it."
"Yitzhak, you're a king, the audience loved it."
How was it?
"Good, I have a few comments."
What's wrong?
"Goni, how did I sing?"
Slow.
"For a general rehearsal, it wasn't too bad."
It was a great general rehearsal.
- It was a helluva general rehearsal.
Thank you for letting me be in the theater's biggest hit.
Amazing.
Amazing.
"- To Daddy, break a leg, from Mommy and Goni -"
I have a problem in the entrance to scene 3.
It doesn't seem right.
I'll set it right for you later.
"Aside from that, I have a very good feeling."
Everyone does.
It's just the beginning.
I get to have no-strings-attached sex with someone who's not my husband.
That is the fantasy.
What's the ideal client for you?
Rich women.
They tip well.
Half the men I meet mistake me for a bank.
And the other half are either just plain boring or collecting social security.
"So, it's about companionship for you?"
"No, dear."
It's about the sex.
I take my job seriously.
"I brighten a lot of lives, and that takes care, focus."
I want every woman I'm with to feel... seen.
Feel special.
His name is Jeremy.
He was the only normal guy.
Marriage is a sacred union.
And your sex life is an expression of that bond.
"But when lovemaking gets routine, how can you spice things up?"
It's research.
"An open marriage can be a safe, fun way to bring excitement back into the bedroom."
And we can help.
I hired them for the party.
They work as a husband and wife team?
Yeah.
"That's crazy, right?"
I don't know.
"A lot of it does make sense, doesn't it?"
"I mean, when you meet them, they seem like a really happy couple."
Is this what we should be?
Polyamorous?
An open marriage?
This way!
Follow me!
Follow me!
Enormous explosion over toward the West Wing.
I don't know if this means the president has been killed.
We know..
I got 100 people in here!
Somebody tell me something!
You idiot.
What'd you say?
You are an idiot.
You just blew our whole mission.
Your mission.
Shut up.
"Mr. Stenz, this may be your lucky day."
Get your men back to the basement.
"I, Alvin Hammond, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute.."
the office of president of the United States..
"and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend.."
"the Constitution of the United States, so help me God."
"Sir, follow me, please."
"Place your hand there for scanning, please."
"Sir, these are your presidential launch codes."
Keep them on your person at all times.
Vice President Alvin Hammond has just been sworn in..
as the 47th president of the United States..
"confirming, of course, the worst possible scenario.."
the death of President James Sawyer.
People all over the globe have been holding their breath.
They're wondering what is happening right here in America.
"After all, the United States has the biggest weapons arsenal in the world."
We need to start moving the money.
"I hope you appreciate this moment, lieutenant."
"You see, I am a cavalry man."
All the von Scherbachs were cavalry men.
"Well, you know what happened to the cavalry."
"Just give me 5 minutes on that couch, will you?"
Five minutes.
The young ones they put into the panzer divisions.
"The older ones, they put in the quartermaster corps or made them recruiting officers, or wardens, like me."
Wet nurses to putrid prisoners.
"In Berlin, they have forgotten that Colonel von Scherbach even exists."
But they will remember now.
Berlin?
General von Pfeffinger?
"Oberst von Scherbach, Stalag 17."
"Jawohl, Herr General."
Name:
"Dunbar, Leutenant Dunbar."
Sabotage.
"Jawohl, Herr General."
"Well, there will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin."
You will be interrogated by the general staff.
When it comes to the part about your arrest I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I just want to sleep.
I haven't slept in three days.
You will remember the name.
"Scherbach, von Scherbach."
"Well, Herr Inspektor, how did you find the camp'?"
"Crowded, but gemutlich, shall we say?"
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar.
- Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
-It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
One should go to the nearest temple of any kind in a moment of weakness.
Maybe I shouldn't hurry about Moloch?
"Wise Solomon, people believe in your fairness."
Don't let doubts poison your grand design.
"The law will protect you from your enemies, because what you believe in will always become law."
"King, here are the petitioners from the city!"
Great King!
You're building a temple for pagan filth.
"New sacrifices will bring not glory, but fear."
The treasury has already paid for the building of the altar to Moloch.
Temples are expensive nowadays.
I'm decorating this city to glorify it.
Great King!
"There are madmen, who being blind, will worship the new idol."
Get him out of here!
Don't build the altar to Moloch!
The pagan filth will destroy you and all of us!
Glory to wise Solomon!
Hurray to our King!
Hurray to our King!
Hurray!
What was there will go on.
What has been done will be done again.
There is nothing new under the sun.
Hurray to our King!
Hurray to our King!
"Have you come to your senses, you son of a bitch?"
Where am I?
What are you babbling?
Wait.
Let him drink a bit.
We won't tell anyone about it.
"If you don't run, you spoil our fun!"
"I offer up this contract, to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps in the atmosphere!"
Is he using that magic to accelerate?
"I offer up this contract, to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps in the atmosphere!"
Are you okay?
"Yes, but you... that magic..."
You should know it.
"I didn't want to use it, though."
Damn it.
So that was...
You!
Why do you use our magic?
He couldn't be!
An Alpha Stigma bearer?
The eyes said to bring forth disaster!
"I offer up this contract, to unleash..."
Stop!
Don't use magic!
"I offer up this contract, to unleash the magic beast which dances through the skies!"
"If you'd used that power sooner, everyone might not be dead right now!"
"We only faced three of them, so we made it out alive."
"Besides, it's been seven years since I've used this power..."
You gave us an interesting spectacle there.
"How rare to see an Alpha Stigma, monster."
Cower more!
"Amuse me, monster."
"You have an Alpha Stigma, right?"
Show me something nice.
"Do you get it yet, monster?"
Those two are the only ones left.
We killed the rest.
All of them.
/ Sure.
Bet he's got plenty of hands and other pieces stashed somewhere.
"Maybe he's dipping them in wax,"
- passing them off as sculpture.
- What?
A classic Vincent Price movie.
You gotta see it.
"""House of Wax"" (1958)"
I'd rather see here Bianco's hauling Mr. Dead body.
Hudson medical school?
I can't believe they'd hire a sleazoid like Bianco.
Looks like he's an outside contractor.
Does that jacket say UPS?
It says APS.
Anatomical procurement services.
Cooler's too small for our body.
He didn't have time to cut it up.
This is unacceptable.
The order was for 20 knees.
"Well, the students will just have to share."
My students are surgeons getting CME credit in advanced arthroscopic techniques.
These people are not accustomed to sharing.
"Actually, they won't be a problem."
"I'm sorry, there is no auditing of this course."
We're not here to audit the course.
We're here to audit the school supplies.
This medical school buys thousands of body parts.
"But I assure you, all the paperwork is in order."
"Where do you think you're going, Frankenstein?"
"Well, I just make deliveries."
I don't know where they come from.
"- Russ Bianco, you're under arrest."
It wasn't the right code.
Tell me you killed the girl before you figured that out.
What?
Fuck!
They got to the emergency phones.
Just let me think.
"No one even knows we're in trouble, do they?"
"No, they don't."
"- There has to be a safety measure, right?"
- No.
- Something or someone?
- There's nothing.
Someone who cancels the broadcast when something like this happens.
There's no one.
"There has to be some kind of back-up, like an emergency back-up..."
Something like this doesn't happen.
"Seventy years, the code's never been breached."
Somebody has to be out there who can...
"Katherine, there's nothing but the goddamn numbers!"
"If we do our job, we get out of here alive."
I promise.
"You kill her for me, I let you live."
No.
We've gone to a lot of trouble here with these broadcasts.
We can't leave anything to chance.
We can't let the girl cancel the broadcasts.
She's the only one who can undo what's been done.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Go fuck yourself.
"Look, your bosses won't let her live."
She knows too much.
Either you or me or the Agency pulls the trigger.
"Always ask yourself, are there any hidden carbohydrates in the food you eat."
Watch fried foods.
"Now, whenever you do anything strenuous, check your pulse."
Do deep breathing exercises.
"Stay away from starches and sugars, and that's it."
"Now, if you will also supplement... with twice the adult minimum daily vitamin requirements... and do six and a half minutes of isometrics every day, it's easy, Bob."
Wouldn't it be easier if I just stopped eating?
"Yeah, that might work too."
"Hi, honey."
"- Hi, dear."
How'd it go with Dr. Klein?
"- Oh, fine."
Fine.
Good.
Any change since your last physical?
No.
Everything's fine.
"Oh, great."
"You want a drink before dinner, honey?"
No.
"Well, there's some fruit, if you wanna munch."
No munching.
"Bob, Is there something you're not telling me?"
"Well, I just have to go on a little diet."
I have to start counting the calories and... try to get rid of that.
"Oh, that?"
"Honey, that's just a little happy fat."
I think it's cute.
"Emily, fat isn't cute unless you're nine months old and you're playing with a Busy Box."
"Well, it shouldn't be hard to lose three or four pounds."
"- Uh, eight pounds."
- Eight?
And so early.
"Oh, Mr Reznik, I only wish all my tenants are considerate as you."
I will give you a receipt in the morning
"Good night, Mr. Reznik."
"Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me, but..."
Have you noticed anyone hanging around my apartment?
Has there been a burglary?
"No, no, no, nothing like that."
I just wondered if...
"You know, if... you noticed anything unusual lately?"
Unusual?
"Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike."
I am sorry to disturb you so late.
Good night.
What we know is this:
One:
Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.
Two:
Miller's arm was in the cutting zone of mill while it was off.
"Three: the mill suddenly activates, catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this."
What's the fucking point?
"These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik."
Our job is to investigate these events from every possible angle...
So that we might prevent their recurrence.
So we'd appreciate it if you would be a bit more co-operative.
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.
"What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?"
I was distracted.
By what?
What distracted you?
"It was Ivan, I was watching Ivan on the pit."
"The whole thing is my fault, okay."
"My theory is that these creatures, aliens feed of people like we feed about other creatures, and that they need for substinance a substance similar to opiates, heroin is an opiate, so this one can hear for it but they found something better!"
That substance is produced in the brain during an orgasm and is similar in chemical structure to opiates.
It is the key to get this substance.
Why didn't he kill me?
Did you have an orgasm?
No!
"In the end, in the end..."
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
Over there...
In the end.
In the end come on now.
We can be together now.
Come out!
You can feed on me if you want.
It's OK.
I don't mind.
Now you care for me.
We can be happy.
I wanna make love with you.
No!
You can't leave me.
Don't leave without me.
No!
No!
"Excuse me, I'm in a tremendous rush, I can't make any stop"
I've got to go strait to the penthouse.
"The penthouse, that's the same as the roof, that's where I'm going."
Looks like Adrian is having a party.
Adrian?
Who's Adrian?
This isn't the roof.
I was trying to piece together what happened that night she disappeared.
- He helped me fill in the blanks.
- What blanks?
He reminded me that I'd stopped by his dressing room during the intermission.
Reminded you?
You don't remember?
"Well, it was the first night back from the tour."
"Everything was so hectic, I..."
Did he remind you what you talked about?
Why are you taking this sarcastic tone with me?
Because it sounds like he was planting a false memory in your mind in order to come up with an alibi for himself.
An alibi?
Why would...
You think Philip killed her.
You are insane!
I can't listen to this.
I can't!
Planted memory.
Maybe we can turn it into probable cause.
"I'm warning you, doctor, if you faint, I'm not responsible."
I'll try to control myself.
"By the way, your production of Aida five years ago, one of the best nights of my life."
Lennie Briscoe took me.
Do you know how many singers I've led in that role?
"Tebaldi, Price, Milanov, Caballe."
What's this underneath the makeup?
A boil or something.
Looks like a bite mark.
- Human bite.
- That's not possible.
Don't move.
I need to take a photo.
Fantastic.
A truly great sleep.
"On the scale of one to five - 5,429,562."
Sleeping face down in the toilet is conducive to restful slumber?
And why shouldn't I sleep in the lavatory?
You wet the bed.
Once.
I had a nightmare that I was ordinary and untalented and there was a momentary aberration.
It's a sign of an extra-vivid subconscious.
It's a sign of an extra-drippy tiddler.
"Eddie, I was having a nightmare that I was a pleb."
It was a horrifying experience.
I remember the night so well.
I awoke to hear Richie screaming into the middle of the night.
"""Ah. "" His heart-rending sobs echoing round the house."
"Why, you wept like a soul in torment."
"I rushed in to find poor, frightened Richie shivering, terrified, white, sitting in a puddle."
"- Yes, and what did you do?"
- I don't remember.
You switched on my electric blanket.
Only to take your mind off the nightmare.
You completely electrocuted my love truncheon.
Love truncheon?
"Love pencil, more like."
"Well, love pin, actually."
"Eddie, what's this?"
- I don't know.
- It's one of my scary looks.
Is it really?
My intimidating frown.
So you just watch out.
Has the hair grown back yet?
Flippa!
(retching)
"What gives, brah?"
You're supposed to be my GPS.
"Sorry, cuz, I got seasick."
I see why our navigation system's on the fritz.
"Well, leaving your first mate in charge of the liquor may not have been the most prudent move."
"Don't sweat it, Doc."
I got an auxiliary engine just for this situation.
(engine whining)
I assume you checked that the battery was charged before we set sail.
This thing has a battery?
Mayday.
Mayday.
This is the SS Thong Magnet needing emergency assistance.
And I'm afraid the radio is powered by the battery as well.
And we lost cell service a few hours ago.
Why are you so calm about this?
"Well, I project outward confidence as a way of coping with stress."
"Inside, I'm terrified."
We're gonna die out here.
Nobody's dying on my watch.
All we got to do is send a distress signal up.
Coast Guard will come and tow us to shore.
(clicking)
"You got to be kidding me, brah."
Must be a safety-- give it here.
"Sure, let the drunk guy handle the firearm."
Great idea.
"Everyone chill, I got this."
"Well, there's no missing that."
I heard you got something.
He's not competent to make this decision.
We're not praying.
"We're taking the medication, and we're gonna get you home."
And you're gonna be all better.
Shh.
This stuff is hard to come by...
Psilocybin cubensis.
Where did you get it?
From a colleague running a clinical trial.
I have to send back what's left over.
I'm packing it into a gelatin capsule.
The trick is to get just the right amount.
It lessens the chance of a bad reaction.
Great.
Here's the leftovers.
- Put them in a safe place.
"- Thanks, I appreciate it."
My pleasure.
"Most people experience some nausea, but don't worry."
It soon passes.
I've set you up with five hours' worth of beautiful music.
- Ah.
"- Listening to music helps, so..."
Can I have the remote?
Thank you.
"Manuel will be standing by at all times with a tranquilizer, so if there's anything that feels uncomfortable or you feel any fear, you... you just speak up."
"- You say so, all right?"
- All right.
Okay.
How's the volume?
You let me know if there's any problems right away.
"Well, it's real sweet of you to keep coming here for lunch."
"And this is my property, so police or no police, you're trespassing."
- Now what do you want?
- A man was killed last night not half a mile from here.
- Where were you?
"- ""Where were you?"""
Don't you be flimflamming with your penny-ante questions.
"You're not interested in where ""I"" was."
Very well.
Where was she?
She was locked up all night and nowhere near your dead man.
(Murdoch):
And why do you keep her caged?
To keep her safe.
It's in her own best interest.
"And charging admission to view her in a cage, is that also in her best interest?"
She's... paying her keep.
"- Mr. Travis, is it?"
- Aye.
You're coming with us to the Station House.
- I have no reason to.
- Do I have to arrest you?
- Come on!
- Don't lay your hands on me.
- (girl grunting)
- I'm doing nothing the law says I can't!
Unlawful confinement of a person or persons.
You're coming with us.
I finished my anatomy report on the unclaimed bank robber.
- Mrs. Braxton?
- Yes.
"I appreciated the opportunity, Dr. Ogden."
"Well, if you put what you learn to good use, her unfortunate death will not be for nothing."
"Here, here, wait a minute, here."
"Listen, you jerks, talk to each other."
(overlapping chatter over phones)
(all yelling)
BARBELLA:
Attention!
"All right, now let's straighten this out."
"Zimmerman, you and Paparelli got guard duty."
You're nuts.
"Bilko never put two on, two off."
(all yelling)
(clamoring)
"Men, it's good to be back again."
"Now, uh, what's the trouble?"
(all yelling)
ANNOUNCER:
Morgan was played by Horace McMahon.
I WALK IN THE SUN
Let's go in.
Silent sculptures are looking at us.
They can only speak through their shape.
"And what we can read from their language, we'll be forever our property."
This works of art must have been made by an artist working in turbulent 20th century.
He expressed the tragedy and dignity of a man of our times.
His name is Xawery Dunikowski.
"Sculptor, painter, educator, builder of the People's Republic of Poland."
"During 60 years of his career, hands of the artist knew no rest searching forms for ideas that were always original and full of humanism."
In 1955 we were celebrating his 80th birthday and 60 years of creative work.
"So much work, so many battles with recalcitrant matter."
So many works of art.
Let's go between the sculptures.
It's not just that worrying you.
You can't stop thinking about that portrait of your family.
It won't get out of my head.
Just yesterday I was posing with my family.
My mother scolded me because I wouldn't sit still.
"When we finish the mission, we'll find out what happened to your family."
"I don't know if I want to find out, Julián."
There it is.
A new mission awaits us.
Victory or death.
I prefer the first one.
Me too.
You two go and see the Prior.
And you?
I'll start looking.
With this habit no one will suspect anything.
Be careful.
And to what do we owe your visit?
There is a risk of imminent attack by the Maquis.
I doubt it.
We are peaceful people.
and because of that have always been respected.
A big fish in the German army is coming to visit this monastery.
We need to be sure that nothing happens to him.
"Do what you wish, but do not bother the brothers."
You've arrived just at lunch time.
(Door creaking open)
(Two shots)
Throw down your weapons!
"Look, how thoughtful."
This one doesn't need subtitles.
I said to throw down your weapons.
"- I went to vocational school, Sir."
"Besides, I wasn't born yet."
"- Yes, how time flies!"
"""Ruit hora"" as says.. um..."
- Horace.
- Horace.
"I was saying, our case is one of mythomania."
The word comes from the Greek:
"mitos, myth, mania, mania."
"It's formed in the psyche, in the subconscious, a sort of gap."
"It lowers, it lowers blinds that.."
Blocks the memory.
"- No, not exactly."
It lowers the blinds..
"yeah, fine, that blocks the memory."
"Excuse me, Sir, did you see that guy?"
Can it really be him?
"That's not a man but a gnome, a runt!"
"- Papa, what do you know, excuse me?"
"It's a question of the subconscious, as the counselor rightly said."
It all depends on the fact that if it lowers we call it blinds.
We all have our blinds.
"Oh, perfect!"
"You have believed in good faith, and we'll support you with our doctrine that he was the other."
In these long years of solitude you created from reality a totally ideal image that matched the other.
"Don't worry, ma'am, I'll take care of you."
Thank you.
"Sir, excuse me, what about Mario?"
"Mario, who is Mario?"
- What do you mean?
"Mario De Santis, her husband."
- No.
Come to the window
"All those windows out there, I'm behind one of them"
What do you want?
I've had it I'm getting out
"Don't leave me, Elizabeth"
Where are you going?
Somewhere you'll never find me
I'll find you I don't give up
"Sweet dreams, Elizabeth"
How many?
Two thousand tenants.
Fascinating.
"In addition, we can handle up to 5,000 visitors a day."
That's a lot of people to have over for drinks.
"You have 80 miles of wiring, piping, cables..."
- In this apartment?
"- No, over the whole building."
That's a relief.
There's a restaurant in the foyer which serves what we consider the finest seafood.
We also have a gift shop and a wedding chapel.
- Mother will like that.
"- Oh, Mother wants you married, huh?"
Mother wants herself married.
It's looking pretty good now that she's got this aluminum siding salesman from Toronto.
I think they're going to move here.
She wants to be close to me.
Maybe we can show her one of our two-bedroom apartments.
"Well, I'm afraid not."
I was lying.
No aluminum siding salesman.
No mother.
I've developed this strange sense of humor and it sometimes gets me into trouble.

You knew when the job is a risk!
"Look, look ..."

I'm sorry.
This is something that came with the business.
"John, I'll give 3 referral:"
"Back to work, go to therapy, and he sold the house shit."

No.
Nothing odd going on here.

Dr. Desmond.
"Tell me, Guardian, what part of no interruptions did you not understand?"
A G-Gnome on Sub-Level 26 reports three intruders.
-Ugh.
Did I miss a perimeter breach alert?
-No.
Then the G-Gnome's confused.
Whatever might occur in our faux lab above ground the real Cadmus is the most secure facility in D.C.
My job to keep it that way.
Fine.
Take a squad.
Might I recommend Guardian leave his G-Gnome behind?
If violence should occur....
-The little guy would be in my way.
-No.
The advantage of instant telepathic communication outweighs other concerns.
I need my G-Gnome with me at all times.
"Okay, I'm officially whelmed."
This is how they hide this massive underground facility from the world .
The real Cadmus isn't on the grid.
It generates its own power with these things.
Must be what they're bred for.
Even the name is a clue.
The Cadmus of myth created a new race by sowing dragon's teeth into the earth.
And this Cadmus creates new life too.
Let's find out why.
They call them Genomorphs.
Look at the stats on these things.
"Super-strength, telepathy, razor claws."
I always said you were my brightest student.
It worked.
All living things contain carbon.
"In fact, the term ""organic"" is often defined as"
"""containing carbon."""
"One carbon isotope present in all living forms is carbon-14, which has a half-life of 5,730 years."
"Meaning in that amount of time, half the carbon-14 of a dead organism will decay."
"By measuring the ratio of the remaining carbon-14, we can determine the life of an organic sample, such as the cloth of an Egyptian mummy, or the ashes of a caveman's fire."
Tomorrow I'll demonstrate this process in the university lab.
Hiya.
MacGyver.
Is it really you?
I think so.
"How are you, Kelly?"
I didn't think I'd see you again after you left Thera.
"What's it been, four years?"
Five.
Ah.
"This is for you, teach."
Are you finally flirting with me?
Um...
"Actually, it's a bribe."
I need your help.
Funny.
Didn't think you needed anyone's help.
You'd be surprised.
What is that?
Some kind of oxidized matter.
"Yeah, it's off an artifact Professor Atticus and I found."
"""Atlantis"" Atticus?"
"My grandfather still talks about him, none too fondly, I might add."
"Yeah, I'll bet."
"When Stone stepped out of the front door, his career would be over."
"Good luck in the polls, Mr. Stone."
"Mr. Stone, what is this about an alleged--"
Hey!
Hey!
I don't know.
I didn't do anything!
"Then, as the cameras flashed,"
Melissa had the mother of all sneezing fits.
[Sneezes repeatedly]
"Mr. Stone, what did you do to your intern?"
I didn't do anything!
What happened back there?
Do you have a comment?
Melissa suffered from...
"Otherwise known as ""achoo syndrome."""
Achoo syndrome.
It's a genetically inherited condition.
"An exposure bright light can cause you to uncontrollably sneeze,"
"50, 60, 70 times."
"The violent sneezing caused an injury to the lining of her aorta, causing the blood to actually go between the leaves of the heart valve itself, and blood being spewed out into her chest cavity, dying within seconds."
Melissa played Stone like a pro.
I need everyone out front at 7:30.
She set him up to knock him down.
[Sneezes repeatedly]
But then she went down.
Get that thing out of my face!
"God bless ya, bitch."
What do you say we run through this one?
"- Yeah, one more time."
"- All right, let's do it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry and the Atrics."
who are you?
Muthu's brother in law Muthu's brother in law?
Nothing will happen But we must be alert
"You said, you won't come to the temple"
-But you have come
- What If I come?
"No, you said, you will not come what if I said?"
"No uncle What do you mean by no,uncle?"
-Uncle -what uncle?
"-Why, this to me?"
-What do you mean by why this to me?
"-No uncle -what, no uncle?"
-Gosh
-What gosh?
-Aha -what Aha?
I will smack you
-Worship God
-What do you mean by worship God?
"Smart guy, has become alert"
Was this girl not named so long?
They name her only now
This is a tradition followed by us
"For newly married,before the family deity"
"She will be named again, same name only"
"After marriage, you will also be named like this"
Why did he come here?
Has he come to defame me?
"Ask him to go out He said, he will not come"
"But he has come, but how can we send him out?"
Will he not keep quiet?
If you put stone mortar in his mouth he will keep quiet
"But he will not keep quiet, when he sees Arul"
- The guy you kind of saw?
The guy that I saw leaving must've stolen the sword
And hidden in this room over here
When he set off the bomb.
I collected these grenades years ago.
Every last one of them.
I know I did.
"So, wait, whoever stole the sword"
Has other things that belong in the warehouse--
Which would mean that we have competition.
I don't know.
"Artie, just how long is this list of things"
We don't know?
I don't know.
About twice as long as the list of things
"That I don't know about, all right?"
"Well, who else would have these implosion grenades, Artie,"
"I mean, if you collected them all?"
"Well, whoever it is, if he's willing to use this"
"To cover his tracks, then it's somebody that's--"
What's a darker word for dangerous?
"If he did this to steal the sword,"
He'd have no trouble killing anyone
Who got in his way.
"Oh, none at all."
"Next time, don't get a suite--just a room."
Okay.
The lead here is the implosion grenade.
We find out who had one of those
And then we find out
Who has the sword.
"Okay, let me just--"
You complain to the collector?
Face the consequences
The roads are in poor condition in our area
Why do you place the tar barrels at my door?
Didn't you ask for roads?
Next month will get stone pebbles....
Will the stork eat the fish?
Or will the fish eat the stork?
Man will eat both....
-What do you want now?
-I want Arul now
Why does the Satan riding the cycle ask for the cockroach riding the bike?
I must get Arul now
To get grace go to the temple Or do a fire walk
-I will walk upon you
-Should not talk like that
I will talk like that only
Won't you respect your brother?
You call yourself a brother
Who said you are my brother?
Look at his ugly face They have named a tin as 'Gold'....
"Sir, are there no female members here?"
-Swarnam
-Yes coming
What do you want?
We have moved to your opposite house
We are doing house warming today
All of you must come
I may not be able to come why don't you go and attend?
Mom said a senior like you should conduct the Pooja
OK we will come
Why do you look through a lens?
Now that Samm...
"Now that my brother has gone, I must find something with which to occupy myself."
I've responsibilities.
Dependents.
I've decided that to continue with the agency.
"I understand, Sammy discussed with you Baker's Dunkirk film?"
The role of an inebriated uncle.
No!
"You know, after conversations like this with my brother I would say, ""What have you got to lose by being honest Sammy?"""
"Explain to the man, he's 63."
Not 36.
"And that he's pre-flown to fame is ""Inspector Chamfold""."
Chamforth.
Inspector Chamforth.
Please be calm Mr.Hilliard.
I'm perfectly calm.
What you're seeing is controlled anger tempered with ice headed detachment.
This is one of the many subtle emotions which a good actor is capable of.
Three weeks and location Devon.
Followed by three in a London studio.
There are currently only nine films in pre-production with the studios.
None of the others hold a role for you.
"I hope I share some of my brother's qualities, Mr.Ambrose. I do not however share his sentimental attachments."
I'll not keep un-profitable clients on the books.

Oh!

Excellent choice.
Too long.
Lose half.
Which half?
Who to?
Admiral Jackson is in command of the squadron blockading Rochefort.
"Sail Defiant to Rochefort, is that what you're asking?"
"Sail her up to the squadron, alongside English men-of-war?"
"Yes, I am asking you to do that if you care for the safety of your country."
If you don't wish to see her humiliated and overrun by Frenchmen.
"- Well, what will become of us?"
- How can I promise anything?
Their lordships at the Admiralty do not encourage mutiny.
- It was never intended this way.
"- What way, then?"
A petition?
I see.
Bit late for petitions now.
"All right, we'll sail to Rochefort."
"- Lf we do, will you stand by us?"
- I'll do my best for you.
All of you.
I'll submit all the facts in your favour.
But I warn you if any harm comes to a single officer...
A single officer.
I understand.
"Very sorry you lost the arm, sir."
He's promised to speak for us when the time comes.
Can we trust him?
"What, trust an officer?"
- To hell with England!
- I've got a family back home!
I don't want Frenchmen tramping through my house.
"Sergeant, watch him."
All our lives depend on this.
"For the present, we're agreed."
Alright?
Good.
So tell me...
Can you be trusted?
That's enough Tom.
"... It's a place, an organism, an arrangement  that operates primarily without money or monetary transactions ... but rather human interaction, so that we may confront one another  and exchange ideas, where everyone can find their own voice  and achieve a self-realization."
That's the top priority.
We are open to everyone who really wishes to contribute and live among us.
What develops here depends on each and every one of us.
That's the basic idea.
Very good.
Hello.
"Ah, my neighbor."
"Yes, that's right."
Let's sing something together.
I'm a friend to the art of singing.
"Sounds like there's a ""but"" coming."
But... only when I feel like it.
It's much different for me.
I could sing all day long.
"Obviously, you don't like my singing."
No.
It's dreadful.
I'm just being honest.
That's how I am.
I'm very sorry but your singing annoys me.
That's why you're here?
I just wanted to make that clear before we get closer to each other.
Who says that I want to get closer to you?
Get out!
The Goldfish
- Welcome to the news!
'Give him some roses
'She loves them so.'
We'II start taking statements.
"I'm Gary Racine, Detective Sergeant provincial police."
"Jacques PIante, also Detective Sergeant."
We'II take your statements.
They mentioned 4 witnesses...
including him?
"No, it's..."
Josée Morin.
She's still in there with the doctor.
- Detective Sergeant Racine.
"- Yes, yes..."
We mustn't talk too loud.
"It's not good for her, even if she's sedated."
You gave her some...
Sedatives?
"Yes, yes."
I had no choice.
She's in a terrible state of shock.
But did she talk to you?
Yes.
She had a very bad night.
She can't remember...
"The way she speaks isn't very coherent, but I still managed to get a few bits of information on what happened."
"First of all... one, she's a woman who was at the hotel and who was having drinks with some... alcohol, and who suffered a terrible shock, which would have been preceded by a perturbation of an emotional nature... which was followed by a sort of blackout."
"But she will recall some elements, always the same ones."
I have noted that.
really?
Which ones?
That she found herself in this bedroom.
"Then... that her right cheek was tumefied,"
A kidnap?
!
"What are you, the cockney Al-Qaeda?"
"Don't shit yourself, we're going for a drive."
"- Hello, mate!"
"- Come on, is this really necessary?"
What about my allergies?
!
Let's talk about this.
Please!
My allergies!
"Wasn't expecting that, was you, mastermind?"
!
See you tomorrow!
Institutionalised bullying wasn't quite the work experience I had in mind.
But I knew how to deal with bullies.
I got my mum to tell the teacher.
"I was hoping you'd be able to do something about it, Mr Gilbert."
- I'm sorry.
- I just wonder what he said to them.
"- I don't think he said anything, Kevin."
- He must have said something.
He walked back through the town centre sopping wet and barely clothed.
I'd hoped you'd take this more seriously.
"He wrote to the paper especially to get work experience, and instead I'm picking frogspawn out of his underpants."
Would you excuse me just for a second?
Ooooooooh God!
"Look,"
"I really want to help, but it's not my responsability."
"I will ask if they'll consider swapping students, but I can't promise anything."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I do have a meeting to attend to."
What a pickle!
Why should we?
We didn't have anything anyone would want!
"Easy, easy."
They poured it on like...
"Like phasers, only worse, whatever they were using."
I tried to signal them.
"We called up, tried to surrender."
We had women and children.
I told them that.
I begged them.
They wouldn't listen.
They didn't let up for a moment.
"Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus III."
One for the Enterprise to go there and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.
"They hit us a full day before you got there, captain."
"No messages came from us, captain."
Why did they do it?
Why?
Why did they do it?
There has to be a reason.
- There has to be a reason!
- It was a trap.
Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus III.
Getting us and our whole crew to come ashore.
Very clever.
As to the reason...
The reason is crystal clear.
The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation.
"Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open."
"You allude to invasion, captain, yet positive proof has not..."
I have all the proof I need on Cestus III.
"Not necessarily, sir."
Do you want to come?
EVERYTHING IS READY
I am very contented to see everyone reunited here.
For me it is something indespensible.
I am happy that you have prevailed in life and that you have become fortunate.
Today we will celebrate.
A party like in our youth.
I hope you have a prosperous future.
Today's special:
CURRY RICE. 15 CENTS
It's a pity on a day like this if you must pay.
For us the times ahead are very difficult.
"You are in luck, there's a job for you."
English Teacher in a girl's school.
How is your English?
Therefore you will no longer be anxious.
The school is in the city of Tochigi.
Shall we go?
"Don't be sad, someday we shall return to Tokyo."
You have not rid yourself of the vice of arriving late?
Let us sing the hymn of the school.
Three springs pass so quickly.
Your face is still as vibrant as a scarlet flower.
"Now we take leave of each other, in a future we'll meet again."

TEGEL PENAL INSTITUTION
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Your streetcar's over there.
Go on now.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know.
If there's another way to go
I missed it 20 long years ago
My life was a war that could never be won
They gave me a number and they murdered Valjean
When they chained me and left me for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Yet why did I allow this man
To touch my soul and teach me love?
He treated me like any other
He gave me his trust He called me brother
My life he claims for God above
Can such things be?
For I had come to hate the world
This world that always hated me!
Take an eye for an eye!
Turn your heart into stone!
This is all I have lived for!
This is all I have known!
One word from him and I'd be back
"Beneath the lash, upon the rack"
Instead he offers me my freedom!
I feel my shame inside me like a knife
He told me that I have a soul
How does he know?
What spirit comes to move my life?
(WEEPING)
Is there another way to go?
I am reaching but I fall
And the night is closing in
As I stare into the void
To the whirlpool of my sin
"But...was not a ditch, major lord We jumped a shade."
"- You are crazy, Tót."
- Me?
No.
-Maybe I am the fool?
"Ow my god...no, no, no.How I would dare this assumed from my son's benefactor?"
"If you knew that this is the ditch, not ditch, you should have warned!"
Into a unpleasant situation brought for before Sóskuti.
Since just yeah.
"If I speak on the before Sóskuti,then ...major lord."
...let us go rather under the gardens.
"Nothing saves your action, Tót."
I insist on this road already now.
"Take care, major lord!"
"Jump, Tót."
After the respectable major lord only.
Do not argue.
I do not like the politesse.
- Sóskuti!
"- Yes, major lord!"
The thread of his hair will not bend for your younger brother.
Thank you very much major lord.

Based on the life of Nolberto Coria
Customers were witness to the havoc created.
Some good Samaritans had to help her to get out of the vehicle because she was hurt.
Some gangsters were about to die at the hands of an enraged crowd in Guatemala.
The so-called criminals were whipped and had to walk naked on the streets as punishment.
The crowd thought them guilty of extortion and robberies.
Policemen and soldiers rescued them before they were killed.
A substitute teacher gave a hard punishment to a six-year-old boy...
Hello.
"Yes, madam."
Yes.
"Yes, of course."
Paa.
- After a fashion.
- Paa...
Do you think maybe she recognizes that I'm Roland's father?
And that's what all the speaking and gestures are about?
It seems to be some form of primitive language.
- Pa.
"- Well, we know she had a father at some point."
It appears so.
- (indistinct conversations)
- I've been expecting your call.
You have?
You don't seem the type of person who's comfortable with unanswered questions.
I want you to keep looking for his parents.
"Well, in fact,"
"I've carried on with my search, anticipating this very thing."
So you have something?
Please tell me it's not a mother pining for her lost child.
Not exactly.
"After her parents died,"
I found out that Joanne Perly left Stratford.
But the trail went cold after that.
So I checked into Mr. Braxton.
It seems he left England for the bright lights of Brantford.
"There, he met and married Joanne."
How did they get Roland?
The woman I think was Roland's mother lived out of town on a homestead.
She went into labour earlier than her time.
"There were complications, and she died."
What happened to Roland?
The rural midwife was the only person present.
She reported that the baby was never delivered.
Don't bother about it.
Since when was he staying here?
They vacated last week.
THEY vacated?
How many people?
"This guy, and another man with you."
What was the other man's age?
- Probably within 30.
Take the register and look for the entry.
Here.
This one?
"SIRI, call."
98942-83-834.
"The phone number, address, and other information from the lodge are fake."
The number is registered on a fake company's name.
They have been using it illegally.
The SIM had been active till his death.
Now it's not in use.
What about the incoming and outgoing call details?
Not too many calls.
But there are repeated calls from a number.
The number that ends with 333.
I enquired about that as well.
That's also illegal.
Not in use.
Did you get information about the other guy in the lodge?
We didn't get enough details about him.
There is just one window open for investigation now.
We have to find the one who killed him in the accident.
Our program's main concept is to find information about the unidentified dead people.
We can enquire about the rest later.
Looks like I often have to remind you who's the cop.
Go!
Go!
Move!
Move!
Go!
"This is yet another liberal attack on our values, our families and on our way of life."
"On the subject of gay marriage, remember this, people."
This is not about the union of two people of the same sex.
"This, this is clearly the work of liberal judges who are trying to force their will on you, the American people."
Society at large is better served by maintaining the sacred tradition of marriage.
As in a man and a woman joined together by holy matrimony.
The people know it.
You know it.
And I know it.
This is Jim O'Bannon reporting.
"Good night, everybody, and thanks for watching The O'Bannon Files."
Yeah?
"Arbor's gone, sir."
Missed his assignment in Seattle.
What happened?
I'm not sure what happened.
He just vanished.
"So the guy doesn't complete his assignment, and you have no fucking idea where he is."
This is unacceptable.
Do you understand?
I understand.
I'm gonna make it right.
I have Senate Oversight all over my ass.
And I'm meeting with the director tonight.
The last thing I need is a failed assignment by a rogue agent who disappeared and didn't follow orders.
He is your man.
He is your responsibility.
That picture was taken after the attack at the ruins.
Three weeks ago?
!
Why didn't you tell me about this?
!
it's obvious that they're targeting you.
That's too great of a risk for us.
my friend was used as a human bomb!
Are you asking me to look away on this one?
Noah's ark is a very dangerous ruin.
I can't let you go there in the state you're in.
this mission is too much for the injuries that you've incurred.
and...
You must be joking!
A challenge has been directed straight at me!
I'll settle this myself!
Yu!
Here you go.
Thank you.
Professor Mayzel is researching the spot.
Doc Mayzel is..?
This plane is now entering Turkish air space.
An unknown fighter of unknown origin has ordered us to change our course.
Our permission to land from at Devas airport from ground control has been cancelled.
We are now heading for Istanbul.
agents from the Turkey branch of the Arcam Foundation are working to make alternate travel arrangements.
what a tender welcome.
Did you come to fight a war?
Seize them!
I'm very sorry about that.
We were supposed to have had an agreement.
let's just take it easy.
"Mr. Moreau, excuse me."
They just informed me
Which unfortunately our president will arrive later.
We can offer a visit to His Majesty and to the Belgian Ambassador
Of the Miniatiürk Park while we are waiting?
"Mr. Moreau, what about the Atomium?"
"The Turks have a lot to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,"
Commander of the Turkish forces in the War of Independence
And founder of the Turkish Republic.
And they expressed their gratitude by building this colossal mausoleum.
Freedom or death.
"He was a man with a clear vision, did not he?"
Yes.
"We all admire Kemal Atatürk, His Majesty."
"Listen to your vision, Turkey today would be a very different country."
This is the last reappearance of the king running in the park like a puppet.
There was going to be a news bomb and there would not be a script.
Ludovic!
Wallonia has declared independence!
Belgium collapsed!
Their declaration of independence is called 'We're Tired'.
Fed up?
About what?
"The valleys feel faint, humiliated, and misunderstood by the Flemings."
They are tired.
We must go back to Belgium immediately.
We will arrive at the airport in ninety minutes.
Ready?
Could you repeat that?
His Majesty the King wishes to speak to the Minister-Walloon President.
Ready?
Ludovic?
Dodo and Wakizaka continue to clash?
"Internal division is the greatest enemy, Your Eminence."
Reasonable amount of rivalry can so increase productivity.
But the fact that there is Konishi behind Dodo and Kato behind Wakizaka is what bothers me.
"If I keep them together, they will be more concerned with fight for power than fight against Chosun."
How about changing the lineup of the advance guards?
That's what we will do.
Send Wkizaka with Konishi.
Konishi thinks too much.
He needs a decisive comrade to push him.
"And for the same reason, we will pair Dodo with Kato."
High Commander...
His Majesty has acknowledged your loyalty.
Sir!
Weigh it.
Hurry up!
We don't need to!
It's much lighter!
Be quiet.
From now on we're going to look a hundred times before we leap.
As we should!
Is that good?
"That's good, isn't it?"
I think it's light enough that we won't have any problem with the force of restoration.
Yes!
"What's wrong, Lieutenant?"
I though you'd jump for joy.
"If we use copper and iron alloy, our problem will be solved."
Right?
Then our problem is solved!
What's wrong?
Copper is many times more expensive than iron.
But I'm the one who processed it like this.
It's always interesting to process other people's photographs.
What about this part?
Did you cover part of the negative?
"No I didn't, the negative ends somewhere here."
"Here I didn't expose it, and here I used a light pencil."
Do you recognize me?
Is this a person?
A painting?
"It's not a painting, it's a real man."
"He wasn't naked, even though the picture suggests otherwise."
"He's perfect like this, isn't he?"
"Yes, yes."
"Is this picture called ""vertigo""?"
"Yes well, it's called like this for anecdotic reasons."
Because I saw the film after...
"I took the picture, well it was the same afternoon but.."
"It isn't very related, even though I was..."
I suffered from vertigo while taking it.
I was quite drunk.
This bottle is almost empty.
It's a very strange story.
The story of the shooting of the picture is quite special.
Would you mind telling me?
It's quite obscene.
I was...
In a position...
An embarassing situation with a friend.
Who...
"I lit a cigarette, and he told me..."
"""You're lighting a cigarette now, like an Amsterdam whore..."""
"And I say ""Yes, why not?"""
"Yes, but beyond that."
The law is too narrow for me.
"For instance, the felon who never gets caught is still a felon, right?"
Right.
"Should he be noted, too?"
- I guess he should.
But how would you find one?
- That's another question.
"When we agree about that, the things get complicated."
"Is it a crime when father spends all his paycheck on booze, while his children walk around in torn shoes?"
That's a complex question.
Is it a crime when one doesn't care about his ill parents?
"I guess it is, if you say so."
That's why one should record it all.
"Otherwise, statistics is not complete."
"That's ok, but..."
I can't see why...
"- Why is all this for, right?"
Yes.
- I'm not surprised.
"As a matter of fact, I haven't explained you all about my work and what is the result derived from it even from afar."
You don't see a purpose.
Right?
"Explain me, then."
"Roughly, at least."
"Look, knowing about something means a lot, right?"
Right.
"The closer we get to the complete knowledge about what a crime is and how it occurs,"
I guess the sooner we'll destroy it.
"Yes, maybe."
- It's doubtless.
That's it.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, who was that?"
Goes by the name of Hector.
"Well dressed, well spoken, a grave manner, spitting image of you, in fact."
Are you referring to what I think you are?
To what do you think I'm referring?
"Every so often, I pay a visit to a friend of mine."
"We have tea and converse, for reasons I do not understand, and with no encouragement on my part, she likes to call me Hector."
Tea?
Tea!
Of course.
"Don't worry, the King will know nothing of these tea parties."
Hector.
I have not yet found the opportunity.
You must be patient.
I cannot be patient.
I know him.
"If I wait, he will find another, but not your equal."
But you agree.
He will find someone else.
This is the first time...
What?
...that I've see you like this.
Not the cold and distant goddess that breaks every man's heart and strikes fear into everyone in the salon but
"but soft, human, vulnerable."
And broken.
Go and see him.
Confront him.
Tell him your feelings.
"You're wasting your time, waiting and hoping."
"If he accepts you back, then you have reaped the rewards of your courage."
And if he rejects me?
"You write ""step out""... with ""on your debts"""
"means ""run out"""
Let's try that again
Abacus and Writing Lessons Clear the abacus for the next calculation...
Abacus and Writing Lessons
Abacus and Writing Lessons That's 7 pence
That's 7 pence
Eight pence
Five pence
Two pence
Three pence
"If you're going to teach, why not teach swordfighting?"
What's the point in a world with no more war?
Idiot
But a samurai teaching the abacus?
Got nothing to do with avenging...
"As they say, ""Hunger is a terrible master..."""
"""Hunger's the master"""
"The point is, a man doesn't need to read if he's got the guts to fight"
"As they say here, ""Only the countrymen keep their money"""
We spend our money as soon as we make it.
Who needs calculations?
You're not even from around here
"You're in the way, move"
What do you want in there?
Soza san to teach me how to write
"You, too?"
At least I'll learn how to write my own name
"You have no guts You should learn, too"
Damn it
"""My own name"" my ass!"
"I'll never write a single word, until the day I die"
"- Clear this area, please."
"Everybody, can we just clear out of this area?"
There is another restroom under the stairs to the left.
What's going on out here?
Angry mob getting angrier.
And somebody's still packing.
There you are.
City roads are bad enough-- forget about getting to the airport.
That our fake air marshal?
I.D.'d from the fingerprint that Bishop sent over.
Facial recognition came up empty for a reason.
This guy is a notorious chameleon.
"Well, it would explain why Bishop found him familiar, but not familiar enough."
Norman Dopps.
Name rings a bell.
Maybe because he comes up on our Most Wanted updates every week.
He's this go-to jack-of-all-trades for organized crime families and drug cartels and other horrible people that can afford him.
Any terrorist affiliation?
Probably... the only thing that's not on his record.
Why?
Chatter may not be about him.
"Not so fast, boss."
Chatter's changed again.
Look at this.
"On it, Gibbs."
We'll call you back.
I knew I'd seen his face before;
the Most Wanted updates.
I check them religiously.
"Well, I guess I'm only mildly religious."
"What did Gibbs say, Tony?"
Homeland now thinks it's an assassination plan.
Mother!
"All right, Regan, let's see what the trouble--"
Regan!
Keep away!
The sow is mine!
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
Stay away from me!
Stay away!
Hold her steady.
Hold her tight!
Don't let them!
She's heavily sedated.
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
What was going on in there?
How could she fly off the bed like that?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength accelerated motor performance.
For example say a 90-pound woman sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck runs out and lifts the wheels a half a foot up off the ground.
You've heard the story.
Same thing here.
"Same principle, I mean."
"So, what's wrong with her?"
We still think that the temporal lobe--
"Oh, what are you talking about, for Christ's sakes?"
Did you see her or not?
She's acting like she's fucking out of her mind!
"Psychotic, like a split personality, or...."
"Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry."
"There haven't been more than 100 authentic cases of so-called ""split personality,"" Mrs. MacNeil."
"Now, I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first."
"So, what's next?"
- Very well
"""This is the first time it's happening in 18 years"""

Who's he?
"Ma, I've yet to set my eyes on him"
So there's no one?
I was wondering.
One doesn't find such boys nowadays
And you dream of someone you haven't even seen!
Quite mad
No Ma.

To save the historic Estabul from Roland...
I don't care what happens to the kingdom!
The people come first!
Will this really make the people happy?
Isn't it just excessive bloodshed?
I'll be satisfied if the people can live happily.
"Aren't you the one who taught me that, Salawell?"
"Right now, our forces are still strong."
So Roland won't get too brazen.
But there's no guarantee of that in the future.
"I've heard terrible rumors about Roland nobility, too."
"If you truly want to consider the people, now is the time."
"If you speak thus, it must be so."
"For you, we would not shrink even from death."
"I want to make a kingdom where everyone can live with a smile, where everyone can be happy!"
"Can I do it, Salawell?"
Of course you can!
We shall henceforth do battle with Roland!
We shall take back Estabul's independence ourselves!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
I bear a message from Rear Admiral Klom!
The battle has commenced!
"Shuss, what are the enemy numbers?"
Roughly eight to nine thousand.
Exactly as Froaude's information claimed.
- I don't like it.
- Sir?
Nothing.
We'll end this with minimal casualties.
Let's go!
"All forces, advance!"
- Your wedding?
- I'm engaged to be married.
We haven't announced it yet.
Father said it was an awful comedown for an earl's daughter to marry a mere baronet.
He was joking of course.
He didn't care about things like that.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Lady Carnarvon.
The carriages are ready.
Goodbye.
This is for you.
It's the terms of the concession.
My husband was very keen that you continue with your work.
"He agreed with the government that you remain in charge of the clearance of the tomb, no matter whether it remain intact or not."
- I won't let him down.
- No.
"- Goodbye, Howard."
- Goodbye.
MACE:
I think we're going to have to lift this frame up a couple of feet to get the right angle of leverage.
"Ali, Ali, can you give me the rope?"
- How's it going?
- Good.
"If you're looking at the damage, don't blame us."
They must have just banged it into position.
They don't seem to have taken much care.
It took us 12 hours to get the last one out.
We should be able to restore it.
When are you going to be ready in there?
I don't know.
There's a crack across the lid.
"That and the V.A. records, yes."
Do you mind passing this on to the judge?
--based on only one interview?
"The defendant has a lengthy, documented case--"
Please answer the question.
-Would you restate the question?
-All right.
"Based on that one interview, you were able--?"
Where are you going with this?
"Your Honor, the witness interprets the defendant V.A. record one way..."
... ourpsychologist interprets it another.
Another and another until the end of time.
So much for expert witnesses.
Let's take a break.
2:30 all right for everybody?
"I see you've already met Peter Ragan, my law clerk."
He's written some of my best opinions.
He appeared before me first time I presided over moot court at Yale.
You could say Peter and I are joined at the hip.
"Thanks, Peter."
Please have a seat.
"Thank you for seeing me, Judge Stern."
And how can I help you?
Tino Zapatti.
What about him?
How did he get off with probation?
I can only sentence in accordance with the conviction.
He was convicted of criminal possession of the fourth degree.
They found a kilo in his car.
is it your intention to try the case again?
Not at all.
But I read the rap sheet.
All systems normal.
"Good work, Mr. Kim."
"Mr. Neelix, you're with me."
I thinkit's time we contact the Mokra.
"Mr. Paris, set a new course."
Bring us out from behind the moon and establish a standard orbit around the planet... slowly.
We don't want to look aggressive.
"Yes, sir."
What kind of response should we expect when they see us?
The Mokra are paranoid and hostile.
They have little use for diplomacy.
I wouldn't be surprised if they started shooting at us immediately.
We'll be in full view of the planet in a few seconds.
Their orbital sensor net has picked us up.
They're scanning the ship.
We're being hailed.
On screen.
I am Third Magistrate Augris of the Mokra Order.
Commander Chakotay of the Federation Starship Voyager.
May I assume you're seeking permission to conduct business with us?
No.
Some of my crew members have already been to the surface.
We've lost contact with them.
I see.
You must have been unaware of our regulations.
I'll transfer a complete copy for future reference.
I have reason to believe they're being detained.
Detained?
Thas possible.
I'll look into it for you.
I'll contact you shortly.
Thank you.
Wu-tang originated from Shaolin.
They are so ambitious as to compete with us.
The Highness will be the host of this competition.
Then please send me!
That's what's in my mind.
But we still have to get our chief's approval.
Tat-chi has only been with us for a short time.
He's still got a lot to learn.
How can he be our representative?
"Please decide, Chief!"
Why do you propose that Tat-chi fight?
"Although he has a short history with us, he has great potential and a firm foundation."
He would make an ideal representative.
Only a senior student can represent our temple.
How is your sole testimony supposed to sway me?
I don't think we should let seniority decide.
"Then since you must continue to insist,"
I would like to test him!
You don't have to argue anymore then.
Yes!
"Tat-chi, would you like to compete with Fat-chi?"
I'm willing to accept it!
Tat-chi!
You must do your best!
Please excuse me then!
Very nice!
"Fat-chi, excuse me!"
"Tat-chi, your strikes still cannot demonstrate a sure win."
Try your Chin Kang Fist now.
Let's see how you do with that.
Tat-chi!
Tat-chi!
Jin Tianyun!
"Master Shi, it's been 3 years since we met"
"Your temper is still so bad, huh?"
"Brother Jin, how come you're still here?"
I'm afraid that you'll be bullied again
So I came back!
"Jin Tianyun, you taught my apprentice in secret"
This is definitely against ethics
T alk about morality?
How complicated!
I don't know that.
Your apprentice saved my life
I taught him a bit as a way to say thanks
Why are you so mean?
"That's true, Master."
"In fact, it's good to learn more!"
"You traitor, you've betrayed our teachings"
And our school.
I'll kill you!
"Shi Zhengzong, the decent school talks about"
Loving and helping the young generation
But you blame your apprentice ;
even beat him up... in order to save your face.
"If you try to... give him a hard time again, I'll interfere"
"Jin Tianyun, I know how to teach my pupils"
You have no say here!
"You yelled so loud, don't you fear... it will break some more of your rib bones?"
"Brother Jin, you're not recovered yet"
"Just leave here, quick!"
"So, you're wounded"
If I fight with you...
People will say I've taken undue advantage
Those cases have nothing to do with this case.
The jury will disregard.
Please disregard it.
Please disregard it because that's exactly what they do to people like you and me.
"We are disregarded because, unless we make them money,"
- unless you're putting cash in their pocket--
- Objection.
- Ms. Papagian-- - ...no value to them at all.
Sustained.
"Uh, really, one more time, and you're done."
All right.
"Well, I am done."
Here's the thing.
They're going to tell you that Ryan Larson was suicidal.
Absolutely a lie.
In no way was Ryan Larson suicidal.
Thank you for your time.
Hi.
That was interesting.
It's very impassioned.
The evidence will show that Ryan Larson left a suicide note.
"Look, Borns Tech is in the business of protecting America from terrorism."
That's what we do.
"Let me take this opportunity to introduce you to Leonard Letts, my co-counsel, and Lucy Kittridge."
Lucy's brother died in the war effort.
"He went overseas, and he lost his life to enemy fire protecting this country and all the principles that we hold dear."
Lucy's brother--
- Objection.
- ...wasn't a war profiteer.
[whispering]
He was a patriot.
And so is Borns Tech.

You also missed out.
You are just drunk.
We'll see.
Let's go to sleep.
"No Ivana, it is true."
You also played and you lost.
What the devil are you saying?
Are you crazy?
"Waiting for you, I gave them security."
"Waiting for you, I gave them safety."
I am expected to do what?
You said that I am expect?
You gave the security - of me?
"By the devils, who do you think you are?"
"Unhappy cretin, miserable ruffian, traitor shit!"
"By me, they can very well wait forever to get their security."
"To the devil, with you and your friends."
"They are crazy Ivana, capable of anything."
"Only to get it straight, the problem is yours not mine."
"You and your gambling games, I am tired."
"Perhaps, because for the want of Filippo, or by the perverse... pleasure, to see him totally dependent on me,... three days later decided to go to pay this dues,... this extravagant debt of my husband."
"In addition, I confess, I was intrigued."

-Yes.

"- Well, he's very handsome."
"- Oh, come on!"
"So, what's an American doing in Dunkirk?"
"No, scrub that."
- What isn't he doing?
- Fighting.
"- Yeah, so what does that make him?"
- A priest?
"- No, we need a hero."
- I don't know...
- Travel writer?
Journalist?
- A journalist.
"Hard-boiled, wise-cracking Yankee hack who can pilot a boat heroically."
You're not pinching any more action from Rose and Lily.
I'm not unpicking the entire bloody structure either.
"Will somebody give them a hand over there, please?"
All the way up.
"Of course, the irony is, they've given this to a bloody documentaries director."
"He won't want any dialogue, anyway."
"It will all be fishing nets and local kids playing football, you wait."
"What if it's not what the American does that makes him heroic, it's what he doesn't do?"
"He falls for Rose, but he doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie."
"Self-sacrifice, that's noble."
- Only if he stands a chance.
- Maybe he does.
"Maybe she likes him, because he's the sort that'd let her fix the propeller."
"So give him a name, our journalist."
Joe.
Only you can do that.
This was just after you escaped from the Hunters in Afghanistan.
"You're not suicidal, Flynn."
You're angry.
The Hunters did something to you.
"And until you face it, find out what really happened, it will kill you."
So who cares?
Emme does.
You're all she has now.
"Don't let the Hunters take everything away from her, too."
How was Karp?
His shipment's arrived.
I've got everything we needed from him.
What's the status on the reversion?
One of Sterling's solutions was successful.
You've been observing Sterling.
Can you replicate the process?
Can you replicate the process without him?
- Yes.
- Then you know what comes next.
It's all here?
Something so huge contained in these notes.
Incredible.
The incredible thing is our species working together.
"In a few days, I have accomplished what no other human scientist could even dream of."
Imagine what we can learn from one another.
Humans would never accept us.
They see us as monsters.
"You're not monsters, not to me."
Not anymore.
You're just trapped in a skin that doesn't fit you.
"In a world that just doesn't understand you, but people can change."
The pasta carrots?
"I know there is a glitch with my copter, too, but at least I had it under control."
A glitch is one thing but I saw...
"Kade, Dani, Graham, you guys did great work today."

"Optimus or no Optimus, I don't know how long I can put up with this..."
order around.
"Others taking the credits, having to pretend we're tin cans."
"What, did you see the way my partner pilots me?"
My controls are still sore.
"It's always higher, higher, faster, faster."
"Still, it was nice being a part of emergency response again."
I find our Chief quite competent.
There's much he can teach us about this law enforcement procedures.
The humans do have strange ways.
But that's what makes them so interesting.
I'm leaving.
You can't leave.
You're our leader.
"Then, we'll all go."
Those humans will never understand us.
We'll never belong here.
I know what you mean.
Don't bother.
You're not fooling anybody.
Trust me.
"Living in Griffin Rock,"
I know robots and you guys...
worst robots I've ever seen.
We failed in our mission.
Our cover is blown.

What is it?

What happened?
He was wearing military boots like the Mokra.
It was a trap.
A trap?
And you saw it?
My clever girl.
We'll be all right.
We have each other.
Thas all we'll need.
Is not that simple.
We can't just walk into the prison without weapons.
Maybe we'll have to try a different strategy.
We don't have to ask your friend any more questions if you give us the answers.
"I told you, I don't..."
I'm sorry.
I guess I...
I always assumed that Vulcans didn't feel pain like the rest of us;
that you were able to block it out somehow until I heard...
Was that you I heard?
Vulcans are capable of suppressing certain levels of physical pain.
"Beyond that, we must simply endure the experience."
How can you say that so calmly?
You must feel some anger at what they did to you... some desire to fight back.
"Under the circumstances, physical resistance is ineffective."
We are...fighting back by refusing to give them any information.
Get down there!
Three more hours.
There's nothing going on around here.
We've got her!
She's coming around!
They've done it!

The French are running back into port!
"Look there, sir!"
"- They're a good crew, sir."
"- Signal from the flagship, sir."
"Thank you, Defiant, for swift and honorable action."
"""Thank you for swift and honorable action."""
"No mutineers onboard this ship now, sir."

- We join the squadron.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Stand by to go about!
"Thank you, Mr. Crawford."

What about the stolen-car report?
Currently lost in the system.
"But if the car was actually stolen,"
We got nothing to use on him.
"Eh, we got something that'll rattle this limey's cage good."
"I'll tell you, you know what I would do"
If the bumper fell off my car while I was committing a crime?
I'd file a stolen-car report.

BECAUSE HE WAS BEING A GOOD BOY
AND HE WAS DOING WHAT THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD DO

THEY WOULD CALL HIM UPPITY;
THEY WOULD CALL HIM A LOUD MOUTH TO DISCREDIT HIM.

BUT HE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO HAVE RACIAL EQUALITY IN AMERICA.
"AND IF WE DIDN'T, IF HE DIDN'T DO HIS PART"

I'm you before you shrivelled and died.
And I don't wanna go where you've been.
"So in answer to your earlier question, you should've given me a place here."
I'd have been the best student you'd ever had.
Here he comes.
"Welcome back, Tony."
"Congratulations, Tony."
"Good work, sir."
Enjoy.
"The pleasure is all yours, sir."
The pleasure is all yours.
You're not coming?
Which firm have you decided to join?
All three offers are equally good
But I'm thinking in terms of...
Choose the job that gives you... the best scope of advancement.

"Jai, just do it"
What's all this?
Nothing much
"Just my stuff, my stock of mineral water, juices"
"My exercise kit, etc."
Mamma sent it
Did you have to get it from your Mummy?
We would've bought it for you
"I guess, that's a mother's love."
Like when Jai was in America... his mother would send over...
what do you call those... those sweet gramflour-balls and the mango pickle
So my Ma sent me this stuff
Careful.
Juice cartons on the right

"Sorry, I had to change my dress"
"Rice, please."
Mummy sends you her regards
The food also looks too spicy.
It's no good for your health
Sister-in-law...
I hear your Dad runs a roadside Indian eatery in America
"Not roadside eatery, a restaurant."
And it's his business
"You wouldn't know, because you've never stepped outside this town"
"Isn't that so, Jagadish?"
Will you please pass the salad?

Peking?

When I saw your works
I thought... working hard reaches others found friendship

I would think of myself and feel that it doesn't fit me but now
I need that
what I don't have is that kind of straightness
I like you
I like you
I like you

"You see, it's important having a system."
"When one creates a system, he doesn't need every piece of data on his disposal."
The system is what counts.
It shows everything.
"You've heard about probability and statistics, have you?"
It never fails.
"For me, the most important is to know the number of crimes in Zagreb."
The quantity of each type.
Where they happened.
The newspapers only prove something that I already know in my own way.
"Strange, isn't it?"
"No, no..."
Statistics is generally...
How far are you ready to go?
"You mean, in depth or width?"
- Well...
"In width, for instance."
"You see, I have data for Trnje."
I begun from here.
"I have an insight into quarters, streets, houses..."
Almost the apartments.
"Maybe it's too ambitious speaking about this, but maybe it should be expanded to whole Zagreb and its suburbia."
"I have a lot of data about that, too."
And then even wider.
"Say Dubrovnik, Split, Rijeka, Osijek, Varaždin, etc."
That's fantastic!
What about the depth?
What may be the depth of it?
That's more of a philological question!
The question is: what's a crime?
What should be considered an offense?
I thought you were taking the basis of law into account.
- For hurricanes.
Yeah.
- This is a radioactive cloud.
- I wouldn't call it a cloud.
"You wouldn't call it the end of a Yankee game, either."
I don't know.
"You got your sirens, route and tone alerts on local radio and TV."
- Paul Reveres go out.
- Civil defense volunteers.
"Yeah, we got the armory in Caldwell, 75 miles away, for refugees."
"Still, we're talking about widespread panic and chaos, right?"
I assume.
- Anything else?
- I don't wanna go back to my meeting.
"- Well, you're not staying here."
- Okay.
There must be 110 million for distance learning and telemedicine.
Can we shave that down?
There are three rural committee members who love distance learning.
I'm not sure I see the point if the rural poor don't have Internet hookups.
- Why don't we plus-up the entire bill?
- Sir?
We get our Internet 52 million.
They get to add 52 million for Internet-blocking software or whatever they want.
Can't we do that?
One of the problems is they're deficit hawks.
- We're deficit hawks too.
- That's the other problem.
"All right, work with me here."
What do they want?
"A bridge, a highway a soda machine?"
What do they want?
It is like they are breathing
Is not it?
They are enlivening your yard my Paşa
So Bali Bey
Is Matrakçı keeping you good company?
"Thanks, he is very good"
But he is not like the Matrakçı I heard about
I'm asking but he doesn't answer
Obviously a woman hurted him badly
History bothers everyone
Time is the medicine of any kind of wound
I don't mean to bother you my Paşa.

What do they say?
They say you set icons up

Were his eyes that blue too?
What are you saying?
Pardon me my princess
But he is not a rude man as you think
He had a table made specially for you
Are you ready?

Four or five pieces.

- For several hours at least.

"They have no fixed location, so we must try to take them."
- Collect them you trust the most.

- No.
Meet me at the concert hall.
"- Okay, I'll brief the others."
I can only say that we methodically work through the material.
We go from door to door in the area.
An extensive technical work.
The traditional policing will determine what happened.
We will do everything to get to the bottom of this.
Are you sure it's a coincidence?
There have been several shootings and a murder in the city.
We exclude nothing.
I must go back.
Further questions answered by my press spokesman.
"I did not ask, if you exclude anything ..."
This is way off track.
We will search for clues.
"If it is now organized, and there are shootings throughout the city -"
- Have you a plan for protecting offentiigheden?
We do not give us with speculations but investigating this matter thoroughly.
Now I remember I wasn't wearing it tonight.
- What will you have?
- Two glasses of wine to start with.
"Yes, sir."
"- A cigarette please, Dimitris?"
- With pleasure.
"What's bothering you, Aliki?"
"Nothing, nothing..."
"We had an agreement before our marriage, Aliki."
I was never to talk to you about something not belonging to me.
- Tonight we'll make an exception.
"- What do you mean, Dimitris?"
Looks like the painter is having considerable success...
"There's a rave review in the paper about his first exhibition, going on for a week now."
"Yes, I know..."
"Yes, I read it myself accidentally"
I can't see the connection with our agreement.
"Besides the review, the paper has a photo of a portrait titled 'I love you.'"
A portrait with your face in it.
I'm not sure if the artist has the right of exposing you.
"- Jealous, as always, Dimitris."
- Terribly.
And I think as a husband I am entitled to demand that he withdraws the portrait from the exhibition.
That would be thoughtless.
"If it bothers you so much, you can withdraw it by other means."
Buy it!
You're right.
Simpler that way.
We'll go to the exhibition tomorrow.
Together!
I'd look totally ridiculous alone.
As you wish.

Phillip Harris was right. [Door closes]
There is a phantom serial killer murdering people on both coasts.
That's clever.
Splitting up his hunting ground kept everyone from knowing his existence.
- Did the boys get any leads?
- Just one.
His sister said that Phillip Harris was working undercover at Zenith Studios.
Alexis:
"Oh, they're the ones that ruined the Nikki Heat movie franchise."
Not ruined...
"Destroyed, terminated, extirpated, vaporized, eviscerated."
Do you plan on running through the full thesaurus?
No.
I think that'll about do it.
"Anyway, Phillip thought someone at Zenith Studios was The Phantom."
Makes sense.
Plenty of people connected with the film industry are bicoastal.
"Directors, producers, cinematographers..."
"And actors, who are all borderline sociopaths, by the way."
Don't have to tell me.
"Hey, did anyone at Zenith know that Phillip was working there undercover?"
Just one...
Head of the studio.
Ah.
Let's go talk to him.
Thank you.
I am so going to get that spot in the Greatest Detective Society.
"I mean, there's no way Kendall has access to the kind of details that I have."
"Oh, don't get cocky, Rick."
You haven't solved the murder yet.
You girls are strange
You only speak half of what you want to say what are you doing?

Let me know if you ever need me
It's a treacherous world and I'm honest
"Like that, Shekhar?"
These KK-Mix guys are trying to pass off a re-mixed old number
This song isn't working
"Shekhar, he says KK's mix won't work!"
Better give him on anotherjob
What's wrong with my number?
"Not one, several"
The original is a classic.
And you...
Rape...?
I have raped so many songs but all my rapes are super-duper hits
My liftman can sing better
Then call your liftman
Yes sir?
- Here's the moment... you've awaited all your life.
If you can sing today... you'll be singing for the rest of your life
This is an insult to KK-Mix!
I have mixed a superhit

"All this my friend, by dint of money"
Not because of money.
He's capable
"Oh yes, I know your philosophy."
Love is mightier than money
But love cannot beget you money;

That's why my family is with me and that's why you're a loner
You are with me.
"Because of Love, Not for money"
He's dead.
I've never shot with these before.
"Be quite interesting, I think."
The flintlock musket that Mr. Carrington is loading was fired at the Battle of Waterloo.
When you're ready.
Just fire the trigger?
Yeah.
Ooh!
Ooh...
Phew!
"Man, I've got the shakes."
That's scary stuff there.
That was a lot of fun.
"Bearing in mind they'd fire off three rounds a minute, in the line he'd be all over the place, wouldn't he?"
Yeah.
With his... recoil.
That's probably not very good.

"Yeah, that would be sensible."
"In 1815, Napoleon met his Waterloo."
But victory in Europe did not bring peace at home.
"300,000 servicemen, destitute and hungry, returned to a homeland bankrupt after the long campaign."
"Mobs roamed the countryside, stealing from the large estates."
"As there was no police force, local militia were used to protect property."
"One of these volunteer armies, made up of farmers and local laborers, has come to drill with the gentlemen, ready to confront the growing civil unrest."
Charge bayonets.
Huzzah!
Straighten those bayonets.
"Militia and volunteers, shoulder arms."
Prepare to advance in ordinary time.
Forward... march.
"Left, right."
"Ohh... say, that's my supper you're eating!"
Shh.
I'm thinking.
The show bill!
You've got it!
Josie.
"Uncle daniel, come here."
Have you figured out yet how we're going to beat that injunction?
"No, he ain't!"
"Just when we need all the powers of glory pulling for us, his mind wanders to frivols and follies."
"Pleasure is the spice of business, uncle daniel."
It's as good as any picture could make of her.
"Still, it doesn't do her justice as a star temptation."
"You're dwelling in the fleshpots of egypt tonight, jimmy."
"But unless you find some way to get more stock, tomorrow we'll all be cast into a fiery furnace."
"Hey, boss-what about them bonds?"
What bonds?
Them confederate bonds.
They worked all right for us before.
"Ohh, get that ninny out of here!"
Wait.
"Confederate bonds... confederate, convertible!"
I told you luke's the brains of this organization.
"Jimmy, you got an idea!"
I see it!
You got an idea!
You bet i have.
There's nothing in the injunction that says that we can't print bonds.
What kind of bonds?
Convertible bonds.
"Well, what is a convertible bond, boss?"
A bond that you can convert into stock.
Report when you contact surface.
Tarrant to Scorpio.
We're on surface.
Scorpio to Tarrant.
"Message clear, report again in one hour."
- Why aren't they answering?
- I don't know.
"Tarrant to Scorpio, are you receiving us?"
He didn't hear.
I fear that sensors indicate audio malfunction.
"Tell us something we don't know, Slave."
I do apologise most profoundly if I have given offence.
- I assure you that...
"- All right, Slave, be quiet."
You'd better check the audio beam.
"It looks as if we're stuck here, Tarrant."
I knew I should have brought my night clothes.
Hmm.
"Well, they'll obviously be working on the fault."
Nothing we can do about it.
Let's go.
Then from your private suite back into the reception chamber.
"This is, of course, a communication centre which gives you video contact by satellite with any part of Helotrix."
You also have a direct audio link via the Magnetrix terminal with Federation headquarters.
"Not quite direct, then, is it, Leitz?"
"No, sir, I meant that it's private and priority coded."
Years in the civil service have turned me into something of a pedant.
"You mustn't let it worry you, Leitz."
LEITZ:
The Supreme Empress?
Servalan?
- Is your Excellency certain?
"Now, in exchange,"
I want you and yours to leave my daughter alone.
Forever.
Or?
"No need for ""or."""
"You know a good deal when you hear it, and I'm only offering once."

"Hello, Carla, or... do you prefer Amanda?"
Or Tasha?
Carla is fine.
Carla.
"Well, your prints tell an interesting story, Carla."
"Multiple arrests for prostitution under various aliases dating back over 20 years, and then a gap."
"And then, two years ago, a misdemeanor for promoting prostitution."
Looks like you went into management.
Made enough to buy that vintage Mustang we pulled you over in.
And now you can add arson to your list of accomplishments.
BELL:
"Maybe murder, as well."
This man...
"She's prepared to take the fall for her crimes, whatever they are."
Likely due to a combination of fear of her employers and the promise of future compensation.
Spent her whole life in the sex trade.
She's used to trading herself for money.
Didn't ask you how your emergency meeting with Shinwell went.
Did you manage to avert his crisis?
"Well, I tried to point him in the right direction."
GREGSON:
We already have you on the arson.
(sighs)
I spilled gasoline by accident.
I dropped a cigarette.
"Or, am I just love-crazed about you"
No one's crazy.
Not you.
"Not I. You are my strength, my family"
"Else, how long does it take for a man to break under these circumstances?"
"You have reposed trust in me, I'm grateful."
Thank you
I'll deliver that order
I'll deliver this one
Pizza delivery.

"Sir, please give me one chance."
I came to Bangalore... hoping I'd work for this company.
"Given a job, I'll prove... how profitable I can be for this company"
Perseverance and perspective leads to success... not impetuousness and impatience
I've read much about you in the papers.
I know your story
I'm a fan of yours.

I only ask for 100 seconds to prove my capabilities.

"Father and son, together on the street?"
"Son, have you quit school?"

Mr:
"Reardon, what are you doing down here?"
This area is off-limits:
And I've been looking all over this ship for you:
"I'm sorry, Colonel:"
I was just getting bored up there in the sick bay:
I thought I'd take myself a little walk:
"Well, this is the third time you've decided to take a little walk, Mr:"
Reardon:
How do you expect that leg to heal if you keep putting your weight on it?
I really didn't think I'd hurt it any:
"Well, come along before Dr:"
Goodfellow finds out you've been playing hooky again:
"Whatever you say, Colonel:"

"That's hard to tell, Hawk:"
No telling what capabilities that fake Searcher has:
But if they do...

It disintegrated:
"Yeah, just like the fake people who were on board it:"
Any word yet?
No:
Nothing:

The photon energy reading's practically off the scope:
"Admiral, I realize I have not been asked, but my sensors indicate: : :"

Instruments show us firmly held by a magnetic force 10:
"You shouldn't have, Pasha"
"I want you to be happy, Abdu, very happy"
"God bless you, Pasha"
Drink up
"It doesn't taste good, but it's nice"
"It's nice, sir"
"You know, Abdu... after you have another glass... you'll feel like you want to do nice things very nice things, the nicest thing in the world"
"I know it, sir, but my wife is in our hometown all the way in upper Egypt"
Does it have to be with your wife?
By the way... most women are not very nice

- Calm down
"Calm down, people are watching us"
Be normal

You want to make a scandal?

Roundup is one of the safest

Yeung:
"One country embracing this gmo model wholesale is paraguay,"

The scale of soy farms here stretches literally as far as you can see.
It's just soy in every single direction.
Yeung:
"Gmo soy is booming here,"
And business at the monsanto distributer has never been better.
We're just taking a tour around dekalpar.
"They mostly buy from monsanto,"
And they distribute to farmers all over paraguay.

Wow.
Does everyone in paraguay grow monsanto soy?
(speaks foreign language)
Yeung:
"Now because the seed genes belong to monsanto,"
A farmer is not allowed to replant any of the seeds from last years' crops.
"Instead, they have to buy new seeds every season."
Yeung:
"So farmers are buying a lot of monsanto seeds,"
And also a lot of roundup.
"Whoa, that's loads of roundup."
"This is all roundup, roundup, roundup."
How much roundup do you sell every year?

He ruled by fear.

He's a barbarian of genius.
So what!
He offered nothing to hypnotize or transform his people.
Where is the drama in slaughtering well-to-do farmers?
Stalin misunderstood the principals of opera.

- Mom!
- What?
What was the length they wanted?
7 or 8?
I did not ask them
"Mani, come here"
Sit down
You got 10 fingers
Why only one finger is sweet?
The finger that touched you is sweet to me
All other fingers are starving
Oh bee of the bamboo forest The crab that jerks my brain
Am I the feast to contain the starvation of your 1 0 fingers
Oh Bandit darling The girl who commit light murders
Will I leave if you keep away?
I am obliged to hide my arrogant beauty
It's your ability to pluck with out unveiling the screen
It's cruel to hide the beauty
You got 1 0 fingers
Why only one finger is sweet?
The finger that touched you is sweet to me
All other fingers are starving
Oh man who pinches my mind
Do you know Cupid's lingo?
With the eyes that could penetrate the dress
Stroking upto the soul
He has disappeared since a long time among all these books.
Between the lines.
Between the lines?
Two students will now perform the last programme ofthe evening
Their height is... six feet.
They are ex-students of this school.
"My word, I haven't seen such pranksters."
They were vey good friends.
And they are even now.
Their friendship bears a song.
Which they have composed themselves.
They have agreed to sing it on my insistence.
I hope they find their rhythm.
I say this because... one ofthem is a police inspector.
And the other a lawyer.

"Hello, Mr Hatem... these tenants are unbelievable"
Someone went up in the lift and left the door open
Who's this?
"Zaki Pasha, irresponsibility is normal these days"
I know... who's this?
- He's with me
"- Oh, he's with you but he's strong..."
he's with you
Why don't you go up and bring the lift down?
- When Mr Hatem tells me to
"- Oh, when he tells you to"
Tell him to go bring the lift down
"Don't worry, nothing will happen to him"
"Enough, Pasha"
"- Go up, Abd Rabbu"
"- Go up, Abd Rabbu"
Wow!
Did you see him?
"He went up so fast, He ran up"
He's like a tiger
He's very strong
You're a decent guy and you deserve good things
"You'll have a nice night, Mr Hatem"
"That's how nights are, they are nice to some people... and crappy to others"
Come in
Are you shy?
Is that man a real Pasha or a fake one?
"No, his father was a real Pasha and became minister a couple of times in the past"
- What does he do?
- Nothing
"He lives off of some properties he inherited, always been a loser"
"A relic, like you just saw"
Lighter.
Good.
"Be warned, you may experience unusually vivid dreams as a side effect of the medication."
All right.
You get some rest.
We'll begin our first session tomorrow.
Drink.
Please describe your affliction.
"Ever since my parents' accident, their passing,"
I've had anxiety...
Mmm-hmm.
Insomnia.
My doctor thinks...
Dr. torrington.
"Yes, sir."
"He feels that my afflictions were not mere products of my grief,"
but manifestations of more latent maladies.
This is why he felt i would benefit from your care.
And which latent maladies did he identify?
"I have often been called willful, overly curious."
I'm told that my flights of fancy are not becoming of a lady.
"These character flaws, he believes, have evolved into my current difficulties."
And what do you think of the doctor's assertion?
My brother has always said that...
I don't care what your brother thinks.
What do you think?
I want to be a good daughter and a good sister.
I do.
But I cannot accept curiosity as a mark against my character.
And isn't imagination the sign of an active intellect?
"I know too much independence is not becoming of a lady, but it just..."
"There is nothing wrong with you, Isabel."
"-Without it, I could not have conquered Logopolis."
-This is not conquest.
It's devastation.
It's nothing more than a blanket of silence.
Which is killing the Logopolitans and turning them to dust.
-You expect me to believe that?
-Yes!
You are destroying everything.
It may already be too late.
"You exaggerate, Monitor."
Logopolis is not the universe.
But it is!
Logopolis is the keystone.
"If you destroy Logopolis, you unravel the whole causal nexus."
Causal nexus?
You insult my intelligence.
You're interfering with the law of cause and effect.
"Nyssa, Nyssa, let go."
That is a demonstration of the causal nexus.
You revolting man!
The electro-muscular constrictor gives me complete control over that hand.
Please replace the screen.
I wouldn't take orders from you if you were the last man in the universe.
"Very well, one of your young friends will eliminate the other."
You understand.
Logopolis is crucial to the whole of creation.
This could mean the end of the universe.
"I've never been persuaded by hyperbole, Doctor."
Then come into the streets and see what's happening.
No need for that.
I can demonstrate the continued functioning of Logopolis from here.
This device only creates temporary silence and can be switched off.
-As a professional...?
-lt is not a betrayal
It is wrong to say someone alive as dead
Nothing wrong in saying the dead as alive to save a good man
Connect the ventilator immediately
It may look as if he is breathing Start iv fluid drips
Connect the ECG of some other patient to the monitor
Find out his blood group and hang a bottle
-What is the case?
"-Sir, he has beaten the MLA"
- Why did you beat?
"- He hit me, I hit him back"
"So you have hit him for self defense, is that so?"
-Under what section he is booked?
"-Under 307, attempt to murder"
The beaten MLA is still alive
He has beaten for self defense
File it as grievous hurt under section 324
"Leader, MLA beaten up on the road badly"
Uncle..
No one should touch him in this condition
Don't cry Nothing will happen to my brother
"Did you see your brother, how is he?"
No problem for my brother He is fine
Your MLA will be back soon Don't worry
-Where is he?
-He is in the police station
"Leader, he is the one"
How dare you touch my brother?
I will kill you here itself
- Open the door
"- No sir, keep quiet"
"Hey, ronin If you want the castle, it's this-a-way"
Excuse me
You heard?
He knows one of the government retainers
And has a relative in the castle study
"Oh, no, the tale keeps getting taller and taller"
"I found him, your enemy"
"Not, again..."
"This time, I swear it's him"
The water's perfect
I know another guy...
"""Height 175cm, fair skin with regular teeth"
WANTED
"WANTED ""His fox-like face bears a red mark from his right eye down his cheek"""
"Ah, the marked cheek is on his face, not his backside..."
Yes
Age?
Thirty
Thirty...
Much older looking since I last saw him...
"Don't lose heart, Soza"
Finding a man in Edo's sprawl is like winning the lottery
"It could take 10 years, no, 20..."
"Hey, sis, another sake"
Patience...
"But he's the right height, right?"
I'll go over it once more so listen well
Our shit fertilizes the rice paddies and fields
"That's why the farmer pays money to buy it from the rich landlord, who owns this tenement"
And that money pays for New Year's rice cakes for all of us
"You mean, rice cakes come from shit?"
"Well, not quite, but you're not far off, either"
I heard things
Did you know that İbrahim Paşa has icons set in his palace?
"How can I not know that, my Valide?"
That's what I don't get
How can you allow it?
It is a scandal
Nilüfer
Look into my eyes
I said look
Can I rely on you?
"Of course, my Sultana"
When the time comes you'll do something for me
But it is a little dangerous
"My Sultana, I will do anything for you"
First the table than the paintings
I said nothing not to hurt you.
But this is too much my lion
They won't be welcomed
It will have more harm than benefits
İbrahim Paşa doesn't live alone in that palace
There's Hatice.
They'll soon have a baby
They may be harmed
It urgently needs to be destroyed and removed.
Those things are icons!
As long as I live those sculptures will live on the yard of that palace
Whoever tries to do harm to İbrahim Paşa or to her family will face me
It will be known as such
Your decision my lion.
It is my duty to warn you
I'm telling you the last time as your mother
You are making a mistake
I going to get married to an amazing man
He has never seen me but he knows me so well
People know you People love you
Who loves me?
Name me one person who loves me me
Welcome darling
The priest is waiting
It would be a sin to be under the same roof without the blessing of God
Sunny days and rainy days
I pronounce you man and wife
You may kiss the bride now
Are you a virgin?
Yes
Get up and go to work in the kitchen
You ain't no priest and you fool are no wife
You are now a kitchen maid
I hear you arranged a marriage for Julia
Is she happy?
I know nothing
"Something is not right, where is Julia?"
I have no idea
What have you done?
My best friend Julia has disapeared
She is the village beauty
You would like her
He is so talented
You are in love with him
I am sorry I didn't realise I am stupid
Don't worry about it
It is him not us
I think that real women leave him cold
"But this is human fantasy pleasure, do you want to be as restrictive as the Church or State?"
Can't stop me now
"I, I'll get by"
"I, I'll survive"
When the world's crashing down When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around Don't you try to stop me
"I, I won't cry"
I found myself in Wonderland
"Get back on my feet, the ground"
Is this real?
Is it pretend?
I'll take a stand until the end
"I, I'll get by"
"I, I'll survive"
When the world's crashing down When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around Don't you try to stop me
"I, I won't cry"
( ALICE'S THEME PLAYING)
"Oh, Alice, dear, where have you been?"
"So near, so far, so in between"
What have you heard?
What have you seen?
"Alice, Alice, please, Alice"
"Oh, tell us, are you big or small?"
To try this one or try them all
"It's such a long, long way to fall"
"Alice, Alice, oh, Alice"
"How can you know this way, not that?"
You choose the door You choose the path
Perhaps you should be coming back
"Another day, another day"

Jan eliasson:
"In india, the challenge may be"
Sanitation and open defecation.
"In rich countries, it will be taking care of our resources,"
Which is the difference between life and death.
Rashid:
Jan eliasson is the deputy secretary general
Of the united nations and former chairman of water aid sweden.
We spoke with him about the serious problems with water management
Emerging around the world.
"The problems of india may seem far away to many,"
But it's a crisis for all of us.
We have to realize that we are in the same boat.
Water has been taken for granted.
"We live in a world where, in the next 10 years,"
Almost two billion people
Will be living in regions
With absolute water scarcity.
Two-thirds of the world population will live under water stress conditions.
This is a global reality that we have.
Rashid:
Severe problems with water
Affects almost every region on earth.
"In australia, south africa, and brazil,"
It's severe droughts.
"In pakistan, saudi arabia, and turkey,"
It's inefficient diversion of water to agriculture.
"In peru, indonesia, bangladesh, and china,"
They battle widespread pollution.
"Here in the u.S., we're depleting some"
"Of our most vital water sources,"
"Like the ogallala aquifer,"
It looks like a pretty large fire over there.
The amount of smoke and how much it's spread is incredibl.
In recent years there's been a worrying increase
In so-called superbug infections.
Centers for disease control warning hospitals nationwide
About a growing number of superbugs.
Male reporter:
There's a new deadly superbug
Spreading in hospitals across america.
"Half of all the patients who get it, die."
Smith:
"As the number of outbreaks continues to increase,"
"The horrifying reality is that simple infections,"
"Which used to be completely treatable by antibiotics,"
Are now potentially fatal.
The nightmare bacteria are now completely untreatable.
To find out what can be done as more and more antibiotics
"Continue to lose their effectiveness,"
We sent thomas morton to meet with some of the world's leading scientists
To try to find out what the future holds for antibiotics.

(birds chirping)
"Hi, it's thomas."
We're traveling upriver
And into the jungles of malaysia
"To find the drugs that humans will use in the future,"

"""Salmonella was rife in the town of Frankenhausen"""
When Dr. Gartner discovered the baccilus name after him in 1888
The mode of infection is yet to be discovered
But a detectable relationship has been established with the spirochette of the encephalitic bacterium which reaches epidemic proportions
"Nowadays, what we call encephalitis was identified by a Dr. Ekonomo in Vienna in 1919"
Whether the two are the same or not is still a matter of speculation
Looking beyond these questions at Dr. Ekonomo's diagnosis of lethargic encephalitis...
Like our friend here there's no evidence it attacks during winter
So he doesn't have it
Ready?
Going back to the original question...
"Whom are we to punish?"""
"""That which happened, could not have been averted"""
"""She had stepped out of her house, dressed to kill"""
"""Had someone not eyed her, it would have been his decency..."""
"""had he cast a glance, however, nothing would escape his eyes"""

"""You decide this, my friends..."""
"""whose mistake is it?"
"Whom are we to punish?"""
"""You decide this, my friends..."""
"""whose mistake is it?"
"Whom are we to punish?"""
"""Those endowed with good looks, have always been beautiful..."""

"785 01:04:46,700 --&amp;gt; 01:04:51,700 My agenda was programmed, you know..."
"It's impossible to fight with my mom 786 01:04:51,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:56,200 I will study for finances at Asim Sekip Kaya University, later masters in America."
"787 01:04:56,300 --&amp;gt; 01:05:01,000 When I return, I will work in one of the companies until I get married 788 01:05:01,100 --&amp;gt; 01:05:08,600 Of course this is not a bad program but you you will be happy if you do what you like."
"789 01:05:15,428 --&amp;gt; 01:05:18,251 15 missed calls..."
"Orkun (5), dad (2), mom (5), Mert (3 790 01:05:18,251 --&amp;gt; 01:05:21,668 Ohh there is the fair!"
"791 01:05:26,500 --&amp;gt; 01:05:29,000 What happened that he took back his complaint?"
"792 01:05:29,024 --&amp;gt; 01:05:31,404 We don't know."
"838 01:09:07,909 --&amp;gt; 01:09:11,238 We were in the first year at university when we got married 839 01:09:11,238 --&amp;gt; 01:09:14,728 Anyway I was together with them, during school."
"840 01:09:14,757 --&amp;gt; 01:09:16,957 He's funny."
"841 01:09:17,000 --&amp;gt; 01:09:19,900 - Am I lying?"
"- No, you're right."
"842 01:09:19,966 --&amp;gt; 01:09:23,428 I was 20 years old when I gave you the birth."
"843 01:09:23,500 --&amp;gt; 01:09:27,100 God bless you."
-Amin!
"844 01:09:27,200 --&amp;gt; 01:09:30,000 No, I won't drink"
"845 01:09:33,200 --&amp;gt; 01:09:35,500 It affects my mom."
"846 01:09:35,514 --&amp;gt; 01:09:40,433 When I drink It starts playing a clarion in my blood."
"847 01:09:40,433 --&amp;gt; 01:09:42,675 Everyone understood it!"
"848 01:09:43,100 --&amp;gt; 01:09:44,741 :"
"It affects my cousin too, 849 01:09:44,741 --&amp;gt; 01:09:51,400 she has an increased level of endorphin in her body or something like that, with a single glass she gets drunk."
"850 01:09:51,502 --&amp;gt; 01:09:55,303 I have that thing increased then too, right Yaman?"
"851 01:09:59,904 --&amp;gt; 01:10:02,536 You're a sound artist."
"852 01:10:02,600 --&amp;gt; 01:10:06,712 Ah mister who lost the artistry so that I could find it?"
"853 01:10:06,800 --&amp;gt; 01:10:08,700 I just sing songs... 854 01:10:08,900 --&amp;gt; 01:10:14,400 I brought up my children with my voice."
I earned my honor and bread with my voice.
"855 01:10:14,500 --&amp;gt; 01:10:18,500 When you were young you won a voice competition..."
"856 01:10:20,200 --&amp;gt; 01:10:23,269 err...in your childhood...I mean when you were major 857 01:10:23,269 --&amp;gt; 01:10:26,800 Be ate ease my kid, of course in my youth, I have wrinkles now 858 01:10:26,904 --&amp;gt; 01:10:31,871 Not at all!"
"You're voice is very beautiful, Yaman told me."
"859 01:10:32,951 --&amp;gt; 01:10:36,227 Whereas he doesn't like me singing but 860 01:10:36,300 --&amp;gt; 01:10:40,000 Nothing like that, I just don't want you to work at night."
"861 01:10:40,179 --&amp;gt; 01:10:43,749 There is not any night club which works during the day, son!"
"862 01:10:43,874 --&amp;gt; 01:10:47,831 Thank you very much, I bothered you .May your hands be blessed!"
- Enjoy it!
"863 01:10:50,600 --&amp;gt; 01:10:55,100 When you're done we will leave! -okay."
"864 01:10:57,400 --&amp;gt; 01:11:02,500 Yaman wants to walk away from us by running."
"- What a 865 01:11:03,000 --&amp;gt; 01:11:07,800 I couldn't imagine a place like this even in my dreams."
Can one escape from here?
"866 01:11:07,900 --&amp;gt; 01:11:12,300 I wish I was this wall here so I would stay here ."
"867 01:11:12,600 --&amp;gt; 01:11:14,978 We can wait as much as you want."
"868 01:11:15,000 --&amp;gt; 01:11:20,200 May God bless you."
And that is curve fitting.
I am Francesc Alted.
I work for
"Continuum Analytics. and during my tutorial, I would like to introduce you to to Numexpr and Cython, as libraries that can help you to accelerate operations with NumPy."
Can everyone hear me well?
All I wanna say Girl I wanna say
Saying I'm sorry
"August 4th, we were chilling at the house Said I'm done, I told you to get out"
Didn't mean a word that I said Cause I was hoping you would come back
Cause I tried and tried And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I'm hurt And I tried to fight and I cried to God
"Ooh, please let it just work And I'm going crazy with you"
"You got me so confused Cause you walked away, and I walked away"
And we should've stayed baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry
"And I'm in love with you Baby I want this, baby I want it"
Say baby I'll do what it takes And I will be here all the way baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry
"You wanna know if I was moving on without you I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"To tell the truth I've thinking bout you lately I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"Christmas day, you said you had a ring But you changed your mind"
Too caught up in the streets Boy your truth is hard to believe
Why are you really scared of me
Cause I tried and tried And I cried and cried
And up late at night and I hurt Cause I put in mine and worked all the time
And you never put in your work And I'm going crazy with you
"You got me so confused Cause you walked away, and I walked away"
And we should've stayed baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry
"And I'm in love with you Baby I want this, baby I want it"
Say baby I'll do what it takes And I will be here all the way baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry
available today in US English and they're coming pretty soon in many other languages.
I hope you enjoy that.
Let's talk about another Cloud Computing Application; this is one of my favorite demonstrations.
"It's called Google Translate, which Eric called summation earlier."
"So the Google Translate App that's available today from Google Apps in the Android Market, allows you to type or even speak a phrase in one language, and then have it immediately translated and even spoken back to you in one of 50 other languages."
So that's pretty cool and you can try it out.
But what I want to do today is I actually want to show you a preview of a feature that we've been working on for a little while--it won't be out for a few months--it's called Conversation Mode in Google Translate.
"And for that, I'm going to invite my colleague Kyle over back on stage to help me out."
"Please keep in mind this is experimental, so it may or may not work perfectly."
"Nice to see you, Kyle. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
Were going to be in Germany in a second. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"Hold on, it says French. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
We're in Germany. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"So--I know, yes, so Kyle, I'm a tourist and you're a salesman at a local shoe store here in Berlin."
"So we're going to start conversation mode here, and you'll notice that I have a button in English and you have a button in German."
"So, our conversation would probably go something like this."
Do you have these shoes in size 41? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try that again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try it again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What color? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Black or Brown would be fine. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have black and brown. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Can you give me a discount if I take both? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Twenty percent. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Sold. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
"That's a deal, that's a deal. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
Vielen Dank. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
That--this really is history because for 50 years people have talked about being able to do what you just demoed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
[INDlSTlNCT].
And so then what we can do now is plot these things.
So let's do the following.
I'm sorry.
How many coeffients of A and B which you were two of them which.
"You're trying to get new a's and b's. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I'm sure like with many of those, like 35. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Yeah, you can give, if you have something a higher, for instance, if you want to fit it a parabola, ax^2 + bx + cx, you've passed in a, b, c and you'll find out Yeah."
"The higher dimensional, the harder it is to, you get a lot more local, it finds a local minima, not your global minima."
"Your guessing is very important in this, 'kay?"
"The higher, the, the more complicated your guess, or the, your thing you're trying to minimize, the curve you're trying to fit to, the more important it is to have a really good guess."
"So there are my coefficients, A and B, and let me do this here for A1 too and B1, and these are, so now what we want to do is say okay, my data, let's say XP for X plot, pretty much goes from zero To five, and now we'll just say is my y2 fit, What is it?"
It's a2 * xp
"*, oh + b2."
"There's my curve fit, y1 is gonna be a1 * xp * b1."
"And now I can say, hold on, and I will plot xp versus y2."
"And lets plot the L2 fit in red and the y, and the y1, L1 fit in magenta."
Sound good.
"Oh, here, yeah, thank you."
Okay.
There we are.
Look at that.
Beautiful!
I have an L2 fit and an L1 fit.
And look at that.
They kind of don't look very much different.
Like you don't really expect them to look that much different I suppose.
Okay?
Everybody good with that?
There's my data.
"And you can see that the L2 and L1, slightly different, especially up here, but slightly different."
"Now here's t he question I'm gonna ask, and this is why L1 becomes important."
We think about our data Pretty easy thing about putting a line there.
"Now, what would happen if i had out-layers."
"Now, lets talk about that formula a little bit."
And then we're going to multiply that times y plus 2.
"So when you multiply y plus 2 times this, so you have y times negative y squared, it gets us negative y to the third power. y times 3y is going to be plus 3y squared."
2 times negative y squared is negative 2y squared.
And then 2 times 3y is plus 6y.
So then you go all the way down here.
"This thing can simplify, too, because you have 3y squared minus 2y squared."
So this going to be negative y to the third plus-- this part right over here simplifies to just y squared-- y squared plus 6y.
So that's this entire part simplified to this down here.
We can take the 2 pi out of the integral sign.
So let's do that.
We're integrating from y is equal to 0 to y is equal to 3 dy.
"And I took the 2 pi out here, and that is equal to our volume."
"And so now, we're essentially ready to take the antiderivative."
This is going to be equal to 2 pi times the antiderivative of this business evaluated at 3 minus evaluated at 0.
And I'll color code it.
I found this useful.
"The antiderivative of y to the third is y to the fourth over 4, so this is negative y to the fourth over 4."
"Antiderivative of y squared is y to the third over 2-- or y to the third over 3, I should say."
"And then finally, I'll do it in yellow."
"Antiderivative of 6y is 3y squared, so plus 3y squared."
And we are going to evaluate all of this business at 0 and 3.
So this simplifies.
"This going to be equal to 2 pi times-- well, let's see."
Let me do it in the same colors.
3 to the fourth power is 81.
"So it's negative 81 over 4, plus-- 3 to the third is 27 divided by 3 is 9, plus 9."
"And then 3 squared is 9 times 3 is 27, plus 27."
"And then when you evaluate all of these things at 0, you just get 0."
"So you're just subtracting out 0, so we really don't have to do anything else with the 0."
And now we are ready to simplify.
Let me see.
"Actually, let's just add them all up."
"If you are at 40 and you are imagined you are at 40, point number 40, the last PMT or C is $10,000, so at time 40, it's exactly ten, but when you look back if you were to, you have to carry past money amounts you've invested as earning money, which is good news for you, right?"
And it's earning how much?
"Eight percent and let me, let me tell you, that's not bad at all, aleight."
And we'll talk about that when we talk about risk and return in a second.
"So, do you understand the nature of the beast?"
The beast is not easy.
"It's not easy, it's like doing 39 future values and adding them up, right?"
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to now shift to using a calculator.
"Okay, Okay, so, if you notice I am on the top panel and I am going to use the formula of PMT."
"Remember, whatever you don't know, you type in here."
"So, that's yeah, PMT, alright."
"And the one thing, you have to do before you do PMT and not get excited like PM, Mr. Hyper, you have to put equal sign so that, otherwise, you will get all kinds of garbage."
"Okay, you open it up."
What is the first number that shows up?
The first number that shows up is the rate of return and we know how much are we earning.
We earning 0.08.
"Again, emphasizing this."
The only reason I'm using Excel right now is what?
"Simply, because the calculation is very difficult."
But I've explained to you what's going on.
"You're doing 40 going forwards, but actually only 39."
Because the first one is zero and the last one is just itself.
"So, so that's why, that's it, okay?"
"So, you put a comma, and what's the next one?"
40.
"Number of periods, right?"
"And, actually let me just back track a"
little bit.
"The thing that we want to figure out is FV, so put an FV and now I want rate 0.08."
You see what I was doing we will do next time.
"So, the number of periods is 40 and in this case, I know my PMT and my PMT is $ten, 000, right?"
"And what is PV, don't worry about it, it's not in there and just hit, okay?"
"Some Pokémon in the anime are just MONSTROUS, such as Dragonite and Tentacruel who are roughly the size of a BUlLDlNG!"
"While these Pokémon are clearly meant to give the idea that some of these monsters have the potential to become massive, it is interesting that, on the flipside, most of Game Freak's official sizes are much smaller than what you'd expect."
Let's get back to Charizard.
"In the anime, Ash's Charizard is actually a runt compared to others, but he's still big enough to give Ash a lift with plenty of space."
"But in the games, Charizard stands at just 5 foot 7 inches and just under 200 pounds."
"At 10 years old, Ash Ketchum is probably around 4 foot 3 inches, 70 pounds."
So I can believe that Charizard is still flyable at the average size of a child.
"But, a big adult like me?"
We wouldn't be flying anywhere.
The simple fact that Charizard and I can step on a scale and weigh the same is just it's just weird. . .I weigh a Charizard.
It just doesn't sound right.
But Charizard isn't the only Pokemon with a size you wouldn't expect.
Let's take a look at some of my favorites.
Nidoking and Nidoqueen are both a little over 4 feet tall.
"By the time you hit your teenage years, you'll probably already be taller than them."
Yeah. . .
"When you start picturing them like this, they're just not nearly as cool."
"And speaking of Pokémon much smaller than you think,"
"Rosalia, who's usually pictured to be around a couple feet tall, is just one."
Yeah.
It's just tiny.
It does look hilarious in colosseum though.
"Also, I get that Joltik is a bug but- 4 inches?"
He'd fit in the palm of your hand!
"At a size that small, it's pretty unbelievable that he'd ever be able to battle with well, ANYTHlNG else."
"Also joining Joltik is the recently announced, 6th generation Pokémon, Flabébé."
"Not only does it tie for the smallest size at 4 inches, but also the lightest weight too at 0.2 pounds."
"With Pokémon this small, what do you even need pokeballs for?"
"But when you look at Dunsparse, what do you think?"
I usually picture a little snake.
Just look at the guy in
Mystery Dungeon.
"And finally, the L here stands for Last, which means we multiply the last terms in the two binomials, so b * d."
"And the answer to this multiplication is the sum of all of these, F + O + I + L. So, let's apply this method here to see that we get the same answer that we just found."
Okay.
"So, we still have this product, (x+5y) (3x-y)."
"So, what is F here?"
This is the product of the first terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * 3x, which is 6x^2."
And what about O?
I is a product of the outer terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * -y, which is -2xy."
And I is the product of the inner terms in the two binomials.
"So, 5y and 3x, which is equal to 15yx."
And L is the product of the last terms in the two binomials.
"So, 5y *, - y, which is -5y^2."
"And therefore, this product is the sum of all of these."
"So, it's 6x^2 - 2xy + 15yx - 5y^2."
"And again, -2xy and 15yx are like terms so we can combine them, which gives us the same answer of 6x^2 + 13xy - 5y^2."
"So, FOlL is a quick way to distributive multiplication of two binomials."
Let's see another example.
Let's multiply these two binomials here.
"Well, we can apply the FOlL method we just saw."
This is equal to the product of the first terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * 2x, plus the product of the outer terms in the two binomials, so 2x * one."
"And then, plus the product of the inner terms of the two binomials, so -one * 2x."
"And then, plus the product of the last terms in the two binomials, so -one - one which gives us, 4x^2 + 2x - 2x - one."
"And notice the outer and the inner terms will cancel, which leaves us with our answer of 4x^2 - one."
"Now, it should be pointed out that these binomials are special and that we're multiplying together the difference and sum of the same two terms."
"We have 2x and 2x, and one and one."
And there's a special formula in this type of case.
"And the formula is that (A-b) (A+b) = A^2 - B^2, because the outer and inner terms will always cancel, which is what we just saw."
"That is, in our case, our A is 2x and our B is one."
"So our answer here is A^2 - B^2 or (2x)^2 - (one)^2, which is this 4x^2 - one."
They sat by my mum's hospital bed  when my mum was in coma.
They came and get me out of jail when I get busted for stupid stuff over the weekend.
Nobody ever did that for me before.
"Nobody cared about me."""
"So, that thing that Thay says  'goes in in order to go out'."
"It comes in from the staff of caring  teachers, people like yourself first, unrelentingly, fiercely,constantly pouring that love and attention and going beyond their expectations to care about them."
To care about them.
"Here is a poem,"
"(Bell) by Travis Daniels, a Youth Build student."
"He was at a conference and saw all people like you caring and talking about the program,  and how they want to help it."
"""His Hero, from being lonely and getting blunted to seeing concern and feeling wanted."
"From hating you because you stared, to loving you because you cared."
"In the pain, I am in a struggle, I need to talk, I need to hug you."
I hope that you feel my heart and its words.
"Now, picture the youth that stand on the curbs."
"They have no hope, they see no change."
They try to live but stuck in their ways.
"16 years old and suicidal,  you may not relate but trust me, I do."
"I reminisce about my cries for help,  no one noticed that I hit myself."
"As time went on, a lost soul grew and was welcomed by those who care for the youth."
I know there is more that  you want me to be.
"I am still in the dark  but the light, I can see."
"Let it be known, I love what you do,  from now till forever, I'll pray for you."""
"So, everything that everyone has said  is part of the picture, right?"
"Taking care of ourselves,  appreciating each other, knowing that we can't do it all in one step."
"Taking the step, step-by-step."
Pouring out the love.
"Mother Teresa, I want to quote her."
"She says,""Love until it hurts  and then love some more."""
"I think that's what we're called to do and the more that we take care of ourselves, the more of our natural love we have available to share with our students."
Thank you very much.
(Half bell)
"You know, just a normal day."
"About 9:30, the aide came in from the college class and said that Alex had not made it to school and wanted to know if she was supposed to be there that day."
"Of course, she was."
"She would just never answer her phone, so I went and told the office that I needed to go find her."
"But, I knew where she was, and I knew what had happened."
"Just in my heart, I knew."
She had taken a back road to school that morning.
"She wasn't supposed to take it, because it was a dangerous road."
"And that's where I found her truck, out in the field."
[Music]
"The doctors had come in the second time and told us that they didn't think Alex would make it - that they'd lost her several times, and they needed to know what we wanted to do."
And my husband and I had to make the decision to let her go.
We were out in the hall waiting for them to get her cleaned up so we could go see her one last time.
[Music]
I think everything about my life changed.
"For a long time, it was hard to laugh, to really be joyfully happy."
"There are times when Katrina and I would be out doing stuff, and I would feel like I needed to text Alex and tell her what was going on, because I knew she would like it."
And then I would remember I couldn't tell her.
I was supposed to be able to go visit her at college right now.
"You know, and embarrass her on campus in front of all of her friends."
I can't do that.
It's just a whole part of my life that's gone now.
[Music]
"She left me a note, oh, probably six or eight months before she had her wreck."
"Just ""Alex hearts you,"" you know, on my windshield with a dry erase marker."
It's still there.
"You know, I can't bring myself to wipe it off."
I look at it every day.
[Music]
"After Alex died, and we went home, I got on the internet to check her phone records."
"And my husband came up and he goes, ""What are you doing?"""
"And I said, ""I want to know if she was texting and driving."""
"I don't like these one halves lying around, so let's multiply both sides, this equation, by 2."
I'm just gonna multiply both sides by two.
"So, on the left hand side, I'm just left with (a+b) squared, and on the right hand side, I'm left with 2ab and then two times one half c squared, i.e., plus c squared."
What happens if you multiply out (a+b) times (a+b)?
We get (a+b) squared.
That is a sq. + 2ab+ b sq. = 2ab + c sq.
"Subtracting 2ab from both sides, we are left with, a sq. + b sq. = c sq. i.e. the Pythagorean theorem."
OK.
"What we see here, is a 3D maze."
"It's actually HTML, CSS3, and a bit of Javascript but the CSS3 is 3-dimensional CSS."
"What we've got is a whole bunch of cubes, stacked in bars, and we've got one red ball in the upper left corner."
"And I can move that ball with the buttons up on top to the right, down..."
Why?
"Because there's cubes that are opened and cubes that are closed, which are part of the maze set-up."
"The proof of concept is created with one singular maze, in the end product it will be possible to incorporate different mazes."
I can move the ball by clicking the correct button.
"I just went right and as you see, there's a little marker line that says I moved to a different bar."
"Now I can't go anywhere else,"
"I can go back left, that's where I came from,"
"I can go back right or come forth, and this way"
I can walk through the entire maze.
The objective of the maze is to clear the maze.
"Rather, the objective of the game is to clear the maze."
"On this side there is one more block open, that has no front."
"If I go through there,"
I'm out of the maze and I will not be able to use any of the buttons anymore.
"I can only go back and forth, I can go down, and I can walk my way all around through the maze."
Just like this.
"Oops, can't do that."
I can come forth and left and forth and left...
"Well, you get the idea."
Now this maze obviously is quite simple.
Is it Ole Bull that you rank highest within Norwegian music?
"Yes, Norwegian classical music."
Why?
Because he was a great man.
And he was  allowed to be that because it was deserved.
Because he lead Norway onto the world map.
He  was the first man to promote Norwegian folk music.
He was able to get national scene in Bergen which was the first cultural place we had.
"He started Ibsen, Bjornson - a national hero."
But you want to play in the movie about Ole Bull?
"Yes, I would have loved to do that."
"I'm probably a bit too dark and talk a bit too much eastern-Norwegian, but, yes, if I practiced enough."
Can you give an example of Ole Bull?
"That's ...um ""Norway in a nutshell"", ""Seterjentens sondag"""
"You can almost see the cow walking across the grass, sort of."
What does music mean to you?
It's nothing more and nothing less than a mood setting.
Sometimes you really want just to be happy when you're sad or you just really want to feel something.
You really want to fall in love with your wife again and there it's probably not the best choice to listen to Eminem right then.
If you really want it music has the ability to bring the feelings you want to have.
Does it do this for you?
"Yes, absolutely."
The one thing I'm still to understand is people who go to see their favorite artist on a festival and there are those who just go to festivals to listen to some artists.
And then I can't understand what you get out of it when you go to those concerts and not caring for those artists.
"But of course, there is a relation - it's great."
"And me, I love festivals but every time I'm asked to join a festival as audience"
I always make sure to see who's playing.
"""Oh, I'm only able to go on Friday"" ""OK, who's playing on Friday?"" ""I don't know""."
You have to find out what you're going to listen to.
You have always had a discipline; you have practiced a lot ever since you were a little boy.
Do you still have that discipline?
The thing is that as a classical kid it went straight  to my blood that you had to practice 2 hours a day.
"Look at me here, here on my own again, and up straight in the sunshine."
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
Wonderful life.
It's a wonderful life.
AMY GOODMAN:
"From Pacifica, this is Democracy Now!"
AARON FORD:
"I'm honoured to stand here today alongside the New Jersey State Police, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, and United States Marshall for the District of New Jersey, to announce the addition of Joanne Chesimard to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list."
AMY GOODMAN:
"Assata Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, a member of the Black Panthers and the Black Liberation Army, becomes the first woman named to the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorist list."
"Convicted of murdering a New Jersey trooper in 1973, she's always proclaimed her innocence."
She's lived in Cuba since the early 1980's after she received political asylum.
We'll speak with scholar Angela Davis and Assata's long time attorney Lennox Hinds.
And we'll hear Assata Shakur in her own words.
ASSATA SHAKUR:
"Well the government just perceived us as a threat because they understood that we were serious, they understood we were telling the truth, and they understood also that we were becoming a much more sophisticated opposition, we were not just the piece of pie opposition, but that we wanted a real, structural change in the United States"""
[ *please skip to 11:28 to continue with Assata Shakur piece *]
JUAN GONZÁLEZ:
"And I'm Juan Gonzalez, welcome to all of our listeners and viewers around the country and around the world."
"We begin today's show looking at the case of Assata Shakur, a legendary figure within the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army."
"On Thursday, she became the first woman ever to make the FBl's Most Wanted Terrorists list."
"In addition, the FBI and the state of New Jersey doubled the reward for her capture to $2 million."
"Shakur was convicted in the May 2nd, 1973, killing of a New Jersey state trooper during a shootout that left one of her fellow activists dead."
She was shot twice by police during the incident.
"In 1979, she managed to escape from jail, and she later fled to Cuba where she received political asylum."
"I'll still come into the chatroom, that sort of thing, but it's it man."
I don't want to be a venue for man-children and My Little Pony.
"Nobody's learned shit, nobody's done shit."
"So, you know how it is."
"No, I'm not gonna abandon the chatroom man."
"I'm gonna still come in here, but I'm not gonna stay in here for as much time as I had."
Sometimes I've stayed in here for shit.
"I mean, it seems like an hour, but five hours have gone by and shit man, I've been having a lot of great conversation with a lot of you guys and females in this chatroom and transsexuals, mind you."
"Amy Daly is a believe it or not has been a great breath of fresh air, you know, in the chatroom."
Especially when I came in here this morning feeling a little jaded about this shit.
"I'm still jaded about it, but great words from her, great words from a lot of people in here, so anyway, once again, man, the show's over."
"I'll be in here, man."
You know?
"I'll be in here, but... that's it for the show, man."
"The archives will be there if people still want to listen them, they can still listen to them, so... anyway. coyoteinthehat:"
"Seriously, thank you for the time and money and everything you've put into it and sorry for adding to the forces of trolls and stuff earlier this year and whatnot, but man, thanks for everything."
GuitarNinja:
"Yeah, man, the past couple of years."
"You've been sewing the seeds of capitalism and now it's just time to sit back, you know, chill, wait for the harvest, man."
"You know, it's coming, it's gonna happen."
We just gotta wait and do our homework.
Sebastian:
"Thanks for the show, Ghost. karaszkunskadoo:"
"Hey, I wonder what will happen to the Engineer since you are quitting this show. iusethelancer1:"
"The Engineer wasn't real, dude, okay?"
GhettoCapitalist:
"Look guys, the Engineer."
Y'all don't worry about the Engineer.
The Engineer is eligible for so many entitlement programs now it's ridiculous.
He's gonna be making more money being unemployed than he ever would at Ghost's show.
"I'm just sayin', I'm just-- you know."
"Section 8, all that stuff, all that stuff."
Outliers get squared.
Right?
"So if you're really bad, you square it, to get even that much worse."
Okay?
"Now, it could be that, in fact, that outlying data shouldn't take up that much importance, but when you do the"
L^ The square fit with the L2.
You square that distance and you put it into that thing.
Where is if you do L1?
"You just take the distance and leave it, you don't square it."
Okay.
How does it impact this example?
Well let's see.
I'm gonna put in some outliers.
"So I'm gonna add a couple data set points here here's my data, here's what I'm gonna add at .5, it's at 3.8 and at 3.9 Now, let's try it."
"Okay, there is are results, so I added a couple points, outliers to the data."
And now You can see there's a pretty pronounced difference between the L2 and the L1.
"And then, we can talk about, well, what's best?"
"So, first of all, that's question doesn't even make sense."
"Because when we say, what's best, you could say, well, if it's an L2 sense, clearly, the red line is best because it minimizes the L2."
"So, best here is."
"Akward, mathematically its best and best by the eye."
And then look at the magenta line.
The magenta line really doesn't change because of the outliers.
"Right, hardly influenced by them, shifted slightly."
The red took a huge tilt.
"So some would argue that when we answer the question about what is best, that in fact, the magenta is best, cuz it does not react to the outliers, and the only reason that red, and that red line got way shifted, because it's trying to compensate for these points that are way out squared the distance analysis and this red line doesn't do the job at all, bottom points or the top points, doesn't, doesn't do well anywhere."
"But the L1 says, tell you what, I got most of them right, I got a couple of outliers."
"But by the way, nobody is gonna get the ou tliers right, so I'll try to get the bulk of them right."
Does that make sense?
"Okay, that's the L1 norm."
All right.
So curve fits.
There is a book called  'Buddhism Boys'.
It's about a teacher who taught mindfulnes to high school football players.
"I think, boys particularly can see the relationship to sports."
That's a big inroad.
(R. Brady) I don't think we will have time to answer more questions right now.
"But, there are going to be a lot  of opportunities to raise questions of various kinds  throughout the rest of the week."
"And after you leave here,  there is a worldwide community of over 1000 people who are interested in mindfulness in education, who are all part of the Mindfulness and Education Network listserv."
How many people are already  on this list?
"Please, raise your hand."
"We don't have too many Canadian members yet, but it would be wonderful to have a large Canadian presence."
The flyer is downstairs in the bookstore.
"If you have questions such as the ones you have been asking, you can just put them out on the network and you would get very thoughtful answers."
"It's not a very busy web service, you do not need to worry about being flooded with emails. but it's very thoughtful."
"So, I want to encourage all of you  to pick up a flyer."
We also have a conference annually.
"We have Canadians who come to our conference, that gets announced."
It will be March 14 to16  in Washington D.C. this next year.
There is a lot of resources on our website that you will find also listed here.
(J. Bell) I'd like to do one plug for a book that I found very nourishing.
It's called 'Teaching With Fire'.
"Two teachers asked teachers to sent them poems to guard them through hard times,  to remind them why they taught."
They talk about courage.
There are about 100 poems in here.
On one side is the poems sent by the teacher.
On the other is the teachers' own story about why this poem is important.
"I have used this in my teaching, in my training work and for my own personal use."
"I've used poem to cry through, beautiful collection of poems, some of them written by famous people, some by teachers themselves."
'Teaching With Fire'.
(Br.
Phap Dung) Thank you.
"(J. Bell) The author, the editors are Sam Intrator and Megan Scribner with Parker Palmer giving the intro."
"(Brother) Thank you John, thank you Richard, thank you panelists, thank you friends for being with us and... wonderful at my heart."
"If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA, that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil."
"OK, if we can do this, could we put it back?"
This is a key question for everybody.
"Does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?"
"Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania, restore that ecosystem?"
Or has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible?
I've been to Tasmania.
I've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common.
"I've even spoken to people, like Peter Carter here, who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old, but in 1926, this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines."
They trapped them.
"And when I spoke to this man, I was looking in his eyes and thinking,"
"""Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like, what they smelled like, what they sounded like."""
He led them around on a rope.
He has personal experiences that I would give my left leg to have in my head.
We'd all love to have this sort of thing happen.
"Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance, could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines."
My interest was in whether the environment had changed.
He thought hard.
It was nearly 80 years before this that he'd been at this hut.
"At any rate, he led us down this bush track, and there, right where he remembered, was the hut, and tears came into his eyes."
He looked at the hut.
We went inside.
There were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night.
"And he told me, as it all was flooding back in memories."
"He said, ""I remember the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside,"" and he said they made sounds like ""Yip!"
Yip!
"Yip!"""
All of these are parts of his life and what he remembers.
"And the key question for me was to ask Peter, has it changed?"
And he said no.
The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in 1926.
The grasslands were sweeping away.
They had a lot of sailors from the island.
"My uncle was telling me one time, I forget how many cousins he had that were captains on boats."
But that was when there were 70 ore boats.
You'd go up in the evening time and watch them going up Sand Bay.
"They all did the same speed, they all burned coal in the 50s."
"There was nothing to see, a dozen, right after the other lined up at the same speed, just heading for"
Grey's Reef there.
They did the same thing -
"In the day you'd see the smoke, but at night you'd see the lights go by."
"And when you went across on the mail boat, you always passed in front of one or behind one."
Heading down to Charlevoix or coming back up.
There was an awful lot of guys.
"When we put up ice here, our whole crew pretty much would be - we'd have 8, 10 guys down there."
They all were sailors that were just home for the winter.
They laid the boats up the first of December and go back in March.
"Unless a guy had lucked out to get the job for the winter staying on the boat, just to keep an eye on things."
"Like I said, [?]'s husband."
He'd always run what we called The Jack.
We had a movable thing to - when you put the ice up in the ice house the ramp and everything.
You walked alongside and it was just a little plank.
I don't know if I could -
"So, you'd pull the ice up."
These cakes up to the foot of the thing.
And then the other team - some guy driving the team.
"One of the sailors, he'd have the team."
Then they used the team to pull four of these blocks up.
Ray would be the guy behind us at what we called the
Jack.
He took a 12 by 12 plank with a bunch of spikes through it and then a big handle - to guide the - you hook on behind him and they'd keep on skidding it up.
And there'd be two or three guys up inside the ice house itself.
"They have these big ice tongs, skid it around, and they'd jam them and they'd tape it together."
So it was like one solid block of ice.
(R. Brady) Thank you.
(Woman in the audience) You mentioned that singing about flowers may not necessarily reach teens effectively.
"So, I was wondering if one of you can express what might be the best way to mindfully communicate with teenagers."
(K. Weare) I was not trying to say that nobody should sing songs about flowers with kids.
"But again, just taking the Mindfulness  in Schools Program from the UK, which is a Teens Program, it basically does things that are quite edgy, and exciting."
"For example, tasting."
It's chocolate but it's also hot chili which excites some of the kids.
"The next workshop, we use a shock ball, which gives an amount of electric shock to illustrate aversion."
(Laughter)
"It's very mild, I would say."
(Laughter)
We haven't lost too many yet.
(Laughter)
"But things like using clips, some films, some current pop music, and so on."
"And using language,  so you won't use mindfulness."
"We use MindLab or Emotional Warrior, or something of that sort."
"You talk about sports, you talk  about surviving life in a club."
You basically stop where they are.
It comes down to knowing your teens and working how you talk to them about anything really.
Translating the work of mindfulness  into the examples and language that you would use.
"There is a lot of stuff in pop music  that you could choose to play if you want to talk about being  in the moment, and ethics and so on."
"There is just a lot out there, you just need to get the head on, which is seeing the world  from the teen's point of view."
And use the teen themselves to tell you  what works with that group.
"So there is a lot, it's really  about the spectacles you put on before you start teaching more than sort of specifics."
(Woman) I am speaking from a parent's perspective rather than a teacher's.
"I would get someone else to teach, then."
(Laughter)
"(J. Miller) Just bringing the mindfulness to boys,"
I think one of the things is sports.
There are lots of people  in the sport world using this.
"The classic book is Phil Jackson's, who was coach of Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers."
He brought mindfulness right into a working coaching.
"Coleen knows that I'm giving a message to her, and she can open that message and know that it goes to Alice."
It doesn't require the first one.
"If Bob see me talking with Coleen, presumably that's not a problem."
It doesn't require the second if Bob sees Coleen talking with Alice.
That's also not a problem.
"If Bob sees both of those and sees them in quick succession, especially if he sees the envelopes being handed on, then he's got a good reason to suspect that I'm talking with Alice."
So we need both of these properties.
"We need to know that Coleen can be trusted, and we need to know that Bob can't see both of these transactions."
Those are pretty high security assumptions.
"We don't want to have to trust Coleen completely, and we don't want to rely on the fact that Bob can't see these two conversations."
The way to make it more secure is to add a third person--
let's say we know Edgar as well.
"Now instead of giving the message directly to Coleen, what I'm going to do is take the envelope for Coleen, put that inside an envelope for Edgar."
We need to fold things a little to make them fit.
Now I'm going to seal this envelope with a very secure seal that only Edgar can open.
Now I'll give this to envelope to Edgar.
"Edgar will open it, see that it has an message for Coleen."
Edgar will give the message to Coleen.
"Coleen will open that, see that it has a message for Alice, give the message to Alice."
Alice will open the message and see that she shouldn't eat the onion.
This has more protection.
Now Coleen doesn't know that I'm communicating with Alice.
Because the message is going like this:
"It's going first to Edgar, then to Coleen, then to Alice."
"Neither Edgar, nor Coleen knows that I'm communicating with Alice."
Edgar knows that I'm sending a message through him that goes to Coleen.
"Coleen knows that she's receiving a message from Edgar, and it's going to Alice."
Neither one knows both endpoints.
"If we add enough hops, this can start to be quite secure."
This is actually called onion routing.
That's why the message is to not eat the onion.
The name comes from the idea that an onion has all these layers.
"So 2,600 words and it has 23 paragraphs."
A two-paragraph preface is then added to the report.
Is the average number of words per paragraph for all 25 paragraphs less than 120?
So this is interesting.
So the average number of words per paragraph for all 25 paragraphs less than 120.
So if we knew the total number of words in the document we'd be set.
We would just take the total words divided by the total paragraphs they have now.
"They have the 23 original plus the 2 from the preface, you have 25 total paragraphs."
Now it told you the average words per paragrah.
"Now, we don't know the total words, because the total is going to be equal to the 2,600 words in the body of the document plus the words from the preface-- I'll call that words sub preface-- all of that divided by 25."
This is the average.
"This is what we really have to figure out, to figure out if it's less than 120."
That's what they want to know.
So statement number 1.
Each paragraph of the preface has more than 100 words.
"So I guess we could say that the preface, the words from the preface are greater than 200."
"That's another way of saying that the total is going to be greater than 2,800."
"Now if the total is greater than 2,800, what does that tell us about the total divided by-- excuse me."
"So then the total divided by 25 is going to be greater than 2,800 divided by 25."
"What's 2,800 divided by 25?"
"Let's see, 25 goes into 2,800."
"1, 25, 30, 1, 1 times 25, 25, 50, 12."
So it tells us that the average is going to be greater than 112.
So that doesn't help us.
"If it told us that the average was going to be greater than 120, we would be done."
"We would say oh, we have enough information to answer the question."
"Actually, the answer is no, that the average is going to be greater than 120."
"But here, this tells us the average is greater than 112."
It could be 113 or it could be 121.
So it doesn't answer our question of whether the average is less than 120.
So statement one alone is not that useful.
Statement number 2 tells us each paragraph of the preface has fewer than 150 words.
"I have D, I have a D 70 too, earlier with the, the."
"Yeah, the, but this new one's nice, very nice, the, the busier ones now, although I really help with the multimedia stuff."
"Um, I'm gonna look and see if we have something coming up on that."
Um.
"While I'm looking up the D800, what types of courses would be most helpful for you coming up?"
"Um, do you, do you I ike the longer courses where you can just go in and pick out a movie?"
Or would you like shorter more direct project type courses?
"Um, I would say well, for the subject matter, I mean I think you guys do a pretty good job, at least I think with a lot of thee a Adobe ones, which I, which thee, I think those are my, the ones I've been using a lot, on there."
"Uh, how they connect with each other, that would be helpful because they go into the multi media, there is after effects photo shop, and premiere, and the audio piece, what is it, the um, audition."
Uh huh.
"Here I have one that shows how they all connect with each other, how you place to using one thing and go back to the other set, for saying, mention "" em briefly in one or the other."
And stuff.
Don't really have anything to actually.
"So the true relationship, because all these have, are connected that you can use them in a way where they all complement each other, but"
"I don't really, it offends me to figure them out."
"Within each one, they might mention, it might mention a little piece on after effects."
Sure.
Bye.
But not like the total workflow.
My might mention a piece on premier.
"But there's no real slow connection on how all of this production piece, that production piece works all together."
"Same with the way of uh, design is really easy to figure out on that one."
It's just opening photoshop illustrator.
That's not that complicated.
But far as the .
"Uh-huh , a lot more complex on there."
Okay.
Okay.
"Um, yeah that's good feedback."
Those areas are mostly outside of my segment.
"But it's really good information for me to, to talk to the audio and video guys about."
And uh.
This was 5 times 1 minus 1.
"Yeah, 5 times 0 minus x1, which is 1."
"Now, this case, it's 5 times-- oh, I have to be careful."
This is 5 times x2. x2 is 1.
"So 5 times 1 minus 0, so it's 5."
"And then I have 4 times 0 plus x2, plus 1."
"And I just showed you if I replace each of these standard basis vectors with the transformation of them, what do I get?"
I get this vector right here.
So I already figured out what they are.
"If I take this guy and evaluate it, it's the vector 1, minus 1, 4."
"And then this guy is the vector 3, 5, and 1."
So what we just did and this is-- I don't know.
"For some reason, I find this to be pretty amazing."
We can now rewrite this transformation here as the product of any vector.
"So if we define this to be equal to a, or we could write it this way."
We can now write our transformation.
"Our transformation of x1, x2 can now be rewritten as the product of this vector."
I'll write it in green.
"The vector 1, 3, minus 1, 5, 4, 1 times our input vector, x1, x2, which is super cool because now we just have to do a matrix multiplication."
"Instead of this, and if we have some processor that does this super fast, we can then use that."
"I don't know, I think this is especially elegant, because what happens here is we applied the transformations to each of the columns of a 2-by-2 matrix, and we got a 3-by-2 matrix."
And we know what happens when you multiply a 3-by-2 matrix times a vector that's in R2.
Or you can almost view this as a 2-by-1 matrix.
You're going to get a vector that is in R3.
Because you're going to have these guys times that guy's going to be the first term.
These guys times these guys are going to be the second term.
These guys times those guys are going to be the third term.
"So by kind of creating this 3-by-2 matrix, we have actually created a mapping from R2 to R3."
"Anyway, for some reason I find this to be especially neat."
"Hopefully, at least you find this somewhat instructive."
hello dear sports fans
I'm with you again DmitriyXfit
And you still do this?
And I don't do this anymore.
I haven't practiced for real for the last 7 months.
What the meaning of that?
For me if you were to pull it very far - it was like being a drug addict and not getting the high you need.
"But after some time I learned - no, I do practice because I go through everything in my head."
"I play with the band, I play concerts, I don't have time to do everything anymore."
But that time will hopefully come again.
As long as you work and do something you just need to be happy with yourself.
Teenagers who are sad and have a bad personal image send in a demo after demo and have no response from  record-labels.
They shouldn'tbe sad they should be proud of themselves that they  are not just sitting on the couch doing nothing.
Do you feel that you had to let go of many things to get where you are now?
No.
The only thing I let go without knowing was my first and biggest love.
"You talk a lot about love, you sing about love."
"Well, there are a lot of emotions in me; it's not for just anything."
"I get very emotional - ""Titanic' you know of it, right?"
"Or ""Notebook"","
I just cry because I put myself too far into the films.
And I can't be sad for breaking up with a girl when there obviously was fate surrounding the situation.
We're getting close to the end and we talked about it earlier - how does you future look?
If you can picture it?
If I'm allowed to decide...
But you will decide.
"Yes, my future looks like I will now do many concerts this summer which I will not let people cancel, that was some surprise."
And...
And I will after some time take a little vacation where I will think over what my next project will be.
I'm quite sure that one day I will end up in children's television as a host probably.
And I also really want to help with a new talent.
And I will turn into an old-news and then I want to be there discovering a new talent.
"It's kind of the ""circle of life""."
"Alexander Rybak, thank you for being here."
It's still 10 days away.
Ok.
"Quickly I went back to the message,  the first one and what I found is this, obviously."
"He was talking about Tuesday, August 20."
"And I was understanding, of course,  it was the time."
"There is a very thin line  between what I want to say, what I say, what the other guy  wants to hear and the way he understands it."
And any deviation in this thin line automatically puts us in what we generally call... a misunderstanding.
And even though  it produces discomfort to us
"I propose to you the idea that behind our misunderstandings  there is a lot of very useful information at first hand about ourselves, which is also giving us  an opportunity of learning, that allows us to grow and helps us  improve our relationships."
"Lets see, in 1514, spanish explorer"
"Francisco Fernández de Córdoba landed in the shores of the peninsula  he called Yucatán, because that was the word  natives pronunced when he asked them what was the name  of those shores in which he had landed."
"Later, it was known that  in the mayan language,"
"Yucatán means ""I don't understand""."
(Laughter)
"As I was saying,  our misunderstandings speak more about the way in which  we perceive things, than the way things are."
"We are constantly filtering  what we perceive and we do so all the time,  in a major or minor scale."
"As the famous adagio says,"
"""We don't see things just the way  they are, but the way we are""."
"Without going further,  a while ago I found myself working in a job presentation, totally abstracted from the exterior world and then"
I heard some kind of noise  from the exterior that was telling me
"""Bla-bla-bla the kids..."
Bla-bla-bla tomorrow ...
Bla-bla-bla balls...
"And in that moment I noticed  it was the voice of my wife, Maru, who was staring at me, and saying,"
"""Did you hear what I just said?"""
"""Who?"""
This catch phrases allow me  to gain some time.
"""Yes, yes, you were telling me that...  tomorrow I'll take the kids to school..."
"What happened with the balls?"""
"""See."
"When I speak to you,  you don't listen to me"""
"""Yes, eh..."""
What does it say to do?
It says check to see if I'm in that base case.
It's the list of length less than two.
Is it one basically?
"In which case, just return a copy the list."
That's the simple case.
"Otherwise, notice what it says to do."
It's says find the mid-point and split the list in half.
"Copy of the back end, sorry, copy of the left side, copy of the right side."
Run merge sort on those.
"By induction, if it does the right thing, I'm going to get back two lists, and I'm going to then merge them together."
Notice what I'm going to do.
"I'm going to print here the list if we go into it, and print of the when we're done and then just return that."
Merge up here.
There's a little more code there.
I'll let you just grok it but you can see it's basically doing what I did over there.
"Setting up two indices for the two sub-list, it's just walking down, finding the smallest element, putting it into a new list."
"When it gets to the end of one of the lists, it skips to the next part, and only one of these two pieces will get called because only one of them is going to have things leftovers."
It's going to add the other pieces in.
"OK, if you look at that then, let's look at what happened when we ran this."
We started off with a call with that list.
"Ah ha, split it in half."
It's going down the left side of this.
"That got split in half, and that got split in half until"
I got to a list of one.
Here's the first list of size one.
There's the second list of size one.
So I merged them.
"It's now in the right order, and that's coming from right there."
"Having done that, it goes back up and picks the second sub-list, which came from there."
"It's a down to base case, merges it."
"When these two merges are done, we're basically at a stage in that branch where we can now merge those two together, which gives us that, and it goes through the rest of it."
"We'll check that return equals, equals null, just like it did."
"In fact, it looks a lot like the stack, actually."
And here I'm going to show you something kind of funny.
If I go take my stack CCPs pop.
"So if you remember what pop did over here, is it took the front most cell off the"
list.
And in the case of the queue that was the popping operation.
And it turns out the D queue operation is exactly the same.
"If we're empty, right, then we want to raise there."
"Otherwise, we take the head's value."
"We move around the head, we delete the old memory."
So it's not actually the top element.
"I should, actually, be a little bit more careful about my copying and pasting here."
I could really call that front.
It's the front-most element on the top.
But it's like the exact same mechanics work to take a cell off the front in that way.
"Well, that's sort of nice."
"And it's like, yeah, well, since I have some code around I want to go try it."
"My stack, also, kind of does some things useful in push that I might be able to use."
"It's not exactly the same because it's adding it to the front, but it is setting up a new cell."
So I'm going to make a new cell and I set its value.
"Then, it's attaching"
looks a little different.
Let's take a look.
"We omitted a cell, copied the value in, now the goal is giving our pointer to the tail, we want to attach onto the tail."
"So we know that it's always going to have a next of null, the new cell."
"So no matter what, it will be the new last cell and it defiantly needs that value that tells us we're at the end of the list."
And then we have to attach it to our tail.
I'm going to write this code first and it's going to be wrong.
So just go along with me in this case.
If the tail's next is the new cell.
"So if I'm wiring in the pointer from the tail onto the cell we have there, and then we want to update the tail to point to the cell."
Let's say that this distance between this leg and the book is 1 meter-- or the box.
"Let's say that this distance between the leg and the center of mass is 2 meters, and so this is also 2 meters."
"OK, so we can now set this up as a moment problem."
"So remember, all of the clockwise moments have to equal all of the counterclockwise moments."
So what are all of the clockwise moments?
What are all of the things that want to make the table rotate this way or this way?
"Well, the leg is the only thing keeping it from doing that."
So everything else is essentially a clockwise moment.
"So we have this 100 Newtons, and it is 1 meter away."
Its moment arm distance is 1.
"So these are all the clockwise moments, 100 times 1, right?"
"It's 100 Newtons acting downwards in the clockwise direction, clockwise moment, and it's 1 meter away, plus we have the center of mass at the top of the table, which is 20"
"Newtons, plus 20 Newtons, and that is 2 meters away from our designated axis, so 20 times 2."
"And you might say, well, isn't this leg exerting some force?"
"Well, sure it is, but its distance from our designated axis is zero, so its moment of force is zero."
Even if it is exerting a million pounds or a million
"Newtons, its moment of force, or its torque, would be zero because its moment arm distance is zero, so we can ignore it, which makes things simple."
So those were the only clockwise moments.
And what's the counterclockwise moment?
"Well, that's going to be the force exerted by this leg."
That's what's keeping the whole thing from rotating.
So it's the force of the leg times its distance from our axis.
"Well, this is a total of 4 meters, which we've said here, times 4 meters."
And so we can just solve.
"We get 100 plus 40, so we get 140 is equal to the force of the leg times 4."
So what's 140-- 4 goes into 140 35 times?
My math is not so good.
Is that right?
4 times 30 is 120.
120 plus 20.
So the force of the leg is 35 Newtons upwards.
"And since this isn't moving, we know that the downward force right here must be 35 Newtons."
"Our porch served as a place to relax, for meals, nargilla, the dining room"
"Here are the stairs, here was the dormitory, two rooms, 30 guys- our first class."
This is where the Mechina began.
"We were told, ""There's a kindergarten about to be abandoned, not far away, just as the municipality promised us."
It wasn't clear if we were suppossed to get both classrooms or just one.
"In the end, the kindergarten emptied and we added caravans."
Here were the sports area and a mini obstacle course
Here was the climbing rope
"Everyone who came to the Mechina knew that by the end of the year, he'll reach the top of the rope."
"In the end, after 5 amazing years in Kiryat Malachi, the Mechina had to move on."
"We came here, to the Shafir area."
We had study partners at the local school.
They told me all the time to check out the Mechina program.
"I came thinking I'd be here for a week or two, and then move on to the army.."
I had no intention to stay..
I wanted to just go straight into the army without thinking too much.
"I didn't even think for a moment about life processes, yeshiva."
Not even for a moment.
"My thinking at the beginning of the year was to come to the Mechina, do my psychometric tests, and then immediately apply for the Atuda program, without any thoughts of staying"
I came to the Mechina
And I see great guys great Rabbis who love us for who we are.
You see the warmth here.
I saw that this Mechina is more special than the other Mechinot I saw.
Gili was a Platoon Commander in the Tank Corp.
They were called to go to Ramallah.
They asked Gili and his platoon to enter the junction in order to attract the gunfire away from the infantry.
This is what saved them.
They told him it was enough but he insisted on going in again.
One bullet penetrated the earpiece on his helmet and killed him.
"About a year after Gil was killed, a major donor of the Mechina, Sandy Kolb asked us if we would agree that the Beit Midrash be named after Gili."
This is how we got to know Rav Boaz and Naftali Kendler.
Their self-sacrifice is close in my heart to the self-sacrifice exhibited by Gil to his soldiers.
"And then I want to add this 2p minus 1 here, so plus 2p minus 1."
And what do I get?
These cancel out.
These cancel with that.
And these guys cancel out.
So there's a total of p squared possible A's where the determinant of A is divisible by p.
"Now, we're very close, but this isn't what they're asking."
They want the total members where the determinant of A is not divisible by p.
"So all we have to do here is take our total membership, which is p to the third, and subtract from that the members whose determinants are divisible by p."
And we just figured that out.
We subtract p squared.
And now we'll get the number of A's where determinant of A not divisible by p.
"Now let's see if that's one of the choices, and it is."
"D, p cubed minus p squared."
Mary Shelly wrote Frankenstein.
"If there is one monster that you know by name, you may think its Frankenstein."
"Of course, if you remember the book, Frankenstein is actually the name of the individual who brings the creature to life."
The monster is unnamed entirely.
Not every memory is 100 percent reliable.
"For example, the most common image of Mary Shelley shows her as a mature woman."
"While you read the book, it might be worth bearing in mind that she was only eighteen years old when she began writing it."
"Also, there are two introductions to the book in most of the available editions these days, one written in 1818, one written in 1831, both nominally by Mary Shelley."
"Some people feel that the first one was written by her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley."
"But since he died in 1822, the 1831 preface is certainly hers."
These are not random additions to the novel.
I ask you to read those before you read the text itself.
"Finally, as you read the book, you might be wanting to keep in mind that the book is constructed with different narrative voices, speaking to us, through each other."
Are all of those voices equally trustworthy?
Is every narrator truly reliable?
"What are their motives in saying what they say, and the way they say it?"
"They do, after all, live in a world with monsters."
"I'm the trouble starter,  punking' instigator"
We've got enough to worry about with the illness; that's not counting what the government is trying to do to cut our money down.
"I thought this was a really good stunt, if you like, to highlight the difficulties faced by people with MS in walking 20 metres."
It doesn't look like a vast distance to have to walk but it depends on the day.
"If you've got MS, you can't pin down that you're going to be that well all the time."
It's different every day.
I think it's gone really really well.
It's nice to see that there's a lot of people on our side.
I think it's very good that we had an MP with us.
Stephen Lloyd (off camera):
"""I think a really good piece of campaigning from the MS Society."""
It's really nice that there's several different news people here.
Well I hope it's made people aware of what the problems are that people like us have.
I'm a bit more positive now than what I was earlier on.
I think today more than anything I felt proud; proud of what we're doing a proud of people with MS.
Anchor:
Students at Western illinois are trying to get drunk drivers off the road.
The university's emergency medical services hosted it's 16th annual Mock DUI project.
College volunteers show people what a drunk driving accident looks like.
"With prom and graduation right around the corner, officers say it's important to stop drunk driving."
Officer:
The numbers related to DUI accidents and fatalities is pretty staggering.
Everybody has somebody that they know or a loved one that knows someone that has been involved in a DUI accident or been killed in a vehicle accident of this nature.
Anchor:
"Local hospitals, police and fire departments help set up the event."
All emergency officials respond to the accident as if it was real.
"Cubs fans sing ""Go, Cubs, go"""
"White Sox fans chant ""Go, go, White Sox"""
"Both sets of fans say ""Go, CTA"""

There's an not a decade long period.
Where you have health care expenditures less than the growth in GDP or equal to the growth in GDP.
"And you can see in almost every year, here it's almost two%."
"Here it's almost three%, it is three percent 1990s last and we'll talk about this in a second."
An d you can see in this period 2-1/2%.
"Overall, 2.4 percent for 40 years.You're on, you're on, those of who have understood the idea of compound interest."
"That makes a grow, grow, grow."
"But I do wanted, draw your attention."
"There is one year there, one year, one decade, the 1990s where it only grew 1.3 percent above GDP."
What was happening do you think in the 1990s that did that?
"Could, empower, that's right."
So 1993 he takes office in January.
He attends to introduce health care reform and get
National Health Coverage and what happens?
"It was defeated, that's right."
"Lots of reasons why it was defeated and we'll talk about that on the first session of the ACA why, what some of the differences are but it was defeated."
One of the reasons it was defeated was.
The passed Congress.
"Yes, that's correct."
But that means it wasn't a coalition.
Who pulled out of the coalition?
Businesses.
And they pulled out because they thought they could get a better deal somewhere else and the thought was the manage care companies came to them and said we can hold your cost down.
You don't need the government.
And the way they were going to do it was with manage care and then what happened.
So one thing that happened is that reduce choice and
Americans rebelled because at that time the main mechanism that manage can control the cost was to reduce what they paid doctors but also restrict choices of the population.
"There was a line going around in the 1990s, one 800 just say no."
That's what happened.
Men's care company gave you an 800 number if you didn't like their decisions and all that happened at the other 800 number just say no.
And the consequence was.
Manage care was able to control cost for a short period of time and we'll see about five years but then towards the end of the 90s cost went up.

"As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion."
"And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the early part of the 20th century."
It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage.
"Now, I won't use mirrors, but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater."
So let the story begin.
"On a dark and stormy night -- really! -- it was the 10th of July, 1856."
"Lightning lit the sky, and a baby was born."
"His name was Nikola,"
Nikola Tesla.
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.
Let me show you.
"Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?"
Nikola Tesla:
"The result is 118,236."
Marco Tempest:
Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.
"When a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind."

The Red Line stops just outside the ballparks 35th Street is the stop for U.S. Cellular.
Addison is the stop for Wrigley.
What could be more convenient and fun than a train full of like-minded fans?
How about a bus full of fans?
The #152 Addison bus drops fans just feet from the friendly confines... ...as does the #22 Clark and #8 Halsted.
The #35 35th street and 39 Pershing buses offer front door service to U.S. Cellular.
The CTA once again has commemorative fare cards and posters for this year's Crosstown series.
The posters have become sought-after souvenirs ever since they were first introduced in 1998
"This year's poster features the unsung heroes of the ballpark, the hot dog vendors."
Let's be frank.
Grilled meat and cold beverages are as much a part of the ball park experience as the game itself.
"""Exactly."
"It's part of the atmosphere, its part of the environment."""
Steve Musgrave is an illustrator who has created twelve Crosstown series posters for the CTA.
The 2010 poster is a whimsical departure from past depictions of ball players.
"""I appreciate the fact the CTA was open to doing something a little more playful than a baseball player- so it's a hot dog vendor."""
"Steve's first CTA gig was a series of baseball-themed paintings that adorn the Addison ""L"" station"
"Now, his posters adorn countless walls in and across Chicago. "" I really enjoy it, it's a lot of fun..."
"Some people collect them and some go out of their way to pick them up, which is nice to see."""
"""I'm a big fan of earlier 20th century European poster design kind of a streamlined or deco look."""
"""Every time I design them I picture them on some kid's wall, what I would have done with them as a kid."""
And how does he decide whether to put Cubs versus Sox ... or Sox versus Cubs?
"""Whoever hosts the games first gets the top billing."""
"Prior to each game of the series, CTA employees distribute the posters as long as supplies last."
"The commemorative farecards are available for purchase in CTA vending machines across the system, throughout the month of June or while supplies last."
Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone

"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
The correct answer is:
"When evil is legal, become a criminal."
"When oppression is enacted as ""law,"" become a law-breaker."
When those violently victimizing the innocent have badges become a cop-killer. so the next time you hear of a police officer being killed in the line of duty take a moment to consider the very real possibility that maybe in that case the law enforcer was the bad guy and the cop killer was the good guy.
"As it happens, that has been the case more often than not throughout human history."
Stephen:
Come with me in the airplane and you are
looking at the instrument panel and you are flying in the clouds.
You can't see a thing.
Imagine.
"Now you are born deaf, profoundly deaf."
"If you have never heard anything in your life, how is it that you can fly airplanes?"
How is it that you can hear people teach you how to talk?
I am that person.
Announcer:
"""The guy just blew me away."" ""One of the best speeches I have ever heard."""
"""He's funny, poignant and he's lived it."""
That's what people are saying about Stephen Hopson.
A passionate and entertaining speaker.
His message about overcoming adversity comes from his heart and his own experience.
"Deaf since birth, Stephen never let his disability become an obstacle to achieving his dreams and reaching his goals."
"In February of 2006, Stephen became the world's first instrument rated deaf pilot."
A dream which began in childhood.
Stephen:
"When I was 4 years old, I begged my mother to take me to the airport so I could watch planes take off and land."
Did you ever do that?
"OK, so you know what I am talking about."
"Remember, I am 4 years old!"
My mother would park her car by the fence and I would be so eager because I wanted to be a pilot.
I would hop out of the car and I would run up to the fence and I would put my fingers on the wires of the fence and I would wait for a plane to come out.
"The minute a plane came out, I would put my head on the hood of her car, like this... and then I would wait for an airplane to take off."
"And as soon as that plane took off, the car would vibrate."
Those would be things like...
Our release engineer at the time had the keys to the server room where the Mozilla machines operated.
"These are small details but they were really important at the time and we knew that if he could do it he would help us keep Mozilla operating and we knew that Chofmann was running the engineering organisation and we knew that he would be helpful as it turned out, we needed him."
And Marcia had the keys to the closet that was our single supply of Mozilla t-shirts.
Which I bought with my own money.
"Oh, no."
"That was later, nevermind."
The ones I bought later.
But she had that key and she had access to some other things.
"So we would sit and think how many machines do we need, how many employees do we need."
"If we have one employee, is it Leef who runs the build machines?"
"If we have one employee, is it Brendan?"
Who is he?
And what's the best way to keep Mozilla operating?
But when it came to it I was the only one who was fired and so the rest of the Mozilla folks were left and Chofmann provided a haven for us to try and continue to be effective as well.
So this was this first era.
"So after I was fired there were a bunch of people still at Netscape, working on Netscape navigator."
As part of that we finally managed to ship our first product as Mozilla.
Mozilla 1.0 we called it.
And this had been a long time in coming.
That was in 2002.
We started Mozilla in 1998 and expected to have a product very shortly afterwards.
"But it turned out, when we got into it that the technology was pretty old."
Brendan made the decision to really build the new technology base.
That technology base is Gecko.
It cost us years to get the rendering engine to a point where we could really build a good application on it and ship it.
We finally did that in 2002.
It was Mozilla 1.0 and it was technically a good product.
It was technically a shockingly good product.
"Across the open source space, where people knew it they were retelling us they were really shocked to how good a product it was."
But it was not a consumer product.
"It was really built by developers, for developers."
Now Mister Morton is happy and Pearl and the cat are too.
"They're the subjects of the sentence and what the predicate says, they do."
Are you a hardworking artist?
I think I'm a hardworker but at the sametime I'm lazy.
"I usually wake up, get rest, watch tv, do nothing."
Then in few hours I can work more than enough and finish everything.
I can't say that it's racked my brain
"Well there must be something, it's all done by yourself, but I'm sure it's also improvised."
There's not a certain subject nor story.
These are not message giving drawings.
Usually there's a main subject.
"Not in all, but some of them"
"Some are very simple ideas, and some are about very personal things that even I might be embarresed to tell."
I usually think how to deformate an idea onto the drawing.
"For example it can be read from this side, and if we look at it from this side, it can be something completely different."
I try to take an idea in this way as well.
"while trying to draw for example a house or a castle, there are several technics, academical or perspective..."
"For example, here the castle can symbolise a room but I don't think what symbolizes the room."
I have fun when it becomes something different with the free angle.
It's like I make some rules and actually I play a game.
Colors.. .
I have my own color restrictions and I don't pay attention to do them at the same time or to let them be in an harmony.
"As I said before, between the years 2007 and 2008,"
"I've been in a period of searching and all these pictures came out afterall, which made me really happy."
"If a pshycologist would come and see these drawings, he or she might evaluate, analyse and say something about them."
"And the result might show the truth about me, but I don't think about it too much,"
"I only try to keep myself in a positive way, self-enclosed."
Since few years I've been reading William S. Burroughs and interested in Beat Literature...
"Lately he has written the book called ""My Education"" where he talks about his dreams."
"I read it sometimes, it became one of my favorites..."
The name of this exhibition comes likely from there.
"Actually there are less handwritings than my past works, and signutares are bigger."
So whatever that number divided by 2.
"So the pulley itself, the acceleration of the pulley is half of this number, which is 1.59 meters per second squared to the right."
"I know this was a fairly difficult problem and the key realizations though, I think that you had to discover or realize in order to be able to do this was a couple of things."
"One, that the acceleration of this pulley is half the acceleration of the block, or the acceleration of the block is double the acceleration of the pulley."
You have to realize that.
And then you just have to work out the net horizontal forces and realize well the only thing pulling on this block is friction going backwards and tension of the rope to the right.
And that same tension of the rope is constant throughout this wire or through this rope.
"And on this pulley, and this might not be something that you had already realized about pulleys, but now you will, is that since the rope essentially goes around the pulley, it's pulling twice on the pulley."
"And the tension's constant, so it's pulling with a tension of"
T on the top and the bottom.
"And if you realized those things, then it's just a"
little bit of algebra to get the acceleration of the block and the acceleration of the pulley.
"Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse you too much."
I would call this a five star problem if you would see this type of problem on physics competitions.
"So if you know how to do this, you're doing well, at least as far as tension and ropes and friction are concerned."
I'll see you in the next video.

Friendly and a lot of teaching.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;REDMOND:
There's lots of geometry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;VlLLARREAL:
It's more heartfelt than anywhere I've ever been before.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ORAN:
Whoa!
That sums it up pretty well.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;GONGVATANA:
So many words that come to mind...
I'm getting nervous!

Hi My name is Colleen Hall-Patton and I am your teacher/faciliator for this semester.
I thought that you should probably have some idea who you're dealing with not all of these are going to be video recordings but we will start with this so you at least have some idea who I am.
A little bit of background about me to begin with is I have a PH.D. in Sociology from UNLV in 2004 took me ten years to do that so those of you on the long track on this I empathize.
A Bachelors and Masters Degree in Anthropology and so I take kind of a more world view of things and across cultural sort of view on stuff.
I have been teaching Women's Studies at UNLV since 1999 while I was still a graduate student and I think in Women's Studies especially it is important to know the placement of where you are or a person is in various hierarchies.
So here's mine.
I am came of age in the 1970's at kind of the height of optimism on changes on the second women's movement.
I am married had been for 35 years.
Which I don't think I am old enough to be married that long but there it is.
Two kids who are both young adults. and I had a 25 year career in Information Technology and switched over to teaching full time in 2003.
So that's kind of a background of where we are on this.
"In terms of the class, the class is organized in modules 1 for each week and our book has 13 chapters so we've got 13 chapters over 15 weeks."
"In this we have a life time of experience doing gender, race, class, ability even though we may not recognize that we do and of course our experiences are all unique."
Recommendations for this class is stay on top of the work.
"Do the work for the week in the week, contribute to the discussions that's going to our primary place of talking to each other."
I will be in out of them as well.
You learn through participation.
You learn from the other students.
To find out why Sarah Lee is suddenly tongue tied in class the school's resource teacher takes her to see speech and language specialist Donna
Orloff.
I'm going to read a sentence to you.
Orloff starts by testing Sarah Lee's basic language skills.
Look at some pictures and you can start up here at A.
"Lion, horse, mouse."
She has very good language for single words.
"She knows a lot of labels, a lot of nouns."
And she uses them and she understands them.
But there are other words that were associated-- not the direct label-- but associated with the pictures.
And that posed difficulty for her.
Perfect.
Point to swine.
So we get to swine.
She had no idea what swine is.
She's heard it.
She's heard it from reading Charlotte's Web.
But she doesn't have that rich storage system that enables her to tap the vocabulary and to retrieve the words that she needs.
"Our brains are basically a very complex storage and retrieval system where every piece of information that comes in to you, you put it someplace so that you can refer to it later on."
"If you see a Saint Bernard walking down the street, your retrieval system goes to your storage system, pulls out all of the note cards that it has on dogs, go through it until it finds Saint Bernard, and says, oh"
"look, there's a Saint Bernard."
All this happens in a millisecond.
And then you take that card and put it back where it belongs so when you need it next time you can find it.
The problem with these kids is that the storage and retrieval systems are very complicated and generally very confused.
So they will go and take the card out and then put it back in the wrong place.
"That ability to make mental connections, to go from one file drawer to the next also affects the way kids think abstractly."
"A student talking about a trip says, it's still up in the air."
Probably he's talking about a trip going around the world.
This is the child who only sees the picture of the pig is the pig.
The picture of the train is the train.
"If it's up in the air, he's got to be on an airplane."
"Language is never that one to one, rigid, concrete correlation."
Google are among the big donors that have allowed the Khan Academy to add nearly a dozen software engineers.
It's really smartly done on the computer.
And I love being on the computer!
"With more than 2,000,000 users a month, many others seem to love Khan's lesssons, too!"
"I've already taught 70,000,000 lessons!"
And he will be happy to teach millions more.

"Mountainview, California."
We launched our own Open Culture Data competition in June 2012... ...after the succes of winning the Apps for the Netherlands competition.
We set up our own competition with three goals for developers.
"Firstly, use Open Culture Data to increase the audience reach and use of this data - online, offline and on site."
"Secondly, connect different datasets."
"Many of are separated, even though they have related information."
"Thirdly, make innovative new apps or websites with Open Culture Data."
There were four awards for the developers... ...three Open Culture Data prizes and one special Dutch National Archives prize.
"We promoted... ...the competition during two large-scale hackathons in June and October, and a smaller one in December... ...and by giving presentations at developer gatherings and at conferences."
"The competition closed on December 31, 2012."
And on 1 January it turned out 27 apps were submitted for the competition.
The Open Culture Data award ceremony took place in January.
The jury consisting of a mix of heritage professionals and copyright specialists chose the four winners.
The winner was the Muse app by No strings.
It's an iPad app in which you can rearrange parts of paintings to make a new artwork.
The second prize went to Histagram by Richard Jong of Frontwise.
On this website you can personalize press photos of the Dutch National Archives and send them to friends.
Bronze was won by SimMuseum by Hay Kranen.
In this game you are a museum director and can trade artworks with other museums.
The Dutch National Archives award was won by Tijdbalk.nl from Arjan den Boer.
With this app you can make your own timeline by combining different data sources on the same subject.
My drive to use open source and open cultural data is that it forces you to think outside the box.
You open up to the unexpected by letting others in on your projects.
If you work closed source you stay on your own island.
You gotta miss me though
Let's turn his room into a gym
We ain't putting no gym in my media room.
Who's media room?
Our media room
"Okay, US health care cost."
"In 2010 which is the last year for which we have reliable data, we're two years behind on these data."
"We spent, the United States spent 2.6 trillion dollars on health care."
"Now, I have gone through lots and lots and"
lots and lots of places and talked about this spending and one of the things I have noticed is no matter where.
I go.
People have a very poor grasp of the word trillion.
And how big this number is.
So we have a few mechanisms to put this in context for you.
It's great for cocktail parties or frat parties or any place else you need to talk to someone and raise irrelevant topics and just show how smart you are so here is the first question for your audience response thing.
"If you convert health care spending, that 2.6 trillion dollars, how many years ago is 2.6 trillion seconds."
"40 percent said 80,000."
"Twenty, 100,000, 28%, you guys got it right."
"It's 80,000 years ago, 2.6 trillion."
Do you know how long ago that is?
"When was the first human that left the African continent, modern human that left the African continent to explore the rest of the world?"
"They didn't go out to explore, they went out looking for food that was 60,000 years ago."
This is before human being migrated out of the African continent and we're measuring this in seconds.
"So, how big is a trillion."
"Well, a million seconds [inaudible] actually it's about twelve days ago."
"One billion seconds is the year I graduated college, you guys can figure that out for yourself, okay? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it, there you go. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [laugh]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I got to fix that slide."
"A trillion in seconds is 30,000 PC, 2.6 is around 80,000, alright?"
Just a huge number.
"Now, I know seconds is not what you think about and 80,000 years ago is a little too much at some ways."
"So, we're going to the moon."
"Single dollar bills, nice, crisp bills gotten right after the federal reserve and printed them, stacked up."
"You can see a 100 million crisp bills is pretty [inaudible], 6.8 miles. $One bills, right?"
The clocks are set at different times and moving at different speeds.
So the clocks are totally out of sync with each other and the child is generally out of sync with his environment.
"But the law of averages will tell you, if you take three clocks, set them at different times, and move them to different speeds, eventually-- bingo, bingo, bingo-- there will come a time when the three of them are all telling the same time."
"And when the clocks are in sync, there's this incredible forward movement on the part of the child-- for a day or week or a month if you're lucky, this incredible forward movement and progress."
And then the clocks get out of sync again.
The moment of truth called demystification.
You are like a wonderful car like a Mercedes or a Jaguar.
"But it has a very small gas tank so that when you try to think or do a lot of work, it runs out of fuel pretty easily."
"Demystification, I think, may be the most important movement in this field in the last 10 years."
And that is explaining to the child what the problem is.
"If you have a child with diabetes, one of the first things you do is explain to the child this is what diabetes is."
These are the foods you can eat.
This is what's happening to your body when you don't eat the proper food.
And explain line and verse.
"Yet when a child has a learning problem, we try to protect the child from it."
"I've had parents say to me, he doesn't know he has a learning problem."
"Indeed, he does."
"And sometimes a child takes great comfort in the diagnosis, in knowing"
I'm not the only person that has it.
I'm not stupid like the kids tell me in the school bus.
I'm not lazy like the teacher tells me every day.
There's really a name for this.
The second problem you have is what we call a graphomotor problem.
You don't have very good control over the very little muscles at the ends of your fingers.
And you know what you do because of that?
You try to get rid of them.
You know how you get rid of them?
By putting your thumb over these two fingers.
And you bear down real hard.
And you end up writing with your wrists.
And that's too slow.
And then you know what happens?
"So this is linear, order n and n is this sum of the element, or sorry, the number of elements in each list."
I said I was going to back my way into this.
That gives me a way to merge things.
So here's what merge sort would do.
"Merge sort takes this idea of divide and conquer, and it does the following: it says let's divide the list in half."
There's the divide and conquer.
And let's keep dividing each of those lists in half until we get down to something that's really easy to sort.
What's the simplest thing to sort?
"A list of size one, right?"
So continue until we have singleton lists.
"Once I got a list of size one they're sorted, and then combine them."
Combine them by doing emerge the sub-lists.
"And again, you see that flavor."
"I'm going to just keep dividing it up until I get something really easy, and then I'm going to combine."
"And this is different than binary search now, the combine is going to have to do some work."
"So, I'm giving you a piece of code that does this, and I'm going to come back to it in the second, but it's up there."
But what I'd like to do is to try you sort sort of a little simulation of how this would work.
"And I was going to originally make the TAs come up here and do it, but I don't have enough t a's to do a full merge sort."
"So I'm hoping, so I also have these really high-tech props."
I spent tons and tons of department money on them as you can see.
I hope you can see this because I'm going to try and simulate what a merge sort does.
"I've got eight things I want to sort here, and those initially start out here at top level."
The first step is divide them in half.
All right?
"I'm not sure how to mark it here, remember I need to come back there."
I'm not yet done.
What do I do?
Divide them in half again.
"You know, if I had like shells and peas here I could make some more money."
What do I do?
I divide them in half one more time.
"Let me cluster them because really what I have, sorry, separate them out."
"And then he bids for one million, and of course no one bid, any bids for five hundred thousand, four hundred, three hundred.."
Let's start two-fifty.
Someone put their hand up - two-fifty.
"And that's when he started - two-fifty two-fifty, we've got two-seventy-five, two-seventy-five, two-seventy-five, anyone two-seventy-five!"
We've got two-seventy-five!!
"Three-hundred, three-hundred, wawawawawawa..!!"
[laughter].
"And even I was a monk, even I started getting excited."
[laughter].
"And you can see just how they do this, just the way they speak, they suddenly raise their voice and started speaking very quickly, and you do get excited."
"And how emotions can be generated, when you see how those emotions can be generated, you can actually sometimes be in power over other people's emotions."
"Just by acting slowly, and by speaking softly you can calm people down."
One of the first times I saw this and it was very impressive was the former abbot and Spiritual Director of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia
Ajahn Jagaro.
I was with him when he was a monk just learning his trade in Thailand.
Because we do learn a trade - this is a training which we go through.
And we were having our morning meal when a Thai lady ran into our dining hall.
"She ran in, and she's obviously very upset, because they don't usually do this - interfering in a monk's meal."
"And she was saying something in Thai, and I actually caught it after a while, she said ""Suchin is dead!"
Suchin is dead!
She shot herself!
"She's committed suicide!""."
"And I got really quite excited too because I knew that lady, she had cancer, we've been going to see her, talking to her, counselling her."
She was a close disciple of the monastery.
"And that morning she had shot herself, and this was her best friend who found her body."
"She came in to the monastery just straight away, completely distraught having found her best friend committed suicide."
You can understand what she felt like.
"And I understood that, and I looked to Ajahn Jagaro who was the head monk at that time to see what he would do."
He understood what she'd said and he put his head down and carried on eating.
And this
"lady - ""She shot herself!"
"She killed herself!"" - and the monk just carried on eating as if nothing had happened."
But the PAL-V is not the only flying car - or driving plane if you prefer - coming on to the market.
The US-based firm Terrafugia have just carried out successful tests on their own street-legal plane called the Transition.
"Terrafugia say around 100 orders have already been placed for the car, which will cost roughly the same as its European cousin."

MATT FARAH:
It's impossible to ignore the parallels between being in the desert and driving a race car.
"The feeling of isolation, your having total control over every aspect of the experience, and if something goes wrong, there's nothing there to save you."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
Inde Motorsports Park is certainly remote enough out in the Arizona desert.
"The front straight doubles as a runway, so it's long, wide, and unforgiving."
"Rest of the two-mile circuit is bumpy, dusty, tight, and blind."
And the AVI Racing Corvette GT1 is probably the fastest track car I've ever driven.
"Or if not, it's certainly the loudest."
"In-car audio not, so much."
"I have no idea if you can hear me or not, this is by far the"
loudest car I've ever driven.
"AVl's Wayne McKeen, after putting tens of thousands into a C6 Corvette CO6 to go racing, had a revelation-- if you want to build a Corvette for the track, why start with a Corvette that's meant for the street."
That's like buying a casino when all you needed was a card table.
WAYNE MCKEEN:
I love Corvettes.
The geometry and the engineering that's went into the Corvette for a track car is unbelievable.
And we needed a stiff chassis to complement the geometry of the Corvette.
This car is a tube-frame GT1 Corvette race car.
"Essentially, a Corvette stock car, with a completely rebuilt, redesigned two-frame chassis that's extremely stuff."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"The body of this car is made out of-- this current car-- is made out of fiberglass the production cars will be out of carbon fiber and Kevlar as an option, which saves about 80 pounds to the weight of the whole vehicle."
"And the chassis itself, dry weight is about 23-30 the way it sits."
"So, getting a stock zero 6 down under 3,000 pounds for a race car is extremely tough."
I asked people to join us on the board and it slowly started to grow.
I started to advertise and it s started to grow more.
I have had many parents and community members say they learned alot and that makes me happy and excited.
"I""m exicted to see how much it has grown,but it still needs more ""sun""(attention)and more water(love)."
I want your help.
We need money-it's honest.
We need money.
"But,I""m not going to ask you for alot."
I 'm just asking you to give $10.
"If everyone would donate $10,together we can raise alot of money."
"We can raise $5,000."
What will we do with that money?Go shopping?NO:) We will be able to give 8 children 8 weeks of free therapy.
We have hooked up with frendo a new company.
There is no processing fee.
"If you give $10, then CCI gets $10."
"Please,I am asking you to go to www.frendo.com and check out the charity of the week"

Thank you.
Taking just a few seconds to cool freshly laid eggs could add weeks to thier shelf life according to a Purdue University study.
The rapid cooling process uses liquid carbon dioxide to stabilize the protein in eggs thus extending their shelf life.
You can cool eggs many different ways.
"Traditional cooling of eggs, which would be the eggs you would find in the grocery store those are typically just cooled under ambient conditions where the eggs are put into a carton, they're about 105°F. and then they cool over time."
It takes about 10-14 days for those eggs to cool to refrigeration temperature.
The egg cooling system that we've developed here based on using carbon dioxide as a liquid that we can spray and create a cold snow.
This snow is about -107°C.
(negative).
This snow can be circulated around the eggs and we're able to then rapidly cool eggs.
Instead of taking 10-14 days we can do it in the range of seconds of treatment time.
Eggs cooled under current methods lose the AA grade in about six weeks.
Keener's study shows that this rapid cooling process can significantly increase this time period.
"So typically your eggs at the grocery store, those are traditionally cooled where they are just allowed to cool under ambient conditions."
The shelf life on those eggs is usually 4-6 weeks.
"Because, if they were down at the South Atlantic, it'd take a while for somebody to get to them."
And so we'd throw that out 150 ft above the deck and you try to wrap it around
"like, here's the capsule, and the wind is -"
"They'd put two small ones, the capsule, and then the other two."
"And they're tied together, so they'd wrap right around."
"And then then you'd drop your paramedics, and those guys were good."
They were experts in nine fields.
"They're paramedics, mechanics, parachute guys, anything."
Great bunch.
So we did this for a while and really got it down.
They'd mark spots like you do in the side window and they guided you in.
"I'd be on hot mike in the back, and they'd be looking out seeing the thing."
"The capsule, and the logger?"
Yep.
They'd see the capsule and the logger because they'd nod their head one way and you'd go one degree
"left, two degrees right."
"And then they'd jump, just like that."
And it didn't make any difference what the wind was doing.
"One night, them seas had to have been ten feet high and blowing the top right off them."
Middle of the night.
"And we went up to 20,000 feet so a couple million candle [?] out the back end."
Flares.
And then we'd go back down.
But then the astronauts show up and so we flew to Houston twice for a weekend two different times out in Houston.
And we went out there because they had different equipment.
And they also wanted to see who was going to pick them up.
If they got in trouble...
"So they get on the plane, and it's funny because all I had was a stack of wood pallets with a piece of plywood on it and the flight [?] around a couple power cords so they could have - they call it [?] - search and"
"locator ... anyway, they were just improving on this to find the capsule."
"That was back in the early 60s, you know, sort of primitive."
"So, they're on the plane, and I never gave it a thought."
"You meet them, and you're working with them and they go out and fly with us and they'd see what I was doing in the cabin and they were offering advice on what it was like and the scuba guys and the whole bunch, we all worked together."
"I feel the energy, the heart filled, I see all of your faces, really just brightening up."
We are going to end here and remind everyone to come back  to the basic practice.
Because I know we have been stimulated.
Don't let that pull you from who you are.
"I think we have touched that, the truth of who you are and your practice in the present moment."
"Don't let anything tempt you and lose that, even if it is about teaching  and education and all that."
"We just come back to our breath,  our steps, basic things that will..."
"Actually all the things that we need  are already in us and with the practice, we can trust that."
"With the mother and... as parents too, the teenagers."
I work with a lot of teens and the mindfulness has helped me a lot to really call out what it is that is really happening in present moment.
You only can do that calmly  if you've done your own homework.
So there is nothing that  you cannot solve or deal with.
"Mindfulness is just an energy, is not a technique, an energy we can cultivate."
"Just in present moment, you can recognize and call out to the teenagers to the students, what it is, what is happening."
"But calmly, with a lot of love  and compassion, miracles happen."
We all have experienced that  wherever arena we are in.
"So that encourages you for the next hour, or as we eat lunch."
"Don't think about this,  let it go."
"Come back to your steps, come back to your dinner."
"What it is that you are looking for, it is already in there."
"I think we all know that already, that's why we're here,to actually cultivate that."
"So we learn the teaching mind,  a teacher's mind which is... more things, more pieces of paper."
"We just let go, come back."
"So, we'll end here  with three sounds of the bell for us to really enjoy this moment and to let this happiness and what we touched here for the sharings, giving us a lot of energy."
"We let that dissipate  into all the teachers, all the students, all the young ones, all the parents  out there, all doing their best."

May we end here?
Can I teach you a song?
"I'll sing the first line, okay?"
"After all, the poison that doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
I have a friend.
He had another friend.
They become business associates together.
And they decided to expand their business into European expansion.
My friend was responsible for it.
"While my friend was busy with the European expansion, he was hit by the news that his friend has committed a massive financial fraud, and ran away."
"And, we are talking massive, we are talking mega dollars, because the business was dealing with those kinds of sums."
"My friend was investigated, suspected, but anyway, at the end of the story, although the investigations proved that my friend was innocent, and in fact, he was a victim, it destroyed his life in the country where he lived, and he had to leave."
"In the other country, where he went maybe about 2-3 months later,  he was hit by another crisis that hit him in a very personal way."
Something that only his wife and I know.
"Nobody else knows, not even his family."
"You'd say, by that time, he should be finished."
He's done.
Two major crisis in your life almost instantly.
But he managed to stand up again.
He managed to rise again.
"Right now, he is facing another crisis, another major disappointment."
"But I look at his face, and I see a defined man."
I see a man who refuses to give up.
I see a man who's still trying to build up his life.
He reminds me of a story.
And this is where I want to end this.
My time is almost done.
"Of a man who enters into a fight, one of those ancient fights, there were no rings at the time, they used to fight in the open."
And he gets beaten up in his face and he falls flat on the ground.
He rises up again and is hit again.
"Every time he rises up, he is hit again, third, fourth time, he's down on the ground. trying to rise up, he thinks in his head,"
"""If I'm able to stand up again, it's because I refuse to stay down."
"And if I do stand up, and I'm hit again and I'm never able to rise up at least it will happen while I was fighting."
"At least it will happen while I was on my feet."""
"The Chinese have a saying, and I want to say this to myself to you guys, and to Yemen."

80% of the people fail within the first year.

Announcer:
"Stephen disregarded those discouraging words and when he once again found himself in the vice-president's office, he acted on his intuition."
Stephen:
"I looked at him in the eye and I said, ""Sir, if you don't hire me,"""
"""you'll never know what I can do for this firm."""
Announcer:
"Stephen got the job, but with one final condition."
"Stephen: he said, ""We'll train you for three months, we'll give you a little salary."""
"""At the end of three months, you have to take a 250 question examination."
"If you fail by one point, YOU'RE OUT!"""
Announcer:
"Stephen passed that exam and over the next four years he achieved national recognition,"""
"""earning a six figure salary as his personal sales increased by over 1,700%."""
"But there was something more, a broader goal and purpose for his life which came to him with instant clarity on a vacation trip to the ocean."
Stephen:
"I had to get away for a while, remember I was a stock broker at the time, and I had to get away."
"It was a lot of pressure, I just needed a little bit of sun and a little bit of water, and a little bit of sand."
"I needed a little bit of a tan, too (laughter)."
"So I went away, and there I was on the beach, and it was a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous day."
I was reading a book and then it happened.
Out of the clear blue my eyes flew open.
It was a revelation.
I just knew that my life purpose was to become a speaker and an author.
Announcer:
"Since that decisive moment on that beach, Stephen has shared his inspiring story through the medium of television and radio as an author and has spoken to hundreds of organizations of all ages, all across America and has never looked back, except to remember the people who helped to encourage him along the way."
People like his fifth grade teacher.
Stephen: ...and then Mrs. Jordan made a grand entrance into my life.
She was a larger-than- life woman with salt and pepper hair and eyes that I swore twinkled.
"Have you ever had someone in your life that you wanted to be so much a part of, people who are that powerful?"
But the growth arc is not going to be in power level.
It's going to be in something else.
So that's just one way to look at characters.
It's not the only way.
But it is one way to view your characters.
"Almost every good character... they may move along this but almost every good character is going to start of with a little smidge of this, and a little smidge that."
"And so, I will add under the ""aspire to be,"" which is kind of the same concept, but: they are an expert at something."
In other words they have a superpower.
And their superpower might not be something we normally think of.
A great example of this is going to be Sam from Lord of the Rings.
"He is superhumanly loyal, would you not say?"
He has one attribute.
Everything else about him is basically goofy and befuddled.
The midget in the world of giants.
And yet he has this one super quality that all of us would love to have.
And because of that he consistently polls as people's favorite character from Lord of the Rings.
"In fact there is a lot of discussion that he probably is the hero of the whole story, is Sam."
And that is because Sam has this blend down really well.
"Yes, he's kind of a fool in a lot of ways, but he has this one thing that is defining about him."
"And it's something that, when you look, you say ""yeah, I wish I could be Sam, for that moment."""
"So, an expert at something."
The other one I'll add up here is that they are proactive.
Have we talked about proactivity?
Did I do anything about this?
"I think I talked about it in the first week, or maybe the second."
Keep in mind that you don't need to do all of these.
And there are a few more I'll throw up here.
These are all tools in your toolbox that you can use to increase the level of sympathetic... the sympathetic nature of a given character.
If you can combine them all - great.
"In fact, pretty much everything up here are things that you should try to put in almost every character."
"But it doesn't mean you can't have one that leaves out one of them or two of them, or something like this."
These are the ways that we make people sympathetic.
"Our first speaker is Jack Miller from OlSE,"
"Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, who has been involved for many years teaching holistic education and more recently,  mindfulness in particular."
"But let me just say, more complete  biographies of each our speakers, you will find it in your booklet."
"So, you can read that in your leisure time."
Here are some interesting things about them that are not necessarily  in their biographies.
Jack.
"(Jack Miller) Thank you Richard,  it is an honor to be here."
I believe this retreat  could have tremendous influence on education in North America.
"And I have worked in Ontario  for 40 years and this could also have huge impact  on this province, the education."
"So, thank you for coming."
We were asked to share a little bit  about personal story.
I am a child of the 1960s.
"As a young American, I was facing the dilemma of the Vietnam war."
"The more I read about that war, I felt  it was wrong for America to be involved."
So I had the choice when I was drafted that I went to Canada.
"The stress of that time, was when I began my spiritual practice."
"So, in 1969, I started doing yoga and I could feel the effects immediately."
"So I got interested in the philosophy  behind the yoga, and I started reading on Eastern thought."
"Then in 1974, I started  doing Vipassana meditation."
I have been doing those things since those years.
"When I was doing the meditation, one of the things about the experience of meditation is that you begin to experience interconnectedness which Thay calls interbeing."
You experience it at deeper level  than just intellectually.
So this is what eventually lead me to holistic education.
Because holistic education  is about interconnectedness.
"And unfortunately, our education system is very fragmented."
"We break things into courses, into pieces, into little bits of information."
"This basically causes suffering, this fragmentation."
"So, holistic education is an attempt  to have a curriculum that is connected."
So I wrote a book called The Holistic Curriculum which is about that.
"There is a school in Toronto, it is originally called Whole Child School now called the Equinox Holistic School."
We have some teachers here from that school.
I was delighted to run into Kyle.
"At $60 the value of our option is $10, but we paid $10 for it."
"That's our break even, but then we make money after that."
This is from the perspective of the holder.
This is from the perspective of the holder of the call option.
This is the holder of the call option.
What would it look like if you're the writer of the call option?
If your the person selling the right to buy the stock.
"If this person right over here, if the holder has the right to buy at $50, someone must be selling them that right."
Someone must be agreeing to say hey I will essentially sell that to you at that price.
If you're the writer of the foot ... we have the holder in green.
The holder in green.
What if you're the writer?
You're essentially the counter party on that option.
You're the person agreeing to uphold that option.
"If the option never gets exercised, then the writer doesn't have to loose any money."
"If the option does get exercise, then all of a sudden, the writer starts to loose money."
"If the writer doesn't own the stock, and let's say the stock is at $60, this guy, the holder, can exercise his option to buy at $50."
The writer would then have to go buy the stock on the market for $60 and sell it for $50.
They would loose $10.
The writers payoff would look something like this.
Once again it's the mirror image of the payoff of the holder.
"If you think about the profit of the writer, if the option is never exercised, then the holder gets to keep the $10 that they were paid ... that they sold the right for."
"If the option is exercised, and they start to"
"loose money, and their break even once again is at $60."
"Anything below that, then they start to loose more and more money."
Once again these are the mirror images of each other.
If you were to add up these two line it would be break even.
These parties are the ones who are exchanging money between.
If this guys makes $10 this guys loosing $10 or vice versa.
Dr. Christopher R. Austin:
"Thanks, and it's great to be here."
I just want to make a couple of points.
"Since they couldn't pay me, I had no money to move,"
"I had to always go on foot, sometimes covering large distances."
Then I had two options:
Or I ate ...
Or paying service.
More often than not I ate!
"Therefore, the Ministry is not a choice, but it is something that is interlaced with your destiny and discover gradually that you grow up with God."
You can not escape.
"Then, I dedicated myself, and many more."
"I sweated, I cried, I gave blood for this Ministry."
"I asked for help, several times I've been betrayed, because well ... they are seen as a small anonymous preacher."
And then ...who wants to stand on the side of a poor failed?
"But in the end, you realize that from the evidence there is so much more and you don't stop, I can say that Gap was my life in these 12 years."
"It was what God used to form my character, and if I were to go back, confront all that I faced ...be called a beggar, a dreamer,"
"I'd never done anything, that I was a poor dumb because I was moving away from those ministries that would give me a lot."
I would do it all again.
Without thinking twice.
"Because I was granted the honour and grace to see lives reclamation, preparing Ministers fans who are not afraid of nothing, not even death."
"Then, Gap has been a passionate dedication of my heart."
Q:
Gap doesn't give you any financial support?
A:
No.
Q: are you working now?
"A: look, seeing the need that have the Gap, I always preferred full-time work.For this I've tried so far work .... but Gap does not remunerarmi, and I will soon find a job according to my education."
"The fact is that we always need a hand, this resource is our needs: we need more people possible, capable and with a real call. to help us."
"There are many cases of suicide in universities: people who have a desperate need, and what I need is not being able to do more."
It's always a drama to fail to muster enough people to do more.
"Q: you're invited to preach in other countries, travel a lot?"
A:
I've never traveled in my life.
"I preached a lot in Fortaleza, and I helped in the formation of leaders in these 10 years as a mentor."
It's designed for other people too.
We should think about everyone living in our city.
"We need more things designed for everyone."" Babies, children, young people and old people are living in our city."
Some people are physically challenged.
We sometimes care about only ourselves but we should care about those people too.
"As a person living in this city, I want to make everyone happy."
It's important for us to think about things from other people's points of view.
That's the thing I learned in this class.
Let's work together to have a better life in our city.
Hey guys.
Welcome to another episode of Drive Clean.
"I'm Larry from ammonyc.com, where we're obsessed with driving and protecting cars."
"Now, on today's episode, we're going to be working on a 1958"
Porsche Speedster.
"Now, the paint is totally wrecked, so we're going to restore it."
That's all coming up today on this episode of Drive Clean.
[MUSlC PLAYlNG]
"Before we get started, I want to thank all you guys for the emails and comments I received since the first episode."
"They've been spectacular, and I'm really grateful for them."
"But the cool part is I've actually kept track of everything you suggested, and we're going to try to incorporate them into the upcoming episodes."
"So for today, we're going to restore this 1958 Porsche Speedster."
"Now, I think the problem was they washed it improperly, and nobody took care of it, didn't put a cover on it and left outside, so the paint is totally wrecked."
"Now, the first question you want to ask yourself is whether you want to clean, protect, or restore the paint."
"Now, obviously, in this condition, it's so bad, we're going to need to restore the paint."
"Now, the second question is what year is the car and has it been repainted?"
"Now, this particular car is a 1958, but it's been repainted in modern times."
"So now I know there's clear coat on it, I can approach it differently."
"Now, the third question is a little bit more complicated."
It's deciding whether the paint is hard or soft.
We're going to talk about how to figure that out in the upcoming steps.
"So this episode is going to be a little bit more complicated, because we're really going to geek out."
"So, let's take the extreme case scenario, you are doing a regular job and you know 40 years from now, you are going to retire."
"My point there is, you have more control on that, but sometimes people don't."
People have jobs where they are dependent on their employer on how many years they work?
"But forgiven, I mean you won't go to a financial advisor and say, how many years do I retire?"
"The person will give you an answer but [laugh] , you know, will charge you a lot money for giving the answer, right?"
"So the 40 is also information that you should know, 10,000 is the information you should know and now the eight%."
I'm going to violate the assumption that I said make at the back of your mind.
"But to be fair, I never said assume is not there."
"I said, I know it's there, keep it in the back of your mind, but for convenience's sake, ignore it."
And that is risk.
"So, let me ask you this, who determines the eight%?"
"And if you can answer that, you have arrived."
And the answer is simply nobody.
"If, if anybody knew what the interest rate was in the future for the next 40 years or something, you know, they would, they would be omnipresent."
They would know the future.
We are wanting to be like that.
But I think the beauty of
life is nobody knows.
"And in fact, one of the most profound developments in Finance in recent years, I, I should recent say last 40, 50 years that gets challenged because it's a good idea."
"Bad ideas don't get challenged, right?"
Good ideas get challenged.
"So, the notion there is that nobody in a good market should be able to tell the future because everything we know is already in the marketplace, right?"
That's why I said competitive markets at the beginning are extremely important to what we do.
"So, quick question."
Who determines the eight%?.
And the answer is you.
And this is where I have to bring in risk a little bit.
Why?
"Because eight percent let me tell you, if you get over the next 40 years, may the force be with you."
[laugh].
Because it is not going to be easy.
"You have to take risks to get high rates of return, and with risk comes volatility."
"I'm on the, on the, on the course forums or in whatever social media hangouts you're using."
"And, if you haven't joined a group yet to work with and discuss the questions with,"
I strongly advise you to do that.
The only one I want to look up from
Assignment one is question eight because this one has a little bit of mathematics in it.
It relates to that proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
And you'll recall from a lecture that a key part of that was taking this number N that you get by multiplying the first
little n primes together and adding one.
"And at the time, I actually mentioned that this number is not always prime, well, how do you prove that?"
"Well, you prove it by exhibiting a sequence of prime numbers for which it's not prime."
"So, you start by looking at the primes and you sort of say, well, two x three + one, in that case, you get seven."
Then seven is a prime.
"So, let's go one more, two x three x five + one, you get 31."
That's also a prime.
"Well, let's do another one, two x three x5 x seven + one, that's 211."
That's also a prime.
"Well, at this point, you might beginning to lose heart, but if you keep going just a couple more until you get two x three x five x seven x eleven x thirteen + one, then in that case you get 30,031, which is equal to 59 x 509, which is not prime."
"And so now, we've exhibited a number of this form."
Let me put parenthesis in here.
Just to separate things out.
Oops.
"You don't actually need them, because of the conventions that multiplication dominates over addition."
But let's put them in anyway.
"And in this case you check one, two, three, four, five, the first six primes, add one, you get a composite number."
"That shows that this number is not always prime, okay?"
And that takes care of assignment one.
First we'll deal with the controversial bit.
This car belongs to Ferrari.
And I'm probably not supposed to be driving it.
But I'm not going to dwell on that.
"Someone kind of subcontracted it to me, let's say."
The film begins as a proper horror film with this mysterious ghostly ship coming through the mists.
"And the score cycles through all of it's motifs; there is a suspense score, and there is a mysterious music track."
"And then, The extra-diagetic music goes away and we start to listen to what's on the set of this dock."
And that's where things start to get interesting.
So let's watch and listen to how Robson and Lewton set up sound at the beginning of Ghost Ship.
[music]
It's the beginning of our score.
[music]
And now we hear the harpsichord and the blind man off screen.
What we see are these knives.
So that violent motif is set up right away.
And there's a distance between what we see and what we hear. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [music]
"Me, give me some time to blow the man down. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Good luck. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Thank you, sir."
"Being a sailor, you'll need luck."
"A young sailor, too. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Now so, the blind man cannot see, but he hears very well."
Speaker:[inaudible] &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And he seems to speak the truth.
"He knows that a hero is an officer by the sound of his bag, that will come in a moment."
"And he also knows that this is a bad ship. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; You've got a blind man's tricks for telling what men are like, but ships [inaudible]. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; So, it begins with this foreboding of a man who cannot see but hears, and as our hero walks up the plank listen."
"Blow the Man Down, the song reappears."
Now Blow the Man Down is an interesting song.
It's a song about beating a sailor who's been insubordinate and it's also a song about ships on rough seas.
There's a song of great foreboding and terror.
"And yet it's introduced gently here as though it's just a man singing about a, a quaint song about going out to sea."
"Now, things get even stranger and more interesting when we are introduced to Finn."
So listen to how the music works at this moment.
Speaker:[music]
I'm the third officer.
Where can I find the Captain? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; There's our knife again.
Gestures with the knife.
"Now watch when we cut around, and listen to the music."
[music]
"Hear that as that smoke comes in, we get the mysterium theme."
We discovered it last year at WOWODC.
It's basically telling Oracle to work in the 8I mode.
You lose all your 10G features.
"OK, next one I'll go through pretty quickly."
"Awake from insertion, it's the EO constructor."
If any of you have ever tried to use the actual Java constructer in your enterprise objects you probably quickly discovered that wasn't really a good thing to do.
"If you want to do your initialization in awakeFromlnsertion, it's the place to set defaults for your enterprise objects."
The little known fact that I want to point out today is that it can get called more than once.
"Two cases have been pointed out recently, Java client and nested editing context can result in this getting called more than once."
In order to protect yourself the best practice is to check to make sure a value is null before you set the default.
"If not, then probably something else has been done with that object and you don't want to go back to the default."
- There is also the init method you can override if you're using Wonder which checks whether it's a temporary global ID or not.
If you deleted an object from an editing context and do an undo on the editing context it gets reinserted.
"- Oh, that's another good point, yeah."
- You want to set up the default values there.
Use in it or check whether the global id is a temporary global ID or a non temporary.
"- OK, now a few quick Java ones, exception handling."
Don't do this.
How many times have I seen code...
I thought somebody would like that.
Don't write code like that.
Just don't do it.
"I've seen so many people do that and it's just,"
"""Oh, it will never happen."
"Don't worry about it."""
"Sooner or later, yeah, it does happen."
- What if you expect it and it won't hurt?
- Whatever you want to do in the privacy of your own application is fine with me.
- He's right.
That does occasionally happen.
"For me when that happens I always put a comment in that catch, and explain why I'm doing that."
Because someone is going to come back behind you and wonder... they'll think you're a bad programmer.
"And near the ha nd, the garage is going to be low ends contracted."
"So, the garage is going to be even narrower than it really is."
"So, in the ladder frame we obtain the following picture and the two seem to be in conflict."
"In the picture on the left, the"
ladder is in the garage.
"In the picture on the right, there is no way the ladder could be in the garage cuz the garage is even shorter than its rest length which is as it is shorter than a ladder as we see at the top."
"You can make the puzzle sharper by saying, imagine that at the instant over here on the frame on the left where the ladder is inside the garage, I closed both doors."
What happens then?
Now
I have a ladder in the garage.
"Well, now it's not ambiguous."
The doors are closed.
"So, let's resolve this issue. there is, as always no real paradox."
There's only confusion.
"And the confusion, as I said, is always to do with simultaneity."
"And,"
I'll solve this problem twice.
"The first time, algebraically, using Lorentz"
Transformation.
"And then, I'll demonstrate, graphically how this solution works and along the way, play with space time diagrams, and what we can or cannot read off of them."
But I want to convince you that Lorentz Transformations are useful.
"So, to use Lorentz Transformations, what we do is, we have to be very careful that we're not talking about wishy-washy things, we want to be very specific about what are the things we're talking about."
"And the things we talk about are events, things that happened."
"And they happened a particular place, at a particular time."
"So what are the things we know? in order to use coordinates, I'm going to set up my usual space time diagram if you want, or my coordinates."
I'm going to have the black coordinates presenting the garage because
I'm thinking of the garage as at rest.
And the latter is moving to the right and its coordinates as seen by the garage are t prime and x prime.
I have to pick an origin for each of these.
"So I will pick the left end of the garage, remember the"
ladder is moving to the right.
So the left end of the garage is going to be the origin for coordinates on the garage.
"The good news is, that you'll get feedback immediately from the computer as you're taking them."
"And, and for the assignments, you have the whole week."
"Whereas for the final, I'll let you know how much time you have."
"The real good news however, is because I'm interested in you learning rather than just testing you just once and saying, forget about it."
This guy or gal doesn't know something.
"I'm more interested in what you know, rather than what you don't know."
So I'll give you two attempts at each of one of these.
"Each assignment two attempts, final two attempts."
"But you have to finish within the deadlines, both attempts."
Otherwise you cannot.
The score cannot count.
"We have to have some criteria, right?"
"Now, dealing with me or the teaching assistant and this is one of the things that I think is a little bit of a disadvantag e in the online class."
This class is really large.
I do not want to get into the numbers because I want you to think of this class as just for you and I mean I think that's the beauty of online class.
So it's a
"large class, what can't we do?"
"I would encourage you, please don't attempt to contact me, or my teaching assistant Nathan Brown."
And the reason is you can easily find our emails and shoot an email.
"It's not that, we don't love you."
I love you all.
"There's a heart that beats in each one of you and that's my requirement for loving, you know."
"And in fact even plants have lives, right?"
"So, but in anyway, I'm coming back to the basics."
"I cannot afford to answer emails and Nathan cannot, because it would become unmanageable at our end."
So we encourage you not to try to contact us.
So what will we do?
We'll provide all the resources on a weekly basis.
"They'll come, you'll know what you want, you'll know exactly what, what's needed to be done and the teaching assistant, Nathan, will monitor the class for any errors, and so on, so forth."
But our goal is to make this class self-sufficient.
How?
"There's only one teaching assistant, and only one of me."
So I guess the books get stacked that way.
"And they labeled this right here, this dimension is x."
"And they're saying, will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?"
So essentially I'm going to put the first 10 in there.
"So the first statement they say, is that x is equal to 50 centimeters."
"Well, that doesn't help me because I don't know how big the first 10 volumes of the encyclopedia are."
"If each of them are, at least the first 10 are,"
"less than 5 centimeters each or on average less than 5 centimeters, then maybe I could fit them."
But one by itself doesn't help me.
Two:
12 of the volumes have an average thickness of 5 centimeters.
"Well, that doesn't help me either because remember, they're saying will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia?"
"Maybe the 12 that have an average thickness of 5 centimeters, maybe those are the volumes 8 through 20 and maybe volumes 1 through 7 have an average thickness of 50 centimeters each or 5 million centimeters each."
So even both of these conditions combined don't help me know if I can definitely fit the first 10 volumes of the 20 volume encyclopedia.
So that is E.
Both statements together are still not sufficient.
Problem 39.
A circular tub--
"OK, so they've drawn this circular-looking tub."
So the top looks like that.
And then there's two sides.
Let's me see how well I can construct what they've drawn.
And the bottom looks something like that.
"And then they shade in a little area, a strip of this, like that."
And they say a circular tub has a painted band has a band painted around its circumference as show above.
So this is the painted band around its circumference.
What is the surface area of the painted band?
And they tell us that the height of the painted band is x.
"So in order to essentially know the surface area, you'd have to know the height, which is x, times the circumference of the circle,"
Right? which would be the length.
"So if you knew the height times circumference of the circle, you'd be able to know the surface area."
"So they tell us, the first statement, x is equal to 0.5, whatever, meters."
The suitors are doing all the wrong things when it comes to xenia.
"When they cross this threshold and act so ugly, in such an ugly way to Odysseus."
"Yeah, they're, they're treating a beggar poorly, and they should have treated a beggar better."
But they're also running afoul of this critical code that is built into what it is to be Greek.
You ought to treat strangers well.
"So, it's not just that you're doing something that's a little bit rude to this one person, you're violating a core social custom of what it is to be a Greek."
So these suitors are violating something quite strong here and being quite so rude to Odysseus.
"Also, they are violating a code that is a strong, strongly knitted into the Greek cultural fabric."
But it also comes from Zeus himself.
So they are committing a kind of offense against Zeus by not treating a stranger well.
And this comes out.
Gods arrive and disguised in every way.
We hear again at page 370.
Gods arrive disguised in every way.
That person who you don't who it is could be god.
You should treat them well.
"And if you don't, you are violating even the great authority of Zeus."
"Looking forward to book twenty, one of the suitors comes up and says, you want a guest gift, you beggar?"
"Fine, I'll give you guest gift."
"And takes an ox hoof and he hurls it, hurls it at Odysseus."
Further perversion of the custom of the xenia.
"What you are supposed to do is not take the hoof which can be used as a weapon, but take the meat which is nourishing."
"Give it to somebody who comes to your house, take care of them but they're not doing that."
"As this book, you know, carries forward book seventeen."
We see further Eumaeus develop in his role as messenger.
He brings a message from the stranger to Penelope at 371.
"Then comes back and, and talks to Odysseus and Odysseus asks then Eumaeus to bring a message back to Penelope."
"That message of Penelope, hey, stranger who has just washed into my house."
I'm so far away from my husband.
Maybe you'd like to have a private audience with me?
And invites him to go ahead and come on in and talk to her.
"Already a little bit forward, that maneuver."
That's what I think the drawing implies.
"They say the inside of a rectangular carton is 48 centimeters long, 32 centimeters wide and 15 centimeters high"
OK.
So that's the inside.
Kind of from the other wall.
This is the floor of the inside of the container and then there would be another up here.
But I think you get the idea.
The carton is filled to capacity with k identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright in rows and columns as indicated in the figure above.
OK.
So this is like a top view of it.
"So we could say that this side up here, this is 48 and then this is 32."
"So we don't care so much about the height, I think."
"So, let's see, the carton is filled to capacity with k identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright in rows and columns as indicated in figure above."
If the cans are 15 centimeters high--
"OK, so each of the cans are exactly 15 centimeters high."
So they literally are exactly as high as the carton.
"If the cans are 15 centimeters high, what is the value of k?"
So we have to figure out how many of these cans will fit in this area essentially?
And then they tell us point number one: each of the cans have a radius of 4 centimeters.
Radius is 4 centimeters.
"Well, if we know that each of them have a radius of 4 centimeters then we know exactly how much square area each of these circles will take up, assuming that they're packed exactly like this, right?"
"Because if you think about it, what is this area right here?"
"Well, there's a bunch of were different ways you could think about it."
"The easiest is that if the radius is 4 centimeters, that the diameter right here is 8 centimeters."
"So if this is 8 and you have a 48 length, you can only do 6 of these, right?"
6 times 8 is 48.
So you can only do 6 that way.
"And then if the diameter is 8 this way and this length is 32, you can only do 4 this way."
"So statement number one, alone, is enough to figure out how many you can put."
It would actually be 4 times 6.
"You could put 24, k would be 24 cans that you could fit in."
"So statement one, alone, is enough."
"So, it looks like this."
"The story can be told in multiple ways, but in English we have a phrase, ""What goes around, comes around."""
"On the religious side, there's the golden rule, ""Do onto others..."""
"And the story we heard earlier on the Polish farm, basically internalizing in economic systems, what is otherwise thrown away,"
literally makes certain or ensures that the resources that we have are reinvested in our present and our future.
"You wear, as I do, the same phosphate molecules that were in Socrates, that were in Copernicus, that were in Tyrannosaurus Rex."
"We're breathing the same carbon dioxide, the carbon cycles unrestfully pass through us."
"And we either reinvest the carbon in the landscape, we reinvest the resources, or they are gone."
Here's my sampling 100 points.
I'm going to turn off the light just to highlight this.
I want to highlight some regions here.
"Look I've got some sampling here, notice in here, I don't sample at all."
"Do you think I'm going to be able to get signal in there, because you don't want to go by Shawn's theory."
Shawn said.
"There is no way you have any business making a statement about what's going on in that, right?"
"You got no information there, how are you going to get frequency content when you've not sampled the ups and downs?"
"Oh, look at this region over there!"
"I got a huge stretch, 1.2 and I got all this stuff going on Okay?"
Nyquist would say you're screwed.
You're done.
"Like, why, what are thinking about?"
Like seriously?
Drop math now.
"Compress sensing would say wait a minute, but you told me that this is sparse signal."
Which means I have a constraint on the number of freq uencies that might be active which means.
I might be able to get it.
And I'm going to try to get it that optimizes the fit to what I have with a small number of frequencies that are consistent with the data I have.
"You get it, okay?"
"Actually, in this case you're, you're right at the edge of reconstruction, okay?"
"But still, it's we'll, we'll come back to this."
"It's pretty impressive, still, what you can kind of."
"Get out of this, piece."
"So almost, but not quite, everything I need to do."
Someone want to point out to me what it is I have failed to consider in this situation.
[Inaudible].
It's the what?
[Inaudible].
Yeah. ? trying to make null point to something [inaudible].
Exactly.
So if my queue is totally empty.
So in these cases like
"- one thing you can often think about whenever you see yourself with this error, and you're dereferencing something, you have to considered, well, is there a possibility that that value is null."
And if so I'd better do something to protect against it.
"So in the case of the new cell here, I'm setting aside and not clearing that cell."
"We know it's valid, [inaudible], we've got good memory."
"That part's good but the access to the tail, and that's assuming there is a tail, that there is at least one cell already in the queue that the tail is pointing to."
"When that's not true, this is going to blow up."
It's going to try to dereference it.
So what we can do here is we can just check for that.
We can say if the queue is empty then what we want to do is say that head equals tail equals new cell.
"Otherwise, we've got some existing tail and we just need to attach to it."
"Now, this is what I meant about that often there are little bit of special cases for certain different inputs."
"In particular, the most common ones are an empty list or a single link list being distinguished from a list that has two or more elements."
So sometimes it's all about - a single link list has problems and so does the empty list.
"In this case, it's exactly the empty list."
"Like a single cell is actually fine, you know, one, ten, 6,000 all work equally well."
It's that empty case that we have to work on setting our head and tail to that.
So with this plan we go back to my use of this.
"And stop talking about my stack and change into my queue, end queuing instead of pushing."
[Inaudible].
"Oh, 591 errors."
"Well, that's really - 591, what is that?"
[Inaudible].
"Oh, yeah, this is the year I was going to talk about but I failed to do."
And the answer is no.
"But if you say, is there a way to reduce the two terms to one to a good approximation, the answer is yes."
"And the reason the answer is yes, is because to a good approximation, if you know, if you know R, and if you know this angle in between that angle."
Which we know that angle because we know all the coordinates.
You can estimate R prime with good accuracy.
"If we can find R prime, in terms of R, possibly also using that angle, Then we can reduce this expression from two terms, down to one."
Can you do that?
I'll leave it to you to see if you can figure it out.
So we'll conclude this segment with this nice picture of one of the main quads at
Duke University.
Thank you for watching this problem session.
We'll see you in the next segment.
Good evening friends.
"I am Shinzo Abe, representing the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan."
Hearty congratulations India Center on 10th Anniversary.
I am very impressed with this grand ceremony.
Mr. Vibhav is a good friend for the last ten years.
"I do not know anyone, who has passionately devoted his life to the relationship of India and Japan."
It was from Mr. Vibhav that I learned the greatness of India and the significance of strong friendship between India and Japan.
"Last year, Mr. Vibhav gave me an opportunity to visit India and there I have met many dignitaries."
"Including Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan."
India and China are the top two growing countries in Asia.
I believe that the key to the prosperous future of Japan is by learning from these countries' progress and growth.
"To strengthen relations between two countries, it is important that each countries think earnestly about the other."
This is the first step forward.
Mr. Vibhav is a very passionate man.
"Sometimes we get exhausted, because of his enthusiasm."
But I have realised that it is this passion and enthusiasm that is significantly inevitable.
"I am now in the position of the President of the LDP, and I attach importance to the friendship of India and Japan."
"With common values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and feudal society,"
let's strategically establish and develop the relationship between the two countries.
"My grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was the first Prime Minister to visit India."
"And that was talking about how if you stretch out heart cells, and all of the things within heart cells-- all the proteins-- that it actually changes the force of contraction."
"And actually, force of contraction is very much related to this length-tension relationship as well."
So I'm going to put that up here.
Force of contraction.
"And instead of using that terminology, though, we're going to use the term tension."
"I mean, you can essentially think of them the same way."
"But classically, the word tension is what everyone uses."
So we're going to use that same word.
"And then, as far as length, specifically the length that we're talking about is the length of a sarcomere."
So I'm going to write sarcomere here.
"And the sarcomere, just keep in mind, is really going from one z-disc to another z-disc."
"So to draw this out, to actually write it out maybe, we can start with myosin."
"And so maybe this is our myosin, right here."
And I'll draw some myosin heads here.
"And maybe some myosin heads on this side, as well."
"And, of course, you know it's going to be symmetric looking, roughly symmetric."
So this is our myosin.
"And actually, I'm going to make some copies of it now, just to make sure that I don't have to keep drawing it out for you."
But something like that.
"And we'll move it to be just below so that you can actually see, when I draw a few of them, how they differ from one another."
"So I'm going to put them, as best I can, right below one another."
"And we'll do a total of, let's say, five."
"And I think, by the time we get to the fifth one, you'll get an idea of what this overall graph will look like."
So these are our five myosins.
"And to start out at the top, I'm going to show a very crowded situation."
So this will be what happens when really nothing is spread out.
"It's very, very crowded."
"And you recall that you have actin, this box, or this half box that I'm drawing, is our actin."
"And then you have two of them, right?"
"And they have their own polarity, we said."
And they kind of go like that.
"And so, in this first scenario, this very, very first one that I'm drawing, this is our scenario one."
The Zande have dozens of names for illnesses and they also have hundreds of medicinal plants that they use to cure those illnesses.
"But when the treatment doesn't work, if the illness gets worse, they pay less attention to the medicine, and they turn their attention to the witch that is behind the person getting sick in the first place."
"For example, stubbing your toe is not extraordinary."
So if you stub your toe usually gets better after a few days.
"But if it doesn't get better, if it gets infected, if it turns into gangrene, that's witchcraft."
Or lots of people catch the flu.
And you get over the flu in a few days.
"If you don't get over the flu and it gets serious, and you catch pneumonia, that's witchcraft."
"So if the Zande can't control the illness through medicines, they turn to something they can control: social relations."
And I have a couple of stories that I'll show you how that works.
Medicines-- or caught not that one.
Here's a picture of Lucy and her son Benjamin.
Benjamin was just a few weeks old when I arrived.
And he had conjunctivitis in one eye.
And I always carry small bits of medicines with me when I travel.
So I had antibiotics and I treated him every morning; every evening.
I put a drop in his eye.
It got better.
"Lucy wasn't really concerned because it's very common for babies to get conjunctivitis, and it usually clears up, and it did."
But then the conjunctivitis came back in the other eye.
And so now she was getting a little worried.
I then treated the baby every morning; every evening for five days and the eye cleared up.
"So, Lucy was kind of wondering what was happening, but she was okay because it-- then it cleared up."
But then it came back again in the first I.
"And this was really a sign that something was going on, and that there was probably witchcraft involved."
"Now, babies are not usually victims of witchcraft because they really can't offend people."
And he was never really in danger of dying or anything.
"So Lucy interpreted his eye-- is conjunctivitis as a sign that someone was upset with her, and she knew who it was."
So now I want you all to think like a Zande.
Who could possibly be mad at Lucy and her baby?

Pardon?
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.
It's all about sensuality.
It's all about transforming.
"Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen."
This is happening by itself.
It transforms through the magic of lighting.
It's all about sensuality.
It's all about touch.
"Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco, up on the Upper West Side, with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that."
Let's see it one more time.
"Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it."
"And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before."
It's about bringing nature to the inside.
"In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --"
I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.
It's about stimulation.
This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.
"Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall."
"And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,"
look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.
And I think I'll probably leave it at that.
Thank you very much.

"To set your grasslin timer, turn the dial on the front until the dial pointing to the correct time"
Slide the tabs to the outside for the period you want the timer to be on and ensure the remainder of the tabs are all pushed towards the middle.
In this example the timer will be on between midday and 6pm and off for the rest of the time.
"There is also a sliding switch on the timer, when at the bottom the timer is always off and when in the middle."
It is governed by the tabs around the dial
When this is at the top the timer is constantly on
The Power of Thought.
A person's thoughts are basically a processing of information and situations before him and we all have ideas and thoughts in our mind
"If you did capture them, which we did occasionally, you could use it until it runs out."
"But without a code sheet, you would have to break the code."
And you would have to do that with mathematics.
-What was the key?
What was wrong with Enigma?
What was its weakness?
DR. JAMES GRlME:
Let's have a look at what the flaw is in the Enigma machine.
"So the Germans thought it was unbreakable, but there is a flaw."
If I press a letter K--
"For this quiz, your goal is to define a procedure."
We'll call it abbaize.
"This is very useful if you need to come up with names, and what it does is take 2 strings as its inputs and outputs a string that is the first input, followed by 2 repetitions of the second input, followed by the first input."
"As an example, if we called abbaize, passing in the string 'a' and the string 'b'-- single character strings-- what we should get as a result is the string 'abba'."
"If we called abbaize, passing in the string 'dog' and the string 'cat', what we should get is the string 'dogcatcatdog', and there aren't any spaces between the strings."
They're just all pasted together.
"Ermira, you have led the session many times, what would you say about it?"
This is the last chance you have as a trainer to do teaching practice actually.
"And it's your last chance to make sure that all the participants have understood correctly the importance that children should have to make this working groups alone or in pairs or working as a group of five or more, depending on the number of children they have."
"But in the same time, it's the last chance for them as well, for the participants, to make sure that they can prove to themselves that they can do it and can demonstrate they can use this techniques."
Then let's plan together.
Do you agree to plan together to see what kind of supplies we can make for work?
The following incident is a reenactment.
Professional actors will depict different characters in each episode.
"(BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP)"
"ME, ME, ME"
It's my day off.
I can't reach it.
Ugh.
(And there was another drive-by shooting today...)
"Blah, blah, blah!"
Get to the weather already.
Martin:
"Yes, it's also one of the things we are allowed to tell you people, that you may well start thinking about everything as in movement because everything is basically motion and the more one goes into the movement, the easier life you get it is no more than a few years ago it dawned on me that our beloved Greeks didnt have a word for music"
"What is called ""musica"" is a blend of all the musical expression, so"
"If one started playing, there was of course one that began to dance, another who sang and everyone attended there was no real audience until far into antiquity"
"I think we could learn something from that, and it's also what you say that the movement becomes a part of it"
"I'm sorry to say so but if you want to continue the illusion as a earthling please do, but I would love to help you so if I may, in the other dimensions, you let me know in any case, I think we should all lean at Ole Fogh Kirkeby's wise words"
"A true philosopher, I hope it plants seeds out there in small ponds"
"And so I thank you for your participation, Kirkeby's one of the good guys in philosophy master's in human and Dr. Phil of management philosophy at Copenhagen business school. and director of the ""Centre for Art and management""."
Did I say that the right way?
Ole:
Yes
That is very much in one person
Thank you for joining and send me a letter at:
"Martin@tvfraenandenplanet.dk and if you sit at home and think ""wish it was me who was alien"" then you may very well be"

His terrible death weenie.
No response BTW from the league yet.

"Too-sly-for-you writes ""hey, genius!"""
"So we went back to these specimens and we started digging around, and particularly, we looked into the teeth of skulls, hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers, and we found much better quality DNA."
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes.
It's there.
So we got it.
OK.
What could we do with this stuff?
"Well, George Church, in his book, ""Regenesis,"" has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA."
"We would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form, and then, much like we've done with the Lazarus Project, get that stuff into an egg of a host species."
It has to be a different species.
What could it be?
Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?
"They're related, distantly, to thylacines."
And then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end.
"Critics of this project say, hang on."
"Thylacine, Tasmanian devil?"
That's going to hurt.
"No, it's not."
These are marsupials.
They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean.
That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.
"It is, shortly, going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world, so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going."
Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time.
"And it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet, but it's the kind of thing we want to think about."
"They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome, but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue-green in the mouse baby."
"In other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA, it would be able to be recognized."
"When the baby popped up, it was filled with blue-green tissues."
"And that tells us if we can get that genome back together, get it into a live cell, it's going to produce thylacine stuff."
Is this a risk?
You've taken the bits of one animal and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal.
Are we going to get a Frankenstein?
Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?
And the answer is no.
"When I was studying in London, I took part in Malaysian and Singapore student organizations, and I dare say a couple of them were pretty radical."
"I thought they wanted to know my activities in London, for which I was mentally prepared."
"However, I began to feel disoriented after their repeated questions."
They kept wanting to know what instructions Tan Wah Piao had given me and what he had told me to do before I left London for home.
I was puzzled to say the least.
I knew not their target was Tan Wah Piow.
I did not know that there were so many people who had been hauled up.
Let me share with you this anecdote.
"I remember in the first few days of detention, our breakfast consisted of a boiled egg, two pieces of bread and a glass of tea with milk."
Almost the same everyday.
It could be the second day when I was one of the first to be served with breakfast.
I was jolted when I saw there were more than a dozen eggs in the bag the Gurkha adjutant was carrying.
I was stunned.
"Prior to this, I knew that one of my friends had also been taken in."
But I never thought there were so many people involved.
One of the detainees asked to see her lawyer.
The cold reply she got was:
"""Your lawyer has also been invited to ""have tea"" with us."""
"It shows how unprepared we were mentally, really!"
"It was strange that when I came to know they were spinning the yarn of a ""Marxist Conspiracy"","
I kind of sighed a heave of relief.
I surmised it must be another of those stories in Arabian Nights.
That same old story!
Why the ISD bigwigs decided to pick Tan Wah Piao as the vortex to get all of us sucked in.
I have yet to find a satisfactory answer!
I told one of the senior officers in ISD that I didn't know many of those arrested.
The answer given was:
"In a conspiracy, you needn't know all of the members involved!"
We may giggle at the reply given.
"But the stark reality is that the 1987 incident did act as a dreadful deterrent to more than a generation of Singaporeans, particularly the youth."
"For over 20 years, people were so wary of politics that they exercised all-round self-censorship."
"Even now, people still recall events in those years with considerable trepidation."
The letting go one is the hardest one for people to understand because they don't know what they're supposed to let go off.
"It's not letting go of the grief, it's letting go of the person that doesn't want the grief."
It's letting go of the controlling.
"Because sometimes when people have grief, disappointment, broken heart, anger, fear, when we try and do letting go we think letting go means destroying those emotions."
That's disrespect to those emotions.
"Instead, we let go of that person inside who's trying to do something about this, the controller, the one who says ""I don't want these emotions, I have to get rid of them""."
That's the thing we have to let go of.
The control-freak.
"So if you have those emotions inside of you and you try to suppress them, get rid of them, destroy them, of course what happens - they get worse."
"If you're fed up and you say ""I shouldn't be fed up"", that's what we call being fed up about being fed up."
[laughter].
We have something called suffering - the word for suffering in Buddhism is dukkha.
We call such things double-dukkha.
It's like I'm angry
"- ""I shouldn't be angry!"
"I'm a monk!""."
You're getting angry at being angry.
"You're depressed, and I'm fed up with being.., I don't want to be depressed anymore!"
You're being depressed about being depressed!
Or you're afraid of fear.
Those are called double-dukkha.
Double-suffering.
And of course from double-suffering we go into the next stage of treble-suffering.
[laughter].
I'm angry about being angry about being angry.
I'm so sad about being sad about being grieving.
Now this is actually what people do.
"They actually build it up by their reactions of trying to get rid of things, controlling things."
"The first part of the Buddhist reaction, the wise reaction, is just accept this is your reality."
"Let it go, let it be if you like."
"So stop messing around with these emotions in this moment, stop adding negativity to the emotions you're experiencing right now."
"If someone is grieving for the loss of a child, or they're disappointed because a relationship they cherished is no longer viable, or if they're afraid - be honest to that fear."
But you still can have a circle of 35.
The circle comes from indigenous people's.
It is a long tradition and this is the most healing way that we can actually be together.
"I am a strong believer  in the circle but also using other variety in things like tribes which is a way to do small groups, and there are kinds of support  mechanisms for that."
Those are just a few little things that I would say.
"-(Man) That last one you said, a tribe?"
"- (J. Miller) Tribes, yes."
Jeanne Gibbs has written a book called 'Tribes'.
Many of our teachers in Ontario  and Toronto are using it.
It is a powerful technique for dealing with large groups and breaking things down.
It gives a guideline to how small groups can work.
Because you can't just put students in small groups and then give them a framework.
(J. Bell) I would like to offer another idea.
Sometimes I've seen teachers  scratch their heads.
What should we do about this issue  when the answers are among students?
"I think if we change our model from thinking we have to control and set it up to saying, ""We are building  a community together."""
"This takes a lot of time up front, setting the rules together, making contracts, agreements for each other, how do we want to treat each other, to talk with each other."
Establish all those things.
"What if somebody doesn't talk like that,  what should happen?"
"We should bring that up, how should  we handle 'the discipline' issues."
"If you create a collective experience, they are getting that sense of ownership, of democratic decision making, a being mindful of how their behavior is part of the mix."
It is much more and you have much less behavior problems if you have 35 students helping  to create the classroom culture.
There are lots of other things.
The use of constant appreciations and shout-outs.
What I noticed Tommy doing well the other day.
"Jose, how did he do well as a leader."
Keep building it a constant thing so they are inoculated with a sense of loving speech and respect and cooperation in the classroom.
It doesn't eliminate every problem  but it goes a long ways.

"[yelling, indistinct]"
Everyone has something at their core that they're really upset about.
And here at least it seems that it's all molding together to be like a structural change.
That's what people have been working on.
That's what the general assemblies are here.
"That's why the working groups are forming, so that people can go into a specific corner like sanitation or environmental, or whatever, and start forming their own demands."
Right now we're just practicing first aid on people.
"You know, some people are hurting their feet, or, you know, hurting their ankles, we give out ice packs and stuff, but that's really all we're allowed to do."
"And if we feel someone needs to go the the hospital, we'll call for them and send them there."
"These medical supplies came from all over the country, people donated them."
We got a big shipment in on Tuesday.
"You know, they really sent a lot of stuff, which was, like, heartwarming."
This is the comfort station.
"Essentially we provide warm, dry cloththing, tents, blankets, we have men's socks, women's socks, men's shirts, women's shirts, men's pants, women's pants, umbrellas, tarp, everything to keep everyone comfortable while they're camping out here."
"Makes no sense that one percent of the population owns sixty percent of the wealth,"
"It makes no sense that people are trying to live the American dream and they go to college, and kids are knee-deep in debt, and they can't find jobs, so that's why I'm here."
We're basically feeding everyone.
"God was throwing thunderbolts down like Zeus in the cartoons, but churches, they built churches on hills as shining beacons."
"And, as such, they attracted lightning bolts."
"And when these churches were hit by lightning, it often destroyed them, and a lot of bellringers got killed from that lighning."
"And the clergy, who were doing their best to suck up to god were at a loss to explain how this was going on."
What was happening here?
Why did god dislike them so much?
"So, based on his understanding of electricity, Ben Franklin, who was a deist, solved the problem with his lightning rod, and his lightning redirection system in 1749."
"And, today, all churches, lo and behold, have lightning rods."
"Yet, they claim god is still protecting them."
I find that amusing.
What about rainbows?
"Well, in Genesis 9:11, we have god talking to Noah."
This is right after the flood.
"And god says, 'And I will my covenant with you."
Neither shall flesh be cut anymore by the waters of the flood.
"Neither shall there be flood to destroy the earth.' And god said,"
"'This is a token of my covenant, which I make between me and you and every"
living creature that is with you for perpetual generations.
"I do set my bow on the cloud, and it shall be forever a token of the covenant between me and the earth.'"
"So, according to the bible, rainbows are a remembrance of god's promise not to kill everything on the planet again."
-Promise not to kill again with a flood.
He can kill it again in other ways.
- Okay.
"And you can contrast this rather silly kindof creepy story with the Feynman lectures on physics, where Richard Feynman explained how and why rainbows appear the way they do."
"And he worked out the angles and the diffraction of the light and all this good stuff, and there's no psychopathic connotations and there's a lot of beauty."
And that's what science has done instead.
"So, materials science."
"So, say you're god and you wanted to communicate a message to humanity."
"And if you wanted to write something on a slate or a tablet, and you wanted it to last for centuries, you might use sapphire-coated titanium."
That might be a good choice for a writing surface to send a message.
-I'm down with that.
"The thing is I'm pretty sure if I'm a god, and"
This discotheque owner is also DJ in order to save money.
The only cost for music is the two percent to composer and lyricist.
A cost of no more than SEK 200 a night.
A popular orchestra would cost tenfold.
-Most of them refuse to play disco music.
The play socially critical music you can't dance to.
They are welcome to play that but then they can expect to be unemployed.
-We've tried the last two or three years to play seventy percent disco music but it is apparently not enough.
-The new technology is here to stay.
"It has many advantages in terms of stimulating the music scene, interest in music and so on -"
- but it can't serve as an alternative to a job outcompeting the live music.
"Beer to thirsty disco dancers, but now the Musician's union want to retract liquor licenses to dance halls who don't play live music."
-I refuse to play music my guests at large does not want to deal with and then some bastard blackmail me and take away my rights.
It is the part of Swedish society today that I must strongly protest against.
Also amusement parks begins to stop using dance bands.
This weekend saw the premiere of the dance to video discotheques and the Musicians' union advice all artists to not participate in these kinds of video recordings.
No aunty I can't do it
What is it that you're worried about and can't do? you will go on stage and sing the songs that you know say couple sentences and you will be done she's right we will do what we usually do in weddings
No..
I can't do it

Mini-Mobile Concerts project entails musicians who play on the streets
"We play not in a cafe or a certain space but on a street corner, next to a bus station, a train station..."
"The musicians in Egypt, or in Alexandria, are very talented and people would like to listen to them"
"However, the market does not give them the opportunity, people do not have access to them"
At the end there is a miss-communication happening
"What is happening on our streets is that they are full of noise full of headache, and full of harmful sights this makes us all agitated and impatient with each other we get angry at each other too we think we need music on the streets good music that can really reach our hearts to calm us"
"The project's idea began in 2011, and the first concert was hosted in April 2012"
"And we had 15 concerts during three months and we started again since January 2013 and the first concert was at the end of March and here we are now, and we plan to host 50 concerts"
"Independent musicians, or the musicians presenting an art that is not necessarily targeted but is unique and original to be known more because people like them and the idea is not that people don't like them but it is that people do not know this art exists we made a website www.eventsrun.com so that when people on the streets like this music they have a way to reach those musicians again because they don't know where these concerts take place or when they are hosted the idea from this website is to present the different events happening in each city so you can go on the site and see what is happening in Cairo on any giving day as an example and you can know the different spaces that have music so you can attend something similar to what you saw on the streets"
Hi guys!
Hi everyone!
I'm Jana
I'm Ju!
Jana:
So the time has come for us to talk about our favorites of the month!
August!
One last thing about prerequisites.
Algebra and Statistics are other formal subject matters that we need and I think even this for everything.
"With so much data available on anything under the sun, knowing Algebra and Statistics is very important, and I hope my treatment of the s ubject matter will motivate you to learn a lot more."
Rather than seeing it as a hurdle to understanding things.
So these are the formal things you could think about.
But don't worry about it.
"As I said, if you have curiousity and a bad attitude."
"And a bad attitude is one which says, you know, give me anything."
"I'll, I'll handle it."
"If you have that attitude, you will do very well in this class, and you'll learn a ton."
"Not just in this class, in life."
"And so, bring that attitude, and we'll be fine."
"Now, I'll talk about something that's very important and it's called Pedagogy."
How do I conduct the class?
"This class, because of the value of Finance being both theory, framework, and practical, is all driven by problem solving."
"I will always force you to do problems, because that's how you learn."
What does that mean?
Everything I introduce in class will not be preceded by a formula.
"Finance is a lot of Algebra, a"
lot of formulas but I will always tell you why we are doing something not what it's all about.
"Why is far more important in life than the what, the what you can"
Google right?
"So if you can Google and get what I'm providing you in the class, I'm not providing you much."
"So because Finance is applied, we'll emphasize problem solving, and everything will be introduced with an example."
"However, I want you to recognize that you have to do most of the work."
"I'm a coach, you have to do the work."
"I hope I'm a good coach and I motivate you and give you the main issues you need to worry about, right?"
"In life, there are not that many issues, four or five."
One is love.
"The rest is, kinda follows a little bit."
Number two is financing my book.
"But anyway, so you'll be doing assignments every week and I encourage you whether they're called quizzes or not, quizzes or assignment, do them."
And we did find a lot of stuff.
"We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex."
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
"It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex."
"And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16."
"We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet."
But this one died at the age of 16.
"We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone."
"Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant."
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But Mary went further.
"She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid."
"Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left."
But there was something left.
There were blood vessels left.
"There were flexible, clear blood vessels."
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
It was extraordinary.
"But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones."
"And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins."
"But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground."
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
"And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples."
And we did.
We got better material.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
"I mean, it was wonderful stuff."
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
"So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast."
"We're just not going to be able to do what they did in ""Jurassic Park."""
"At this time though, the end results are dark in the viewport."
"Unlike Mental Mill, 3ds Max does not have a ""Brightness"" shader."
"Instead, you use the Gamma/Gain shader from the mental ray maps rollout."
You need to insert that node by dragging &amp;amp; dropping it on the connection  between the Phong illumination Node and the Map to Conversion node.
You can then adjust the Gamma/Gain parameters to suit your liking.
"If you wish, create a similar shader tree for the eyes,  using the supplied bitmaps."
"As you can see, building metaSL shader trees in 3ds Max  is a simple process."
It is not as elaborate as Mental Mill but does provide you  with the basic tools to build simple shader trees.
"If you are interested in Mental Mill, you can view the How-To movie  entitled:"
How to Use Mental Mill.
I do want to test this question we're all interested in:
Does extinction have to be forever?
I'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about.
One is the Thylacine Project.
"The other one is the Lazarus Project, and that's focused on the gastric-brooding frog."
"And it would be a fair question to ask, why have we focused on these two animals?"
"Well, point number one, each of them represents a unique family of its own."
We've lost a whole family.
That's a big chunk of the global genome gone.
I'd like it back.
The second reason is that we killed these things.
"In the case of the thylacine, regrettably, we shot every one that we saw."
We slaughtered them.
"In the case of the gastric-brooding frog, we may have ""fungicided"" it to death."
"There's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world that's called the chytrid fungus, and it's nailing frogs all over the world."
"We think that's probably what got this frog, and humans are spreading this fungus."
"And this introduces a very important ethical point, and I think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up."
"What I think is important is that, if it's clear that we exterminated these species, then I think we not only have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it, but I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something, if we can."
OK.
Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project.
It's a frog.
"And you think, frog."
See you!
Jana:
Byeeee!
Ju:
Omg!
"This voice, guys!"
Ju:
Sent from heaven to earth.
Jana:
It's going to be freaking noisy on the video!
"Great, Dan Garcia couldn't make it today, so I'm here to replace him."
I am
"[INAUDlBLE] here at Berkeley I go by Rabbit and I'm one of the TA's, and today's lecture is about concurrency. today's news of the day is friendship paradox."
"Two weeks ago, a research project came to us, that they surveyed Facebook users."
It's pretty cool.
"And they found one, along other things."
"One of the things they found is that on average, your friends are more popular than you."
"This is weird, but on average, the average Facebook user has 250 Facebook friends, while their friends on average have 350."
Pretty interesting.
"What happens is this is actually a paradox that happens in real life everywhere and they are like gatekeepers that are, know a lot of people, and a lot of people know them, and they are very common, and chances are that you're friends with them and that would bring up the average rather than knowing the other people that know random people. other than that, personally, I'd like to tell you to double-check your Facebook privacy settings."
Your Facebook privacy settings have been changed and they changed about once a month and they changed it for you.
"So, double-check it."
Awesome.
"So, this is going to be hard."
Okay.
"So, today, we're talking with parallelism and there are two main types of parallelism, intra-computer and inter-computer."
"Intra is inside one computer and this is the idea of having multiple course, multiple CU, CPUs inside one computer, and then, they work together to solve one common problem. this happens in most computers nowadays, anything you buy has [INAUDlBLE] of course. inter-computer is bigger."
"It's the warehouse scale computers where you have thousands, hundreds of thousands of computers working together to solve a common problem."
"This is called distributed computing and there are two main types, grid and cluster computing."
"Grid computer, grid computing is the idea that you just took lots of computing, of computers and put them together."
"And, now you use them as one big computer and very strong one."
"This is useful, but it's not as uniform."
And are you any more intelligent than a small little novice.
Why is it that these emotions they catch us.
And why is it?
"Because we don't see them coming, we encourage them too much."
"Every time we think negatively,"
"""oh, the ghost is going to come to us"" or we think negatively ""I'm going to lose my job"" or we think negatively ""I'm going to get that cancer."
I'm going to get it.
I know
I'm going to get it.
"Now I'm fine but I am."""
"When you think negatively like that you're building up the emotions, the emotions you get are built up by many many moments of unskillful attitudes and thoughts."
But now we have them.
So once you know where they come from you know they're actually created.
"At least if you know that you create them, you actually bring them together, even like grief.."
Why do you have to have grief when somebody dies?
Why can't we just celebrate that fact that we've known these people for such a long time.
What a wonderful time we had together.
Now we just let them go.
"You never cry for the person who's died, you always cry for yourself."
At your loss - nothing to do with them..
So when we understand that we can do something about these things it gives us a possibility to actually to transcend those negative emotions.
"Because when you think about it, reflect upon it, what good does grief do?"
It doesn't help the person who's dead.
It doesn't help yourself.
It's not what the dead person really wants from you - they don't want you to be unhappy and to cry all those hours and days.
"If someone really loved you and you loved them, they want you to be happy, to live your life in as much fullness and joy as you possibly can."
If you really revere their memory surely that's what you should do.
Not to grieve for them but to be happy for them.
"For you to be happy, for them."
"So when we can change our attitudes that way, when we can actually do something about our grief, or like our anger - what good does anger do?"
"Every time you get angry at your partner they don't do what you want them to do, they don't get better - they usually get worse!"
So why get angry and shout at them for?
"Now, what I want to think about is how these characters will change their state due to their incentives."
Then we'll talk a little bit about Nash Equilibrium as well.
"On this axis, up here, lets' say this is one of the competitors."
"This is where they produce 25, and let's say on the ultimate cheating quantity of 75, and this is somewhat close to the market, or that is the equilibrium quantity if this was perfect competition, they produce half of that, so this is them producing 37.5 units."
"As we go from 25 to 37.5 units, they are cheating more."
"This is more cheating and over here, this was no cheating."
We can do the same thing for the blue player.
I'll write them as B. This is them producing 25.
This is them producing 37.5.
"As we go up and up and up, they are cheating more."
"This is a lot of cheating, or more cheating."
"To think of it in a Game theoretical way, this is the Pareto optimal state right over here."
It's optimal in many ways.
This is they've maximized the total economic profit here.
There's no other state that one person would benefit without making the other worse.
"Now, let's think about whether this is a Nash equilibrium."
Let's remind oursleves what Nash equilibrium was.
"This was a state where holding all the other players constant, so in this case there's only one other player, a player can't gain by changing strategy."
"In this case, changing strategy is changing your output."
Let's see if that is true of this state right over here.
"Well, let's hold A constant."
"If A is constant, we're in this column right over here."
"Is there something B can do, is there change or strategy B can do, that would allow B to gain?"
Sure.
B can increase production.
That's what we saw in the last video.
We would go from this bottom right state to one right above it.
"Now B's economic profit is 280, A's is 200."
"The pie has shrunk, but B has got a larger chunk of it."
That was not a Nash equilibrium.
"There is, holding all others constant, there is a player that can gain by changing their strategy."
"The Nash equilibrium definition, just to make sure, they say it's a state where holding others constant no player can gain by changing strategy."
You mean they couldn't go through a normal 45-minute class...
"Yes, because they easily got tired."
Did those health problems in children sometimes lead the families to leave the area?
"Yes, the educated class was the first to escape."
"The families that remained were either farmers, families with disabled members, or families with many children."
"In other words, families who couldn't sustain themselves in other places."
You've also been to Fukushima and measured radiation level there.
So you've seen both:
Chernobyl and Fukushima.
What do you think when you compare the two?
Radiation level in Fukushima is way too high.
It's crazy...
That's what everyone involved in Chernobyl is saying.
"So-called ""hot spots"" in Kanto region is like the radiation level in Belarus."
"In Chernobyl, people are not allowed to live in the area with more than 1 microsievert [per hour]."
"April 23, 1994 Belarus No-Entry Zone (30km from the plant) 0.232 microsievert"
"On the other hand, many people are allowed to live in such dangerous areas as Fukushima City, Koriyama City, Nihonmatsu City, and Date City in Fukushima Prefecture."
"June 11, 2011 Fukushima Municipal Moriai Elementary School (school yard) 1.383 microsievert"
I can't believe it.
I don't WANT to believe it.
I can't understand that people are treated in such an inhumane way in my own country.
"But sadly that's how it is, and the provisional radiation exposure limit of 20 millisievert/yr for school yards hasn't been retracted yet."
"Well, they say they'll make efforts to lower the actual exposure level to as close to 1 millisievert as possible, but the regulation itself hasn't been retracted."
"And children are still playing cheerfully in cities with very high radiation, such as Fukushima City, Koriyama City, and Nihonmatsu City."
"Based on your experience with the Chernobyl children, what do you think should be done now?"
Children must be evacuated immediately.
"Adults might not be able to get out due to financial reasons, but that has nothing to do with children."
"Evacuate them in units of classes, for example."
At least for a month.
"Or, considering the level of radiation there, they shouldn't return for a while."
Otherwise they would have to face really serious consequences.
The government of Belarus eventually took the responsibility to establish programs to separate children from radiation.
"""Driven to the last necessity, and obliged to have recourse to arms in defense of our lives and"
"liberties."""
"So they're saying, 'We're not rebels who are out to rebel against the King."
"We're actually--We've been driven to this by what's going on in Massachusetts and we're protecting ourselves, but this is a defensive act and not an aggressive act.'"
"And then when you read a little further on in the statement, after all of this sort of noble, lofty sentiment, they then promise each other they're not going to get drunk or gamble or swear."
[laughs]
It's down to practicalities.
"Now that we've declared our purpose to the world, no heavy drinking."
Okay.
"The next day, April 22,1775, classes at Yale were suspended and a lot of students went home."
"Some, a few, actually, went off to fight."
So you can kind of see the way that the wind is blowing in New
Haven.
"You can imagine, given these sorts of events potentially how much fun it would have been to be a college student with Loyalist leanings at this particular moment."
It would not have been very fun--and sure enough in 1775 there was that student.
I discovered that student this morning.
"There was a--I don't know if he's the only one, but he's the guy who got in trouble."
There was one college student here at Yale who was a declared
"Loyalist, 1775."
He did not make other Yale students very happy.
He must have been loud about being a Loyalist.
"Otherwise don't know how it would have been so obvious to everyone that he was a Loyalist, but the--a large chunk of the"
Yale student body decided to have a meeting to debate what should be done about this student.
Okay.
"Obviously, things are not going to go well for the student."
'What should we do about this student?'
"They decide that they are going to formally denounce him as-- publicly, as, quote, ""an enemy to his country""-- and that no one will be allowed to socialize with this student ever again."
Okay.
They've just ostracized this--Can you imagine?
Sorry.
'You've just been entirely ostracized from every other person at Yale University [laughs] because we don't like your politics.'
"So when I first found this this morning, I was like: oh, poor guy, and I couldn't figure out what happened next and I just felt sorry for him."
There's that blank  space full of tears
Give me love That's enough
I try to write the letters  hundreds of times
But at the end  I rip it apart
Why is love  so heavy for me
I cry all day  Until the day breaks
I don't know if that  sun is the moon
I don't know if  it's night or day
"I cry all day the day breaks  Day breaks, day breaks"
"I cry all day the day breaks  Day breaks, day breaks"
Give me love That's enough
...but it's actually Michigan where this is maybe the most stark and the most amazing.
"In Michigan, the new Republican governor is a man named Rick Snyder."
"Rick Snyder does not get a lot of national attention, but boy howdy he ought to."
"What Governor Snyder is doing, I think, tells you, in particular, how clueless the beltway press has been about what is actually happening in the states right now, in Republican politics."
"If you listen to the beltway press, even those who are willing to be critical of the Republicans, they say things like, ""Well real fiscal conservatives would consider raising taxes, as well as cutting spending, to address their state's budget shortfalls""."
That is actually happening in some of these places.
Look what they are trying to do in Michigan.
Rick Snyder has proposed an actual tax increase.
"Michigan has a budget problem, so he's gonna do the,[bell dings] responsible thing. right?"
He's going to raise taxes.
"He's gonna raise taxes on - seniors, and on poor people."
"1.7 billion dollars in tax hikes for Michigan seniors, and Michigan's poor people, and for people who want to make a tax deductible donation to public universities."
"Sorry, you know, Michigan has a budget problem."
We're gonna hafta raise a whole lotta money from you -
"- poor people, old people, people supporting public schooling - you have to take the hit because the state needs to save that money."
Is the state saving that money?
"No, the state is not."
"Governor Snyder is taking all of that money that the state will gain, and he is not using to close the budget gap."
He is giving it away - in the form of 1.8 billion dollars in corporate tax cuts.
"He's taking in 1.7 billion dollars in higher taxes from poor people and old people, and giving it away."
1.8 billion dollars to businesses.
"We used to have this beautiful, little bird: the mountain plover; also gone."
"This is sobering information, so what can we do?"
We can choose a better future.
"Let's apply the empathy that we have for our cats, dogs, and other pets to endangered species like this chimpanzee, but all endangered species."
Let's have fewer children; that's one of the most powerful-- (Applause)
- Thank you! - (Applause)
- I didn't expect that response. -
"That's one of the most powerful things that we can do in the United States; if we want to have kids, great; let's have two."
"If want to have more than two kids, let's adopt."
What else can we do?
"Well, we won't go there."
"So, what else can we do?"
We can help educate girls and provide economic opportunity to women in developing countries.
(Applause)
Amen!
"When we do that, those ladies choose to have to have smaller families, and we have more nutrition, more health care, more education for their kids, and the impact on the global population is huge."
"Finally, what we can do is we can give more to our planet."
"We can give half of our donations, let's say, to people and people-related causes, and half of our donations to the planet, to ocean conservation, to wildlife conservation."
"I want to mention, by the way, that today, we only give about 2 to 5% of all giving that goes to environment and wildlife as a category."
"You've been very patient with sometimes, a difficult topic;"
"I just want to say that the thing to think about is do we change, as a species, what do we do, so that our fellow living beings who happen not to be human can thrive alongside of us a 100, 500, and 1,000 years from now."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
"-- Hi, Jonathan!"
"Can you tell us who you are, please?"
"-- So I am the CTO at Normation, a company I founded in Paris, France, back in 2009."
I've basically a sysadmin background.
I've been using CFEngine since 2009 when the version 3 came out.
-- And can you tell us what is the role of Normation in CFEngine?
-- Normation is specialized in configuration management automation in general. we've actually been leading CFEngine training sessions across the world since 2011.
I think that to this state we've trained more than 150 people in CFEngine
I think the first session was in Paris for obvious reasons -- because we're based there.
But I'm going to look at the hook scene now because it's a fabulous example of how sound and image can create a monster where there's no monster there.
"Innocently enough, with a little hook, actually a big hook, swinging on a chain and the sailor noticing it."
Just a little sound.
"Right, and so our hero mimics exactly what his officer told him."
[inaudible]
Now we cut to the sinister scene on the bridge and this lighting is just mad.
"We got this low lighting that comes right on their faces, the sound of the bells which is a motif across the film and quiet talk."
"So, we're going in to a dark, dark world here and that setting up the attack of the monster watch."
"Still in gentle sling, but now it's a massive beast that's intruding into the frame, and in the first attack of the hook."
"Watch by Stone using passes, and in-communicative and stern, and also simply wrong."
[crosstalk]
"Now, the it's going to, to become the monster at night, attacking the night watchmen."
"We hear the crashing, off screen sound."
"We don't see it and he's going to use his flashlight to track it, there it goes."
It explodes across the foreground.
We can see its distance of the swing by how he moves the flashlight.
We don't actually see how much it's swinging.
And now the crashing becomes more complex.
We hear it swing and then crash into something.
"And then swing again, but we don't see it."
So sound is mapping the movement before we see it.
"Then we discover it, right?"
"We discover all the parts, too."
"We see it swing past the man out over the deck, and then come back to hit this ladder."
And any ladders that sound to crash[SOUND].
The climax that this is the boat and it illustrates the power of this things.
"Finally, we get it done to control that just variable."
"Disaster is averted, there really is too much potential energy to tie down this hook."
Which mean this is not really about the hook at all.
There's something on this ship that must explode.
"There is something troubling that will break through the surface, and harm men no matter how hard they try."
"And by using sound, I think what Lewton and Robson do is make it more than a hook."
"Of course, we need it for ATP, we need it to build the phosphate sugar backbone of DNA, and we need it for energy transmission and so forth; all life needs it for that."
But it is really pretty scarce in the crust.
So it is usually limiting.
"Now if you just go out there and you pour a bunch of phosphate into the landscape, this is what you get."
Okay?
"You get lakes filled with algal blooms, and that is showing you the dramatic response of-- the algal population and plant population in lakes is showing you that phosphorous really is the limiting factor."
"So phosphate fertilizer is very important in agro-ecosystems, and phosphate fertilizer gets washed into lakes and fish die."
Why do fish die in an eutrophic lake that has a lot of algae in it?
What's killing them?
Yes?
Student:
"Because when the algae becomes decomposed, those &amp;gt; will take a lot of it and change it into nitrogen. &amp;gt;"
Prof:
"Well you've got it right about anoxia, but you got the mechanism wrong."
"By the way, the bottom of a eutrophic lake is anoxic and the process you described is going on there."
But the algae don't have to die to do that.
Student: &amp;gt;
Prof:
Well the algae certainly are taking the sunlight out of the top of the water.
But when does the oxygen disappear from the lake?
"I remember the bad joke about the astronaut who was not so bright, who said, ""Ah, we are going to take our new spacecraft and we are going to"
"land on the sun."""
"And he was asked, ""How are you ever going to"
"land on the sun?"""
"And he said, ""Don't worry, we are going at night."""
It happens at night.
At night the algae are all there.
"They're not making oxygen because there's no photons coming in, but they still have to breathe themselves, and they just suck all the oxygen out of the water and the fish are asphyxiated."
They don't have to die to do it.
They're just naturally living their lives as normal healthy algae and they suck the oxygen out of the water at night.
"Okay, so some take-home points on ecosystems."
"Movement of matter and energy around the planet is really important, and there are some really interesting large-scale issues."
You might not know it at the time but I call them growing pains.
"Your heart is growing when it's crying, when it's hurt"
"- it's part of things, so allow it to be."
"Be with it and you'll find out why it was there for you, what it's teaching was."
When somebody dies it tells you the value of life.
When you break up with someone you love it tells you how valuable relationships are.
When you get disappointed it tells you just how your expectations were far far too unreal.
"When somebody dies, it shows that your time here is not that long, so I must make better use of it."
"All of these so-called negative experiences they're all teachers, so we should never reject them."
Allow them to come intro our heart.
Make good kamma with the bad kamma you're experiencing now.
That way we grow and those positive emotions become stronger and stronger inside of us.
"We become beacons to the world, people who don't get afraid, don't get angry, who don't have grief."
"But have lots of kindness, lots of joy, huge amounts of peace."
Positive emotions grow at the expense of the negative ones.
They grow and grow and grow.
This is actually the path.
What a wonderful thing it is to cherish and nurture these beautiful positive emotions of life.
"Understand where they come from, nurture them, grow them, the negative ones become less and less a part of your repertoire."
"You don't get angry, you get very kind."
"You don't get depressed, you just get wonderfully inspired."
"You don't get so fault-finding, you'd be grateful in the smallest of things, even in..."
"I shouldn't say that, I was going to say a small John Howard."
The smallest of things.. [laughter].
"I shouldn't give him a hard time, he's not a bad guy."
And that way we can have a happier
"life and we can understand the role of emotions in life, how to deal with them, how embrace them, how to generate the positive ones and have a happy time."
"So may you all have a happy time by developing the positive emotions, understanding the negative ones, and understanding how this all works."
"So that's the talk for this evening, thank you very much for listening."
Audience:
"Sadhu, Sadhu, Sadhu"
Ajahn Brahm:
"A high school reunion brings some 50 former students to Riceville, Iowa."
"Eleven of them--some with their spouses and children--arrive early for a special reunion with their former third-grade teacher, Jane Elliott."
This presentation is delivered by the Stanford Center for Professional
Development.
Hey there!
"Oh, we're back."
We're back and now we're getting down and dirty.
"We'll do more pointers, and link"
"list, and implementations."
It's actually going to be like our life for the next week and half.
"There's just even more implementation, trying to think about how those things work on the backside."
So
I will do another alternate implementation of the stack today.
So we did one based on vector and we're going to do one based on a link list.
"And then I'm going to do a cube based on link list, as well, to kind of just mix and match a little bit."
"And then, we're still at the end of the case study, which the material is covered in Chapter 9."
I probably won't get thorough all of that today.
"What we don't finish today we'll be talking about on Friday, and then we'll go on to start talking about map implementation and look at binary search trees."
How many people started [inaudible]?
How many of you got somewhere feeling good?
Not just yet.
"One thing I will tell you is that there are two implementations you're working on and I listed them in the order of the one that the material we've seen the most, right."
We've talked about link list more than we have talked about things that are tree and heat based.
So I listed that one first.
"But, in fact, actually, in terms of difficulty of coding,"
"I think, the second one is little bit more attractable than the first."
So there's no reason you can't do them in either order if it feels good to you to start on the second one before you come back to the first one.
"Or just trade off between working on them if one of them is giving you fits just look at the other one to clear your head, so just a thought about how to approach it."
Okay.
So I am going to do some coding.
I'm going to come back to my slides in a little bit here.
"""You're doing so great!"
"Keep going!"" ... and a bad self on the other side saying, ""Aw, come on ... just one won't hurt."""
And sometimes ... in a moment of weakness ... the bad self wins.
Having a slip-up can make you feel guilty and disappointed in yourself ... but that's not helpful.
"In fact, those bad feelings could set you up for another lapse."
"The truth is, slip-ups happen ... and they happen to almost everyone who quits smoking."
So forget the guilt and disappointment.
What's important now is to
learn from your mistake so a lapse doesn't turn into a relapse.
"Chances are, you slipped because of one of three things: your environment ... your cravings ... or your social support system."
So let's take a good look at each one.
First ... your environment.
Think about the slip-up.
When did it happen?
What were you doing?
Who were you with?
Maybe you're used to smoking when you drink coffee or alcohol ... when you go to certain places ... or when you're around people who stress you out.
Keep track of the things that trigger you to smoke.
"It can help you see patterns, which can help you plan how to deal with your triggers ... or avoid them ... so you can stay strong."
"Next, if your cravings got you to light up again, think about nicotine replacement."
Using medicine can more than double your chances of quitting.
Never tried it?
"Consider an over-the-counter product like the patch, inhaler,"
"lozenges, or gum."
"If you're already using nicotine replacement, keep using it ... even if you slipped up ... and ask your doctor if there are other medicines that might help you."
"Finally, how's your support system?"
It's harder to quit if you're around people who aren't ready to quit with you.
"So when you're with people who aren't ready to quit, ask them not to smoke around you ... and spend more time with people who want you to succeed."
"If you could use more people on your side, join a support group ... find an online quit program ... or call a quitline."
"If you have a smart phone, quit-smoking applications are another way to get encouragement."
Some let you record video messages from loved ones that you can watch when you're tempted to smoke.
Other apps can connect you with friends on social networking sites so they can cheer you on.
Anyone interested?
Couple of you?
Yeah.
"So, Greywater, it's from sinks, showers and washing machines."
So its water that's a little bit dirty but it's not too dirty to other plants.
"It's never from toilets and it's not from washing diapers, so it doesn't have thicker matter in it."
"It's not like the toilets, which would be not safe to reuse."
"Kitchen sinks, it depends on what state you"
live in if it's considered Greywater or not.
"In California, kitchen sinks are not allowed to be--we're not allowed to reuse that water legally."
So I want to break Greywater into three ways.
The first one is for outdoor use.
"This is just taking the Greywater, sending it outside."
"You're taking a shower, it's going out just directly and irrigating your plants."
So that's the simplest way to use it.
It's low tech.
We try not to have pumps or filters or things that require maintenance and mechanical devices.
"The second way is also for outdoor use, but this is a little different."
"It's taking Greywater and sending it through a drip irrigation system, which is a lot more complicated because Greywater has hair in it, has lint, it has little, you know, chunks of things."
It's a little gunky.
"And so, if you want to send that to drip irrigation, you're going have to really filter it and get all the particles out."
"And so, then you just have a much more complex system."
So it's a really different way to use the water.
And then the third way is indoor use.
"And so that's for non-potable uses, such as toilet flushing, and possibly laundry washing."
And it's also a lot more complicated to get greywater back inside because it has to be filtered and disinfected and it's pumped and it's connected to the domestic water supply.
And it's really just a whole other level of system.
It's also not really allowed under the new code in any practical way and so it's definitely a good resource for bigger scale projects like commercial buildings.
"For residential, it's usually not very appropriate."
"And so, when you're thinking about any type of Greywater System, the soaps and the products you use really matter because now that water is going to your plants."
So there's a couple of things you want to avoid.
You want to avoid any salt compound.
I'll give you a couple of examples.
"Schools are still pretty much organized on factory lines - ringing bells, separate facilities, specialized into separate subjects."
We still educate children by batches.
"You know, we put them through the system by age group."
Why do we do that?
"You know, why is there this assumption that the most important thing kids have in common is how old they are?"
"You know, it's like the most important thing about them is their date of manufacture"
"Well, I know kids who are much better than other kids at the same age in different disciplines, you know, or at different times of the day, or better in smaller groups then in large groups, or sometimes they want to be on their own."
"If you're interested in the model of learning, you don't start from this production line mentality."
"These are, it's essentially about conformity."
And increasingly it's about that as you look at the growth  of standardized testing and standardized curricula.
And it's about standardization.
I believe we've got to go in the exact opposite direction.
That's what I mean about changing the paradigm.
"There was a great study done recently of divergent thinking, published a couple of years ago."
Divergent thinking isn't the same thing as creativity.
I define creativity as the process of having original ideas  that have value.
Divergent thinking isn't a synonym.
But it's an essential capacity for creativity.
"It's the ability to see lots of possible answers to a question,"
lots of possible ways of interpreting a question.
"To think, what Edward de Bono would probably call laterally."
"To think, not just in linear or convergent ways."
"To see multiple answers, not one."
"So, I mean, there are tests for this."
"I mean, one kind of cod example would be, people might be asked to say how many uses can you think of for a paper clip."
Those routine questions.
Most people might come with 10 or 15.
People who are good at this might come up with 200.
"And they do that by saying, well, could the paper clip be turned, and a foot tall, and be made out of foam rubber."
"You know, like, does it have to be a paper clip as we know it, Jim."
"Now, there are tests for this."
"And today, it's something enjoyed by about 300,000 people every day."
"Tela mentioned, more than 100 million TED talks have been viewed."
"When you think about that, it's strange, you know, 100 million lectures viewed on the Internet, who would've thought?"
How did it happen?
This event here today actually seems equally miraculous to me.
TED itself had really nothing to do with organizing it.
"And, trust me, organizing an event like this takes a huge amount of effort."
"And, yet, it's one of more than 100 would be held this year around the world as part of this TEDx program of independently organized TED events."
The program still in Beta hasn't really even started yet.
No one is making any money.
"This is being done for passion, curiosity."
How did that happen?
So I should warn you that the story I will tell it's not like a top-down plan of some determination to propagate TED to the world.
I think you'll discover TED has a life of its own.
"More mysterious than that, it's a story of a very strange, but I think beautiful, cultural phenomenon that has emerged out of a really remarkable community, which by the way includes you."
"So, TED past, present, and future."
TED started as an experiment in convergence.
"The brilliant Richard Wurman and Harry Marks figured it out 25 years ago that industries of technology, entertainment, and design were converging, that if you brought together the people from those 3 worlds, they would have interesting things to say to each other."
"So, it turned out the first TED held in 1984 showcased the brand-new Apple Macintosh and Sony showed off this strange, shiny, silver, round disks containing digital sounds which were the first CDs."
"And both objects, if you like, oozing technology, entertainment, and design."
People were wowed.
Event lost money and wasn't held again for another 6 years.
"But, after that -- (Laughter) after that it's been held annually,"
It really took off.
"And, strange things started to happen."
The content broadened.
"In addition to the T, E, and D, of TED, in came story tellers, adventurers, entrepreneurs, business leaders, just ordinary human beings with a surprising story to tell."
"Remarkably, instead of the audience going,"
"""oh, this is diluted."
"This is losing relevance to me."", they loved it."
Why?
Why?
Factory farming is the biggest abuse of all.
Because in the United States alone there are 10 billion animals raised for food.
Its an extraordinary number and the average American eats 80 or 85 animals per year.
And we want to see that number reduced and we want to see the animals out of these terrible confinement systems.
And why do you think Al Gore didn't mention factory farming?
"You know I think that he probably thought that he was giving a lot of information already to people with An Inconvenient Truth, and maybe he thought that people would shut down if it affected them too personally."
"Because it gets very personal when you're talking about eating animals, and you're talking about something that is part of the American diet."
He thought all this is going too far.
But the public is slowly waking up.
I do not believe that we can have a good situation for animals or the environment if we continue to eat as much meat as we're eating.
"But even if you reduce your total consumption by half and instead of eating 80 animals eat 40, you cut in half the greenhouse gas emissions."
So we do think that our fork is a powerful tool.
"So, they're clear about this in the United States: the power lies with the consumer."
"As consumers, we can make a difference by changing our diets."
Matt Prescott says that meat is the number one cause of global warming.
And he gives a good example of this.
"If every American ate no chicken for just one day a week, then this would reduce just as much pollution as taking 500.000 cars off the road."
Chicken?
No thanks!
We'd rather have 500.000 cars!
It's funny.
"OK, I can hear you thinking:"
Meat and other animal products are bad for the environment.
I get it.
But don't we need meat and milk for our health?
"Where else do we get the calcium for our bones, the iron for our blood, and the vitamins and minerals we need to keep us healthy?"
"Advertisers and food producers have done so much to indoctrinate us, that you'd nearly end up believing it."
Go meat!
Sides of lamb are only 1.99 a kilo.
"The message is clear: milk is essential, meat is good for you, cheese is healthy for us all ..."
"But who benefits most from meat and dairy products, the consumer or the producer?"
Do we really need all that animal protein?
(Guitar music throughout)
Music is a language.
Both music and verbal languages serve the same purpose.
They are both forms of expression.
They can be used as a way to communicate with others.
They can be read and written.
"They can make you laugh or cry, think or question, and can speak to one or many."
And both can definitely make you move.
"In some instances, music works better than the spoken word, because it doesn't have to be understood to be effective."
"Although many musicians agree that music is a language, it is rarely treated as such."
"Many of us treat it as something that can only be learned by following a strict regimen, under the tutelage of a skilled teacher."
"This approach has been followed for hundreds of years with proven success, but it takes a long time."
Too long.
Think about the first language you learn as a child.
"More importantly, think about how you learned it."
"You were a baby when you first started speaking, and even though you spoke the language incorrectly you were allowed to make mistakes."
"And the more mistakes you made, the more your parents smiled."
Learning to speak was not something you were sent somewhere to do only a few times a week.
And the majority of the people you spoke to were not beginners.
They were already proficient speakers.
Imagine your parents forcing you to only speak to other babies until you were good enough to speak to them.
You would probably be an adult before you could carry on a proper conversation.
"To use a musical term, as a baby, you were allowed to jam with professionals."
"If we approach music in the same natural way we approached our first language, we will learn to speak it in the same short time it took to speak our first language."
Proof of this could be seen in almost any family where a child grows up with other musicians in the family.
Here are a few keys to follow in learning or teaching music.
"In the beginning, embrace mistakes, instead of correcting them."
"Like a child playing air guitar, there are no wrong notes."
Allow young musicians to play and perform with accomplished musicians on a daily basis.
Encourage young musicians to play more than they practice.
The more they play the more they will practice on their own.
"Music comes from the musician, not the instrument."
For the most part we have acting out kids altogether.
"But, he, academically he does very, very well when he wants to do it."
"I don't know, some days I can go into school, sit down, not say a word, do everything."
"And everyone will say, wish we could have Adam like this all day without his hat on, without him talking, doing all his work, asking for more work."
And other days it's like Adam comes in and starts goofing off.
So real high school turned out to be another missed opportunity.
He's a fragile guy right now.
"You know, I want him to be successful."
"But when you don't give a student what they need, the potential for really falling apart and giving up is so high that you really have to factor that in."
It's a possibility.
A year later the school has expelled Adam for poor behavior.
"Once again, adrift,"
Adam has held a variety of odd jobs.
And his mother fears he is back on drugs and alcohol.
"When I was a little kid I dreamed of going to college, going to school."
But I haven't finished high school so I can't go to college.
Now I have no high school diploma so I just work full time.
It's like what else do I have?
Nothing.
I see kids every single day that are like Adam.
And sometimes I can get to them.
And sometimes I can help them.
And sometimes they slip by.
But there's no reason that Adam needed to slip by.
We had Adam.
We had a hold on Adam.
"What Adam needed, the experts say, was the hardest thing to get, early recognition of his problems and a consistent plan for dealing with them."
In some states the size of prisons are predicted on the basis of third grade and fourth grade literacy rates.
"So it does portend an alienation from society, in a sense."
"And it's for those reasons, these downstream consequences of loss of self esteem, poor academic development, limited vocabulary and other cognitive developments, difficulties with social relations, difficulties getting and holding jobs, and getting in trouble with the law that we consider reading problems to not only to be an educational issue but a public health issue and a public health concern as well."
Now Adam's parents are left with what they had at the very beginning but only that they still have hope.
You change your dreams.
"Let's say what this actually means, divide and conquer."
Divide and conquer says basically do the following: split the problem into several sub-problems of the same type.
"I'll come back in a second to help binary searches matches in that, but that's what we're going to do."
"For each of those sub-problems we're going to solve them independently, and then we're going to combine those solutions."
And it's called divide and conquer for the obvious reason.
I'm going to divide it up into sub-problems with the hope that those sub-problems get easier.
"It's going to be easier to conquer if you like, and then"
I'm going to merge them back.
"Now, in the binary search case, in some sense, this is a little bit trivial."
What was the divide?
The divide was breaking a big search up into half a search.
"We actually threw half of the list away and we kept dividing it down, until ultimately we got something of size one to search."
That's really easy.
"The combination was also sort of trivial in this case because the solution to the sub-problem was, in fact, the solution to the larger problem."
But there's the idea of divide and conquer.
I'm going to use exactly that same ideas to tackle sort.
"Again, I've got an unordered list of n elements."
I want to sort it into a obviously a sorted list.
And that particular algorithm is actually a really nice algorithm called merge sort.
And it's actually a fairly old algorithm.
It was invented in 1945 by John von Neumann one of the pioneers of computer science.
"And here's the idea behind merge sort, actually I'm going to back into it in a funny way."
Let's assume that I could somehow get to the stage where
I've got two sorted lists.
How much work do I have to do to actually merge them together?
So let me give you an example.
"Suppose I want to merge two lists, and they're sorted."
"Just to give you an example, here's one list, 3121724"
"Here's another list, 12430."
"I haven't said how I'm going to get those sorted lists, but imagine I had two sorted lists like that."
How hard is it to merge them?
"Well it's pretty easy, right?"
"I can't take it anymore, move out of the way"
Mr.Mahmoud wants you
What does he want?
"What are you doing, dad?"
"Come on, world cup is approaching"
We're gonna fight now
What?
Come on Karim
He never even played boxing
"Shut up Karim, why don't you just tell him about all of this?"
I don't wanna play!
Man up!
Stop
Put your arms up like this yeah liek this to protect yourself and the glasses?
Give me the glasses
Raise your hands up
Yeah protect your face well Karim
Ok
"Come on, dress up"
Morning Ellen
I believe you're going to give us an update on some of the work you've been doing?
Yes - last time I did a blog I'd just began treatment on this beautiful lentoid and now I've actually finished it.
And I've updated the housing for the object and now you can see all the beautiful features that are present.
One thing I wanted to point out before we take a closer look at the object is that we actually take a number of samples of everything that we remove from each object and that includes the soil from the cells and it also includes things like corrosion products possible organic materials and if we do happen to find any tiny garnet fragments in the soil.
So all those things are saved and I constructed this little housing so they don't rattle around.
Just as an example this is the soil from the bottom and the left cloisonné cells in the object.
"Okay, can you just turn that round for us so we can just see the soil moving in there?"
"Okay, so that's an example of all the soil that you've kept."
And you were saying other things that you might of kept are just small fragments?
Any tiny fragments that I discovered that are unusual or notable in any way so for an example this is sort of a green black lump that's a compressed possible corrosion product that I found in the cells.
This is an interesting feature that I thought I would point out this is one thing that I found through excavating one of the central cells here and that's a remaining rivet.
There are actually several rivet holes present and you can see those on the back of the object
So christians themselves seem to value ignorance.
The apple of the tree of knowledge - they shouldn't have eaten that.
"And, in the past, they've burnt books for freethinkers alike."
"I view this competition between real science and christian science as like watching a horse race where one horse, the christian sicence horse, has died in gates and never really made it out."
And the other horse has been going for 2000 years or more.
Which one will win?
We'll see.
"- If the finish line is right back at the start, then the dead horse got there first."
- Right.
"Like so many other areas, chrisitan science is a proven failure."
"Although, we're not alone here in picking on christianity."
"All the other religions,"
"like Islamic science, or whatever, Judaistic science."
It's all the same stuff.
"- It's pretty cool, too, because you can go to the Muslim science pages and they'll tell you everything that's wrong with the christian science pages, and the christians will tell you what's wrong with the Muslims, and they'll both tell you what's wrong with the Jews."
"Actually, I don't know that Jews spend a whole lot of time trying to make the Torah and Talmud match up to science."
- The Jews aren't big on marketing.
They're happy to have their exclusive club.
"- I think the most amusing use of science by Jews is actually using science, real science, in order to find a workaround for all the prohibitions for what they can do on the sabbath."
Which is really amusing.
- Little gadgets to push the button on the elevator so that you're not actually creating fire.
"- Or a phone that's always trying to dial every number and you have it stop not, whatever."
"Anyway, it's confusing."
Continue with your...
- Modern marvels.
"Well, today I'm going to talk a little about cosmology, which is one of the big topics that comes up, some other physical sciences, a little bit of mathematics."
"Another time, I'm going to save some of the more meaty stuff for other shows."
"I'll talk about the failure of creationism on another show, and I'll talk about the failure of chrisitian medicine on another show."
"So, so much fail, there must be a god."
The biblical cosmology is primitively wrong.
It's pretty screwed up.
"There's this notion of a firmament, which is this large dome that separates heaven from the earth in biblical cosmology."
But it's done over that theme of blow the man down which is about violence and the threat of squalls and storms at sea.
"And the fact that, that carries from the deck onto the drawing of the line on the map."
Where that X is placed.
"Is a, is a very strong sense of, of foreboding."
"Something will go wrong, and then it brings us to the ship at night."
Now this scene is a straightforward exhibition scene.
It's interesting because the guy serving coffee seems to be really angry at the world.
But watch what happens after it's done.
Back to the ship at night.
"Now interesting, we don't need any voice over, all we need is the face of Finn, the sound of the wind, and the mysterium theme to come back to give us this feeling that something is a mess that all is not happy and easy on the surface, and that there are very, very deep and wrong things going on."
"And this is the, the secret of alludent film, that the atmosphere is always there undercutting even the easy placid moments."
You can never get rid of the monsters.
The monster or the monsteress.
"Now the sinister texture of sound all pays off in the climax of the film, which is quite troubling and disturbing, but beautifully, beautifully done."
"Now, the climax begins with something that we might expect, an orchestral score showing Stone's madness."
[music]
"And his voice over, we're finally getting subjective access to his character's psychology and now we all know this man is completely cracked."
"It's going to climax when he's going to go back to that sign that we saw in the very first scene where he met his junior officer and no longer can face this, we see the madness in the strictness of his authority here."
[music]
"Right, now that's the climax of the score for the moment."
It's going to drift down now.
And as he pulls that sabre off of his wall.
We've been wondering what would happen to that.
We cut away a little bit of exposition as the good guys.
We guess they're good guys.
They don't anything in the end.
They're wondering about the telegram and get this.
[music]
"Billy Radd, again starting his calypso."
[music]
"And it was quite a jaunty, happy number as we see."
[music]
"For example, sending them overseas so they can rest their bodies, and sending them to sanatoriums."
"In case of Fukushima, the current radiation level is so high I'm afraid such measures may not be enough."
"After all, they have eaten produce from local sources."
"Fukushima is ""Forbidden Forest"" of Belarus, so to speak."
Forest so dangerous no one can enter.
"Still, many people including children are allowed to live in the ""Forest."" I cannot permit this."
And such unusual changes in health do not happen in Fukushima alone.
I think this issue should be addressed in a more comprehensive manner.
"Indeed, there are many areas with high radiation in Kanto where children should be evacuated out."
"In Belarus, in the areas where the radiation level simply exceeds 0.1 microsievert, children did get ill, though you can't simply compare those areas to Kanto because they're self-sufficient."
But there are actually people in Kanto who claim to have nosebleed and diarrhea.
"As Dr. Hida [expert in internal radiation exposure] pointed out, if you see both nosebleed and diarrhea, that's a clear sign of internal radiation exposure."
I think it's OK for us to be overly nervous.
The most important thing we need to do now is to protect children.
It's better to overreact now and be criticized for the overreaction later than not doing anything.
"As we have seen today, various problems are happening one after another."
Those who can escape should do so.
And we have to remember the importance of keeping a record if any unusual change in health happens to us.
"Ms. Noro, thank you very much."
We will end our program with the forecast of the dispersion of radioactive particles by the German Weather Services over the next three days.
Please watch out for the weather and the wind direction when you go out during this weekend.
On the ninty-sixth day we sailed again.
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight.
Goddamn them all!
"I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, we'd fire no guns, shed no tears..."
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
The Yankee lay low down with gold
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays but to catch her took the Antelope two whole days.
Goddamn them all!
"And obviously when a media corporation appears in a context of collective enthusiasm, there can be problems."
But I don't think it's very intelligent.
"I mean, I understand the reaction, but it has been proven afterwards that it's a reaction that doesn't benefit, but rather is detrimental for what was happening there."
You need people to insult you through the media.
You need people to manipulate you.
"You need people to distort your words, because there are a lot of people who don't succumb to that manipulation, who don't succumb to the insults, and who don't succumb to that distortion, and realises that you're not what the television says you are."
"It's a lot better to be insulted, I know it's a drag to say"
"""it's better for people to talk bad about you than not talk about you at all""."
"It's not exactly that, but you have to open yourself to the media and accept that they're going to hit you."
"Yes, they're going to hit you."
What's important is that there are other media outlets that understand you.
"Not because you're good to them or because they're on your side, but because ""each to his own"". there was a day"
"I was at an assembly where it was decided, or it looked that way"
"I think they didn't decide on it in the end, they decided that the only camera that could record there was the camera of the Sol audiovisual commission."
"You stop for 15 seconds to think where that's going to, what kind of model of communication it's going towards, and it's scary."
It's a bit scary.
Fortunately that didn't happen.
So there have been a few moments but in the end everyone always realised there was no sense in it.
But you see it's not coherent with who you are.
ST:
That is definitely NOT the 15M.
JL:
Definitely not the 15M.
Not letting the media work is not coherent with the 15M.
And yet I understand the indignation against the media.
Perfectly.
ST:
I participated in two assemblies in which I spoke about this topic.
About prohibiting cameras.
"One was on the 16th, I remember perfectly, the first day of the camp, saying that it was impossible. and the other was the same, but three weeks later."
And they were going on about the same thing curiously.
JL:
The fact that scientists quantitative is a huge theme in the course.
We'll be focusing on operational definitions in the next couple of weeks.
You'll get to practice that later on in the course.
And organize skepticism is another big thing.
This'll really be a focus in week three.
But we'll start thinking about it now.
Welcome back.
We were in the midst of figuring out the Laplace transform of sine of at when I was running out of time.
This was the definition of the Laplace transform of sine of at.
I said that also equals y.
"This is going to be useful for us, since we're going to be doing integration by parts twice."
"So I did integration by parts once, then I did integration by parts twice."
"I said, you know, don't worry about the boundaries of the integral right now."
Let's just worry about the indefinite integral.
And then after we solve for y-- let's just say y is the indefinite version of this-- then we can evaluate the boundaries.
"And we got to this point, and we made the realization, after doing two integration by parts and being very careful not to hopefully make any careless mistakes, we realized, wow, this is our original y."
"If I put the boundaries here, that's the same thing as the"
"Laplace transform of sine of at, right?"
That's our original y.
"So now-- and I'll switch colors just avoid monotony-- this is equal to, actually, let me just-- this is y."
Right?
That was our original definition.
So let's add a squared over sine squared y to both sides of this.
"So this is equal to y plus-- I'm just adding this whole term to both sides of this equation-- plus a squared over s squared y is equal to-- so this term is now gone, so it's equal to this stuff."
And let's see if we can simplify this.
So let's factor out an e to the minus st.
"Actually, let's factor out a negative e to the minus st."
"So it's minus e to the minus st, times sine of-- well, let me just write 1 over s, sine of at, minus 1 over s squared, cosine of at."
I really hope I haven't made any careless mistakes.
"And so this, we can add the coefficient."
"So we get 1 plus a squared, over s squared, times y."
And let's say its mass is 500 grams.
And let's say that I can accelerate this vehicle at an acceleration of-- I don't know-- 3 centimeters per second squared.
What's the force that I need to apply to this mass to accelerate it at this speed?
And we want the answer in Newton's.
So what's the force?
So we're just going to use Newton's second law and
Newton's second law tells us force is equal to mass times acceleration.
"So you might want to, or you might be tempted just to multiply mass times acceleration and you'd get force is equal to-- let's see, 500 grams times 3 centimeters per second squared."
"And you would get force is equal to 1,500 gram centimeters per second squared."
"And if you did this, you would be right."
"Although your answer would not be in Newtons and now you would have to somehow, try to convert this set of units to Newtons."
And what are Newtons?
"Well we learned when we did Newton's laws that a Newton, so 1 Newton is equal to 1 kilogram meter per second squared."
So somehow we have to convert the gram to kilograms and we have to convert the centimeters to meters.
"We could do it after the fact here, or what I find it easier to do is actually to convert the mass and the acceleration units first and then just do the F equals ma."
So what's 500 grams in kilograms?
"Well 500 grams is half-- well, a kilogram as a thousand grams."
So 500 is going to be half a kilogram.
"1 kilogram is a thousand grams, so 0.5 kilograms is 500 grams."
"Similarly, 3 centimeters is how many meters?"
"Well, 1 meter is 300-- sorry."
I think I'm dehydrated.
"1 meter is a hundred centimeters, right?"
So 3 centimeters is 0.03 meters per second squared.
Hopefully this make sense to you.
3 centimeters is 0.03 meters.
And now we already.
We have our mass in kilograms and we have our acceleration in meters per second squared.
"And if this is confusing, you should watch the unit videos because this is all I'm doing; I'm just doing unit conversion."
So let's go back to force equals mass times acceleration.
"So the force was equal to 0.5 kilograms times the acceleration, which is 0.03 meters per second squared."
And this equals--
"Now, of course, over time we worked harder and had more machines, so overall output in US economy grew much faster than 2.4% a year."
It grew more like 7-10% a year over that period.
"Yet, the point is that a lot of that we can get for free, essentially, without any harder work or any more capital."
"However, starting in 1973 until the early 1990s, productivity growth fell dramatically to 1% per year."
That is literally we lost 1 1/2% per year of stuff we were getting before.
"We were getting 2 1/2% a year up to '73, all of a sudden it's down to 1%."
That's 1 1/2% a year less stuff we can get unless we work harder to make up for it.
Why did this happen?
"Well, we don't exactly know, but there's two good candidates."
"We know the two candidates, we just don't know the right proportions."
One is that we have less capital in our society because savings fell.
The amount of savings US households do fell dramatically.
And the US has a very low savings rate.
The US savings rate over this period averaged about 3%.
"That is, every dollar we earned we saved about 3% as a society."
"Compared to countries like Japan, where it's more like 20%."
Every dollar they earn they save about 20%.
Now why does that matter?
"Well, we'll talk about this later in the course, but essentially the amount we save determines the amount of capital we have in society."
"Because essentially, where do firms get the money to build machines?"
They get it by borrowing from households who save.
And the
"less we save, the less money there is that firms could invest in building machines."
And we'll talk about that at length later in the semester.
"But the bottom line is, the more we save as a country, the more money we have available, the more firms can take that money and build machines that improve our standard of living."
"And that saving fell a lot, and that's one reason."
And the other reason is that productivity fell for reasons we don't quite understand.
"We know that productivity slowed down, but we don't quite understand why that is."
"But then in the 1990s, productivity shot up again."
"So productivity went back up towards our historic levels, from 1% back up to over 2% a year."
Why is that?
"Well, it's unclear, but we think it's basically the IT revolution."
So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.
And here you can see the body actor.
"And then this is what we called the ""dead head,"" no reference to Jerry Garcia."
And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance.
"And then, again, the final shot."
It was a long process.
(Applause)
"The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this, because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides."
We had to create a lighting system.
"So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world."
We also had to create an eye system.
"We found the old adage, you know,"
"""The eyes are the window to the soul,"" absolutely true."
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.
"And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity, and feel his intent coming through the eyes, then we would succeed."
So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years.
We also had to create a mouth system.
We worked from dental molds of Brad.
We had to age the teeth over time.
We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
He was very popular.
Skin displacement: another big deal.
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.
"He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home around other old people, so he had to look exactly the same as the others."
"So, lots of work on skin deformation, you can see in some of these cases it works, in some cases it looks bad."
"This is a very, very, very early test in our process."
"So, effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face."
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance.
"There was something that we encountered, though, that we ended up calling ""the digital Botox effect."""
"So, as things went through this process,"
Double recombinents are always the rarest class.
In this case the rarest class will be these right here.
"Now, when we look at this, which two of these genes are in the same phase and what's the third one that is in different phase."
Relative to the parents.
Here are the parentals.
And we can confirm that is actually the parental phase because that is most common.
"When we look over here, the rarest two have c been coming from the other chromosome, where's the capitals are together, just as they should be so, the little m, little b, big m, big c is necessarily the double recombinant, so it must have had something like this to come to double recombination event."
So the order must be B.
"A, C, B. So C is in fact in the middle."
"Now, what we can do, from those numbers you saw."
And you can do this for practice if you want.
You can go back and actually and calculate the recombination fractions.
The recombination between A and C is only 0.8 centimorgans.
"Or if you calculated it, directly it's 0.008."
Between C and B is 15.1% recombination or 15.1 centimorgans.
So we can infer from this since A was at 11P fifteen.
"Six, B is at 11P 12.3, C is probably at or near 11P 15.5."
"In fact, this gene is actually well known to be at 11P 15.5."
It actually has already been mapped and identified.
Now lemme conclude this video by just recapping one very important point.
Goal of genetic mapping is to localize alleles and genes that cause disease.
"What you're trying to do is you're trying to find, where is that unique allele,"
"like, which gene has it."
"Cuz again, genes don't come labeled."
"Even when you have the full human genome sequence, the genes do not come labeled."
Some markers will be associated with disease.
"And those ones that show that strong association where alleles at those markers, the gene attacked at that was the markers will, will be associated with whether or not you have disease, or will predict whether or not you have disease."
Those are ones that will be near the disease-causing gene.
Okay?
Some markers will not be associated.
It will be very weakly associated with it.
And those are the ones are that are likely far away from the disease causing.
Strong force.
All right.
"The weak and the strong forces here, these are intranuclear forces within the nucleus."
That's what keeps the protons and neutrons and the quarks together.
"For the most part, the weak and the strong force don't have an effect in chemistry, with the exception for beta decay, for some radioactive elements."
"That's where you need to think about, in particular, the weak force."
"Gravity also -- Well, gravity actually has no known consequence for chemistry."
"It doesn't mean that there isn't one, but it has no known consequence for chemistry."
"All of chemistry is tied up in this force, the electromagnetic force."
"Now, what I am going to do is I am going to simplify it just a little bit and just call this the Coulomb force."
And why I am going to do that is going to be a little more obvious when you get to 8.02.
But I am going to call it the Coulomb interaction.
And we know what the Coulomb force law looks like.
The Coulomb force law is the following.
"Say I have a positive charge, which is my nucleus."
I am going to call that force plus e.
"And at some distance R, R is the distance now, between that nucleus and the negatively charged particle, which is my electron."
I can describe the force of attraction between this electron in the nucleus by the following expression.
"That force, which is a function of the distance between the two charges, is just the magnitude of the charge on the negatively charged particle times the magnitude on the positively charged particle over 4 pi epsilon nought r squared."
"Now, I am going to treat this force, just for simplicity purposes right now, as a scalar."
"I am not going to talk about the direction, but because this is a force between a positive and negative charge, this is an attractive force."
This epsilon down here is the permittivity of the vacuum.
It is in there for doing our unit conversion correctly.
That is all I will say about it.
Maybe you will talk a little bit more about it in 8.02.
"And then, finally, here is the r squared."
That is the important part.
That is the distance between the electron and the nucleus.
And what I want you to notice here-- I don't need the screen down yet.
Hello.
She just switched it?
"Oh, all right."
People fixed this with something called Time Division Multiplexing and there are
"lots of different algorithms for how to do this but the idea is that the computer is so fast it can jump, it can spend some time on one thread, jump to the second, jump to the third, and then come back to the fourth and as the user we don't see the difference."
"That said, eh, yeah."
And this multithreading has been around for decades too because we can do this.
"Okay, so there are some issues with using parallel programing."
In parallel programing when you write parallel programing you run into a lot more troubles than just writing serial code.
What kinds of troubles?
"Well first thing, you have to think how to divide the problem up so that you can run it in parallel because some, some problems aren't as easy."
"It's called embarrassingly parallelized, like I said the list of 100 that you just send 50 this way and send 50 the other way."
Some problems just aren't that easy to parallelize.
Some problems can't be parallelized.
"And then you have to, there's time to hand out work to different workers."
"Eh, what does this mean?"
"We want, need to send the data around between the different cores."
"All the workers, each computer doesn't always work as fast."
Especially when you work in cluster and cloud computing.
"Each computer, some computers die, some computers are slower, some computers fail."
It happens.
You have to deal with it.
"Eh, there may be contention for shared resources."
"If you try to use the list you can't be changing it all the time because you might get problems, and we'll talk about that in five minutes."
Workers could be overwriting each others answers.
That's the idea.
"You have to wait for the last, slowest worker to come back."
And this is the weakest link.
And there's time to put the data together after you've done all the parallel parts.
"Specifically, in lab this week we're going to have a compitition."
"Ooo, fun."
We're going to see how fast you guys can sort a shuffled deck of cards.
We'll have a classwide compitition and you'll actually tackle all these problems.
"So let's say, time to hand out small work"" units"" to workers, you have to maybe pass out cards between each other."
Some of you sort slower than others and we'll see how it works.
Ole:
"I think thats true and in many ways thay actually realized an ideal life in relation to the cultural and there have been lots of them who have been talented musicians, I can promise you and painters ... christ what is this all about, right? and they didn't have to be professional cause to be proffesional's a compulsion right?"
"If you have enough money, you can always grow it as an amateur, in German called ""Lieb haber"" someone who does something because he enjoys it"
Martin:
"""Amo"" does mean ""I love"""
Ole:
Yes thats true
Martin:
"So if I have to pick up on your totalitarian leadership of the world, if we are to achieve it all before the crisis ..."
We need small units and within the small units we could make a cultural revival we could institutionalize one in any case and then hope that rises a culture in light of the disaster which might also be repentance and then the music very well could play a larger role in the formation project but also as quality of life
Ole:
"Yes, Community Project"
Martin:
Community Project yes.
What else could be included?
Ole:
"Also painting, I think."
Children are phenomenal painters .. many of them have a sense of color that is ever so good
Arts's a way where people generally don't have to harm each other when unfolding
And I think limited sports can be too when it doesn't mean that you have to be wonderful
Martin:
"There's also some sports that potentially could be artistic but thats still about who can make the most twists in the air and jump highest and things like that, right?"
"So that has also been taken out of the artistic of those who potentially had it, perhaps?"
Ole:
"I remember that long ago I read, that in Brazil were a tribe they played out on the criterion that it was important to get the other team to win"
It can of course be a good sport but I like that way of thinking
Martin:
So the competition culture does not benefit anything at the moment?
Ole:
"No, I do not think it has benefited anyone anything ever"
Martin:
But you could say that this Greek way of compeeding to the arts might have helped them become so good? or helped them become so good in so little time.. thats what some thinks..
How did we do code review?
How did you earn your authority?
There was nothing quite like it before.
When we started the foundation we remade ourselves over again.
"We were, as I said, a small number of people, we made a bet on a new product that was Firefox."
We didn't have a product to ship at that time.
"And Asa with our community involvement continued to ship the Mozilla suite for fifteen months, as the only product we had in the marketplace until Firefox was ready."
"We made that bet, which is a scary bet."
"Imagine not to have a browser,"
I mean we didn't have a person working on the product we were shipping.
But we did that because we knew that Firefox was our opportunity to make a commercial product.
Our first five or six years of life taught us that technology alone will not change the industry the way we want to.
Technology alone does not change people's lives the way we want to do that.
Our opportunity with the browser is to have a product that touches people.
Yeah.
[Question]
Yeah.
So that's where I'm trying to get to.
"That technology alone is not enough, that raw power of technology is not enough, that if you really want to touch people, not us, not power users, not developers but if you want to touch consumers and change their lives, you have to be utterly committed to that."
You can't build the features that you want just because you want them.
You can't tell people:
"""Oh, you should behave this way, you should want to be this way."""
You have to build the product that is elegant and beautiful and powerful under the covers but that people love.
That was the first thing.
That is a big change.
Many open source projects never make that change.
I started calling it the tyranny of the product.
If you are serious about wanting to touch hundreds of millions of people you have to be committed to those hundreds of millions of people.
"You can't just think they're stupid, or they don't understand."
You have to really be committed to making their lives better.
So that's what Firefox do.
"So we didn't rewrite all these switches, and all the preferences the way our first product had."
"And he has realized that, as a doctor, he has no business being around a mother when she is giving birth."
So he gave up.
Eating fish is not a medical issue.
"However, when a fish bone gets stuck in my throat, then it can become a medical issue."
"By the same token, it's very important that we don't consider a mother who is giving birth to be ill."
The same way I'm not ill when I'm eating a fish.
Psychiatry and obstetrics are two of the most insane fields within the world of medicine.
"All of us and all doctors were once born, so doctors have their traumas."
"And somewhere it's about 'why should children enter life easier, happier and more loved, than I did when I was born?'"
In a way it's about jealousy too.
"'If it was hard for me, why should I make it easier for these children?'"
"It may sound strange, but I'm absolutely certain that it is part of the deal too."
Semmelweis had scientific results.
He didn't have a microscope.
"He didn't see bacteria, he couldn't prove his case, but the patients of those doctors who had washed their hands didn't die."
He saw things very clearly.
"When he felt doctors were the cause of childbed fever, that they became murderers unknowingly with their own unwashed hands as they assisted with births right after performing autopsies He saw it, he knew it."
"But when he mentioned it, he got expelled."
Doctors couldn't dare to imagine and acknowledge that for long years they had been hurting and killing women.
Semmelweis wrote a letter that breaks one's heart when reading it
"He wrote a letter, in which he was begging doctors to stop the old process immediately and he was asking them not to push this opportunity aside just so they wouldn't have to feel guilty."
"This regime, this mentality causes fear."
"Love is a virus when it spreads, but fear is also a virus."
It is a terrible virus.
"I would recommend obstetricians that they stand up immediately, today and say something."
I don't understand what they are waiting for.
What are they risking?
Is it that they would all be expelled with their licenses revoked?
"Agi's colleagues, obstetricians, experts"
Why are they silent?
What are they waiting for?
"Are they waiting for Agi and a few other brave obstetricians to be punished, and then ten years from now they will find their voices?"

"If they're not equal, then you have too much of one and not enough of the other."
"So basically, what we can do is we can solve in this example-- in this example, we could say the marginal product of labor is 1/2 k over the square root of k times l."
The marginal product of capital from this production function is-- once again I'm using this production function q equals square root of k times l.
Marginal project of capital is 1/2 I over square root of k times l.
So the ratio of the marginal products is simply k over l.
"The marginal rate of technical substitution, given this production function, is k over l."
That's the marginal rate of technical substitution.
"So this says that given this production function and these prices, at the optimum you should set k over I equal to w over r, which equals 1/2."
"So what this says is given this production function, these price ratios, the optimal thing to do is to use half as much capital as labor."
"Half as much capital as labor is the optimal thing to do, and that's what we see in figure 9-2, is the optimal thing to do is use half as much capital as labor."
"Now, in other words, let's say, to now develop the intuition."
"Imagine you told me no, I should use as much capital as"
I should use labor.
As much capital as I should use labor.
Imagine I told you that.
"Imagine I said no, in fact, the efficient thing to use is why not have one machine for every worker?"
How would you tell me intuitively why that's wrong?
Why would I be wrong to say use one machine for every worker?
"Why would that be wrong, given the prices prevailing in the market?"
Someone can tell me this.
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
"Well, renting machines is a lot more expensive than paying more workers."
JON GRUBER:
Twice as expensive to rent a machine as get a worker.
AUDlENCE:
So it would be more cost-effective to have the workers share machines rather than get a whole new machine.
JON GRUBER:
"The key point is the machine costs twice as much, but the machine doesn't do twice as much."
The machine and the worker do the same thing.
The marginal rate of technical substitution is one.
"You're indifferent between one more machine and one more worker, but the machine cost twice as much as the worker."
Let's do one more.
I think that's all I have time for.
Let's do minus one ninth minus one over four.
Well the least common multiple of nine and four is thirty-six.
So that's equal to thirty-six.
So what's negative one ninth where we change the denominator from nine to thirty-six?
"Well, we multiply nine times four to get thirty-six."
We have to multiply the numerator times four as well.
"So we have negative one, so it becomes negative four."
Then minus one over thirty-six.
"Well to go from four to thirty-six, we have to multiply this fraction by nine, or we have to multiply the denominator by nine, so you also have to multiply the numerator by nine."
One times nine is nine.
"So this equals minus four minus nine over thirty-six, which equals minus thirteen over thirty-six."
I think that's all I have time for right now.
And I'll probably add a couple more modules.
But I think that right now that you might be ready to do the adding and subtracting module.
Have fun.
Now we are ready to begin talking about actual program optimizations and we begin with local optimizations.
"Local optimization is the simplest form of program optimization because it focuses on optimizing just a single basic block, so just one basic block and, in particular, there is no need worry about complicated control flow, we are not going to be looking at the entire method or procedure body."
Let's dive right in and take a look at a couple of simple local optimizations.
"If x is an integer valued variable And from here on, we'll assume that x has type-ins."
So let me just write that down.
We're going to assume that x has type-ins in all of our examples on this slide.
"Then the statement x=x+0, well that doesn't change the value of x."
Zero is the additive identity for +.
We're just going to assign x the value it currently has.
And so this statement is actually useless.
It can just be deleted from the program.
"Similarly, for x=x*1."
"Multiplying by one will not change the value of X, and so that statement can also be removed."
And in this case these are great optimizations because we actually save an entire instruction.
"Now, some statements can't be deleted, but they can be simplified."
Congratulations.
You've finally gotten through the discussion about the different parameters and the desired Googlebot behavior.
And now you can go back to your site and repeat this process for the different parameters that you have.
You don't have to do this for every single parameter.
"But just including a few, and specifying the right Googlebot behavior can really help with your crawl efficiency."
We're almost done.
But you might be asking one last question.
"Which is, ""What about multiple parameters in one URL?"" For example, ""sku equals 234 page equals three and sort by equals price"" etcetera."
How does URL parameters work when there are multiple parameter settings?
The answer is to remember that URL parameters is about crawling your site more efficiently.
So you can imagine that all URLs that we know about for your site.
"So if you're the Google store, all 380,000 URLS begin as eligible for crawling."
And then we work as a process of elimination.
Not inclusion.
So we take our knowledge of your site.
Combined by each of your settings in URL parameters to slowly weed away the URLs that shouldn't be crawled.
"Until at the very end, we have a smaller subset of good URLs."
To recap.
"If you're now more comfortable with the URL Parameters, please utilize this feature for more efficient crawling of your site."
You can start with specifying the parameters that do not change page content.
Those should be easier to do.
"And then after you have done that step, the next step is to specify parameters that change the page content."
"And remember, if you can't determine, don't guess."
"Please ""let Googlebot decide."""
"One more time, the sorts parameter."
"If the sorts parameter for your site never exists in a URL by default, then ""Crawl No URLs."""
"Or if site-wide, the same sort value is always used, then ""Crawl URLs with value x."" For ""Narrows"" if your ""narrows"" parameter causes non-useful filtering for searchers, like size or price, then you might select ""Crawl No"
"URLs."" Just be sure to double-check that none of your important pages will be affected."
"For ""specifies"" it's usually ""Crawl Every URL."" And the same applies to ""Translates"" and ""Paginates."""
Yay!
I think we've covered a lot of information about URL parameters.
Here are links to more resources if you want further help.
"There's some science behind it, but it's within a range of what we have historically done."
"We have looked at other properties that have a lot of page views, and much of the social networking things, for example."
And they don't monetize that well.
And they don't monetize nearly as well as text search.
"So we're unlikely to do major changes there, although we're trying a few things."
"The next--another way of asking your question is, where is the next source of revenue?"
"And the next source of revenue is the current business functioning better with better conversion, more traffic, more advertisers, which is our core business."
"The next, and adjacent, business, is a set of display businesses and an exchange that are being built as a consequence of the Double Click acquisition."
The display business is as large as the text search business.
It's relatively balkanized??
(30:39).
It's not a uniform in any particular way.
"The systems are complicated, the way the display ads are managed, is done, in many cases, by hand or by poor quality spreadsheets."
"So we see an opportunity to apply the Google magic, you know, the measurement and the scaling, in that business."
And that's probably the next big one. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Any other questions?
"Yep, right here."
We'll move beyond the first three rows at some point. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
Thank you.
I wanted to get your thoughts on Twitter.
"There's been a lot of discussion there that potentially it evolves as a real time search engine, and in an un-Google-like way, you haven't really responded with any sort of application or product there, outside of, maybe, Blogger."
How do you foresee that product in the next few years?
And is that a potential or a threat for Google? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
We're in favor of all of these new communications mechanisms.
Google just put up a Google Twitter site.
Google can tweet to you.
It's called At Google.
And so you can go ahead and listen to our ruminations as to where we are and what we're doing in 160 characters or
less.
"Speaking as a computer scientist, I view all of these as, sort of, poor man's email systems."
"In other words, they have aspects of an email system, but they don't have a full offering."
"So, to me the question about companies like Twitter is, do they fundamentally involve as sort of â€˜note' phenomena?"
What kind of.
What are some tips can you give people who are in that stage of the publication process?
"Well first of all although acceptance of the revision is not, is not guaranteed that we will see so in the letter."
Yeah.
"I think he should take that as, as encouraging."
Yeah.
In fact that had got has that first reviewing stage is really a good sign and you should work hard to.
Improve the paper so it will get accepted.
Yeah.
"And The First of all, either whatever the you know, first of all, list each comment that the reviewers make, and respond to that."
"It makes it much easier as an editor to, to, to be able to see that the author took into account every comment that e, that, that both reviewers, or as many reviewers were involved, made."
"And the editor will often make comments too, and list them, and respond to each one separately."
"And Either, whatever the comment says."
"Either fix it, fix what the problem is."
"Or explain why you, you don't think that, that criticism is, is valid or important."
Explain why you don't want to fix it.
"And make, you know, give a good argument for that."
Show And also please show the editor where you made the changes in the manuscript.
They'll.
"You know if someone says I just change th-, the method section to reflect this."
"That's sort of hard for us to find wh-, what exactly you did, so, either highlight the change, list the changes in, when you respond to the comments, either highlight them in the manuscript and say, you know, say where they occur, highlight them, or use track changes supply in addition to the, The version where you get rid of the track changes also provide the version that has track changes, so that the editor can see exactly what you did."
Yeah.
"Or sometimes, sometimes a paper will be sent out for further, review, further peer review."
"Sometimes the peer reviewers have really strong concerns, and I as an editor will say, will send it back to them and say did, did the author really satisfy your concerns about this?"
And be polite.
[laugh].
"Yeah, don't like he just said that."
"You know, that, that, oh, this, this reviewers stupid."
You know.
[laugh].
But he didn't really.
"We just say, oh, we thank the reviewers for their constructive criticisms."
He's going to drive down the price even more.
You can see it over here.
"If they increase quantity beyond this market quantity of 75, 37.5 each, if we go beyond that, the price that they would be selling at, at that quantity over there, is lower than the average total cost."
"You're going to be, the total economic, the average economic profit per unit is going to be negative."
There will be a total of negative economic profit.
Neither of them will want to produce more from this state either.
"All of a sudden in this topless state, holding others constant; if you hold A constant, B can't gain by changing his strategy, and if you hold B constant"
"A can't gain by changing his strategy, so we are, up here, in a Nash equilibrium."
This is a Nash equilibrium.
"Like the prisoner's dilemma, it was not the optimal state."
"The optimal state was here, but because they both wanted to cheat, they both wanted to do this one-upmanship, they both broke their contracts, they could end up in this state over here."
But this state is stable.
There's nothing holding the other party equal.
"There's nothing that they could do to change, to optimize."
"What they could do, and this is not what Nash applies to, they could say okay, we've been really ruining each others' business."
Let's go coordinate again and I'm going to decrease production if you decrease production.
"That is not, and they could maybe try to go back to this state, and that does not mean that this is not a Nash equilibrium because by coordinating again we're not holding the others constant."
We're saying I'm changing my strategy while you're changing your strategy.
Maybe only through another agreement they could go over here.
That still doesn't mean that this is not a Nash equilibrium.
This is a Nash equilibrium.
"If there's no coordination, if you hold one player constant, the other player cannot change their strategy, or change their production, for a gain."
Cameraman:
We are from God and to him we return.
Put him on his back.
Cameraman:
These are the mercenaries.
"First man, out of shot:"
These are the people he is using to help him.
He's been shot in the chest.
Another man:
"They wanted to burn him, disfigure him."
"Now here, you can use their attention to see your ad and take some action."
"Of course you need the human resources, the people, the talent to do that."
- It mostly depends on brains.
You don't need to build or to invest heavily in factories.
"- It could be an area where Portugal could invest in, and make a large return, without needing a very big investment in machines."
"- From the early stages, we decided to divide the company in business teams, without departments."
"There is no department of design, or department of development, ... all that stuff."
"All the teams are businessteams that have business people and technical people together, working for the same purpose and for the same team."
"So all you see around our office, is businessteams of 12-15 people maximum, working together in a circle shape."
So everyone works together.
- We got a digital label to work with us and we'll be on a compilation that has different bands from all over the world that play garage rock.
And we were selected to represent Portugal.
- My day job is in school.
I teach Portuguese to foreign learners.
- I'm a designer ... ... of machines.
- I'm an architect.
"- Wel, when I'm not playing in a band, I like to be a photographer."
- Portuguese are people with a high degree of imagination and a high degree of flexibility.
"Both of these aspects have helped us in building a good IT system, adapting it to the needs of our customers."
"- Centre of innovation, of technology."
"It's the centre of tradition, of history, of modernity, of wonderful people. of good food, of good weather."
Everything!
"Oh, Lisbon, it's one of the favourite cities for having international congresses."
So we are at the top.
"- So we're in a group, and there are several other companies there as well, tourism-connected or communication, and event-makers."
So it's all a big synergy of competences.
"It's easy, when you know what you're doing."
"And if you have time enough in advance to prepare all the details, because it's a business built on details."
"And to be prepared for all kinds of ""unexpected""."
So if you are already prepared for what you know is going to happen then you also have time and availabiity to take care of those things that you don't know.
"It's fingerspitzengefuhl, yes, that's for sure."
"This specific congress, as is the case for most of them, is marketed primarily through the website."
So thank you and thank you for listening.
(Applause)
"Hello, and welcome back to Introduction to Genetics and Evolution."
In the previous videos we looked at how to study the process of recombination.
And specifically how we can leverage recombination to actually map genes associated with diseases.
"And again, as I've said several times, we are looking for an association."
"Between alleles at markers, such as these hapmap SNP markers that we discussed, and a phenotype such as disease status."
That is essentially the what we're trying to do with genetic mapping.
"Now what we're gonna do in this video is, we're gonna actually try to map simple genetic traits."
So traits controlled by one gene that have a very large effect on that trait.
Relative to genetic markers [inaudible].
So.
We can actually use hat map markers just
like we use it for soft limitations in previous videos to map simple genetic [inaudible].
"So remember we did these problems using these three [inaudible] markers, a, b and c."
"And we did the case of the test cross with an individual that was heterozygous for all three, so it gave little a, big b, little b, big c, little c."
"Crossed to somebody who, who's homozygous."
"Little a, little a, little a, little b,"
"little c, little c, little c."
"Now we can imagine that A and B are snip markers with, you know, so they necessarily have two or more oleos, and that they have a known location in the genome."
Now what we can say now is maybe C is the disease gene.
"So what we're trying to actually do with a lot of genetic mapping, this isn't all of mapping but part of mapping, is to determine whether C, the diseased gene is between a certain pair of markers."
"And secondarily, about how far is it?"
"Like is it, for example, between A and B?"
"And if so, is it closer to A or is it closer to B?"
"Or is it off to one side, maybe out passed"
A and further away from B?
That is genetic mapping.
"So let's, let me illustrate this with an example."
I will be using concepts very much like what we did with [inaudible] mapping of genes.
Let's use cycle cell anemia.
"Now this disease is recessive, meaning you have to have two copies of the mutant type to exhibit the disease."
Let's pour some drops of methylated spirit in a bottle and spread them on the inside wall so that the methylated spirit well vaporise.
"Blow a lot of cigarette smoke into the bottle by using a straw, until the content becomes opaque."
"Light a match, and throw it in the bottle containing smoke and alcohol vapours."
Alcohol vapours burn instantly.
"Right after, there's no more smoke inside the bottle."
Alcohol combustion produces very hot gases which expand and escape through the bottle opening.
Smoke particles are carried away by gases that escape.
Smoke disappears instantly from the bottle.

TV FROM ANOTHER PLANET
TV FROM ANOTHER PLANET-OLEFOGH KRlKEBY-PHlLOSOPHY
"Welcome to ""TV from another planet""."
"My name is Martin Spang Olsen and yes, I'm from another planet."
"I am an alien sent on a ""mission impossible""."
I have in fact until 21.12 2012 to awaken the slumbering inhabitants of the earth and get them to take care of their self-made crises.
"21.12 2012 is, as you know expectence of the transition to the big change, the change of paradigm, in knowledge vision, as the ancient Mayan Indians talking about and it may well be the beginning of a new era, scary and a little exciting, especially for you perhaps, and I will therefore every week until 21.12 get visits by an expert in earth and space, and together we must try to identify and solve the world crises and today's crisis in the studio is philosophy."
Wisdom was a very popular concept in ancient greece.
"It was so popular that a man named Pythagoras said that he was ""Filosofía"" infact that he loved the goddess of wisdom, Sophia."
"So the philosophy was born and it was the beginning of a large number of schools from which all science stems from, but in time science was parted from philosophy and then personal development and spirituallity was parted from philosophy, and final death blow the philosophy got in the present which means we know all philosophers by heart but completely we forget to think for ourselves."
"People forgot that philosophy means ""love of wisdom"" and not just knowledge itself."
Q: what are the obligations of GAP up nowadays?
A:
"Gap is based on reach middle school and recently, we also open with universities."
"Our core is in Fortaleza, Sobrau, Joào Pessoa, and Moçorò."
"Gap exists to create a means by which the Church can exercise his vocation, exercising the gifts that we have received by the grace of God."
"Therefore, this passion allows us to to influence young people, which nowadays are continually bombarded by the sinful seductions of this modern era and help them maintain their fire for Christ."
This helps them a lot.
"So we're on the road with tent giving space to the work of Christ bearing witness of lives transformed, the recovery of those who have gone astray, and in rebellion to God."
Q: how long are you in business?
A:
By 12 years.
Q: how's the dialogue with the Church?
A: it is difficult.
We are sometimes hesitant.
"Unfortunately there are many churches where leaders are interested in other things, thus deluding their members ... so we are sometimes unsure in making the first step."
"Mostly when it comes to activities, sometimes distrust of us because sometimes it seems that we are depriving them of their members."
"There are pastors who admire what we do, and pray for us, but more often than not we are left alone."
"We have pastors that we depend on, obviously."
The Ministry is under the pastoral care of a church.
Q:
"In these 12 years, how many missionaries have maintained?"
"A: we have never supported anybody, only now we are sending the first missionary."
"But as far as preparation is concerned, we have prepared about 400 young people."
The fact is that our joy in Christ is giving the possibility to people to vote according to their vocation.
"This serves to keep people from what is ""Babel syndrome"", i.e. making a name and putting himself in competition with Christ."
"Then there are Christian missionaries movements at universities, ranging from Ministers that have been prepared by Gap."
This is something that makes us very thankful to God.
"Q: talking about you primarily, in these 12 years, you are devoted mainly to Gap?"
A:
"In these 12 years, many things are interlaced between my personal life and Gap."
"I have a doctorate in theology, and I am the Director of Gap, but"
I had to delay my studies due to commitments with Gap when we were at the beginning.
"And it's not like a rule book as much as guidelines so you can understand, this is why this will make your application better as you follow these various guidelines."
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
It's some kind of another instance of
line stuff up.
Don't reinvent a new way to do a list unless there's a really good reason to.
"Unless it really changes the character of your thing and there's a purpose, there's no reason to invent a new kind of scroll bar."
AUDlENCE:
"For the Android design style guideline, I was wondering what you guys foresee in terms of how its evolution is going to be over time, especially with phone devices, mobile devices."
"The screen size is getting larger, and a lot of times"
"I've heard that you want to keep things closer to your thumb, but with things like the Action Bar Menu and the"
"Overflow Menu, it's so far away on a large device that you no longer have the ability to easily do single hand actions."
ALEX FAABORG:
Yeah.
"Well, on large devices you have the radius of thumbs on the edges."
You want to definitely think about that.
"And the style guide, it's evolving as fast as the ecosystem and the devices are."
"We're constantly pushing out updates, considering new patterns, things like that."
So it's not like this sort of fixed thing that everyone has to adhere to as much as a kind of organic living document as we all collectively learn more.
AUDlENCE:
Thank you for the phone number slide.
I really like that.
It reminded me of one of the horrible failures of iTunes that I've just been annoyed by.
"If you have a date, and you format it with four numbers, a dash, two numbers, a dash, and two numbers more, that should be in ISO format for year, month, day, and no other order."
If you're having sort of the other random orders that some
"locales like, then use the slashes or whatever is sort of standardized for that."
And it helps users so much.
ALEX FAABORG:
"Yeah and especially thinking about your users, because you're going to have your own date format that you're familiar with, but knowing who you're designing for is really important."
AUDlENCE:
I do have a question this time.
Can you talk about tools a little bit?
"I mean, Photoshop is the obvious one, but what other tools can you talk about?"
"Very, very exciting challenge."
Absolutely.
"So many possibilities. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I think, at this point,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;with so many contestants,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; it's really about strategy, right? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yeah.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I think the banana&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is the devil in the box.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's really the only thing&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that you couldn't&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; put with the duck breast."
"I'll tell you what I want to keep, okay? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So Christine has an aide,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Under no circumstances can her aide interfere with the dish.
"I want to keep the kale,"
"I want to keep the sweet potato,"
I want to keep the duck.
"I think she's at a bit of a disadvantage, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;till they learn&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;how to work together.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;With the 18 now,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;this is your first chance&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to really scare&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and intimidate people too&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and be like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"""this is what I'm all about."""
- What would you do?
- I would start off by rendering &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that duck fat&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;off the duck breast.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I would blanch the kale and then sweat that off in duck fat, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bake the sweet potato,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and do a really nice&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;caramelized rhubarb&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with aged balsamic vinegar sauce."
"I am gonna pan-sear a duck breast with a sweet potato puree and sauteed kale in the duck fat, but the fact that there's no elimination on the end of this does help me feel a little more relaxed. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Take full advantage of your 60 minutes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One stunning dish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"At first, I saw that duck breast, and it was stunning, and I was really excited, but then I started thinking that I have a great dish that I thought"
I kind of want to hold onto and bring that out later in the competition.
So I'm thinking right now
"I just do what I know I can handle, which is a rhubarb little tartlet."
It's kind of like a crostada.
"I'm confident, because there's a few people who I think might be a little wet behind the ears, who might be trying to put too much on their plate."
"Yes, sir."
"Scott, what are you cooking?"
- A profiterole.
- What?
A larger profiterole with yams and a little bit of duck in there.
"This is, like, a serious competition."
I'm being very serious about this.
"A duck profiterole doesn't sound serious to me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Right, Samantha,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
A five-spice pan-seared duck breast of a sweet potato-rhubarb puree.
"Sweet potato and rhubarb, they go together?"
- I think so.
- Have you tasted before?
"So everybody is being slowly poisoning, with artificial coloring, artificial tastes, artificial flavoring."
Nothing will be artificial.
Everything in the future will be organically grown.
"The Venus Project calls for building cities in the sea, which would include research and learning centers dedicated to bettering the ecological conditions in our oceans."
We do have cities in the sea of many different designs.
The purpose of the city in the sea is an university at sea.
"It's to train marine scientists, marine biologists, and what they do is they restore the reefs, restore the damage."
The cities in the sea have units out away from the city.
It's called a wedge.
"It's made of concrete, and it's got cells in it."
And the concrete is towed out and mounted about a mile in front of an island.
"So, if a tsunami occurs, the waves are parted a mile out in heavy seas, you understand?"
That is how we deal with tsunamis.
Earthquakes are generally based upon pressures in the Earth that build up over time.
We will have sensors.
We can dig holes six miles deep today with mining equipment.
We could put sensors deep in the Earth that can let us know well in advance when the pressure build-up is occuring.
How much will it cost?
We don't have that problem in the future.
Do we have the resources to do it?
"Yes we do, and that is all that counts."
"The Venus Project's headquarters is located in a pristine area of south central Florida, USA, on a 9 hectare parcel of land."
The site features a research center and a number of other buildings designed by Mr. Fresco and Ms. Meadows.
"Within the structures are housed many models, illustrations, blueprints, and exhibits related to The Venus Project."
"The center runs informational workshops for the public, where participants are able to discuss Jacque Fresco's ideas face-to-face with him."
There will be many different types of buildings in the future.
Different people with different interests will want to select different types of buildings.
"But in most instances, most of the buildings are curvilinear."
They have curves or bent lines.
And that makes the building much stronger and uses far less material.
"So there would be lots of deck space on buildings so that people can relax, as you notice all the deck space on these buildings."
But people will pick a building that suits their profession and their interests.
Ole:
"That which we started about a decade ago, has begun at all business schools connecting art and economy and it is becoming more and more common, which is logical because where the hell would you draw the resources to be innovative from when you need to be innivativ all the time?"
"With violence and power there is almost only art left .. and as you begun with .. philosophy, right?"
Martin:
Both have done badly for some years
Ole:
They have but begins to turn back strongly
Martin:
"Well, you have some power now ... if I could pull some strings so you had A LOT of power in all parts of the world.. what would you do structurally, to face some of these crises?"
Ole:
I would make a society which is based on a lot smaller units
The Danish society I would base on a community with semi large municipalities
"That would run their own training concept, that would run their hospitals and would take responsibility for their young and old and completely developed their own alternative form of production"
Martin:
So the opposite of what we do today?
Ole:
Exactly the opposite of what we are doing today!
And then I would try in some way to stop tourism because it is the most CO2 consuming and time-wasting in the world but we can't do that because that would be totalitarianism and who should have the right to travel and what would a valid ticket be?
I myself am a delicate pensioner..
"No, I won't dwell on traveling"
But then I would...
"And I don't know how the hell I should solve it... but I would try to make the developing countries, such as Africa, proud of their culture so they with violence and force wouldn't try to take over our countries"
"like China and India are trying to... it creates an immense amount of problems on this globe in terms of resources and economic structuring and so on, right?"
Why the hell don't they hold on to their own way of life?
Ole:
"But if I had real power,,,,"
Martin:
"You will have, if you want..."
Ole:
Then would I influence them through their upbringing and their education to believe that what they stand for is really something that is worth a lot and that they should not take over our way of life
Martin:
But perhaps it has also something to do with food ...
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
"Oh, yeah"
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

"Hello, our final lecture on, Alzheimer's disease, is going to talk about animal models, and bio-markers, and therapeutic approaches, to Alzheimer's disease."
"Experimenters, in modern neuro science, have a series of, animal models, for"
Alzheimer's disease.
"Especially mice, especially mice that over produce, a p, p, amyloid, precursor protein."
And other mice that have mutations in pre-senilens.
Again especially with Alzheimer's disease associated mutations.
So there is some progress.
"And the, challenge, is to make, data from mice, relevant to those with people."
"Now, in general, what does one want to do, for Alzheimer's disease."
"Well, as for Parkinson's disease, which we'll discuss in the, next series, you would"
"like, to do two things, for Alzheimer's."
You would like to find a person with early stage Alzheimer's.
And stop that early stage Alzheimer's from progressing any further.
"But generally speaking it's the organisms in a particular place, plus the physical and chemical environment with which they're interacting."
And it's often a local example of some kind of biome.
Okay?
"So it could be a local chunk of tundra, a local chunk of rainforest, a pond."
It could be an upwelling area off Peru.
It could be an alpine forest.
It could be a lot of different things.
"And people study how energy flows, and so the paradigm basically, at least for things that are in the part of the planet that are driven by the primary productivity of plants, it starts with photosynthesis, and the annual production is usually determined by temperature and moisture; certainly for terrestrial ecosystems."
"Left out of this description is all of the chemosynthetic activity which occurs in deep, black, dark water at mid-ocean ridges, and which is occurring in the subterranean part of the biosphere that goes down- up to say five or ten kilometers, where there are bacteria that are living deep in the ground."
"And actually the pervasive influx of life, into the subterranean environment, is an important part in the biogeochemistry of the planet; that's not covered here."
"If we look around by, just by surface area, the planet's about 65% open ocean; it's about 5% continental shelf; desert's about 5%--that's extreme desert, okay, that's just about nothing on the surface; semidesert, so Sahel, that kind of area, about almost 3½, 4%; 3% tropical rainforest; and so forth."
"The idea here is you can take the planet and you can define different categories of the way things live on it, just by surface area, and break it down, and it looks like this."
"So here, if you were just to look at that, you would say, ""Well, open ocean, continental shelf, desert and rainforest are the main biomes on the planet."""
That's just by surface area.
"If you look at net primary production per square meter, you get a totally different view."
Okay?
"So this is just by surface area, and this is by primary production per square meter."
Look at how lousy the open oceans are.
Open oceans are deserts.
Why are open oceans deserts?

No fresh water.
Prof:
What?
Student:
No fresh water.
Prof:
"No, it's not that there's no fresh water."
What do you need if you're going to make an ecosystem productive?
Student:

Prof:
"What I mean by that is that, a student can start here, do the first two years of university education, and then move on for the third and fourth year at the university, attain the bachelor's degree."
Most community colleges have articulation agreements with these institutions.
So it's a seamless process.
And it's the same degree in the end.
"The difference, however, is to the international students' advantage."
"Because you get the associate degree in the first two years, and you have a year of optional practical training available to you."
"You get the second degree, the bachelor's degree, and you have another year of optional practical training."
"So two work permits, you might say, for two whole years in the United States."
"That student, with that language ability and experience with the education, going back to their homeland for work has terrific opportunities that the student that stayed will never have."
So that's one of many.
"The other, of course, is the value proposition."
They are much less expensive.
"NOVA is 1/3 the price of the nearest university, which is a very good one."
And that's probably the least expensive of the universities around.
So already we're talking about one whole third of the tuition price.
"A community college has smaller classes, teachers that are not preoccupied with research."
"They are engaged with the student, one-on-one most of the time."
There are supportive student services that help the students adapt to the United States.
"And writing centers and tutors, all which are free here, are what the student can use to kind of help with their studies."
"So you've got student clubs, as well, associations, so forth, that the student can, here, become a better-prepared university student while they're at the community college, all for less expense."
So that's just part of the picture.
But I think it's an important part.
PATRlCIA GORDON:
We have international student counselors.
They're available for them throughout their two years or if they're here longer.
We have a career counselor.
And we have a transfer counselor.
"And all the faculty, really, are available."
That's the uniqueness of a community college.
The classrooms are small.
The faculty are available.
"Students writing essays to transfer to four-year schools, faculty, staff, counselors are all available to advise them, review their essays."
"That is this treachery, the hipocracy, we are to avoid."
Imitation side.
Which is not proper and is going in the name of proper.
"That is dangerous, we must, we are to avoid that."
We are to come in connection with the truth.
With the reality.
Unto [dim??] also ready.
"Not any [passinarly??], imitationary."
"Our dealing will be sincere, true, and we must come in touch with the truth."
The thruthful result we may expect.
Truth is independent.
It is not subservient to anything else.
We shall have to come in connection with truth anyhow.

UK Youth Parliament Make Your Mark 2012
Want to have a voice?
Want to have a say?
Want to Make Your Mark?
The UK Youth Parliament is coming together to fight your corner and tackle the biggest issues facing young people today.
But we need your help
Run by young people for young people the UK youth parliament gives opportunities to 11 - 18 year olds to use their voice to have an influence on the decisions which affect them members are elected up and down the country by you to represent you its not about party politics its about campaigning on the issues which matter to you this November members of youth parliament are going to take over the house of commons who chooses the issues to be debated?
Simple.
You
Last year the UK youth parliament carried out a nationwide pole of over 65 thousand young people and you told us what your top 5 issues were across the country.
Too often it seems to me that we are happily accepted as adults
When it comes to parting with our pounds but treated like kids when it comes to having our say in matters that affect us
The cost of public transport is forever rising and it's unreliable
It costs me £16 a week to get to work and twice this week i've been late because of public transport and that is catching two buses that are earlier than i need
If we're expected to use public transport and lower emissions then we should be able to afford it
lowering costs of transport would also make it more accessible to people who are poor
Members of the UK youth parliament have been debating voting on which of these top 5 issues will become a priority campaign for the coming year
Make public transport cheaper better and accessible for all was a national campaign for the previous year
"However, most system leaks are small."
"While they cannot be detected by the naked eye, small leaks are the"
leading cause of poor A/C performance.
"Fortunately, small leaks can be easily corrected using the Interdynamics R134a UV Leak Detector and"
Sealer Kit.
"The kit contains one can of direct charge leak detector dye, which is good for five applications, along with a can of direct charge"
leak sealer.
Also included in the kit is a UV pen
"light and pair of UV fluorescent safety glasses, allowing even the smallest leaks to be quickly detected."
"Before using the kit, identify the"
low-side service port in the A/C system.
"Depending on the vehicle, the low-side port will be located on the accumulator or mounted on the large diameter line between the compressor and the evaporator."
Remember to always wear safety glasses and a pair of mechanics' gloves before working on the system.
Now remove the service port cap and then start the engine and set the A/C controls to maximum cooling.
"Next, remove the cap from the can of leak detector dye and shake the can vigorously."
"While holding the can upside down, place the direct charge nozzle over the low-side port and hold for five seconds."
This will allow one application of dye to be injected.
Now replace the service port cap and allow the engine to run with the A/C on for at least ten minutes in a well ventilated area.
This will give the dye adequate time to circulate.
Driving the vehicle for at
least five miles is another acceptable method for circulating the dye.
"Before checking for leaks, turn the engine off."
"Now, with your UV safety glasses on, shine the pen light around fittings, along metal lines and hoses, and the connections at the rear of the compressor."
The presence of dye in any of these areas indicates that a leak exists.
"To seal the leak, add the leak sealer through the low-side service port with the engine running and the A/C controls set to maximum cooling."
Continue to inject the sealer until the can is completely empty.
"Ok, i start to record"
Where are you Faiq?

THlS IS JUST FOR SUBTlTLE TEST. :- HNROSDI (amara.org)
This is the border region of Uganda with Kenya.
A remote area inhabited by communities whose livelihoods depend on live stock
It would be devastating.
"Scott, one step forward, please."
"Yes, chef."
We're disappointed.
"Luckily for you, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;there were two dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;worse than yours.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Back on your station, please."
"Yes, chef. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Ryan, Samantha,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;one of you has just cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; their last dish in this competition."
My dish looks ten times better than his dish.
How is this even possible?
"Even though my dish might have been uglier in presentation, it was still edible."
"The person leaving the competition &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that cooked the worst dish...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I just wanted to say&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that I am definitely not ready to go home yet, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and you were right.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The hero of this dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; was the duck, and, out of the two of us, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I would say that the duck&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; was better executed by me."
I don't care. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And you guys can't eat&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;raw duck.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
No begging.
"You're in this competition competing, not judging."
Let's get that right.
Have some respect for your fellow contestants.
The person leaving the competition &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the worst dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in our first mystery box challenge &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Announcer) The judges have already singled out the two worst dishes.
"Out of the two of us,"
I would say that the duck was better executed by me.
No begging.
"(Announcer) And now, for the first time, someone will be stripped from their apron, and sent home from a mistery box challenge."
The person leaving the competition &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the worst dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;belongs to&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;...
Samantha. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please take your apron off&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and place it on your station.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're leaving&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm definitely sad to leave the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen this early.
"I didn't think my dish was the star of the challenge, but I didn't think it was the loser of the challenge."
It was definitely a learning process.
"It has given me more zeal for my passion, and is not gonna stop me."
"I don't mean to be a hater, but, man, come on,"
"Ryan, for him to throw Samantha under the bus like that, was a [Bleep] bitch move."
"Ryan, back on your station."
"(Becky) You can never feel safe here, and I think that that's exactly what they were trying to tell us, so you better be bringing your a-game every single day. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Winning every challenge,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; every pressure test, results to so many advantages &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"And today, the glory does belong to somebody, because their dish stood out &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;above their competition.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
There are like 2500 jobs that.
Can't even possibly do them.
"See them at project per, oops, per capital growth rate for Medicare spending, so, you're on your way controlling fro the number of people in Medicare."
"If the predicted growth rate exceeds the target, iPad will develop a set of proposal to reduce the Medicare spending."
"The HHS, that's Health and Human Service must implement the proposals unless [inaudible] adopts equally effective alternative."
"So basically, this going to affect unless Congress acts."
"So, no additional legislation needed."
To make these proposals go in and you have fifteen wise men and women giving you the best ideas.
"So, starting in January twenty-eighth, being the target is GDP per capita plus one%."
What have we been doing in terms of growth over the last 40 years?
Gdp plus two.
"This cuts back rate in half, remember that yellow, I think it was the yellow line we had right at the start."
That was cutting the rate in half.
"So, pretty effective."
Congress can overrule only if it's pact by both houses.
With the majority.
"The proposal include any recommendation to rush in health care raise revenues for medicare beneficiary premium, increase medicare beneficiary co-sharing including deductibles, co-shares and co-payments or otherwise restrict benefits to modi fy eligibility."
"So you can't say well, we cannot exclude certain procedures to get this target."
You basically have to get more efficient care to hit this target.
"And by the way, hospitals are excluded for the first period of time because they supposedly gave a lot of."
Of cross savings in that adjustment that we described earlier.
Just recently the [inaudible] committee approved [inaudible] that would eliminate the health force independent payment advisory board.
The bill could be considered by the full house as early as next week.
That's why it's in the news so Congress putting in the bill and actually the President insist that into bill because Peter convinced them it was as fail safe for cost control.
Congress hates the idea.
Why does Congress. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Take the idea about re-election.
"Yeah, why is Congress hate the idea of the iPad?"
"Of this independent [inaudible] and Advisory Board saying, here are changes and if you don't. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [inaudible]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Congress is giving up power, right?"
Some other boards doing it.
It's basically a vote of no confidence in Congress.
You guys can't do the right thing.
"So, we're going to have this independent board."
We know it's not a sink vertex cause we're assuming there aren't any.
So there's an outgoing arc so let's follow it.
"We get to some other node, by assumption there's no sink vertex so this isn't a sink vertex."
So there's an outgoing arc.
"So let's follow it, we get to some other node."
"That also has an outgoing arc, let's follow that, and so on."
So we just keep following outgoing arcs.
"And we do this as long as we want, because every vertex has at least one outgoing arc."
"Well, there's a finite number of vertices."
Right?
"This graph has, say, N vertices."
"So, if we follow N arcs, we're gonna see N plus one vertices."
"So, by the pigeon hold principle, we're gonna have to see a repeat."
Right?
"So, if N plus one vertices has only N distinct vertices, we're gonna see some vertex twice."
"So, for example, maybe after I take the outgoing arc from this vertex."
I get back to this one that I saw previously.
"Well, what have we done, what happens when we get a repeated vertex?"
By tracing these out going arcs and repeating a vertex we have exhibited a directed cycle.
And that's exactly what we're assuming doesn't exist.
We're talking about directed acyclic graphs.
"So, put differently, we just proved that a vertex with no sink vertex has to have a directed cycle."
So a directed acyclic graph therefore has to have at least one sink vertex.
"So, here's how we use this very simple observation now to compute a topological order of a directed acyclic graph."
Well let's do a little thought experiment.
Suppose in fact this graph did have a topological ordering.
Let's think about the vertex that goes last in this topological ordering.
"Remember, any arc which goes backward in the ordering is a violation."
So we have to avoid that.
We have to make sure that every arc goes forward in the ordering.
"Now, any vertex which has an outgoing arc, we better put somewhere other than in the final position, all right?"
"So the node that we put in the final position, all of its arcs are gonna wind up to all of its outgoing arcs are gonna wind up going backward in the topological ordering."
And if you get it early enough.
"Why, that's a remarkable change in the time course of the disease, if you can stop it from progressing."
The way to stop it from.
Progressing early enough is either to have a very good neurological or psychiatric diagnosis.
Or to have a so called bio marker.
"That is an objective measurement either bio chemical or physiological that tells you, yes this person has very early stage Alzheimer's without a doubt."
Now we are not far along on either of those challenges.
Some of the new data suggest that.
"If you take measurements of the tau, remember the tau protein, and phosphorilated tau, and of a beta 42."
"And look at the individual, values, or the ratios among these."
"You can get a fairly early diagnosis, of Alzheimer disease."
"Another, fruitful approach, has just been approved by the FDA, the US Food and Drug Administration."
"It's a molecule, called Florbetapir."
It seems to bind to amaloid plaques that contain beta APP.
Here's the structure and here is the F18.
"Which emits beta particles, that's why it's called Florbetapir."
"So here is a typical positron emission tomography. a person who, does not have Alzheimer 's disease."
"Very few plaques, very few places, plaque places for Florbetabir to bind."
"Here's a person who, by other criteria, does have Alzheimer's disease."
"Clearly, there is a lot more binding, of Florbetapir."
"So, one needs to be extremely careful about these scans, as they're called."
And here are the words that the manufacturer uses.
A negative scan.
"Sparse to no neuritic plaques, inconsistent with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at the time the image is made."
So probably that patient does not have Alzheimer's disease.
"Since the patient goes to a neurologist in the first place for cognitive impairment among other complaints, then that cognitive impairment is not Alzheimer's."
"Now, of course, one needs to be very careful and say that a positive scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid plaques."
And that some patients with these kinds of plaques also have Alzheimer's.
But.
"There are examples of people with other types of neurological conditions, as well as older people with normal cognition who show positive scans."
"So, the manufacturer says very carefully, Florbetapir is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations."
"More than this, we can't say at the moment."
It's right here...
To be precise:
"Right there, in Espalha Brasas, ..."
"Lisbon, of course."
"- I believe, wherever you are in Europe, you're at the centre."
- This is a restaurant that is based on simple and traditional Portuguese cuisine.
- We have had a tradition for centuries:
The codfish... ... dried in the sun with salt.
And some centuries ago that would be the way to keep it all year long.
And that would be the food for most Portuguese who could not afford something else.
- I think Lisbon is the centre of Europe... ...
"With the internet you have no boundaries, we have the weather and the nice people, so we can conquer the world."
"There is a challenge in terms of culture, because we don't have a very entrepreneurial culture."
- The centre of Europe is right where you are.
Our signature is:
'Ideas that happen'.
"So it's not only having the ideas, but also the possibility of making them happen."
I started a house of the entrepreneurs.
"It's a place where entrepreneurs can get the resources they need, the people they need, the support they need."
"- The centre of Europe is split between our heritage, common culture and our hearts."
"Especially with what I call the ""natural dances"","
"like Argentinian tango, salsa... , where you have actually true improvisation, you add another element to the mix."
"And that is that besides the interpretation of the music, you also have the combination with your partner, in a free way, where from simple mechanics you create all these things that you see."
- I think the centre of Europe is where the soul and heart of Europe is.
It took several years to convince Portugal that it was worthwhile to invest in artificial intelligence.
"And also because Portugal did not have a very good image in technology abroad, it was also very difficult for us to convince customers in other countries to go ahead with us."
"Of course it's also very difficult for a computer to have the intelligence to cope with complexity, and that's where artificial intelligence comes in:"
To take better advantage of the resources of the company.
"And that was the main goal for Siscog, our company that develops software for the transportation domain."
"- In internet, you should take advantage of when you have the attention of the customer, to make him perform an action."
"In offline, it's difficult because the media and the action are separate things."
"You see TV, and then you go to the shops."
I have to give something to somebody this is also as much a need as I have to receive something.
"So there is a need, whatever kind of need."
"Needs may be diverse, accordingly relationships could be diverse."
"Now, the moment we form a relationship wanting to fulfill a certain need and if that need is not fulfilled then relationships will go bad."
"For whatever purpose for which we have formed a relationship, if those needs and those expectations are not fulfilled, relationships will go bad."
"We may claim many things, but when your expectations are not fulfilled it does go bad, isnt it?"
"So instead of doing too much wishy-washy about it, its best to look at it straight and see what is it and how we need to handle it?"
The needs within a human being have risen because of a certain sense of incompleteness.
People are forming relationships to experience a certain sense of completeness within themselves.
"When you have a good relationship with someone dear to you, you feel complete."
When you dont have that you feel incomplete.
Why is this so?
"Because this life, this piece of life is a complete entity by itself."
Why is it feeling incomplete?
"And, why is it trying to fulfill itself by making a partnership with another piece of life?"
Fundamental reason is that we have not explored this life in its full depth and dimension.
"Though that is the basis, there is a complex process of relationships as such."
"There are expectations, and expectations and expectations and expectations."
(Laughs)
The expectations that most people are creating are such that there is no human being on the planet who could ever fulfill those expectations.
"If you especially this man-woman relationship, the expectations are so much that even if you marry a god or a goddess, they will fail you."
(Laughs)
"Because the expectations are so unrealistic that nobody, no human being can ever fulfill that."
"And unable to understand the expectations or the source of expectations, nobody can fulfill the expectations."
"But if you understand what is the source of this expectation, you could form a very beautiful partnership."
"Are you ok for, you are getting very serious with relationships"
On a certain day
"Jack and Jill now let me use,"
I am trying to just culturally change the joke.
(Laughs)
"Jack and Jill were going up the hill,"
and
"And since so many communities made this choice independently, it must have been a good choice."
Right?
Even though it meant less music and skoodlypooping.
Thanks Thought Bubble.
"All right, to answer that question,"
let's take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture.
Advantage: controllable food supply.
"You might have droughts or floods, but if you are growing the crops and breeding them to be heartier, you have a better chance of not starving."
"Disadvantage: in other to keep feeding people as the population grows, you have to radically change the environment of the planet."
"Advantage: specially if you grow grain, you can create a food surplus, which makes cities possible and also the specialization of labor."
"Like, in the days before agriculture, everybody's job was foraging."
And it took about a 1000 calories of work to create a 1000 calories of food.
And it was impossible to create large population centers.
"But if you have a surplus, agriculture can support people not directly involved in the production of food."
"Like for instance, trade's people, who can devote their lives to better farming equipment, which in turn makes it easier to produce more food more efficiently, which in time makes it possible for a corporation to turn profit on this 99 cent double cheeseburger."
"This is delicious, by the way."
"It's actually terrible, it's very cold."
"And I wish, I had not eaten it."
"I mean, can we just compare what I was promised to what I was delivered?"
"Yeah, thank you."
This is not that.
"Some would say that large and complex agricultural communities that can support cities and eventually inexpensive meat sandwiches are not necessarily beneficial to the planet, or even to its human inhabitants."
"Although, that it is a little of a bit tough argument to make, coming to you as a"
"I am, in a series of ones and zeros."
Advantage: agriculture can be practiced all over the world.
"Although, in some cases it takes extensive manipulation of the environment, like, you know, irrigation, controlled flooding, that kind of thing."
Disadvantage: farming is hard.
"So hard in fact that one is tempted to claim ownership over other humans and have to till the land on your behalf, which is the kind of non-ideal social order that tends to be associated with agricultural communities."
So why did agriculture happen?
Wait!
I haven't talked about herders.
"Herders, man!"
That's similar to the bilexical dependencies of our earlier lexicalized
PCFGs.
But we don't want to use that as our only source of information partly because lexical information is so sparse.
And there are several other good sources of information.
So let's just go through those.
"So one is the distance between the head and the dependent, And if you look at this picture, what you'll see is that most dependencies are short."
They're with nearby words.
There are a couple of exceptions.
"So, this dependency here is a pretty long one."
But most of them are pretty short.
"Other sources of information are, what is the intervening material?"
"So, in general, dependencies don't cross over verbs, and commonly they don't cross over punctuation."
"Some exceptions, commas are quite often crossed over."
"So, looking at the words in between can give information about whether a dependency is likely or not."
A final source of information is looking at the valency of heads.
"And that's saying, for a particular word, what kind of dependents does it typically take?"
"So a word like the typically takes no dependents on the left and no dependents on the right, as in this case here."
"On the other hand, if you have a word that is, say, a noun, it will take dependents like adjectives and articles on the left."
"But it won't take those kind of dependents on the right, though can take other kinds of words as dependents on the right."
"For example, take prepositional phrase modifiers or relative clauses as dependents on the right."
So you can develop a quite rich typology of what kind of dependents words take.
Okay that should give you a better sense of what dependency representations look like and it's the big picture of how we go about parsing with them.
In the next segment we'll introduce a concrete algorithm for dependency parsing.

"Happy Birthday, Hessian Theater academy,"
We wish you all the best for the next 10 years!
This is a ground plan of the building in which we are.
"We entered here, at number 15,"
"Then straight ahead through the corridor,"
"At the left, the foyer with the works from the design school,"
"Then in the corridor, the durational performance of María Fernández Aragón, ""Voice over"""
"And the door which you see here, this is the door through which you've just entered the room,"
It's going up when we know about health care prices.
"They got faster than regular prices, okay?"
"Healthcare inflation is two percent or more above underlying inflation in the economy, that's why healthcare gets more and more and more guinea pig, right?"
"So, if you keep this rational rising with inflation but healthcare cost are rising faster than inflation, what is that mean?"
More people are in the [inaudible] bracket unless.
Down evermore.
This is a way of either capturing more people in there or putting even more downward pressure on the premiums going forward.
Section 3403 is the famous IPAB.
"For those who actually read the New York Times cover to cover, the IPAB is in the news these days because the Republicans are trying and they actually had a lot of Democrats trying to get rid of the IPAB."
This is an independent fifteen member payment.
Board.
Tax with presenting Congress with the comprehensive of proposal to reduce excess cost growth and improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.
"So, my former boss, Peter Orsack said, we need a process to make sure that is [inaudible] is going up, we have a process to keep it down regardless to what kind of course it does, there is a full proof method that will get us cost controlled."
We have an existing thing called the MedPAC.
The
Medical Payment Advisory Commission.
"And the problem with that is it makes great recommendations, it got these beautiful nice reports and what does Congress do with them?"
"Either grind them up for, you know, landfill or just collect dust."
"That was never implement, well-starting p roposals."
"This is [inaudible] we're just going to take those basically, take those proposals and make that binding [inaudible] in healthcare inflation or Medicare has exceeds some, fixed them up."
"That way, we can be sure that we'll control cost."
"So, basically it's a."
Of the
Medpak which advise the Congress.
Medpak doesn't have the power [inaudible] so
"Peter said, well, let's get basically a Medpak like organizations."
The power to act even if Congress doesn't act.
Kind of like the base causing commission so if
"Congress is paralyzed like it does or does it want to actually put in some of these control, we happen go in automatically."
So members are appointed by the President and subject to send the confirmation.
"This issue with sending confirmation, it's"
lunacy.

Have had technologies that would liberate the world from the slavery of our current
Macroeconomic system.
We were impressed when we came upon Dr. Greer and his brilliant team.
They'd been working on groundbreaking ideas over the past decade and pushing a truth that not many people either know about or are scared to discuss.
So we thought to ourselves
This is a right topic to  document and expose in a film.
After contacting Dr. Greer we found out he had bigger and better plans.
This is a film that is the culmination of 22 years of research and discovery and journey in Space and time and consciousness  and it's going to be the most significant release of information on the UFO subject and new Energy that has ever occured.
The documentary film is just the tip of the iceberg but it's a crucial step toward moving forward in finding new technology and lifting the veil of secrecy blinding the masses.
There's a lot of talk about 2012
Well this is the year for this to happen.
But it isn't about the end of the world
It's about the end of an old and corrupt order in the world
And the beginning of an entirely new civilization on Earth and that civilization on earth will be one that has free energy abundance social justice and Interplanetary capabilities.
We need all of your support

This is why we the people are going to make this film
The internet is our home.
"Each person is going to co-produce this with us, it'll be funded by all of us together"
It'll be distributed by all of us together.
"We want to have a thousand screenings, events and premiers"
But this is an undertaking that requires a large group of people.
So please spread the word
I hope you will help us
I hope you will join us
I hope you will network this information of this campaign to raise the funds for this film to everyone on your email list every organization you know

"But Berlioz trolled Paganini by wrote him a symphony  ""Harold in Italy"" instead of a concerto"
Paganini was so mad that he didn't play the  piece and not even attend the premiere.
The viola has missed the opportunity to rise again.
After many springs and winters until the 20th century in England has appeared our father of viola Tertis
He fully understand that the problem that the  viola doesn't have any good pieces he can counted as the first person who asked and  paid many composers to write songs for the viola
"Therefore, formally speaking, the viola starts it's development from the 20th century"
Talking about 20th century
It's hard to not mention Primrose
He is like the viola version of Paganini
He had already play all Paganini's Caprices with his viola
He started playing as violist before playing the viola but he then never touches the violin anymore
He had say something gold
I personally can't agree more with his words (and that's what I think)
"You are more then welcome to jealous us, violists."
The viola seemed like being ignored for ages but after watching this video now you know what viola is what difficulties it was facing
Viola has a fast development especially it has just started from the 20th century
"Like vegetables, they were just sides in many dishes now they are treat on their own like salad and more!"
Dear fellow violists
If there are people asking you what instrument do you play
"You shall say ""the viola"" very firmly"
Like a boss
If he then ask what's the differences between the violin and the viola? then you can act like a boss and say
"The viola has a nice sound, it is just  different from (or better then) the violin"
"Now, the 1st episode of the E-symphony has now come to an end"

This is important because information persists but it's important to have information on the life cycle and it's important to have proper destruction policies.
I remember working for a company that was dealing with sensitive information a number of years ago.
And.
"They were, discarding PC's, and not zeroing out hard drives."
You may have seen a number of television documentaries or have read about instances where sensitive hard drives have ended up in the hands of the wrong people.
Even when we see issues of dumping technology.
In other countries.
"Loan of equipment or donation of, of aged equipment."
"There are markets for tech savvy folks in countries like that for hard drives that have not been erased, and may have sensitive information."
And then of course you want to give consideration to firing or termination processes.
"You need to have procedures, you need to know how you're going to separate somebody."
And how to deal with disgruntled employees.
Because therein lie seeds of dissatisfaction that might cause people to do damage to corporate information or to steal information that is sensitive.
So I'd like to refer you to special publication NlST-850.
That clearly recognizes the people factor as the weakest link.
And this is a standard that talks about effective security awareness training.
While this is a.
An equal module in the model that I've been using to describe information assurance in organizations.
"To you, this term, it's often an overlooked aspect of the information planning process."
So it's important to note that to be effective.
"An awareness event or, or training program should be designed to a specific audience."
"You wouldn't want to deliver the same training to a technical audience that you would give to general staff, for example."
And you want to be certain that you build the training around a clear message.
And that you have specific outcomes in mind.
This is good pedagogy regardless.
But it's specifically true with security and awareness training.
Because employees are saturated by company messages all of the time.
"And you don't want the reaction, oh well here they come again."
You really want to have a clear message.
"And you, you want to understand what outcomes you want."
And you want to get their attention.
So they don't think this is just another flavor of the week.

"If we treat an encryption function--as the one in GSM--as something that takes a message, produces an encrypted message, and it consumes a key to perform that."
There are different ways in which you can make this resistant against time-memory trails.
Three different mitigations.
"First, you can make the message unpredictable."
Sounds obvious.
Why would you encrypt something predictable?
"But a lot of systems do just encrypt a whole stream of data, some of which is encrypted."
Something is worth protecting.
GSM mixes the two.
[Dave]
All of these attacks you know some--because of the GSM protocol-- there are some messages that are very easy to guess. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [Carson]
Exactly.
[Dave]
And you know what they are and can you those in this attack.
"To exchange a text message, for instance, between the base station and your phone, somewhere between 20 and 40 messages are exchanged, only one of which has the actual text message content."
Another one may have some unpredictable set of information.
All the rest is just management information--encrypted though-- and that management information is usually--
[Dave]
Does it make sense as one solution to not encrypt the management information.
[Carson]
"Clear, yeah."
There's a standard extension that suggests exactly that.
But basically the whole ecosystem would have to change to accommodate for that.
"Currently, it's just the encryption is switched on at some point and everything thereafter is encrypted, be it predictable or not."
"There are measures, though, to make predictable messages more randomized to create some wiggle room for how you send a message."
"That's currently being deployed--not in all networks, though."
I've not seen--one of the two American networks I don't think has it.
You need to know the base station is understanding if you change the protocol like that.
"The base station would have to change to go all the way of making all messages unpredictable, but even changing the base station controllers, bigger installations that control dozens of base stations that control dozens of base stations would do the job, and those are usually software updateable, because they have to accommodate for usually faster connections all the time."
The middle part (alto) is mostly for extend harmonization
Imagine a string group is like a hamburger.
The violins are the beef. the cellos are the bread. the violas are like vegetables.
Not the most important but weird without them.
Continue with the metaphor or the burger.
Improve the taste of the burger means improvement of the ingredients
"Breads have similar taste anyways. so people will mostly focus on the beef, so vege-like violas are ignored"
Now you can cook beef in different ways. even breads can served with butter or soup
Greens?
Eat them raw.
This cycle that happens over and over centuries  makes the situation now viola is facing
There are lots of composers in the world who loves and plays the viola
Here are some examples
Our first example is J.S. Bach
His 5th son is also a composer
He recalled that his dad loves the viola
"Well, J.S. Bach is the father of music and he knows how to play all the strings and keyboard instruments but he sits the viola section when he plays the string quartet"
"He composed 6 string quintet with these quintets, he added the 2nd viola  to enhance the texture of the pieces"
Bach said he loves the sound and the volume of the viola
Our 2nd example is Mozart
Mozart is well known for writing nice sections for violas in his quartets
He wrote a Violin and Viola concerto to his mom
During the premiere of this concerto
Mozart plays the viola and let his dad plays the violin
This is not because the viola part is easier
Both parts have many similar passages and difficulties
But Mozart still chose to play the viola there is no evidence to prove why he did that so I think Mozart secretly loves the viola
There are more famous composers who had play the viola
"However, there are no famous violists so there is no composers to write songs for the viola then there is no pieces to train violists as a result, there is no famous violists"
The theory is similar when you find a job the job requires you to have experiences but you have no job to gain experiences
Paganini is known as one of the most virtuous violinists
"He did try swap from playing the violin to the viola and he knows that there is no good pieces for viola so he paid a composer, Berlioz, to write him a  concerto to show off his viola skills"
We hope for better biomarkers.
"Again, heterozygote advantage does not seem to exist for Alzheimer's so we'll leave that go until we get to depression and let's look now at therapeutic approaches."
"Suppose a person is diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's, what can be done?"
"Well the molecules that are in the clinic now, and that are the molecules of choice, are the"
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors because neurons that make acetylcholine.
Are among the first to die in Alzheimer's disease.
They're in the basal forebrain.
"And therefore, if one can prolong the life of acetylcholine by inhibiting its breakdown by acetylcholinesterase."
One has more acetylcholine.
"And the lack, relative lack of cholinergic neurons does not matter much. the three that are on the market are."
Somewhat effective.
"Interestingly enough, galantamine, may also be, a positive, allosteric modulator, of alpha four beta two receptors, so that, it could be acting, both, by preventing the breakdown, of acetylcholine, and by enhancing its action."
"Also on the market is one NMDA inhibitor, called Memantine, and the thinking here is that."
Excessive activity at NMDA receptors may be excitotoxic.
"And so, it may be possible to slow down the time course of Alzheimer's using Mementine."
"For both of these types of medications, the slowing down is statistically significant. but."
We need very much better drugs.
"So, because we've talked about that the various Secretase sites in beta APP, you can appreciate that."
Beta-secretase inhibitors would also be useful if one could develop them with no side effects and specific action.
There have been other drugs with unknown mechanisms that failed for Alzheimer's trials.
Gamma secretase inhibitors might also be useful.
The one that got the furthest along in clinical trials also failed.
One could think about targeting the protease complex with notch-sparing gamma secretase inhibitors.
Remember the.
"Probable natural function of gamma secretase is to, protealize Notch."
So you'd need to develop a gamma secretase inhibitor which allows Notch proteolysis to go ahead.
But blocks cleavage of the APP.
"And, other gamma secretase drugs."
"Modulators that shift the proportion of a beta peptides, in favor of shorter, less harmful, peptides. have been conceived, but not brought to the clinic."
"And then there's the topic of antibodies against a, beta APP, or, A-Beta."
And the three that had been tried so far in clinical trials are listed here.
The have been largely unsuccessful.

"So, this is different from organizational"
learning where internal efficiency and improvement is the focus.
Resource dependence theory is primarily focused on relations with the external environment rather than on one's within the firm and as such resource dependence theory views organizational conditions in a particular way.
"It presumes there is an environmental determinism, which means that an organizational behavior can be explained by looking at the organisations context such as such as external constraints and control."
It also assumes that an organizations' specific goals are contingent on dependence relations that keep it alive.
"So, these are the relationships that secure its necessary resources."
"Within this context of resource dependencies, the firm's general goal is to find greater certainty."
"So relationships that persist, and are clear, and advantageous, as well as autonomy."
So they're looking for relations that render them independent or in control.
"Last, organizations are viewed as responding to resource dependencies in at least two ways."
"They can either comply and adapt to these dependencies, or they can avoid and manage them."
So what are the core features of resource dependence theory?
One of the most important features of the theory concerns the resources involved and how they establish dependencies.
"To identify resource dependencies, it helps to ask, what are the key resources in an environment?"
Who controls the resources in question?
Resources come in a variety of forms and they're valued differently depending on their importance and availability.
And they differ in terms of who has discretion and control over them.
"There are various types of resources that firms depend on, such as physical materials."
These might be actual materials the organization builds a product from.
But firms may also depend on technical resources like information or knowledge as well.
"And last, they may depend on social resources, like prestige and reputation that enabled them to survive."
All these resources can vary in value.
On the one hand their value can differ by the value of the resource.
Is it in demand?
Is it valued?
Does the firm need the resource to survive?
Is there a critical resource?
For example what does Stanford need to survive?
"Does it absolutely need students, does it require a physical location, books, teachers, money, heating, food?"
What can it live without?
What can't it live without?
"Is there a demand for safety, healthy food, expert teachers and awards?"

Chicken
"Chicken (""Gallus gallus domesticus"") is a term which refers to a species of poultry. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Some breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around)."
"A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock(erel). Roosters do not have penises. A female chicken is called a hen; a young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks."
"When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this."
Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs.
Eggs.
Chickens are well known for their eggs. Many people eat them for their breakfast. The eggs can be prepared in many different ways.
Meat.
"Because of their low cost, chicken meat (also called ""chicken"") is one of the most used kinds of meat in the world. Americans eat 8 billion chickens every year. Some popular dishes with chicken are: Buffalo wings, butter chicken, chicken rice, chicken balls, chicken pot pie, chicken soup, fried chicken (see picture), roasted chicken and tandoori chicken."
Cuts.
"There are different cuts of chicken. Chicken meat can also be bought whole. The leanest part is known as the breast. Sliced pieces of the breast are known as the tender(loin). There are also wings, thighs, and legs (also known as drumsticks)."
Chicken and chickenpox.
"Chickenpox has nothing to do with chickens. When chickenpox was first described, people thought that the pox spots looked like chickpeas placed upon the skin. The Latin word for chickpeas is ""grana"". That is the original word that chickenpox got its name from."

In some parts of the world people breed chickens to fight. They bet money on which of two birds will win. In many places this is illegal.

Bir Tawil
"Bir Tawil or Bi'r Tawīl (بيرطويل in Arabic; Bi'r or بير, meaning water well), is a small, , area. It is along the border between Egypt and Sudan. It is claimed by neither country right now. It is sometimes given the name the Bir Tawil Triangle, because even though it's not an exact triangle, it's made out of two triangles that share a border. The longer side is in the north of the area. It runs along the 22° north circle of latitude."
"The administrative boundary of Sudan and Egypt was made in 1902. Their political boundary was set in 1899. It was set as the 22° north circle of latitude. This area lies south of the 22° parallel. East-to-west, the area is between long in the south. It is long in the north. It is between and wide north-to-south. It is also in size."
"The Bir Tawil area came under Egyptian administration in 1902. This was because it was grazing land of the Ababda tribe based near Aswan, Egypt. At the same time, the Hala'ib Triangle north of latitude 22° north, and northeast of the area, came under Sudanese administration. This was because the tribes of this area were based in Sudan. The two ""triangles"" border at one point, a quadripoint."
History.
"In 1899, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the border between the territories at the 22nd parallel. At that time, the United Kingdom ruled the area. In 1902 the UK drew a separate ""administrative boundary"". Using this boundary, a triangle of land north of the parallel was placed under Sudanese administration. It was because its inhabitants were closer to Khartoum than Cairo, both geographically and culturally. The area was ruled by the British Governor in Khartoum."
"Egypt claims the original border from 1899, the 22° north circle of latitude. This would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan claims the administrative border of 1902. This would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states claim the Hala'ib Triangle. Neither state claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size and is landlocked. There is no basis in international law for Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories. It would also be difficult for any other state to claim the area. This is because only Sudan or Egypt border the land. As a result, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world which is not claimed by any state. The offical currency is the but this is no longer circulated."
Geography.
"In the north of the area is the mountain Jabal Tawil (جبل طويل in Arabic, located at ). It has a height of 459 meters. In the east is Jabal Ḩajar az Zarqā'. It has a height of 662 meters."

Critic
"A critic is a person who reviews things like movies, books, and food to see if they are any good and if other people would like them. They write reviews about what they have seen or read."
"Critics may write about art, music, theatre, politics, movies, television, books, or anything in which good or bad is a matter of personal opinion."
"Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel, Raymond Williams, Susan George, John Ruskin, Rene Ricard, John Amis, Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza, George Bernard Shaw, Robert Schumann and Pauline Kael are some famous critics of art, music, politics and movies."
Søren Kierkegaard
"Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (5 May 1813 – 11 November 1855), was a 19th-century Danish philosopher and theologian, and is usually thought of as the first existentialist philosopher."
"He wrote many philosophical books about faith, existence, emotions, and feeling. He disliked people who tried to make Christianity political and people who tried to limit the single individual in favour of groups of many people. Many people have found his works interesting and have said that they were great works of philosophy. Ludwig Wittgenstein, a 20th-century philosopher, thought Kierkegaard was ""by far, the most profound thinker of the nineteenth century""."
"The history of the British Empire has added to the spread of English. English is an important language in many places today. In Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United States, among others (like those in the Commonwealth of Nations), English is the main language. Because the United Kingdom (the country where England is) and the United States have historically been powerful in commerce and government, many people find it helpful to learn English to communicate in science, business, and diplomacy. This is called learning English as an additional language, English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL)."
"English literature has many famous stories and plays. William Shakespeare was a famous English writer of poems and plays. His English is Early Modern English, and not quite like what people speak or write today. Early Modern English sounded different, partly because the language was beginning a ""great vowel shift"". Later, many short stories and novels also used English. The novel as we know it is first seen in 18th century English. Therefore, today, many famous songs and movies (cinema films) use the English language."
Grammar.
"English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French."
Nouns.
"There are different types of nouns in English, like proper nouns and common noun. To show if a noun is plural, which means there is more than one of the noun, usually ""-s"" is added at the end of a word."
Pronouns.
Pronouns are words that take the place of a noun to avoid repetition. There are different types of pronouns in the English language. The most important ones are:
Verbs.
"Verbs in English show the action or the state of a sentence. Verbs can come in different shapes in a sentence based on the time or condition we are talking about. For example, the verb ""eat"" changes to ""ate"" in past."
Adjectives.
"Adjectives are words that describe a noun. In English they always come before a noun to give you more information about that noun. You can see this in the sentence ""the red apples are juicy."""
Spelling.
"Written English uses a range of historical spelling patterns that changed over time due to political and cultural changes. As a result, different words can use the same letters and combinations for very different sounds. For example, ""-ough"" was once a guttural but has become different in ""through"" (threw), ""rough"" (ruff), ""dough"" (doe) or ""cough"" (coff)."
Many English-speaking countries spell words differently. Some words that are spelled one way in the United Kingdom and many other countries in the British Commonwealth are spelled differently in the United States.
Alphabets.
There are 26 letters in the English alphabet:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Vocabulary.
"Nearly 60% of the vocabulary in the English language comes from Latin and its descendants, mainly French:"
"However, the most common words are more often those of Germanic origin. Also, expressions and typical short phrases are often of Germanic origin."

Stolen base
"In baseball, a stolen base is when a baserunner advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the ball to home plate. In baseball statistics, stolen bases are displayed as SB. It is possible to steal second base, third base, or home plate, but not to steal first base."
"If the defense does not try to put the baserunner out (for example, if the catcher does not even look his way), the play is called defensive indifference (also called fielder's indifference). No stolen base is credited to the runner in this case. Defensive indifference is usually only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run. MLB Rule 10.07(g) defines defensive indifference."
Strategy.
"A player who is good at stealing bases needs not just running speed, but also good base-running instincts, quickness, and split-second timing. The scoring and guidelines for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 10.07 of the Major League Baseball rule book."
"If a player is good at stealing bases, his manager may let him try to steal a base whenever he thinks he can. A player who is allowed to try to steal whenever he wants is said to have the ""green light"". Players who do not have the green light may only be allowed to steal when a coach or manager tells him to."

Gold rush
"A gold rush is when a lot of miners go to a mining place full of gold. Well-known examples are the California Gold Rush of 1848, the Australian gold rush which began in 1851, or the Fraser river gold rush in British Columbia, Canada in 1858."
California Gold Rush
"The California Gold Rush started when James Wilson Marshall was building a water powered sawmill for John Sutter in 1848. When he finished building the sawmill, he went to the river to fetch some water. He saw some shiny little flakes of gold in the river. He immediately went to tell John, and they tried to keep it a secret. But word soon got out, and the gold rush started."
"It was 1849 when the Gold Rush started. People who came to California for gold were called forty-niners because they came in the year 1849. Some of them became rich but most did not. Some people started selling things. Many of them became rich, famous, and politically powerful. Sometimes a woman could earn more than her mining husband."
Men like Levi Strauss also sold things. He invented and sold jeans made from strong denim. The California Gold Rush ended in 1855. Many gold miners went back home because gold was harder to find; others found other work.
Jeans
"Jeans are a type of pants made from heavy, strong cotton material (fabric) called denim. They were invented in the United States by Levi Strauss in 1872. In the late 1800s, jeans were worn by workers. Jeans are one of the most obvious symbols of American cultural influence in the world. They are worn in many countries around the world."
"In the 1950s, jeans became a popular fashion for teenagers and young adults. In the 1950s, jeans were part of rockabilly fashion for teenagers. Now, jeans are a very popular type of pants. They are usually worn as casual fashion clothing. Jeans are made in many styles and colors."
"The word ""jeans"" came from the French name of the city in Italy where a strong cotton fabric was made. The Italian city's name, Genoa, was spelled ""jene"" in Middle English and ""Gênes"" in the French language."
Sovereignty
Sovereignty is the right of a government to have complete control over its area. The idea that this right comes from doing good things for the people under control of the government is as old as Ancient Greece if not older.
"The exact meaning of Sovereignty has changed some in the past. The present meaning of Sovereignty is said to come from the Peace of Westphalia, an agreement between the rulers of Europe in 1648 which said:"
The Past.
Ancient Rome.
"Ancient Rome was first the Roman Republic, but then when Octavian made the Roman Empire the Emperor of Rome said that he was ""Sovereign"". The meaning of this was that he could make any law he wanted, and he did not have to do what the law said himself."
Middle Ages.
"In the time of the Middle Ages many kings and rulers had to do what other leaders said, such as the leader of the Catholic Church, the Pope. Because of this, the idea of ""Sovereignty"" was not much used."
Reformation.
"In the time of the Protestant Reformation, in the 16th century, governments were breaking away from religious leaders. Also many wars were fought between different rulers inside areas that are now sovereign countries. The English Civil War is one example of a war fought in this time between leaders inside one country."
"The Peace of Westphalia was made in 1648 and the idea of ""Sovereignty"" came back. Governments were now separate from outside leaders and only one government or ruler inside a country could make laws. The divine right of kings became more widespread."
The Enlightenment and Social Contract theory.
"The English thinker Thomas Hobbes wrote a book in 1651 that said rulers and governments are ""Sovereign"" because they are good for the safety of the people. The idea that people could change rulers if they were not safe was new with Hobbes."
Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote a book in 1763 that said the choice of the people is the only thing sovereignty comes from.
"Both Rousseau and Hobbes advanced a ""Social Contract"" in which people consent to a government's sovereignty just by living in the country and that people give up at least some of their liberty for security"
"In 1789 the French Revolution made an important country's government ruled by the choices of the people for the first time after the Middle Ages (some cities and small countries were democracies in the Middle Ages). There were many problems and France went back to the old way soon after, but would be ready for Democracy in 1870's. In England, many people got to vote after The Reform Act in 1832. The United States broke away from England in 1776-1783, but was not an important country at that time."

"In the 18th century, there was a downfall of the worship of Panthoibi with the rise of Vaishnavism in Manipur. Hindu King Garib Niwaj Pamheiba (1709-1748) pulled down her temples. He broke her statues. Her last recorded temple was built in 1700. After that, no temple was built in her honour until modern era came."
"From the 18th century onwards, Meitei goddess Panthoibi was equated as Hindu goddess Durga or her manifestation. The identity of Panthoibi was changed to that of Hindu goddess Durga. She was worshipped for five days in September – October."

Numerical integration
"Numerical integration is the term used for a number of methods to find an approximation for an integral. Numerical integration has also been called quadrature. Very often, it is not possible to solve integration analytically, for example when the data consists of a number of distinct measurements, or when the antiderivative is not known, and it is difficult, impractical or impossible to find it. In such cases, the integral can be written as a mathematical function defined over the interval in question, plus a function giving the error."
One way to find a numerical integral is using interpolation. Very often these interpolating functions are polynomials.
"Various formulas have been studied for many years and become famous. For example, there is the Gaussian quadrature (named after Gauss), the Newton-Cotes formula (named after Isaac Newton), and the Euler-Maclaurin formula (named after Leonhard Euler)."
Numerical errors.
"Numerical errors can occur in any kind of numerical computation including numerical integration. Errors in numerical integration are considered in another area called ""validated numerics""."

"Each of these acronyms means roughly the same thing. In each, the learners already have another native or ""mother"" language, and they want to learn English as well."
History.
"The teaching of English as a second language has a long history. For example, the official introduction of English into India's education system began in 1835."
Use.
"English as a second language is the single most popular subject in the world, after mathematics. English is a very important language in business. Many people study English as a foreign language, because they want a better job. English is also very important in education. Many pages on the internet are in English."
"Many people who can not go to English language classes study on the internet, using websites like BBC Learning English."
"Many people study English in a country where the people speak English. This way, many students learn to listen and speak English better."
Testing.
There are many English exams. These English exams are important for learners. They may show how well a person can use English. It is very difficult to compare different English exams. Every exam is a little different. Read Testing English as a foreign language for more information.
Global Scale of English.
"Global Scale of English (GSE) is a test for learners of English as a second or foreign language. The GSE is a list of can-do statements based on the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for English. Learners' abilities are rated on a 10-to-90 point scale for each of the four basic skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing). A learner reaches a level on the scale when she or he can correctly perform 50% of the can-do tasks at that level. The education company Pearson PLC developed the scale."
Teaching.
Teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) is referred to the practice of teaching the English language to the students with different first languages. It is taught in the state school system or privately with a language school or with a tutor. TEFL can also take place in an English-speaking country for people who have immigrated there.
"TEFL teachers may be native or non-native speakers of English. Other forms of TEFL are TESL (""Teaching English as a second language""), TESOL (""Teaching English to speakers of other languages""), and ESL (""English as a second language"")."
"Additional types of TEFL certification include: CTBE (Certificate in Teaching Business English), CTYL (Certificate in Teaching Young Learners), CTO (Certificate in Teaching Online)."
Switzerland
"Switzerland (; ; ; ; Swiss German: ""Schwiz"") is a comparatively small country in Western Europe. The official name of Switzerland is ""Confoederatio Helvetica"". This is Latin and is not often used except for official state documents. Switzerland is a confederation of even smaller states, which are the 26 cantons."
"Switzerland is known for its neutrality. A country is neutral when it does not take sides among the countries who are at war. Switzerland has been neutral since 1815. Many international organizations are in Switzerland. The United Nations has a main office (but not its headquarters) in Geneva. Its predecessor organization, the League of Nations, was headquartered in Geneva. It is no longer neutral since February 28, 2022."
"There are four official languages in Switzerland: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. Some cantons and even towns have two languages spoken in them, and the largest canton by area, Graubünden, has three. About 2/3 of the population speak German; French is spoken in the west of the country, while Italian is spoken in the canton of Ticino and Romansh in parts of Graubünden. Romansh language is spoken less than by 1% of the population."
"Switzerland does not have an official capital city, but Bern is used as though it was the capital. The largest city of Switzerland is Zürich."
To the north of Switzerland is Germany. East of Switzerland are Austria and Liechtenstein. To the south of Switzerland is Italy. To the west of Switzerland is France.
Geography.
"The area of Switzerland is 41,285 km². The confederation is divided into 23 full states called ""cantons"". All 26 cantons are: Aargau, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Land, Berne, Fribourg, Geneva, Glarus, Graubünden, Jura, Lucerne, Neuchâtel, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Ticino, Uri, Valais, Vaud, Zug, and Zürich."
"The mountains are very tall in the center and south of Switzerland. About 60% of Switzerland is in the Alps area. Only few people live here. The highest mountain is the ""Dufour Peak"" at 4,634 m."
"Many of the mountains have ice all year. This ice is called glaciers. The rivers Rhine, Rhône, and many other rivers start in the mountains of Switzerland."
"There are many lakes in Switzerland. The biggest lakes are all in the north and west: Lake Geneva (""Lac Léman""), Lake Zürich, Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Constance (""Bodensee"")."
Mountains in the north of Switzerland are fewer and smaller. Most Swiss people live in cities and towns in the north. The Jura mountains are in the northwest of Switzerland.

History.
"Brooklyn is named after a Dutch town called ""Breukelen"". Dutch people were the first people from Europe to live in the area. When they got there, there were already some Native American people living there called the Lenape. The Dutch started the town in 1634 as part of the colony of New Netherland."
"During the 19th century Brooklyn expanded and filled Kings County. It remained a separate city before the people there voted to join New York City in 1898. Today, many parts of Brooklyn are home to people who are mostly from one culture or ethnicity. Other parts are mixed."
"The Brooklyn Bridge is old and famous. It goes over the East River and connects Downtown Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan. The longest bridge in New York, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Bay Ridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island."
Cornish language
Cornish (Cornish: Kernewek) is a very old language from Cornwall in the southwest of England. Cornish is a Celtic language and is very similar to Welsh and is related to Gaelic.
History.
"A long time ago, Cornish was the only language spoken in Cornwall, but more and more people began to speak English, instead of Cornish. In 1550, when the prayer book was written in English instead of Latin, the Cornish people got angry and there was a rebellion. Because many Cornish-speakers died and they would now hear the Bible in English, Cornish was used less and less."
"By 1800, only a few people could speak Cornish, and since no one spoke it to one another any more, Cornish became endangered."
"People say that a woman called Dolly Pentreath was the last person who could speak Cornish. That is not quite true, but she was one of the last people to use it instead of English."
Methods of spreading.
"Some people learned about Cornish by traveling around talking to people who could still speak it and by reading old plays and books. Some people wanted to learn the language and speak it and so in 1904 a learned man, Henry Jenner, wrote a book to help people. Some people then began to learn the language and speak it again."
Today.
"No one knows how many Cornish-speakers there are now. People think that about 8,000 to 13,000 people probably speak Cornish. Some young people have grown up speaking it. Most people in Cornwall know a few sentences or words in Cornish. In 100 years, Cornish has grown from almost no speakers to many thousands, which is very exciting for many people."
"There are now many new books, films and songs in Cornish. The Bible has now been translated into Cornish. There is an event, the open Gorseth, with a story and poetry competition. Sometimes, Cornish is used in churches."
"There used to be a problem with Cornish: three different dictionaries had different spellings, and people did not agree about how to write words or say them. That was confusing for people when they have not been speaking for long. In 2008, people who used different types of Cornish came together and agreed on a new standard form of Cornish to be used everywhere."

Watergate scandal
The Watergate scandal was a serious scandal during and after the 1972 presidential election.
"A United States President and Republican, Richard Nixon was running for election against Democrat George McGovern. Afterwards, Frank Wills, a security guard, discovered clues that former FBI and CIA agents broke into the offices of the Democratic Party and George McGovern months before the election. They secretly listened to phone lines and stole several important documents."
"When these men were found, they were discovered to have been associated with Nixon. He had helped them cover all the evidence of the scandal, and may have even hired the men to begin with. ""The Washington Post"" was a newspaper which played a big role in exposing the misdoings, specifically aided by reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. This showed the public that Nixon was not as trustworthy as he seemed."
"Nixon chose to resign from office on August 9, 1974 because he wished not to be impeached. This means that he might have been charged with crimes. The U.S. Congress could not impeach him if he resigned. After this, Gerald Ford, his vice-president, became the President by default. Ford pardoned Nixon for all of his crimes later on. The name ""Watergate"" comes from the hotel in Washington, D.C. where the first crime and break in took place, and is often associated with political scandals."

"Port Lincoln, South Australia"
Port Lincoln is a city in South Australia. It is a coastal city on Boston Bay at the southern end of the Eyre Peninsula. It is the largest city in the region. It is about 280 kilometres (straight line – 646 km by road) from the capital city Adelaide.
History.
"The first people to live in the area were the Barngarla (Parnkalla) people, who are Indigenous Australian people. The name they used to call this area was Galinyala."
European people settled in the area in 1836.
"British Royal Navy explorer Matthew Flinders discovered the harbour in February 1802. He named it ""Port"" Lincoln rather than just Lincoln, where Flinders came from."
Fresh water.
"Port Lincoln may have become the state capital of the future South Australia, but it did not have a good water supply.. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln could not get enough fresh water, which is now supplied mostly from the underground aquifers to the south of the city. Recently the water supply on the Eyre Peninsula has been connected to Murray River water through a link from Kimba to Whyalla to connect into the Morgan to Whyalla pipeline water."
Demographics.
"About 14,245 people live in the Port Lincoln area as of 2006. Aboriginal people made up 5.4% of Port Lincoln's 2006 population."
Geography.
"Port Lincoln has different coastal areas, from sheltered waters and beaches, to surf beaches and rugged oceanic coastline."
Government.
Port Lincoln and its suburbs comprise the City of Port Lincoln local government area. Port Lincoln is in the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal Division of Grey.
Economy.
"The economy is based on loading wheat onto ships. The port can handle over 337,500 tonnes) of wheat. There is also the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market. The port is home to a large commercial fishing fleet. There is also fish farming (aquaculture) of the following species: tuna, kingfish, abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimental farming in seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the introduction of fish farming, the main fishing was for Southern bluefin tuna."
"Port Lincoln is the end of an isolated narrow gauge railway system to bring the wheat to port. Iron ore traffic may be added in the future, although this has been the topic of protest and debate in the community."
Tourism.
"Tourism is becoming more important, thanks to the scenic beauty and coastal locality. Easy access to both Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight make Port Lincoln a good place for yachting, scuba diving, shark cage diving and game fishing. The city also is the regional centre for government administration, corporate services and commerce to Eyre Peninsula. However, many State Government functions are gradually being closed as State Government becomes more centralised in Adelaide. During the past decade, there has been a big increase in building houses and commercial buildings."
"Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park and Kellidie Bay Conservation Park are within easy driving distance."
Transport.
Port Lincoln is the port for the isolated narrow gauge () Eyre Peninsular Railway.
There is also a smaller port at Proper Bay which may be restored to use for iron ore traffic. The export of iron ore through Port Lincoln has been approved by the South Australian Government. (c. Oct 2009)
Port Lincoln Airport is located a few kilometers north of the city. Regional Express and Qantaslink provide several daily flights to the state capital of Adelaide.
Culture.
"The book ""Blue Fin"" by Colin Thiele was set in Port Lincoln. The movie of the same name was filmed in nearby Streaky Bay. Some of the shark scenes of ""Jaws"" and Anzac Cove scenes in ""Gallipoli"", were also filmed near Port Lincoln."
"""Australian Survivor"", the Australian-produced series of the US television series, ""Survivor"", was filmed at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln, in 2001."
"""Hearts Apart"" by Caitlin Jones was written on a farm in Port Lincoln."
"Port Lincoln was visited in 1939 by English travel author Eric Newby, while he was crew in the four-masted barque ""Moshulu"", which anchored off Boston Island. ""Moshulu"" had taken 82 days to sail to Port Lincoln from Belfast in ballast (a fast passage for a windjammer). But there was no grain to be had there, even though ""Moshulu"" waited at anchor for most of January. The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. ""Moshulu"" finally sailed to Port Victoria for cargo."
"During the 1939 season, ""Passat"" and ""Lawhill"" also went to Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book ""The Last Grain Race"" (1956). Several pictures of Port Lincoln in 1939 are in his photo-essay of his voyage, ""Learning the Ropes""."

Torres Strait Islands
"The Torres Strait Islands are a group of at least 274 small islands. Most of the islands are part of the state of Queensland, Australia. A small number are part of Papua New Guinea."
The islands are in the Torres Strait.
"The indigenous people of the islands are Torres Strait Islanders. In 2011, the population was 4,248. The island with the most people is Thursday Island."
Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Adopted on March 30, 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment (Amendment XV) to the United States Constitution granted African-American men the right to vote. It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments."
Background.
Nowhere in the original Constitution or the Bill of Rights were Americans given the right to vote. The Fifteenth Amendment gave African-American men the right to vote. But not until the 1960s did judicial interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment conclude the right to vote was a fundamental right of all citizens.
The reasons behind the omissions of voting rights in the Bill of Rights and Constitution is that including them would have been too controversial at the time. Each state had different rules for who could vote. Some allowed free blacks the right to vote. Others allowed women the right to vote. A few states required ownership of property in order to vote.
"In the Election of 1868, Republican Party candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, won the presidency by only a narrow majority of the popular vote. He received support from free black voters in the South. Without that support, he probably would have lost the election. At the time blacks could not vote in the Northern states. The Republican party needed help to stay in power and thought that black votes would help. At the time Republicans controlled both the Senate and House. The proposed amendment was passed by Congress in 1869 and sent to the states for ratification. It was quickly ratified by three-quarters of the states in early 1870. Part of the reason why is that Republicans also controlled the state governments in the South. Southern Democrats were not able to block the measure."
Results.
"After passage, the Fifteenth Amendment did not have much of any impact on black voting in the South for nearly a century. Southerners used various methods including terrorism, poll taxes and grandfather clauses to prevent blacks from voting. Congress and the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down voting restrictions. For example, in a landmark decision in ""Smith v. Allwright"" (1944), The Court decision made it unconstitutional to keep African-Americans from voting in a Democratic Party primary in Texas. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which stated that all Americans had the right to vote, including African-Americans. But overcoming these problems on a case-by-case basis was proving to be unsuccessful. As soon as one form of discrimination was stopped, a new one appeared in its place. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, removed further barriers to minorities voting. It was amended five times by Congress to extend its protections as needed."
Solar eclipses on Mars
"The two moons of Mars—Phobos and Deimos—are much smaller than the Moon, greatly reducing solar eclipses on that planet."
Eclipses.
Phobos.
"Phobos is only 20 by 25 km (12 by 16 mi) and has a rapid orbital motion, so someone on Mars would only see the solar eclipse for no longer than about thirty seconds. Phobos also takes only 7 hours 39 minutes to orbit Mars, while a Martian day is 24 hours 37 minutes long, meaning that Phobos can create two eclipses per Martian day."
Deimos.
"Deimos is too small, 15 by 10 km (9.3 by 6.2 mi), to cause an eclipse. The best someone on Mars would see would be a small object passing the Sun."
View from Earth.
"Both moons are too small to cast a shadow on Mars that can be seen from Earth. However, since the creation of artificial satellites, the shadow of Phobos on Mars has been seen."
War of the Oranges
"The War of the Oranges, or the War of the grapefruit was a brief conflict in Alentjo in 1801. French and Spanish troops invaded Portugal."
Deadpool (movie)
"Deadpool is a 2016 American superhero movie. It is based on the Marvel Comics's character Deadpool. The movie was directed by Tim Miller and it was produced by Simon Kinberg, Ryan Reynolds, and Lauren Shuler Donner. It was Miller's first movie as a director. A sequel movie titled ""Deadpool 2"" has been released in 2018."
"""Deadpool"" was first premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on February 8, 2016. It was released in North America on February 12, 2016. Principal photography for the movie started in Vancouver on March 23, 2015 and ended on May 29, 2015."
"A globe that represents the Earth is usually mounted at a 23.5° angle on bearings. This mounting represents the axial tilt of the spinning planet, in relation to the Sun. This makes it easy to visualize how days and seasons change."
Noah
"Noah (meaning rest or comfort) is a man in the Abrahamic religions. He was the son of Lamech, and the father of sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Noah and his ark are in the Book of Genesis, which also describes Noah as the 'first man to plant a vineyard' (chapter 9). Several other parts of the Bible mention him, as does the Quran."
The Ark.
"As described in the Book of Genesis, Noah and his family kept believing in God in a time when most people were not, like his son Canaan and his wife Naamah. Knowing this was true, God told Noah he was going to flood the world, so he could drown out evil. He told Noah to build a boat called an ""ark"". Noah was to put himself, his family (except his son and his wife because they refused to come aboard the ark), and two (a male and a female) of every kind of animal on it. People laughed at Noah, but they were killed by the flood with his son and his wife. Noah and family stayed on the ark until they reached land. To find land Noah sent out a dove, which returned with an olive branch. After the flood, God made a rainbow as a promise to say that he would never destroy the Earth by flood again. When they were able to walk on dry land, the animals were released and they were able to repopulate the earth."

Cabinet
"A Cabinet is a group of important people in a government, who normally represent the head of government. It is also known as the Council of Ministers or the Executive Council. They are part of the executive branch of government. People in the cabinet are called ministers or secretaries, and they do different things, such as look after the environment."
"In most countries with parliamentary systems, the cabinet decides the government's policy. In other countries, such as the United States, the cabinet has limited power, and is an advisor to the Head of Government. In some countries, cabinet members are given their jobs by those who are in the government."
Many years ago the cabinets were called Privy Councils. The cabinet of today came about during the time that George I and George II were Kings of England.
"In some European countries, the term ""cabinet"" is used to mean the assistants of an important politician."
"In the UK and some Commonwealth countries, the Shadow Cabinet are the leaders of the main opposition party in a parliament."
Newspaper
"A newspaper is a publication printed on paper and issued regularly, usually once a day or once a week. It gives information and opinions about current events and news. Usually people like to read them to stay informed about their local city, state or country. Newspapers can be delivered to one's home, by subscription. One also can buy a newspaper at a store or at a newsstand. Recycling of paper is common. It may be converted to new paper, for example."
"Newspapers usually have many topics. They usually include political events, crime, business, sports, and weather news. Newspapers use photographs to illustrate stories; and also often include comicss and other entertainment, such as crosswords and horoscopes. Many have opinion sections. These sections print the opinions of people who work for the newspaper. The opinions, which are usually on stories in the news, are called ""editorials"". Opinion sections usually also print short letters from people who read the newspaper."
July 4
"Colonel Ilan Ramon (, born Ilan Wolferman; June 20, 1954 - February 1, 2003) was an Israeli air force pilot and the only Israeli astronaut. He was a member of the STS-107 mission crew and he died during Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003."
His mother was a Holocaust survivor (at Auschwitz concentration camp) and his father fought for Israeli independence. Ramon was married to activist Rona Ramon.
Daniel Johnston
"Daniel Johnston (January 22, 1961 – September 11, 2019) was an American songwriter, singer, and artist who lived in Texas. Johnston has bipolar disorder. The movie ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"" is about his life and music career."
"Born in Sacramento, California, Johnston grew up in West Virginia in a Christian family. He became a Beatles fan when he was young, then went off to college but did not finish. He moved to Texas to live with his brother, and ended up joining a circus. He left the circus after another worker beat him up for taking too long in a restroom, and found a church in Austin, Texas that helped him find somewhere to live. Johnston's religious beliefs are mentioned in many of his songs, especially on his CD ""1990""."
"Johnston's music career started in Austin in the 1980s. He made cassette tapes of songs he performed on a chord organ and gave many of them out for free to people he met. He started playing concerts and became very popular with music fans in Texas. Johnston appeared on MTV, and became even more popular when Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain wore a T-shirt with the cover art of one of Johnston's CDs."
"Johnston released one CD on Atlantic Records, a major record label (a big company that helps make CDs and sells them around the world) called ""Fun"" in 1994. However, he was not able to make any more CDs with Atlantic Records because not enough people bought ""Fun"". However, Johnston still writes songs, and his drawings appear on the covers of his CDs. His latest CD is ""Is and Always Was"", which came out in 2009."
"In 2010, movie director David Miller announced that he was writing the script for a new movie about Johnston that would be very different from ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston""."
"Johnston died of a suspected heart attack at his home in Waller, Texas on September 11, 2019. He was 58."

Treepie
"The treepies are a type of bird. They are a member of the crow family (""Corvidae""). There are four different genus of treepie. They are ""Dendrocitta"", ""Crypsirina"", ""Temnurus"" and ""Platysmurus"". There are 11 species of treepie."
"Treepies are similar to magpies. They have long tails. Most treepies are black, white, gray or brown. They are found in Southeast Asia. They live in tropical forests. They spend a lot of time in the tops of trees. They do not come to feed on the ground very often."
Velcro
"Velcro is a brandname and trademark owned by the Velcro Companies for ""hook-and-loop fasteners"". Hook-and-loop fasteners have a ""hook"" side, which is a piece of fabric covered with tiny hooks, and a ""loop"" side, which is covered with even smaller and ""hairier"" loops. When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together. When they are separated, they make a special ""ripping"" sound."
Creation.
"The person who invented hook-and-loop was a scientist named George de Mestral. During a hunting vacation in Switzerland, de Mestral came home one evening and tried to remove the burrs stuck to his dog's fur. He was very surprised to see how hard the burrs were to remove. That night he studied the burrs under a microscope and noticed that each burr was covered with hundreds of small hooks acting like grasping hands. De Mestral decided that this burr could be made to close fabric instead of buttons and zippers. By copying the hook pattern hat he saw on burrs, he made hook-and-loop!"
Vocabulary.
"George de Mestral created the Velcro trademark by combining the French words for velvet (""velour"") and hook (""crochet"")."
Mamane
"Māmane (Hawaiian language) is a shrub of Hawai'i in the ""Sophora"" genus. It is suitable for gardens."
"It is highly polymorphic, growing as a shrub or tree, and able to reach a height of in tree form. It is grow fast in every island of Hawaiian archipelago, so botanists describe many local forms including ""S.unifoliolata"""
"Hawaiian honeycreeper visits mamane sucking nectar,"
"If mamane were to disappear from Hawai'i it would take with it the palila bird, which is also endangered due to the lack of enough māmane trees. ""Loxoides bauilleui"", palila, feeds on unripe seeds of the māmane"

A Man for All Seasons
A Man for All Seasons is a play by Robert Bolt about the life of Sir Thomas More that was first put on in 1960. It was made into a movie in 1966 that won the Best Picture Academy Award that year. It was also made into a TV movie in 1988.
Composite number
"A composite number (or simply a ""composite"") is a natural number, that can be found by multiplying prime numbers."
"For example, the number ""9"" can be found by multiplying ""3"" by ""3"". Another example is the number ""12"", which is obtained by multiplying ""3"", ""2"" and ""2""."
All natural numbers (greater than 1) can be put in one of the two classes below:
Fundamental theorem of arithmetic
"The Fundamental theorem of arithmetic (also called the unique factorization theorem) is a theorem of number theory. The theorem says that ""every"" positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers (or the integer is itself a prime number). The theorem also says that there is only one way to write the number. If two people found two different ways to write the number, the only thing that can be different is the order in which the primes are written. For example, we can write:"
"and if somebody else finds ""another"" way to write 6936 or 1200 as product of prime numbers, we can put those prime numbers in the right order and find out that it is the same as what we have here. Finding the prime numbers is called factorization."
This theorem can be used in cryptography.
Proof.
"The first person who proved the theorem was Euclid. The first detailed and correct proof was in the ""Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"" by Carl Friedrich Gauß."
"Some people may think that the theorem is true everywhere. However, the theorem is ""not"" true in more general number systems, like . This was first mentioned by Ernst Kummer in 1843, in his work on Fermat's last theorem. For more information about that: read ."
"The proof consists of two parts: ""first"" we show that every number can be written as a product of primes; ""second"" we show that if we write a number as a product of primes for a second time, then the two lists of prime numbers must be the same."
First part of the proof.
"We show that if ""not"" every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes, we end up in some kind of impossibility. So after that we conclude that it ""must"" be true that every number can be written as a product of primes."
"So, now see what happens when somebody says that he/she knows a positive integer, greater than 1, which can ""not"" be written as a product of primes. In that case we ask him/her to mention ""all"" the numbers, greater than 1, that can ""not"" be written as a product of primes. One of these numbers must be the ""smallest"": let's call it ""n"". Of course, this number ""n"" cannot be 1. Further, it cannot be a prime number, because a prime number is a 'product' of a single prime: itself. So it ""must"" be a product of numbers. Thus-"
"where both ""a"" and ""b"" are positive integers that are of course smaller than ""n"". But: ""n"" was the ""smallest"" number that can not be written as a product of primes. So it must be possible to write ""a"" and ""b"" as products of primes, because they are both smaller than ""n"". But then the product"
"can be written as a product of primes as well. This is an impossibility because we said that ""n"" can not be written as a product of primes."
We have now shown the impossibility which exists if the first part of the theorem would not be true. In this way we have now proven the first part of the theorem.
Second part of the proof.
Now we have to prove that there is only one way to write a positive number greater than 1 as a product of prime numbers.
"The Far Eastern Championship Games (also known as the Far Eastern Championships, Far Eastern Games or Far East Games) was an Asian multi-sport event considered to be a precursor to the Asian Games."
History.
"In 1913, Elwood Brown, president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association and Manila Carnival Games, proposed the creation of the ""Far Eastern Olympic Games"" to China and Japan. It was at that time that Governor-General William Cameron Forbes was the president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation from 1911-1913. Governor-General Forbes formed the Far Eastern Olympic Association."
"The first event was held on the Manila Carnival grounds (later the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex) in Malate, Manila, Philippines on February 4, 1913 and was known as the ""First Oriental Olympic Games"". Forbes was also the one who formally declare the games open. Six countries participated in the eight-day event: the host country then-named Philippine Islands, Republic of China, Empire of Japan, British East Indies (Malaysia), Kingdom of Thailand and British crown colony Hong Kong."
"In 1915, the name changed to Far Eastern Championship Games and the association to Far Eastern Athletic Association when the event was held at Hongkou Park in Shanghai, China. They were held there again in 1921. The games were held every two years except in 1929 when Japan decided to delay the project to 1930. The FEAA decided to change the time table to four years and the Philippine Islands hosted the tenth games in 1934. Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) joined in the 1934 FECG."
"The 1934 edition was held in a period of dispute between China and Japan, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Inclusion of people from this region in the games caused controversy between the two member nations, which resulted in the break-up of the Far Eastern Athletic Association. In September 1937, Japan invaded China with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and started the Second Sino-Japanese War (which later became part of World War II), thus the planned games in 1938 were cancelled."
Sports.
"A total of nine different sports were contested over the lifetime of the competition. Eight of the sports featured on each programmes of the games, with the ninth sport – cycling – being held once only, in 1915."

Webster-Hayne debate
"The Webster-Hayne debate was a famous debate in the United States between Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina. It happened on January 19-27, 1830. It was about protectionist tariffs. The speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were not planned. They had burst forth from arguments about a decision by Connecticut Senator Samuel Foote. Foote had temporarily stopped land surveying until land already on the market was sold. Webster's ""Second Reply to Hayne"" (1830) was widely seen as ""the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress."""
"Webster described the US government as ""made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people"". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words ""government of the people, by the people, for the people"" in his Gettysburg Address."
Point Hicks
"Point Hicks, once called Cape Everard, is a coastal headland on the east coast of Victoria, Australia. It is now a part of the Croajingolong National Park."
Name.
"Point Hicks is where, on 19 April 1770, the continent of Australia was first sighted by the men on Captain Cook's ""Endeavour"" voyage. Cook wrote that it was Lieutenant Zachary Hickes who first saw land, and Cook named the point after him. Hickes spelt his name with an ""e"", Cook wrote both ""Hicks"" and ""Hickes"" in different places. The spelling ""Hicks"" is now in use for the point."
"When George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point. It did not appear on the charts Matthew Flinders made of their voyages, and the name fell into disuse."
"The point came to be known as Cape Everard. The first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the ""Beagle"" in 1843. It is thought he named it after fellow naval officer John Everard Home, but his maps do not use the name."
"The first map showing Cape Everard was by surveyor George Douglas Smythe, made in 1852 and published in 1853. If he thought of the name, he may have named it after William Everard, commissioner of crown lands."
The name Cape Everard was used until 1970. There has been doubt and arguments about exactly what Cook saw. The actual latitude and longitude he gave () is a location many miles out to sea.
"Point Hicks was renamed as part of Cook's bicentenary. Victorian Premier Henry Bolte announced the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970 (this was the 200th anniversary; Cook's 19 April was by nautical time, i.e. not adjusted for the International Date Line)."
Lighthouse.
"A lighthouse was built on the point in 1887/8 and started operation in 1890. It was built from concrete and with wooden lighthouse keepers houses. It was connected to mains electricity in 1965, and then to solar power recently. The keepers' cottages are today used as holiday houses. With 37 metres of height it is the tallest lighthouse on Australia's mainland. Its light is a double white flash every ten seconds, from a height of 56 metres above sea level."
Hobo spider
"A Hobo Spider is a spider like funnel-web spiders. Their bite is very bad and could send you to the hospital. It can be found in North America, Europe and Central Asia."
Fethullah Gülen
"Muhammed Fethullah Gülen (born 27 April 1941), better known as Fethullah Gülen, is a Turkish preacher, author, educator and Muslim scholar. He lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania (USA)."
"Gülen teaches a moderate version of Sunni / Hanafi Islam, deriving from that of Said Nursi's teachings and modernizing them. Gülen condemns terrorism, supports communication between people of different religions, and has initiated such dialogue with the Vatican and some Jewish organisations. Until 2013 he was an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who later blamed him for the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt. He operates a worldwide organisation called the Gülen Movement also known as FETÖ."
Teachings.
"Fethullah Gülen's attitude towards hijab has changed over time. In the past, Gülen, who regarded the unwinding of even a strand of women's hair as a great sin, suggested that women should cover their whole body by using veils and gloves. In his last speeches, Gülen evaluated the headscarf as a füruat (minor details)."
"For Fethullah Gülen, to allow views opposed to belief in creation is a devastating delusion and evolution, a Darwin fallacy."
"According to Gülene, the creation of Adam as the first human and Eve from Adam's file bone are miracle creations that should not be addressed in the context of cause-effect relationship."
"The first pharaoh was Narmer, though he did not use the term. The Egyptians believed their pharaoh was the god Horus. Pharaohs had several wives but only one wife was queen."
Gilligan's Island
"Gilligan's Island is a 1964 American television series. The series is about seven people (two crew members and five tourists) who take a 3-hour sightseeing tour from a marina in Hawaii. This occurs on the boat, S.S. ""Minnow"". An unexpected storm sends the boat to an uncharted island. Now, the passengers of the boat have to live on the island and try to find a way home. Most of the episodes involved the characters trying to survive a problem or trying to contact help."
Diaper
A diaper (or nappy) is a piece of clothing. It is worn by those who cannot control their urine or feces.
Diapers can be made of cloth (usually cotton) that can be washed and used again. They can also be disposable (put in the garbage after they are used up). Disposable diapers are usually made of plastic or man-made (artificial) fibers and contain chemicals that are very absorbent.
Diapers that can be washed must be folded in intricate ways (like origami) before being put on. With the disposable you must constantly buy new ones.
"Viewed as unpleasant by some, diapers are mostly used by children from birth until the child has learned to use a toilet. They are also used by older people. There are adult diapers for people with medical problems."
"In the United Kingdom, Australia and several other countries, a diaper is called a nappy."
"Sometimes adults who do not have medical problems also wear diapers. This can be for different reasons. Sometimes it is because they have a profession where they cannot always get to a bathroom, like astronauts. Some adults wear diapers for fun. This is usually a form of sexual pleasure, or for emotional reasons. These people are often called ""diaper-lovers"" or ""adult-babies."" The scientific term for liking to wear diapers is ""Diaper Fetishists."""
Mork &amp; Mindy
"Mork and Mindy is an American television sitcom which ran from 1978 to 1982. It stars Robin Williams and Pam Dawber as the title characters. The series was made by Garry Marshall. Comedian Jonathan Winters has a recurring role in the series. ""Mork and Mindy"" is a spin-off from Marshall's other popular TV series, ""Happy Days"".

"American Samoa (; , ; also ' or ') is a territory of the United States. It is part of the Samoan Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean."
"In 1899, Germany and the U.S. divided the Samoan group of islands. The U.S. got the smaller group of islands on the east side. These islands had a good harbor near the capital city, Pago Pago. The western islands were run by Germany and then by New Zealand and are now the independent country Samoa."
"Officially, American Samoa is an ""unorganized"" territory. This means that the U.S. Congress has not passed an Organic Act. But the people who live in American Samoa rule themselves. Their constitution became effective on July 1, 1967."
"The capital of American Samoa is Pago Pago, but the seat of government is Fagatogo."
Citizenship.
"People who are born in American Samoa are called U.S. nationals, not U.S. citizens. This means they have some of the same rights as citizens but not all of them. Unlike people who are not Americans at all, American Samoans can go to any other part of the United States they want and live there for as long as they want. But they are not allowed to vote, to be on juries in court, to run for office, or to hold any job that the employee has to be a citizen to hold. For contrast, someone born in Puerto Rico or Guam is a citizen, so if they move to a state, they are allowed to vote in that state and in all federal elections."
"Some American Samoans like that they are not American citizens and others do not. Some American Samoans say that being nationals and not citizens makes it easier for them to keep the fa'a Samoa, the Samoan way of life. In 2019, three American Samoans living in Utah sued the U.S. government to say they are citizens. The judge agreed with them. The judge said that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that anyone born in any part of the United States is a citizen, and that should mean American Samoans too. But the next day, he said they should not register to vote until after an appeal judge has seen the case."
"In 2016, the United States Supreme Court decided they did not want to look at a case about whether American Samoans are citizens."

Notes
Disgust
"This view is disputed by some. ""Society for the Scientific Study of Religion"" stated in 1990 that there was not sufficient research for a consensus, and that ""one should not automatically equate the techniques involved in the process of physical coercion and control with those of nonphysical coercion and control""."
Management style of cults.
An oft-repeated criticism of cults is that their management style is dictatorial and exploitative. The following is one example:
Use of violence.
"Ownership of weapons and violence has occurred in some cults. The Branch Davidians under the direction of David Koresh used violence against Federal agencies, with tragic results for both sides. The later FBI report reveals the extent of their arms stockpile."
"The People's Temple included guards armed with submachine guns. These guards killed the visiting U.S. Congressman Ryan, and stood around the believers as they committed suicide. Members of the Manson Family were convicted of several murders."
The Cult
"The Cult are a English rock band. They formed in 1982 under the name Death Cult and later renamed to Southern Death Cult in 1983, then was again renamed to their current name The Cult."
1028
1028 (MXXVIII) was a common year when the Julian calendar was used. It was the twenty-eighth year of the 2nd millennium and the 11th century.
James A. Michener
"James Albert Michener ( or ; February 3, 1907 – October 16, 1997) was an American writer. His books include ""Tales of the South Pacific"", ""Hawaii"", ""The Drifters"", ""Texas"", and ""Poland"". Most of his 40 books are very large sagas. They are about the lives of many generations in a particular place. His non-fiction writings include the 1992 book ""The World is My Home"" and ""Sports in America""."
"Michener wrote that he did not know who his parents were or exactly when and where he was born. He was raised by an adoptive mother, Mabel Michener, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Some have argued that Mabel was his birth mother. He graduated from Swarthmore College, where he played basketball, in 1929. He later studied at the Colorado State Teachers College. He taught there for several years. He also taught at Harvard University."
"His writing career began during World War II. He was assigned to the South Pacific Ocean as a naval historian. He used his time there as the basis for ""Tales of the South Pacific"", his first book. This book was the basis for the musical ""South Pacific""."
"Michener met his wife Mari while in Japan. His novel ""Sayonara"" is autobiographical."
"On January 10, 1977, he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald R. Ford."
"In his final years, he lived in Austin, Texas, where he died of kidney failure on October 16, 1997 at the age of 90."
War of 1812
The War of 1812 was fought between the British Empire and the United States from 1812 to 1815 on land in North America and at sea. The British forces were helped by Canadian militia (volunteers) and Native Americans because British soldiers were busy fighting Napoleon I in Europe.
"In nearly every battle, the British defeated the attacking American forces. The war increased nationalism in both Canada and the United States."
Causes.
One reason given by Americans for declaring war was that the British were bothering American ships. The British claimed to be looking for British sailors who had deserted. Many British sailors deserted from the
"miserable conditions and the harsh discipline. Originally, many of the sailors had been pressed into service. It was the practice of the British to arrest any man they found on a street and to force him to serve on their ships. Many British sailors who escaped signed on as crew aboard American merchant ships. The British claim was somewhat true."
"In 1807, an American ship was boarded and then fired on, which created outrage among the American public. The British were also seizing American sailors at sea and forcing them to serve in the navy."
"The numbers of American seamen pressed into British service is not well known and may have been greatly exaggerated. The British were also sponsoring Native American territories in the Midwest to stop the United States from expanding westward. That made 10,000 Native Americans fight for the British."
"Napoleon I started the French invasion of Russia in 1812, just as the war started in North America. The Americans thought that the British would be busy fighting the French during the Napoleonic Wars to do much in North America."
The war.
"Fighting began when the United States started to attack the Canadian provinces in 1812. However, the British and the Canadians successfully defended their borders. In 1813, British and American ships fought in the Battle of Lake Erie. Americans under Oliver Hazard Perry won, which gave them control of Lake Erie. American forces raided and burned Toronto, which was then called York."
"While designing clothes inspired by ""Alice in Wonderland"" for her Abbey Dawn line, Lavigne told Disney executives she could write a song for the film's soundtrack. Director Tim Burton agreed, and Lavigne ""wrote the song immediately"" on her piano. Lavigne described the song as ""a little darker"" and confirmed the lyrics, ""trippin' out, spinnin' around, I'm underground, I fell down."""
Flag of Utah
The Flag of the State of Utah was adopted in 1913 and has the Seal of Utah encircled in a golden circle on a background of dark navy blue.
"In 1912, the Sons and Daughters of Utah Pioneers ordered a custom made copy of the newly adopted state flag to be showed off to the battleship USS Utah, which was commissioned on August 31, 1911. When the flag came, the group found out that the coat of arms on the flag was in full color instead of white, and the manufacturer had added a gold ring around the shield. Rather than have the flag remade, the Utah legislature changed the law to match the battleship flag, and the flag was showed off to the USS Utah."
"A bald eagle, the national bird of the United States represents the safety of America. The arrows in the talons of the eagle represent courage in war. The sego lily, the Utah state flower, represents peace. The state motto ""industry"" represents progress, hard work, and community as does the emblem of the beehive, which is also a traditional Mormon symbol. Crossed Union flags show Utah's support and commitment to the United States. The name, Utah, appears underneath the beehive. The date 1847 represents the year Brigham Young led the first Mormons into the state. The year listed below that, 1896, represents the year that Utah was admitted to the Union. The gold circle around the state seal represents eternal order. The shield underneath the bald eagle represents common defense (military)."
"The design of the seal was adopted in 1850 by the Territory of Utah and changed by the artist ""Harry Edwards"" when Utah became a state in 1896."
Flag of the State of Deseret.
"According to most descriptions, the flag of the State of Deseret was almost the same to the flag of the State of Utah, but as it was not standardized, many other secular and religious alternatives were also used."
"Dawson City, Yukon"
"Dawson City is a place in the Yukon Territory. It used to be a city, but is not one anymore. It is the second-largest place in Yukon, after Whitehorse, and has 1,327 people."
"Dawson was at its biggest during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, and served as a base for mining. Many people became rich not from finding gold, but from running boarding houses/general stores because of good business from all of the miners. It was the capital of Yukon from 1898 to 1952."
Seal of Utah
"The Great Seal of the State of Utah was adopted on April 3, 1896 at the first regular session of the Legislature (January, February, March, April 1896). The first seal was made by Harry Edwards and cost $65.00."

Most people consider the countries in Central America to be part of North America instead of South America.
"While the word ""American"" is usually used to mean a person or a thing from the United States, the most populated country in the Americas, sometimes people and things from anywhere in the Americas are called ""American""."

Books.
"The six books in the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" series are:"
Synopsis.
"The radio, book, TV and movie versions differ from each other. The same basic plot is used but they sometimes contradict each other. This is due to Adams rewriting the story for each new medium."
"In all versions, the story follows the adventures of Arthur Dent. He is an Englishman. His house is being bulldozed to make way for a bypass. At the same time the Earth is being demolished by the Vogons to make way for an intergalactic bypass. The vogons are a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens."
"Dent's friend, Ford Prefect, is an alien. He is a researcher for the eponymous guidebook. He rescues Dent from Earth's destruction."
"Zaphod Beeblebrox is Ford's eccentric semi-cousin. Beeblebrox is the Galactic President. He has stolen the ""Heart of Gold"", a spacecraft equipped with the Infinite Improbability Drive. The depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android and Trillian are crew members."
"Trillian was known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington. Beeblebrox saved her from Earth's destruction. She is the only other human survivor."
"Arthur learns that the Earth was actually a giant supercomputer. It was created by another supercomputer, Deep Thought. Deep Thought had been built to give the answer to the ""Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"". It gave the answer as ""42"". The creators of Deep Thought were disappointed and Deep Thought was then instructed to design the Earth supercomputer to determine what the question actually is."
"The Earth was destroyed by the Vogons just before its calculations were due to complete. Arthur becomes the target of the descendants of the Deep Thought creators, believing his mind must hold the Question. With his friends' help, Arthur escapes and they decide to have lunch at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. They have more adventures."
Cookbook
"A cookbook, or cookery book, is kind of book that tells people how to prepare food for eating using specific instructions called a recipe.

Government.
Somalia is a republic governed by a federal administration with various regional administrations governing on a micro level.
"Somalia is an independent country. Since the Somali Civil War in the 1980s, there has been no working government that covers all of Somalia; instead, different pirates have been destabilizing the region to the southwest, the Gulf of Aden. Somalia is now trying to gain control of their people and get back up on its feet with very little resources."
Clan wars.
"There are four big tribes in Somalia, the Hawiye, the Dirweyn, the Koofur Orsi inhabitants and the Darood. Somalis are a nation of related families, which are called clans. Groups of clans sometimes band together based on a common ancestor or other blood relationship. Sometimes these family relationships date back hundreds or even thousands of years in the past."
"Somalis are mostly camel or goat herders, and depend on their livestock to live. In Somalia there are limited sources of drinking water and grazing land, and disputes over grazing rights, water rights, or land in general can lead to fighting between families. Because of the clan system, the families involved will call on their clan for help, leading to a clan war."
Royal Institute of British Architects
The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is a professional organisation for architects in the United Kingdom.
"It was originally named the Institute of British Architects in London and formed in 1834.

It was awarded a Royal Charter in 1837, becoming the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892."
"The RIBA is a member organisation, with 44,000 members. Chartered Members are allowed to call themselves chartered architects and to add the post-nominals RIBA after their name; Student Members are not permitted to do so. In the past, fellowships of the institute were given, but this has stopped; those who continue to hold this title instead add FRIBA."
"RIBA is based at 66 Portland Place, London—a 1930s Grade II* listed building designed by architect George Grey Wornum with sculptures by Edward Bainbridge Copnall and James Woodford. The Institute also maintains a dozen regional offices around the United Kingdom. Parts of the London building are open to the public, including the exhibition galleries and Library.

Construction and design.
"The track was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke. Tilke also designed the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. The track cost approximately US $150 million to build. It can be set-up as six different tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip."
The track had a special problem. The track was located in the middle of a desert. There were concerns that sand would blow onto the track and disrupt the race. Organizers (the people who run the race) were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive (glue) on the sand around the track.
The surface of the track has a high level of grip. The same surface is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Series hosted.
"The Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of races, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the Australian V8 Supercar Championship Series, the GP2 Series, GP2 Asia, Chevrolet Lumina Series, Speedcar Series, Thunder Arabia and Radical."

"The Bahrain Grand Prix is usually the third race on the Formula One schedule. In the 2006 season, Bahrain traded places with the usual first race, the Australian Grand Prix. The Australian Grand Prix date was changed to avoid interfering with the Commonwealth Games. In , Bahrain was moved to the fourth race on the schedule. In , Bahrain was the first race of the season. For 2010, the Formula One cars raced on the full ""Endurance Circuit""."
"Starting in 2011, Formula One will return to the original track layout. This is the layout that was used in 2004."

The words of Roosevelt's citation explain:
"Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt distinguished himself by acts of bravery on 1 July 1898, near Santiago de Cuba, Republic of Cuba, while leading a daring charge up San Juan Hill. Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt, in total disregard for his personal safety, and accompanied by only four or five men, led a desperate and gallant charge up San Juan Hill, encouraging his troops to continue the assault through withering enemy fire over open countryside. Facing the enemy's heavy fire, he displayed extraordinary bravery throughout the charge, and was the first to reach the enemy trenches, where he quickly killed one of the enemy with his pistol, allowing his men to continue the assault. His leadership and valor turned the tide in the Battle for San Juan Hill. Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army."

MAC address
"Computers that use a computer network or internet network need to be identified. For this reason, many network connection types, like Ethernet or Wi-Fi, use unique addresses to identify the network card, a part of a computer, to access the network. These addresses are usually called the Media Access Control address or MAC address."
"Each computer is given a MAC address by its computer maker. The way for giving MAC addresses to computers, created by Xerox, is used. MAC addresses have 48-bits (how many 1s or 0s it has in it). As each of the twelve entries can have 16 possible values (0 through 9 and A through F), there are 1612 or 248 (or 281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. MAC addresses identify many things, such as the type of device being used."
A MAC address is used by the network to send and receive data (computer information) to the right place almost like mail being sent and received from a home mail address. The MAC address is like door number or street number.

Anna Freud (3 December 1895 – 9 October 1982) was the sixth and last child of Sigmund Freud and his wife Martha Bernays Freud.
She was born in Vienna. She followed the path of her father and contributed to the field of psychoanalysis.
"With Melanie Klein, she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology. As her father put it, child analysis had received a powerful impetus through ""the work of Frau Melanie Klein and of my daughter, Anna Freud"". Her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its ability to be trained socially."
Key moments in life.
"After a somewhat troubled childhood, Anna was psychoanalysed by her father. When her analysis was completed in 1922, she became a psychoanalyist herself. She taught at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Training Institute on the technique of child analysis. From 1925 until 1934, she was the Secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association. She continued child analysis and seminars and conferences on the subject."
"After the Anschluss in 1938 the Freuds fled Vienna and came to London. Freud himself was dying of cancer, so Anna ran the household. Anna had a professional disagreement with Melanie Klein, who had come to London much earlier, and was already established as a child psychologist. A series of 'controversial discussions' were held by the British Psychoanalytical Society. The discussions were about the training and the ideas of both parties. Eventually agreement was reached that both 'schools' should co-exist inside the Society. The Society now has three training divisions: Kleinian, Freudian and Independent."
"During the war, Freud studied the effect of deprivation of parental care on children. She set up a centre for young war victims, called ""The Hampstead War Nursery"". Here the children got foster care, with mothers"
encouraged to visit as often as possible.
"In 1947, Freud and Kate Friedlaender established the Hampstead Child Therapy Courses. Five years later, a children's clinic was added. Freud started lecturing on child psychology."
"From the 1950s until the end of her life Freud travelled regularly to the United States to lecture, teach and visit friends. During the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children. At Yale Law School, she taught seminars on crime and the family."
Freud died in London on 9 October 1982. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes placed in a marble shelf next to her parents' ancient Greek funeral urn. Her lifelong friend Dorothy Burlingham and several other members of the Freud family also rest there.
Personal life.
"Anna Freud lived with her close friend Dorothy Burlingham, daughter of Louis Comfort Tiffany, for years."

Parishes and municipalities.
Bermuda is divided into nine parishes and two municipalities.
Bermuda's nine parishes:
Bermuda's two municipalities:
Bermuda's two informal villages:
"Despite their names, Jones Village (in Warwick), Cashew City (St. George's), Claytown (Hamilton), Middle Town (Pembroke) and Tucker's Town (St. George's) are merely neighborhoods. Dandy Town and North Village are sports clubs and Harbour View Village is a small public housing development."
Economy.
"Bermuda has a wealthy economy, with finance as its largest sector, followed by tourism. In 2005, Bermuda was even claimed to have the world's highest GDP per capita, yet these statistics are hard to verify as Bermuda is not classified as a country but rather as a territory of the U.K."
Main sights.
"Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, cerulean blue ocean waters are popular with tourists. Many of Bermuda's hotels are along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a World Heritage Site. Scuba divers can explore many wrecks and coral reefs in shallow water (typically in depth) with nearly unlimited visibility. Many nearby reefs are easy to access from shore by snorkellers, especially at Church Bay."
"Bermuda's most popular visitor attraction is the Royal Naval Dockyard. It includes the Bermuda Maritime Museum. Other attractions include the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo, Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens, lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with its impressive stalactites and underground saltwater pools."
"It is not possible to rent a car on the island. However, visitors can hire motor scooters for use as private transport, or use public transport."
Arts and culture.
"Bermuda has produced, or been home to, actors such as Oona O'Neill, Earl Cameron, Diana Dill, Lena Headey, Will Kempe, and most famously, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Other movie and television personalities who were born, or have lived, in Bermuda include producer Arthur Rankin, Jr., and cartoonist and Muppet man Michael Frith."
"Music and dance are important in Bermuda. Noted musicians have included local icons The Talbot Brothers, who performed for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and were on Ed Sullivan's televised variety show. Other musicians are jazz pianist Lance Hayward, singer-songwriter Heather Nova and her brother, Mishka, tenor Gary Burgess, classical musician and conductor Kenneth Amis, and more recently, dancehall artist Collie Buddz."
"In 1979, Gina Swainson was crowned ""Miss World""."
Sports.
"Bermuda's national cricket team was in the Cricket World Cup 2007 in the West Indies. Their most famous player is Dwayne Leverock. Also very well known is David Hemp. The yearly ""Cup Match"" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the time for a popular national holiday."
In 2007 Bermuda hosted the 25th PGA Grand Slam of Golf. The event returned to Bermuda again in 2008 and 2009. Bermudian Quinn Talbot was once the World one-armed golf champion.
"The Government said in 2006 that it will provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and football teams. Bermuda's most famous footballers include Clyde Best, Shaun Goater, Reggie Lambe, Sam Nusum and Ralph Bean. In 2006, the Bermuda Hogges were formed as the nation's first professional football team. The team plays in the United Soccer Leagues Second Division."
"Sailing, fishing, and equestrian sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The Newport–Bermuda Yacht Race is a more than 100-year-old tradition. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy. International One Design racing also started in Bermuda."
"At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's Katura Horton-Perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver in the Olympic Games. Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, Clarence Hill. Hill won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also was in Men's Skeleton at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Jillian Teceira was in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Bermuda also competes in the biennial Island Games. It will host in 2013."
Bermuda has a proud Rugby Union community. The Bermuda Rugby Union team won the 2011 Caribbean championships – defeating Guyana in the final.
Bermuda Triangle.
"Bermuda is the easternmost point of the so-called ""Bermuda Triangle""– a region of sea in which a number of aircraft and ships have allegedly disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Some people think there is a pattern to the disappearances, while other people think it is only coincidence."
Tarja Halonen
"Tarja Halonen (born December 24, 1943) is the former President of Finland. She is from Helsinki. She was elected in 2000 and 2006. Her mandate ended in 2012 and she left office on 1 March 2012."
Turku
"Turku () is a city in Southwest Finland. It is the fifth-largest city in Finland, with a population of around 190,000."
"It is next to the municipalities of Aura, Kaarina, Lieto, Masku, Mynämäki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Pöytyä, Raisio and Rusko."
"On January 18, 2017, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at Houston Methodist Hospital, where he was sedated for a procedure to treat an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia."
"On April 22, 2018, after the burial of Bush's wife Barbara, he was hospitalized for sepsis and was placed under intensive care."
Death.
"Bush died on November 30, 2018 at his home in Houston from Parkinson's-related complications, aged 94. A state funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral."
"Tributes and condolences were offered by former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, and then-current President Donald Trump. He lied in state in the United States Capitol and was buried next to his wife at the George Bush Presidential Library."
Other names.
"Since Bush had the same first and last names as his son, he was often called George H. W. Bush or George Bush Sr. (George Bush senior). Some people call him ""41"" or ""Bush 41"" because he was the 41st President."
Comments on broccoli.
"In 1990, President of the United States, George H. W. Bush, made a casual remark about broccoli (a vegetable), and said he would never eat it."
"The President made this comment in 1990, shortly after a journalist from the U.S. News &amp; World Report broke the story that Bush banned the vegetable from Air Force One. George S. Dunlop, President of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, gave First Lady Barbara Bush a bouquet of the vegetable an additional 10 tons in trucks."
"A few days afterwards, Bush hosted a state dinner to honor Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Prime Minister of Poland, and journalists noted there was no broccoli on the menu, as most of the 10 tons of broccoli given to the President's family by the farmers had been donated to the Capital Area Food Bank."
Ohio
Ohio is one of the 50 states in the United States. Its capital is Columbus. Columbus is also the largest city in Ohio.
"Other large cities in Ohio are Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Akron, Toledo, and Youngstown."
"Some famous people from Ohio include golfer , Wilbur and Orville Wright, astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, authors Sherwood Anderson and Toni Morrison, and actors Clark Gable and Katie Holmes. There have also been seven American presidents from Ohio: Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding."
"Ohio is important in elections because it is a swing state. Candidates often campaign a lot there and prior to 2020, the last time they voted for the losing candidate was 1960. Also, no Republican has ever won the presidency without carrying this state. Ohio has both farmland and cities, and there is a lot of discrimination against black people. It is a part of the Midwest. Ohio is the 7th most populated state in the United States of America."
Geography.
"Ohio borders Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia, and it shares a water border with Ontario, Canada. Western Ohio is mostly flat farmland, with some hills. Southern and Southeastern Ohio is near the Appalachian Mountains, and is the most mountainous part of the state. Most of this area is covered by forests. This part of Ohio is home to the Ohio River, the Wayne National Forest, and the Hocking Hills, which has waterfalls and canyons."
"Central Ohio is mostly rolling hills, and is home to Columbus. Northeast Ohio is dominated by the Lake Erie coast and has a mix of cities and countryside."
Economy.
"For many years, industry and manufacturing was the biggest part of Ohio's economy. Youngstown was a big steel producer, as was Cleveland. Other manufacturing - including the car industry - was a major factor across the state. Since the 1970s, industry has shrank in Ohio, but it is still a big part of the local economy. Today, other businesses are more prominent. Cleveland is one of the biggest hubs for Healthcare, and its main hospital, the famous Cleveland Clinic, is the largest employer in the region. Banking is also a major business, and foods and retail are too. Cincinnati plays host to the headquarters of Fifth Third Bank, Cintas, Kroger, Luxottica, Procter &amp; Gamble and Macy's, whereas, Columbus hosts the headquarters of LBrands, JPMorgan Chase, Huntington Bank, Rogue Fitness, Wendy's, Big Lots, Cardinal Health and Nationwide Insurance. In addition The J.M. Smucker Company and Key Bank are also based in Ohio."
Greek
Greek can mean:
Relativity
The word relativity usually means two things in physics:
Principle of relativity
"In physics, the principle of relativity is the requirement that the equations describing the laws of physics is as same as the all frames of reference."
"In 300 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle thought that heavy objects fall faster than objects that are not heavy. The natural science of Aristotle was most popular in Western thought for 2,000 years."
"Linacre College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1962, and was the third graduate-only college at the University. It was the first graduate college founded at Oxford to admit both male and female students."
Botanical name
"A botanical name is a formal scientific name which follows the ""International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants"" (ICN). If it concerns a plant cultigen, the additional cultivar term must follow the ""International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants""."
"The code of nomenclature covers ""all organisms traditionally treated as plants, whether fossil or non-fossil, e.g. blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria); fungi, including chytrids, oomycetes, and slime moulds; photosynthetic protists and taxonomically related non-photosynthetic groups""."
"The purpose of a formal name is to have a single name which is accepted and used worldwide for a particular plant or plant group. For example, the botanical name ""Bellis perennis"" was given to a plant species which is native to most of the countries of Europe and the Middle East, where it has various names in many languages. Later it has been introduced worldwide, bringing it into contact with more languages."
"Some English names for this plant species are: daisy, English daisy, lawndaisy. In other languages, some examples are: , , , ."
"The cultivar ""Bellis perennis"" 'Aucubifolia' is a golden-variegated horticultural selection of this species."
Parts in a name.
"Depending on rank, botanical names may be in one part (genus and above), two parts (species and above, but below the rank of genus) or three parts (below the rank of species):"
"A name in three parts, i.e., an infraspecific name (a name for a taxon below the rank of species), needs a ""connecting term"" to indicate rank. In the ""Calystegia"" example above, this is ""subsp."" (for subspecies). In botany there are many ranks below that of species (in zoology there is only one such rank, subspecies, so that this ""connecting term"" is unnecessary there). A name of a ""subdivision of a genus"" also needs a connecting term (in the ""Acacia"" example above, this is ""subg."", subgenus). The connecting term is not part of the name itself."
Binary name.
"For botanical nomenclature, the ""ICBN"" prescribes a two-part name or binary name for any taxon below the rank of genus down to, and including the rank of species. Taxa below the rank of species get a three part name."
A binary name consists of the name of a genus and an epithet.
Jean Kent
"Jean Kent (Joan Mildred Summerfield; 29 June 1921 – 30 November 2013) was a British movie and television actress. She was also known as Jean Carr. She was born in Brixton, London. Kent was known for her role as Mille Harris in ""The Browning Version""."
"Kent died in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk on 30 November 2013, aged 92. She died following a fall a few days earlier at her home in Westhorpe, Suffolk."
House of Orléans
"The House of Orléans was a French noble and royal family. It descends from Louis XIV of France and his only brother Philippe, Duke of Orléans. The families main traditional home was the Palais Royal in Paris. The family later became very powerful during the reign of Louis Philippe I. He ruled France under the title ""King of the French"". The king successfully married his children into other royal families of Europe."
"The present head of the house is Prince Henri of Orléans. He is known as the Count of Paris. He also claims the title King of the French, but is known simply as ""His Royal Highness The Count of Paris"" and sometimes the ""Duke of France"". However, the titles are not officially recognised because France is no longer a monarchy. Henri has been a claimant to the throne since 1999. The Count was married to Duchess Marie Thérèse of Württemberg. She is herself a daughter of a one-time claimant to the throne of Württemberg."
Vicente Aleixandre
"Vicente Pío Marcelino Cirilo Aleixandre y Merlo (April 26, 1898 – December 14, 1984) was a Spanish poet. He was born in Seville. Aleixandre won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1977. He was part of the Generation of '27. He died in Madrid from tuberculosis in 1984."
Airline alliance
"An airline alliance is when two or more airlines make an agreement to work with each other. The three largest airline alliances are Star Alliance, SkyTeam, and Oneworld. Airline alliances make it easier for passengers to travel around the world, reducing their stops or connections. The biggest alliance is Star Alliance, which has 28 member airlines such as United, Lufthansa, and Air Canada. The second biggest is SkyTeam, which has 19 members including Delta, KLM, and Air France. The third biggest alliance is Oneworld, which has 13 members including American Airlines, British Airways, and Qantas."

The Five Satins
"The long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Many of its animals came from Africa, because the island is closer to Africa than to India. Many of these endemic Malagasy animals have died out since the arrival of humans, particularly the megafauna."
"Despite this, and massive deforestation, Madagascar is still home to an incredible array of wildlife. Most of this is unique."
Environment.
"Madagascar is home to many species that were not known about until around 1679 when Dutch explorers went there. They do not even exist elsewhere in Africa. They only exist in Madagascar. In fact, most of the mammals living in Madagascar do not live anywhere else in the world."
"Many species in Madagascar are in danger because much of the forest has been cut down. Forests are cut down so the land can grow crops such as coffee, which is an important export crop for Madagascar."
Economy.
"Agriculture is a big part of the economy in Madagascar, including the growing of coffee and vanilla. Madagascar sells more vanilla than any other country in the world. Madagascar also makes money from tourism."
Provinces.
In 2004 Madagascar was divided into 22 regions. It used to be divided into 6 provinces.
Human history.
People have probably lived in Madagascar for at least 2000 years.
"France took over the city of Antananarivo in 1895, and added Madagascar as a colony two years later. Madagascar became independent from France, which meant it became its own country, on 26 June, 1960. Philibert Tsiranana became the first president of Madagascar (1960-72)."
Board game
"A board game is a game usually played with pieces on a board, or some area with marked spaces."
"Most board games use pieces that may be moved, placed, or traded depending on the rules of the game. These pieces may be money, chips, pawns, or other objects. Board games may often involve some random chance with dice or cards. There are many board games with a long history in some cultures. Examples of these games are chess, checkers, backgammon, parqués, and go. There are also a great number of popular board games that have been created more recently, in the past hundred years. Among these games are Scrabble and Monopoly."
"Chess, and most versions of checkers, are played on a 8x8 square board with 32 white squares and 32 black squares. International checkers is played on a 10x10 square board."
"Older than chess, but not by much, is tafl (pronounced 'tabl'), later called ""hneftafl"". This is an old Norse board game with just two types of pieces. Its pieces, when found in Britain, have often been wrongly ascribed to chess. In chess, of course, the board is different, and there are six kinds of pieces."
Aerosmith
"Aerosmith is an American rock band, formed in 1970 in Boston, Massachusetts. They have released many popular songs, including ""Walk This Way"" and ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"". They have their own Guitar Hero video game called . Their lead singer is Steven Tyler."
Brighton
"Brighton is a city on the south coast of England. It was called ""Brighthelmstone"". It is in the county of East Sussex. In 2000, it joined Hove to become the city of Brighton &amp; Hove. Historically, Brighton forms the main part of the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation, with 474,485 inhabitants (2011 census). This is England's 12th largest conurbation, and the mostly densely populated area outside London."
History.
"From the 1730s, Brighton entered its second phase of development—one which brought a rapid improvement in its fortunes. The fad for bathing in seawater as a cure for illnesses was encouraged. From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France. Road transport to London was improved when the main road via Crawley was turnpiked in 1770. Spas and indoor baths were opened by physicians."
"From 1780, development of Georgian terraced houses started. The fishing village developed to the fashionable resort of Brighton. Growth of the town was encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) after his first visit in 1783. He spent much of his leisure time in the town, and had the Royal Pavilion built during the early part of his Regency."
"The arrival of the London and Brighton Railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of day-trippers from London. Some major attractions such as the West Pier and the Brighton Palace Pier were built for the growing number of tourists. The population grew from around 7,000 in 1801 to more than 120,000 by 1901."
"In 1984, a Provisional Irish Republican Army bombing killed five people."
"Modern-day Brighton is a centre for education, sports, and recreation. It has two universities: University of Sussex and the University of Brighton. It also has 54 other schools."
"In 2003, the universities of Sussex and Brighton formed a medical school, known as Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Brighton has a thriving LGBT community and every year in the first weekend in August Pride festivities are held."
"Ashford Black Marble is a kind of limestone which contains some carbon, and its particles are very small. Its dark color is from bitumen, and once cut and polished, the surface shines."
"At first the rock was mined from Arrock Mine, and later in 1832 from nearby Rookery Plantation, near Ashford-in-the-Water."
Manufacturing techniques.
"Ashford Black Marble can be manufactured into pots, candlesticks and other similar objects, or sawn to make smooth, flat items such as obelisks and paper weights. Derby Museum and Art Gallery has collections of worked and part-worked items of Ashford Black Marble, acquired from an inlaying workshop owned by the Tomlinson family. This collection also includes pieces of stones which were cut and ready to put into the black marble background. Forget-me-not and lily of the valley were typically designed. Various stones were used with Ashford Black Marble: Greys, blues and purples stones are from Monyash. ""Rosewood"" from Nettler Dale in Sheldon is a kind of barytes and has red and white layers. Castleton Blue John from Crich is a kind of flourspar and has purple and yellow colors. ""Birds-Eye"" rock has a design made from the fossils in it. ""Duke's Red"" is so valuable that it was stored at Chatsworth House. The tabletop design illustrated shows some of the combinations described here."
"In the late 1780s, Derbyshire geologist White Watson made geological picture boards using Ashford Black Marble into which other local rocks were inlaid. These boards show layers of rock in different parts of the county. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals."
"William Martin was once a partner with Watson, and wrote the first scientific study of fossils. His ""Petrifacta Derbiensia"" says that White Watson's uncle and workers at the Black Marble mine called some of the fossils ""crocodile tails"", because they thought they were the remains of crocodiles."
"In 2006, Buxton Museum bought the Black Marble collection that had been left by John Michael Tomlinson. He had spent over 50 years to collect them after finding that his ancestors had been involved in Ashford Black Marble manufacturing."
Tasmanian Wilderness
"The Tasmanian Wilderness is a term that is used for a range of areas in Tasmania, Australia."
"The World Heritage Areas in South West Tasmania, Western Tasmania and Central Highlands are the most well known."
"However, there are also other wilderness areas in Tasmania, Tarkine and the Cradle mountain wilderness. There is also an organisation known as the Tasmanian Wilderness Society."
"The World Heritage Area is one of the largest conservation areas in Australia, covering 13,800 km², or almost 20% of Tasmania. The area constitutes one of the last expanses of temperate wilderness in the world, including the renowned South West Wilderness. The area became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982, and it was extended in 1989. It is important for both its natural value but also its cultural values as well."
"Remains found in limestone caves show that humans have lived in the area for well over 20,000 years."
"The Tasmanian Tiger was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae. The last known specimen died in captivity in 1936.p77 The world's largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the Tasmanian Devil; it is the size of a small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger.p46 It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania.p69"
World Heritage area.
The following National Parks and reserves make up the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area:

Bronchiole
The bronchioles or bronchioli are a part of the lung. They are the first airway branches that no longer have cartilage. They are branches of the bronchi. The bronchioles end by entering the circular sacs called alveoli.
Full twisting layout
"""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"", also sung as ""Buddy, Can You Spare a Dime?"", is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. ""Yip"" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"" was part of the 1932 musical ""New Americana;"" the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era."
Summary.
"The song asks why the men who built the nation – built the railroads, built the skyscrapers – who fought in the war (World War I), who tilled the earth, who did what their nation asked of them should, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary, find themselves abandoned, in bread lines."
Musical structure.
"The song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word ""time"" in the line ""Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time,"" marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger – repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly """"Brother,"" can you spare a dime?"" is replaced with the aggressive """"Buddy,"" can you spare a dime?"""
Update.
"During the bad times in the 1970s, the ""New York Times"" asked Harburg to update ""Brother"" for a new age, and he responded with:"

Since 2007 this club plays in the Regionalliga West (3rd level)."
River Shannon
"The River Shannon is the longest river in Ireland. It runs mainly in a north/south direction, dividing Ireland geographically between east and west. It is thought to rise in Shannon Pot in County Cavan, and enters the sea in the Shannon Estuary at Limerick. The river represents a major physical barrier between east and west."
Rattlesden
"Rattlesden is a village and civil parish in Mid Suffolk, Suffolk, England. In 2001 there were 811 people living in Rattlesden."
Little Strickland
"Little Strickland is a village and civil parish near the M6 motorway in Eden, Cumbria, England."

"Crackenthorpe is a village and civil parish near the A66 road in Eden, Cumbria, England."
"Moulins, Allier"
"Moulins is a ""commune"" in the Allier department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in central France."
"It is the ""préfecture"" (capital) of the department and the historical capital of the old province of ""Bourbonnais"" (the Duchy of Bourbonnais)."
History.
"Moulins experienced its golden age in the 15th century, when the Dukes of Bourbon lived in the city on the Allier river. The region of the northern Massif Central where is Moulins is called the ""Bourbonnais"" after the House of Bourbon."
Moulins became the capital of Allier on 4 March 1790 with the creation of the departments in France.
Cell biology.
"The cells of an animal or higher plant have two sets of chromosomes: they are diploid. When gametes (sex cells) are produced, they have only one set of chromosomes: they are haploid. They have undergone a process of cell division called meiosis. Two things happen during meiosis, each of which makes the offspring more variable. That means they are different from the parents and from each other."
Assortment.
"Assortment is when the double set of chromosomes becomes a single set in each gamete. Of each pair of chromosomes, ""which one goes into a single gamete is random"". Because the gene alleles on each chromosome are not always the same, this means that there is genetic variation between gametes. This process was Mendel's 'first law', the law of segregation."
Crossing over.
"Because crossing over occurs during meiosis, this increases the variety of the chromosomes. This makes recombination possible."
The consequence of assortment and crossing over makes it certain that no two offspring of the same mother and father are identical. Identical twins are the exception. They are identical genetically because they developed from the same fertilised egg.
Advantages and disadvantages.
"There are advantages and disadvantages of sexual reproduction, compared to asexual reproduction. The main issues are:"
Origin of sexual reproduction.
The origin of sexual reproduction is an advanced topic which cannot be dealt with here. A source which may help readers who are graduates in biological science may be helpful.
Leprosy
"Leprosy is a contagious disease. It has been known for a very long time. Today, it is mostly called Hansen's disease, named after the person who discovered the bacterium, Gerhard Armauer Hansen. It is caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae. A person with leprosy is called a leper."
"As of 2004, the estimated number of new infections was about 400,000."
"Getting the disease is hard, since it requires close contact with someone who has it, over a long period of time. In addition, about 95% of people seem to be naturally immune to it."
"Most cases of leprosy occur in India, and other developing countries. It has known to have been in the US before. There are practically no cases of leprosy in the developed world. This is because there are excellent drugs and people regularly take antibiotics which will kill the leprosy bacteria."
"In former times, leprosy was seen as a divine punishment for sins committed."
Symptoms.
"The symptoms of leprosy are irregular spots and patches on the skin. These are either lighter colored than the surrounding skin, or reddish in color. On those patches, hair will fall out, and they will feel numb to the patient. Nerves will form knots there."
"With the illness progressing the sense of touch will become less and less (until the patient feels completely numb). So called leptomes and ulcers will eat away the skin, the flesh and the organs on the patches."
"Usually people do not die of leprosy, but of secondary infections and diseases they get."
For many years there was a leprosy colony on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai called Kalaupapa. Tens of thousands of people from the United States that had the disease were sent there.
Dolley Madison
"Dolley Payne Todd Madison (May 20, 1768 – July 12, 1849) was the wife of US President James Madison. James Madison was president from 1809 to 1817 while Dolley Madison was the First Lady of the United States. She is best known for saving Washington's portrait when the British burned the White House in the War of 1814. Though she is also a famous entertainer, the first to serve ice cream in the White House."
"Dolley was born in New Garden. Now the place is known as Guilford County. It is in North Carolina. Some other account tells that she was born in a village named Payne’s Tavern. It is in Person County, North Carolina."
"Her father’s name was John Payne. As an unsuccessful farmer, he always faced shortage of money. Dolley’s mother was Mary Coles."
"Dolley spent her teenage years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On January 7, 1790, she married John Todd, Jr. (1764-1793). Todd was a lawyer. They had two sons. Their names were John Payne (1792-1852) and William Temple (born and died in 1793). William died in a yellow fever epidemic. In the same year, her husband also died of the same yellow fever epidemic."
"Dolley Todd married James Madison on September 14, 1794. They had no children, but they raised Dolley's son from her first marriage, John Payne Todd. John Payne Todd was a notorious drunkard and gambler, which caused his mother many financial problems, especially after Madison died."
"In 1814, the British army had burnt the White House. Fleeing from her burning home, Dolley saved many records and papers. Legend states she also saved a painting of George Washington, though had to break it out of its frame."
"On the National First Lady Library she says, ""There is one secret, and that is the power we have in forming our own destinies."""
University of London
"The University of London is a federal university made up of 31 affiliates: 19 separate university institutions, and 12 research institutes."
"Its headquarters, Senate House, is in Malet Street in the Bloomsbury area of Camden. This is near University College London and the British Museum."
"The University of London is the largest university in the UK by number of full-time students, with 135,090 campus-based students and over 45,000 in the University of London International Programmes."
"The constituent colleges are responsible for the teaching, the research or the individual students and staff of the constituent colleges; the university is not. The university is an administrative body responsible for standards, degree examinations and certification."
"The university was first established by a Royal Charter in 1836, which brought together in federation ""London University"" (now University College London) and ""King's College"" (now King's College London)."
"Graduates of the University of London may use the post-nominal letters 'Lond.' or 'Londin.' (both from ""Londiniensis"") after their degree abbreviations."
"The university's biggest colleges are Birkbeck, Goldsmiths, King's College London, the London Business School, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway, SOAS, LSE and UCL."
History.
"Founded in 1836, the University at first comprised just two colleges. They were University College London (founded in 1826), which did not apply religious tests to its students, and King's College (founded in 1829), which admitted only members of the Church of England. Therefore, both University College and King's pre-date the University of London, which initially served solely as an examining body for the constituent colleges."
"In 1858 the University expanded its role by offering the University of London International Programmes to candidates outside the colleges, the first of its kind in the country. A new headquarters at 6 Burlington Gardens, providing the university with exam halls and offices, was built to accommodate the new role."
"In 1878 the University became the first university in the UK to admit women on equal terms with men. Four female students obtained Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1880 and two obtained Bachelor of Science degrees in 1881, again the first in the country."
Friedrich III of Germany
"Friedrich Wilhelm Nikolaus Karl von Hohenzollern (New Palace, Potsdam ; 18 October 1831 - New Palace, Potsdam ; 15 June 1888) was the only son of Wilhelm I."
"After his father's death on 9 March 1888 Friedrich Wilhelm became King of Prussia and German Emperor as Friedrich III, but he was already suffering from throat cancer and died after just 99 days on the throne."
"On 25 January 1858 he married Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom, eldest child of Queen Victoria and Albert the Prince Consort. They had seven children. The oldest, Friedrich Wilhelm, followed him as King and Emperor."
"Friedrich Wilhelm III died of throat cancer in Potsdam. He is buried next to his wife in the Mausoleum of the Friedenskirche in Sanssouci Park, Potsdam."
King's College London
"King's College London (King's or KCL) is a large university in London, and a college of the federal University of London."
"University College London (1826) was founded before it. However, King's (1829) was the third oldest university in England to get its royal charter."
"In 1836 King's became, with University College, one of the two founding colleges of the University of London."
"King's is arranged into nine Schools of Study, spread across four Thames-side campuses in central London and one in Denmark Hill, South London."
"King's is one of the largest centres for graduate and post-graduate medical teaching and biomedical research in Europe. It is home to six Medical Research Council centres, the most of any British university."
"King's has around 18,600 full-time students and 5,030 staff and had a total income of £508 million in 2009/10, of which £144 million was from research grants and contracts."
"There are 12 Nobel Prize winners amongst King's alumni and former faculty. King's is ranked 5th nationally and 19th in the world in the 2015 ""QS World University Rankings,"" 7th nationally and 27th in the world in the 2015 ""The Times Higher Education World University Rankings ""and 7th nationally and 55th in the world in the 2015"" ""Academic Ranking of World Universities. In September 2010, ""The Sunday Times"" selected King's as its ""University of the Year""."
King's is a member of the European University Association and the Russell Group. It forms part of the 'Golden Triangle' of British universities.
Ganggangsullae
"Ganggangsullae (Hangul: 강강술래) is a 5,000-year-old traditional Korean dance. It was first used to bring a good harvest and has become a cultural symbol for Korea. The females in Jeollanam-do usually dance this the most. Chuseok, the Korean style holiday a bit like the American Thanksgiving, is often known as the special day for this dance."
History.

Hasse moved to Venice in 1773. He taught singing and wrote music for the Incurabili. He died in 1783. People forgot about him after he died.
Bride kidnapping
"Bride kidnapping is when a man abducts the woman he wants to marry. The practice is also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by capture,"
"Bride kidnapping (which is often shortened to bridenapping) has been practiced around the world, throughout history. Peoples as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe have done it."
Bride kidnapping still occurs in different parts of the world. It is most common in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
"Most countries see bride kidnapping as a sex crime, and not as a valid form of marriage. In some cases, it is seen somewhere beteen a forced marriage and an arranged one."
"In many cases, the woman will cooperate with the kidnapper, to save her face, or to save the honour of her family or her parents."
"Many countries also have laws that say that this is not a crime, if the woman later marries the man. Very often, there are also customs, which see bride kidnapping as some form of tradition."
"In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime because of the implied element of rape, rather than a valid form of marriage. Some types of it may also be seen as falling along the continuum between forced marriage and arranged marriage. The term is sometimes confused with elopements, in which a couple runs away together and seeks the consent of their parents later. In some cases, the woman cooperates with or accedes to the kidnapping, typically in an effort to save face for herself or her parents. In many jurisdictions, this used to be encouraged by so-called marry-your-rapist laws. Even in countries where the practice is against the law, if judicial enforcement is weak, customary law (""traditional practices"") may prevail."
"Bride kidnapping is often (but not always) a form of child marriage. It may be connected to the practice of bride price, wealth paid by the groom and his family to the bride's parents, and the inability or unwillingness to pay it."
"Bride kidnapping is when one man (or a man and his friends) abduct one woman. When this is done on a larger scale (a large group of men abducting many women), this is known as raptio, and different from bride kidnapping. In the 21st century, there have been more cases of war rape, which may have elements of bride kidnapping. Women and girls abducted by groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and ISIS in the Middle East have been taken as wives by their abductors."
"In some countries, there are still rituals, which involve a symbolic bride kidnapping as part of a wedding. Some say that the honeymoon is a relic of such a practice: the husband going into hiding with his wife to avoid reprisals from her relatives, with the intention that the woman would be pregnant by the end of the month."
Jamaican snoring frog
"The Jamaican snoring tree frog, lichened tree toad, green-backed tree toad, or Harlan's Antilles frog (""Osteopilus crucialis"") is a frog. It lives in Jamaica. Scientists have seen it as high as 1200 meters above sea level."
Boris Lagutin
"Boris Nikolayevich Lagutin () (24 June 1938 – 4 September 2022) was a Soviet light middleweight boxer. He was born in Moscow, Russia. He won a bronze medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics and two gold medals at the 1964 and 1968 Summer Olympics."
Lagutin died on 4 September 2022 in Moscow at the age of 84.
Rodrigo González Torres
"Rodrigo René González Torres (26 September 1941 – 4 September 2022) was a Chilean politician. He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 2002 until his death. He was a member of the Party for Democracy. He was also Mayor of Viña del Mar from 1992 to 1994 and again from 1996 to 2000. He was born in Viña del Mar, Chile."
González Torres died on 4 September 2022 from an aortic dissection in Viña del Mar at the age of 80.
2022 Saskatchewan stabbings
"On September 4, 2022, a stabbing spree happened in thirteen locations on the James Smith Cree Nation and in Weldon, Saskatchewan, Canada. 10 people were killed and 15 others hospitalized. It is one of the deadliest massacres in Canadian history."
"31-year-old Damien Sanderson and 30-year-old Myles Sanderson are the suspects and police are currently looking for them. Some of the victims are believed to have been targeted, while others were randomly attacked."
Hero – Gayab Mode On
"Hero – Gayab Mode On is an Indian fantasy television series produced by Peninsula Pictures. It premiered on 7 December 2020 on SAB TV, and stars Abhishek Nigam in the titular lead role opposite Yesha Rughani and Tunisha Sharma."
Black Forest cake
"The Black Forest cake, also called ""Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte"", is an authentic German cake made up of a chocolate layer cake with cherries in the middle and whipped cream on top. They are traditionally made with fresh Morello cherries, poached in a sugar syrup and pitted. It is a variation of the chocolate cake, and sometimes decorated with chocolate curls."
Jeremy Clarkson
"Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson (born 11 April 1960) is an English author, broadcaster, journalist, talk show host. He is best known for presenting BBC television show ""Top Gear"" with Richard Hammond and James May. He is also known for controversial remarks."
He also writes columns for The Sunday Times and The Sun.
Clarkson was ranked 49th on Motor Trend Magazine's Power List for 2011. It is a list of the fifty most important figures in the automotive industry.
"On 26 March 2015, while Clarkson was not allowed to be at work, the BBC announced it will not keep paying him after he said cruel things to and attacked a producer."
Syd Ward
Sydney William Ward (5 August 1907 – 31 December 2010) was an Australian-born New Zealand cricketer.
"Ward was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born in Sydney, New South Wales. He is the second longest-lived cricketer, behind England's Jim Hutchinson, who at the time of his death was 103 years and 344 days old."
Hypothermia
"Hypothermia is a condition when a person is so cold that the body temperature drops below normal. Hypothermia is any body temperature lower than . Someone with hypothermia starts shivering and cannot stop. The person then becomes confused and acts strange. Their words don't make sense and they may be clumsy. Sometimes they become very tired. If someone gets hypothermia, wrap the person in blankets and take them to the hospital. If that's impossible, warm up the person slowly and give them a warm drink."
Mild.
"When hypothermia begins, a person feels cold, starts shivering and can't stop. The person cannot do complicated things with his or her hands. They are also unable to touch their thumb with their little finger, because their hand muscles don't work well."
"Mild hypothermia is sometimes used on purpose by doctors for treating some medical problems. It takes blood away from the skin, hands and feet, and puts it to the brain and important internal organs. This helps when the person is bleeding from cuts or other wounds, and also helps when the patient goes into cardiac arrest."
Moderate (Middle).
"The person begins shivering very strongly. Their large muscles do not work well. They move slowly and with difficulty, growing a little confused and walking unsteadily. The person becomes pale, and lips, ears, fingers, and toes might become blue. This is because the body is trying to keep the most important organs warm. The person might feel sick in their stomach and very tired, wanting to go to sleep, anywhere."
Severe.
"Body temperature drops even more, but the person usually stops shivering. They cannot talk clearly; they think slowly, and they cannot move their hands. Sometimes a person will feel suddenly warm, as if they are getting better, but this just means they are getting worse. They may take off warm clothes or lay down to go to sleep. If this continues, they cannot walk or answer questions. Their pulse becomes weaker, but the heart may beat faster. Finally, the person dies."
Rapids
"Rapids are found on rivers. Rapids are formed by one or more of the following: constriction, obstruction, gradient, and flow rate. For instance, when water is flowing swiftly over a rocky river bed, rapids can be formed. Rapids are typically found in or near the mountains, due to the element of gradient. Formally, the word ""rapids"" is always plural, (like ""scissors"" and ""trousers""), but is often used in the singular when speaking of a specific rapid or when it would be grammatically awkward; e.g., ""Sweet's Falls Rapids vs. Sweet's Falls Rapid). The word ""rapid"" means ""very fast."""
"Because of the splash made by the water going over rocks, rapids are also called ""whitewater"". Some people enjoying whitewater canoeing or whitewater rafting as a sport."
Waray language
"Wáray-Wáray or Warai (commonly spelled as ""Waray""; also ""Winaray"" or ""Lineyte-Samarnon"") is a language spoken in the provinces of Samar, Leyte, and Biliran in the Philippines."
"The Waraynon group of languages consists of Waray, Waray Sorsogon and Masbate Sorsogon. All the Warayan languages belong to the Visayan language family and are related to Cebuano and more closely to Hiligaynon and Masbatenyo."
Usage.
"Waray-Waray is one of the ten officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines and used in the local government. It is spoken throughout the islands especially in the Eastern Visayas region. But it is also spoken in some parts of Mindanao, Masbate, Sorsogon and Metro Manila where Warays went to. There is also a very small number of Filipinos abroad, especially in the United States, that speaks this language."
43 × 0 = 0
0 ÷ 43 = 0
43 ÷ 0 has an undefined answer.
0 ÷ 0 has no answer.
"The following table includes all of the above examples along with other operations in a condensed, generalized form (where ""x"" represents any number)."
History of zero.
"The idea of zero was first thought about in Babylon, India and in Central America at different times. Some places and countries did not know about zero, which may have made it harder for those people to do mathematics. For example, the year after 1 BC is AD 1 (there is no year zero). In India, zero was theorized in the seventh century by the mathematician Brahmagupta."
"Over hundreds of years, the idea of zero was passed from country to country, from India and Babylon to other places, like Greece, Persia and the Arab world. The Europeans learned about zero from the Arabs, and stopped using Roman math. This is why numbers are called ""Arabic numerals""."
The place of zero as a number.
"Zero is almost never used as a place number (ordinal number). This means that it is not used like 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the order, or place, of something, like 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. An exception to this is seen in many programming languages."
Some other things about zero:
"Any number divided by itself equals one, except if that number is zero. In symbols:"
"0 ÷ 0 = ""not a number."""
"In time, zero means ""now"". For example, when a person is counting down the time to the start of something, such as a foot race or when a rocket takes off, the count is: ""three, two, one, zero (or ""go"")"". Zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the rocket takes off into the sky."
0 as a number.
Definition.
"0 is the integer that precedes the positive 1, and follows −1. In most (if not all) numerical systems, 0 was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted. It means ""courageous one"" in hieroglyphics."
"Zero is a number which means an amount of null size; that is, if the number of brothers is zero, that means the same thing as having no brothers, and if something has a weight of zero, it has no weight. If the difference between the numbers of pieces in two piles is zero, it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces. Before counting starts, the result can be assumed to be zero; that is the number of items counted before one counts the first item, and counting the first item brings the result to one. And if there are no items to be counted, zero remains the final result."
Debates.
Is zero a number ?
"While mathematicians all accept zero as a number, some non-mathematicians would say that zero is not a number, arguing that one cannot have zero of something. Others say that if one has a bank balance of zero, one has a specific quantity of money in that account, namely none. It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others."
Is zero a natural number ?
A debate asking if 0 is or not a natural number has been discussed over time.
Encyclopædia Britannica says 0 is a natural number. Wolfram MathWorld´says it isn't. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences says it isn't. The Princeton Companion to Mathematics says 0 is a natural number.
"Although the International Baccalaureate thinks 0 to be a natural number. Oxford Dictionary says ""a positive whole number such as 1, 2, or 3, and sometimes also zero""."
As year.
"There was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD. More specifically, almost all historians leave out the year zero from the proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars (that is, from the normal calendar used in English-speaking countries), but astronomers include it in these same calendars. However, the phrase Year Zero may be used to describe any event considered so important, that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero."
0 as a numeral.
"The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or (rounded) rectangle. In old-style fonts with text figures, 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x."
"On the seven-segment displays of calculators, watches, etc., 0 is usually written with six line segments, though on some historical calculator models, it was written with four line segments. The four-segment 0 is not common."
"The ""number"" zero (as in the ""zero brothers"" example above) is not the same as the ""numeral"" or ""digit"" zero, used in numeral systems using positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher values, so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system. Something called bijective numeration is a possible example of a system without zeroes."
The numerical digit zero.

Yi I
"Yi I (December 26, 1536–1584) was a Korean Confucian scholar. His mother was a famous calligraphist, Shin Saimdang. He was very intelligent as a child, learning to read at three and being very bright at his studies. He was also devoted to his parents: when his mother was sick, he prayed to his ancestors to heal her; and when his father was sick, he cut his own finger with a knife and let his father drink his blood (at that time, people thought human blood was very good medicine)."

X-ray
"X-radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays are waves of X-radiation. X-rays have a shorter wavelength, and therefore more energy, than ultraviolet radiation. They have a much shorter wavelength than visible light (the light that we can see). Radiation with shorter wavelengths (more energy) than the X-ray is called Gamma radiation (γ-rays). These are all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
The wavelength of X-rays covers a wide range. Most X-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometres. This corresponds with frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×1016 Hz to 3×1019 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV.
"X-rays can go through many solid materials. For this reason, taking photograms with X-rays is used in medicine in order to see bones and other things inside the body. Sometimes the term ""X-Ray"" means these pictures instead of the radiation that makes them."
"What these images show will depend on three things: Rayleigh scattering, Compton scattering and photoabsorption. The images show bone because it is dense enough that X-rays are not able to pass through it. Instead, the X-rays are either absorbed or scattered. The images do not show skin and muscle, however, because these tissues are transparent enough for the X-rays to pass through them without being absorbed too much. To detect tumors, other imaging devices are used; such as magnetic resonance imaging. A computed tomography scanner combines an X-ray machine and computer to construct a three dimensional (3D) picture. This has some ability to see other things besides bone."
"X-rays are made by hitting metal with fast-moving electrons. They are photons, tiny packets of energy that can move atoms and change chemicals in the body. They are ionizing radiation but the things they do depend on the wavelength of the X-rays (or how much energy they have). X-rays with smaller energies (""soft"" x-rays) cause the photoelectric effect. Mid-level energies cause Compton scattering. High-level energies (""hard"" X-rays) cause pair production. X-rays used for making pictures of people have low to medium energy. Radiation therapy that treats cancer uses Compton scattering and sometimes Pair production."
"There are small amounts of X-rays in the air. Like other energy in the air, X-rays can change living cells. Exposing the human body to high doses of X-rays for a long time is dangerous. It can cause cancer. However, cancer cells are hurt more easily, so X-rays are sometimes used to kill them."
Computed tomography scanner
A computed tomography (CT) scanner is an X-ray machine that takes cross section images. They can help a doctor in diagnosis.
Hanoi
"Hanoi () is the capital of Vietnam. It is also the second most populated city in the country. In 2004, about 3,083,800 people lived in the city. It has been the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) since 1945 and the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (all of Vietnam) since 1976. Before that, it was the capital of the country now called Vietnam for most of the time from at least the 11th century until 1802. The city is on the right of the Red River, and the city's name translates to English as ""inside the river"". Things made there include machine tools, plywood, textiles, chemicals and handicrafts. Hanoi is at 21°2' North, 105°51' East, 1,760 km north of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). Popular tourist sites in the city include Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum, Hoa Lo Prison, and the Palace of Literature. Nearby Hanoi is also where pho, Vietnamese beef noodle soup, was first created."

"Al-Nassr's kit colors are yellow and blue. The logo resembles the Arabian Peninsula with the same colors, symbolizing the sand of Saudi Arabia and the sea near it."
Grosvenor Bridge
"Grosvenor Bridge, also called Victoria Railway Bridge, is a railway bridge over the River Thames in London, between Vauxhall Bridge and Chelsea Bridge."
"It is made up of two bridges that were both built in the mid-19th century. The eastern side was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1858-60 to carry trains into Victoria Station. This was the first railway bridge across the Thames in central London. The western side was built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1865/66."
"Both bridges were rebuilt in steel in 1963–67, the original piers now being wrapped in concrete. The designer for this work was Freeman Fox &amp; Partners."
"On the north bank is Pimlico to the north and east and Chelsea to the west. The Lister Hospital and the Royal Chelsea Hospital are immediately to the north west. On the south bank is Nine Elms to the east and Battersea to the west. Battersea Power Station is immediately to the south of the bridge, and Battersea Park to the south west."
Vauxhall Bridge
Vauxhall Bridge is a steel and granite bridge in central London. It crosses the River Thames in a north-west south-east direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Westminster on the north bank.
History.
Vauzhall Bridge in 1906. It replaced an earlier bridge as part of a program for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry.
"The building of both bridges was difficult, with both the first and second bridges needing multiple redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and was run as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane."
The present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames.
"In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames."
Ambrose Burnside
"Ambrose Everett Burnside (May 23, 1824 – September 13, 1881) was an American soldier, railroad executive and politician. He served as governor of Rhode Island (1866-1869) and U.S. Senator from Rhode Island. As a Union Army general in the American Civil War, he fought successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee but was defeated in the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg and Battle of the Crater. Burnside commanded the IX Corps, the Department of Ohio, and also the Army of the Potomac for a few months. His distinctive style of facial hair is now known as sideburns, derived from his last name."
List of crossings of the River Thames
"This is a list of crossings of the River Thames including bridges, tunnels and ferries. There are almost 214 bridges, over 20 tunnels, six public ferries and one ford. The list starts at the downstream (Estuary) end and follows the river upstream towards the start of the river."
"A few of the crossings listed are public pedestrian crossings making use of walkways across lock gates and bridges above or near-by weirs. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and weirs, but these either do not fully cross the river, or are for the use of authorised people only, and are so are not listed."
"Besides the ferry crossings listed, there are commuter boat services along the river in the city of London, and tourist boat services running both in London and upstream. Although the main purpose of these services is not to carry people across the river, it may be possible to use them to do so."
Railway Gazette International
"Railway Gazette International is a monthly business journal about the railway, metro, light rail and tram industries worldwide. Available by yearly subscription, the magazine is read in over 140 countries by people involved in the railway industry. A mixture of technical, commercial and geographical articles, plus the regular monthly news pages, cover developments in all parts of the rail industry."

"Joint resolution 39 was passed by the House of Representatives in 1911 proposing a constitutional amendment to directly elect US Senators. The Senate accepted the resolution but since it included a change, it went back to the House. The amended Joint resolution was sent to the states for ratification a year later. The required three-quarters of the states ratified the amendment and the Seventeenth Amendment became official on April 8, 1913."
Clauses.
Clause 1.
"The people of the United States are to elect two Senators from each state, for six years. Each Senator will have one vote in the Senate. There are 100 Senators and 100 votes. ""The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures"" means that anyone who can vote in a state election in their state, may also vote for a Senator. In the archaic language of the Constitution this was written in such a way to allow for states having different qualifications for persons eligible to vote for their Senator."
Clause 2.
"The clause. Previously, when vacancies occurred, several state legislatures were not able to agree on who would fill the position. Before the Seventeenth Amendment, vacancies could last for months and even years in some cases. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, if a Senator dies or has to leave office, his state governor may appoint a temporary Senator until a special election can be held."
Clause 3.
"This is a simple addition to prevent the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment from interrupting the election or term of any Senator chosen before the amendment was passed. The United States Senate elections, 1914 were the first nationwide popular elections for Senators."

Flint water crisis
"The Flint water crisis is a drinking water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan which began in April 2014. When the city changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water to the Flint River, it created a serious public health danger."
"In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have been exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead. They may experience serious health problems. The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that has killed 10 people in the county."
"On January 5, 2016, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency for Flint. President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency. He authorized additional help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security almost two weeks later."
Legionnaires' disease
"Legionnaires' disease is a form of pneumonia caused by any type of ""Legionella"" bacteria. Over 90% of cases are caused by ""Legionella pneumophila""."
"The length of time between exposure to the bacteria and the appearance of symptoms is generally two to ten days. It can be as much as 20 days. People with Legionnaires' usually have fever, chills, and a cough. Some also have muscle aches, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite, diarrhea or vomiting."

COVID-19 pandemic
"The COVID-19 pandemic, also called the coronavirus pandemic, is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of September 4, 2022, more than 600 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in almost every country on Earth. More than six million people have died of COVID-19, and more than 580 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease."
"The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing or sneezing. It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech, followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining."
"The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats. This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. It possibly originated at a wet market, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic."
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
"In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people."
"25 other vaccines have been approved by at least one country, and many others are being developed."
"The United States has the most deaths from the virus. More than 1,000,000 Americans have died from the virus. California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country."
Epidemiology.
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.
Background.
"On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020."
"On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends."
Cases.
Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University.
"The United States has a history in intelligence services dating back to its origins. During the American Revolution, George Washington and other Founding Fathers of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, and Patrick Henry used espionage networks."
"The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency has been Gina Haspel since April 26, 2018."
"The CIA is made up of four groups, which do different things. Its goal is to protect the US people. Many people feel that the CIA does more bad than good. Others people that the CIA does good by finding out secret information about enemies of the United States. Others think those secrets should remain secret. American law makes it illegal for the CIA and other agencies to kill foreign leaders."
"In 1992, Saddam Hussein tried to kill US President George H.W. Bush, who used to be director of the CIA, during a visit to Kuwait. The assassination plot failed. In revenge, President Bill Clinton ordered cruise missiles to be fired at the building of the Iraqi equivalent to the CIA. That occurred at night and so only the cleaners were killed, not those who had planned the assassination."
"CIA has many clandestine, or secret, operations. Some CIA employees have been killed during their work. Their names are on a CIA memorial with a star for them, but some of the names are still secret. The number of stars is deliberately inaccurate."
"The CIA also uses open sources to gather information. Analysts read foreign newspapers and watch foreign news broadcasts to learn information, which can be pieced together to make a conclusion."
"The CIA used to report to the President. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, a reorganization made the CIA and other intelligence agencies report to a Director of National Intelligence."
"The CIA has been featured in many television and film productions, including the American television show ""The Agency,"" the American television mini-series ""The Company,"" the film ""Spy Game"" that stars Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, ""Night Flight to Moscow"" that stars Yul Brenner, ""Scorpio"" that stars Burt Lancaster, ""Clear and Present Danger"" that stars Harrison Ford; ""Ice Station Zebra,"" and several James Bond films that featured the CIA agent Felix Leiter."

Rio de Janeiro
"Rio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil. It is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Until April 21, 1960 it was the capital city of Brazil. According to the 2000 Census, the city had 5,473,909 people, and an area of over 1,000 km2. In 2008 Eduardo Paes became Mayor. The city was started in 1565."
"Copacabana Beach, Ipanema Beach, Sugar Loaf Mountain (in Portuguese, ""Pão de Açúcar""), the statue of Christ the Redeemer (in Portuguese, ""Cristo Redentor""), a harbor on Guanabara Bay, and Tom Jobim Airport are in Rio de Janeiro. It has much commerce and many industries, especially textiles, food, chemicals, and metallurgy. Most of these industries are in the northern and western suburbs of the city. Rio de Janeiro also has a small rural area, near the suburb of Campo Grande, where fruits and vegetables are grown."
"Other cities near Rio de Janeiro, like Duque de Caxias, Nova Iguaçu, Queimados and São Gonçalo, that form the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro, also have a lot of industries and population."
"The city is 420 kilometers (about 261 miles) away from São Paulo, the biggest city in South America. The cities of Rio and São Paulo are linked by the Presidente Dutra Highway (also known as ""Via Dutra""). The region crossed by the Presidente Dutra Highway has been an important industrial zone since the 1950s."
"In the city of Rio de Janeiro lies Tijuca National Park, created in 1961. This park contains some 33 km2, between the northern and the southern parts of the city. The district (in Portuguese, ""bairro"") of Santa Tereza can be reached by taking an electric tram (in Portuguese, ""bonde"") from central Rio de Janeiro (near ""Largo da Carioca"" subway station), crossing over the ""Arcos da Lapa"", an aqueduct built during the colonial period to provide water to the city."
The city hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 2016.
Bubble tea
"Bubble tea, also called pearl tea or Boba, is a drink which comes from Taichung, Taiwan. It is made by mixing black tea with non-dairy creamer or milk and adding round ""pearl"" tapioca. There are many flavors other than the original one. Green tea can be used instead of black tea. Extra items such as honey, coffee or cocoa can be added. Pudding or coconut cubes can be used instead of pearl tapioca."
"When it was first invented, not many people were interested in it. But after a bubble tea maker was interviewed on a Japanese TV program, it became popular among people of all ages. The popularity of bubble tea can be seen not only in Taiwan but also in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, Canada and the USA."
Bubble tea has now arrived in England and the rest of Europe.
Things that are in bubble tea.
"Most bubble tea recipes contain a tea base mixed with fruit or milk, to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. Ice-mixed versions are usually mixed with fruit or syrup, resulting in a slushy softness. There are many varieties of the drink with a huge range of ingredients like coconut or mango. The two most popular types are bubble milk tea with tapioca and bubble milk green tea with tapioca."
The reason for choosing tapioca.
"At first, people made bubble tea without tapioca pearls. But Taiwanese people started to find substances to make the sweetened flavor. Tapioca came from the cassava plant, which is a root of the trees from South America. This plant is now farmed and enjoyed around the world."
Effects on the body from bubble tea.
"Four positive nutrients that tapioca provide are carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds. These include a very low level of fat, cholesterol, and sodium . It is also known as the source of fiber, “good” cholesterol, and protein. But bubble tea has Cyanogen that are transformed in humans and animals after the plant tissue has been weakened. The blood remains oxygenated after it passes through your body and back to the lungs."
Process to make bubble tea.
"Bubble tea is found in Taiwanese restaurants and commonly prepared by shaking ice, milk, tea, and sugar in a cocktail shaker which resulted in a lot of tapioca bubbles. People use the same preparation to make bubble tea, just now with the added Pearls."

Post-election.
"The only realistic possibility would be a coalition government of the CDU, SPD and the Greens. Together, they would have a 2-seat majority . Other combinations (such as the CDU and The Left or CDU and AfD) are highly unlikely. The stark differences among the parties will make it harder for negotiations to create a coalition."

Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on January 23, 1933, the Twentieth Amendment (Amendment XX) to the United States Constitution moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the president and vice president from March 4 to January 20. It moved the start and end dates for members of Congress from March 1 to January 21. In both cases the start and end time is at noon. It also gives the procedure to follow if for some reason there is no president-elect."
Background.
"In the later part of the eighteenth century, when the Constitution was written, travel and communications were both very slow by modern standards. To cross the Atlantic Ocean could take several weeks. Traveling by horseback or by carriage on crude roads in the US could take even longer. Communications were mainly by letter or messenger. For these reasons the framers of the Constitution allowed for the longer periods of time it took to send and receive messages. Four months, the time from the election in November to the swearing-in in March, was necessary at the time."
"By the 1930s, a railroad passenger could cross the country in 3 days. The Post Office had been using airmail since 1918. But vastly improved travel times and communications were not the only reasons behind the Twentieth Amendment. The joint resolution calling for the amendment was sponsored by Republican Senator George William Norris of Nebraska. Called the ""Lame Duck"" Amendment, it acquired this name because Norris wanted to eliminate the lame-duck sessions of Congress where outgoing members still held office and voted on bills for several months before the new members could be sworn in. The bill he wrote applied to both houses of Congress, the offices of President and Vice-President."
Another area the amendment addressed was with the succession of the president if the president-elect died before taking office. It provides for the vice-president elect to become the president-elect and take office on January 20. The amendment also give Congress the power to legislate on other issues dealing with the succession of the president.
Effects of the Twentieth Amendment.
"The sessions of Congress between the election and the beginning of a new term are called ""lame duck"" sessions because members of Congress who were voted out of office still attend and can still vote. Originally the term ""lame duck"" was a financial term meaning those who could not repay a loan. As used in politics, a representative who lost an election was no longer accountable to the voters. As the framers of the Twentieth Amendment saw it, lame duck representatives should not be able to vote since voters had already rejected their views. The Twentieth Amendment only shortened the lame duck period by six weeks. Between 1933 and 2012, 18 lame-duck sessions of Congress have passed laws."

Preamble to the United States Constitution
Behavior.
"The Horned Viper is nocturnal and terrestrial (lives on the ground), and is usually found buried underneath the sand. They are said to be slow moving, but they are able to do sidewinding. When they do sidewinding they can move faster across the sand. They are able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. They sink into the sand tail first and keep on sinking deeper into the sand until only their eyes and nose are sticking out of the sand. The reason they do this is so they can ambush prey which come close to it. They are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. They live in the deserts of North Africa, Arabia, and Iran."
Feeding.
"The Horned Viper catch their prey by ambushing. They eat mainly rodents, birds and lizards."
Las Vegas culture
"Las Vegas culture is the name for a number of setltements on the coast of present-day Ecuador. These settlements were created between roughly 8000 and 4600 BCE. In total, there are 31 settlements. The people who lived there were hunter-gatherers. They had also started agriculture. Bone points and a spatula have been discovered. They may have been used for making nets or textiles, along with various tools and containers shaped of shell; wood, bamboo, reeds, and bark are also believed to have been used in the tool industry."
No mummies have been found on the coast of Ecuador. The Las Vegas people had similarities with the people whose remains are preserved as the Chinchorro mummies of the north coast of Chile.They also lived at the same time.
Yu Kil-chun
"Yu Kil-chun (, 1856 – 1914) was a Korean politician, philosopher, thinker, reform activist and independence activist during the Joseon Dynasty. His nickname was Gudang, Chunmin, Guyil."
Life.
"Yu Kil-chun was born in Kwangju. In his early years he studied under Park Kyu-su and Oh Kyung-suk. As a young man in 1881, he went to Meiji Japan to study at Keio University. He then went to the United States in 1884 to study mathematics. After his he was accused of supporting the ""Gaehwadang"" (enlightenment party). He was arrested and put in jail from 1885 to 1894."
"Between 1894 and 1895, Yu worked for the government of prime minister Kim Hongjip. He was Vice Minister of State for Home Office. In October 1895, Korea's King Gojong claimed that Yu was involved in the assassination of Queen Min. Kim was killed and his cabinet was disbanded. Yu went to the Russian embassy and escaped the country for exile in Japan. He returned to Korea in 1907 after he was pardoned by Emperor Sunjeong."
"In 1910, when Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan, Yun started a movement against the annexation. Yu was offered the title ""danshaku"" by the Government of Japan, but he refused it. He died in 1914 of a heart problem. He was aged 58."

Katherine Jackson
"Katherine Esther Jackson (born May 4, 1930 as Kattie B. Screws) is the matriarch of the Jackson family of musicians and singers, including Michael Jackson, La Toya and Janet Jackson. She is the widow of Joe Jackson."
"Jackson had 10 children. Several of the children became famous. In 1986 ""Essence"" honored her as ""Mother of the Year""."
"In 1990, Jackson released her autobiography, ""My Family"". The book told about her elderly years and her relationship with her husband and their children."

Fax
"Fax (short for facsimile), or telecopying, is the transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device."
"The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which turns the contents (text or images) into a bitmap, Then the bitmap is sent through the telephone system. The receiving fax machine reconverts the coded image, printing a paper copy."
"Businesses usually have some kind of fax system, but the technology has faced increasing competition from Internet-based methods. Fax machines still retain some advantages, particularly in the transmission of sensitive material which, if sent over the internet, may be intercepted. However, encryption (a secret coding system) can make internet messages secure."
"In some countries, because electronic signatures on contracts are not recognized by law while faxed contracts with copies of signatures are, fax machines enjoy continuing support in business."
"In many businesses, standalone fax machines have been replaced by fax servers which receive and store incoming faxes electronically. The servers route them to users on paper or via a secure email. Such systems reduce costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound phone lines needed by an office."
History.
"Since independence in 1948 and the assassination of Aung San, Burma has had civil wars between its governments and minority ethnic groups like the Kachin, Karen, Shan and others. These conflicts are known as the Internal conflict in Burma."

"The ruined walls of an observatory are also on the summit. An emergency shelter has been built on top of the observatory tower for people caught out by bad weather. The roof of the shelter is higher than the trig point by several feet, making it the highest man-made structure in the UK. A war memorial to the dead of World War II is next to the observatory."
"On 17 May 2006, a piano that had been buried under one of the cairns on the peak was uncovered by the John Muir Trust, which owns much of the mountain. The piano is believed to have been carried up for charity by removal men from Dundee over 20 years earlier."

Manaus
"Manaus is the principal city of the North Region of Brazil. It is the capital of Amazonas. Manaus had a great age when latex was discovered in the Amazon region. Manaus developed economically and culturally. After that great age, latex started to be produced in other countries, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where due the similar climate the plants start to grow even faster than in Brasil."
"Manaus is considerated as the entrance door to the biggest ecological reservation in the planet: The Amazon rainforest. Its name come from a tribe called Manaós that lived in this area and means ""Mother of God"". The colonization started on 1669, with a small fort, and around it grew a settlement. In 1833 it became a village, with the name of Manaus. On October 24th of 1848 it receive the name of city and became the Capital of the state."
"Manaus is the site of the ""encontro of the waters"" where two big rivers Rio Negro (black river) and Solimoes River come together and for more than 10 km ""walk together but not mixed"" because of their differing density, and then become the Amazon."
"The American Charles Goodyear, inventor of vulcanization, developed a procedure to process the juice of the rubber tree into rubber. The city became rich, and India rubber barons paid for a big biggest luxury from Europe, a copy the Grand Paris Opéra - the TEATRO AMAZONAS. Other monuments from this time include the MERCADO MUNICIPAL, a copy of the famous market halls Les Halles in Paris, the arts centre RIO PALACIO NEGRO between fascinating Portuguese facades."
"Today Manaus is a foreign trade zone. Foreign enterprises pay here no import duties what guarantees a certain income for the city and the region. Electronics, wood industry and oil refineries have settled in the outskirts in industrial areas.

"The Opera house is the major cultural heritage of the Amazonas. It was inaugurated in 1896 during the rubber boom. In spite of the predominance of neoclassic elements, other styles were used, so the architecture is eclectic, with materials brought from Europe as well as artists like Domenico de Angelis, Giovanni Capranesi and Crispim do Amaral. Preserved as a national heritage since 1965, today, with more than 100 years, it has room for 681 people including balconies and three floors of boxes.

Evil
Evil means something which is morally bad or wicked. It is the opposite of good. People may say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules such as the Ten Commandments is evil. A person or a group that does evil things may also be called evil.
Logical problem of evil.
"A version of the problem of evil, perhaps by Epicurus, goes as follows:"
Another argument goes:
"Arguments such as these are about the ""logical"" problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and so cannot all be correct."
Theology.
"A common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good. Some philosophers accept that arguments such as ""God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will"" are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil. Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are ""logically incompatible"", even a highly implausible instance of God's coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose."
"In theology, there is a question: ""If there is a God, why does God let evil happen?"" Some think that evil proves that there is not a God. Others think that God lets evil happen so that people can choose ""not"" to do evil."
"Philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism. For logical positivism the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of verification. In their view, this makes the proposition ""God exists"", not true or false, but meaningless. A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified."
View.
"The study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics. Ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil. It attempts to give all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good. Christians believe that at the Second Coming of Christ, God will put an end to evil and the works of the Devil- see the end of the Book of Revelation. In movies or TV series evil people are often called villains. Political actions are sometimes viewed as evil such as authoritarianism, ableism or censorship. People disagree on why people do evil things. Religious people may think that it is the result of listening to an evil being such as the devil or sin. Others think it happens because of mental issues like anger, mental illness or revenge. Certain types of behavior are also sometimes seen as evil such as killing or lying to be punished. Sex crimes such as rape, hebophilia or pedophilia are also often seen as evil."

Personal defense weapon
"A personal defense weapon (PDW) is usually defined as a light, compact and easy to use firearm. However the definition varies depending on context and who you ask. Many will still say it is a short-barreled rifle (SBR). These are regulated in the United States by the ATF. Many SBRs have ""selective fire"" (you can switch between semi-automatic or fully automatic fire)."
"The United States Department of Homeland Security defines a personal defense weapon as an M4 carbine (or a Colt AR-15 civilian semi-automatic rifle). Some governments' definition of PDWs includes handguns. An example is the Czech Republic. It has proposed a constitutional amendment which would allow its citizens to own and keep PDWs as a way to discourage terrorists. Regardless, a PDW is usually agreed upon as being somewhere between a submachine gun and an assault rifle."
History.
"In the 1980s, the term was used for troops in tight, confined environments. They needed a compact automatic weapon that could defeat body armor. It was designed for troops in tanks, military trucks and those operating from aircraft including pilots. The majority of soldiers do not take part in an infantry battle. Their jobs are usually to support the infantry. Their main role is not winning a fight, but often to escape an ambush. In other situations they may assist the infantry. PDWs are also used by bodyguards as they can be hidden under a jacket but still allowed good firepower. PDWs tend to be shorter range weapons."
"The term evolved as concealed carry became more popular, especially in places like the United States. Certain states in the United States make carrying a firearm for personal defense relatively easy while others make it more difficult. Also, quite a few other countries allow concealed carry, to various degrees. Pistols, especially compact models, are very popular self defense weapons today. Also, there are now a number of pistols available in rifle calibers."
Alternative self-defense weapons.
"In places where a firearm cannot be carried or the person chooses not to carry a firearm, there are other weapons they can carry. Common items such as a credit card, car keys, a pen or even a scarf can be effective self defense weapons. Because of the popularity of self defense, there are also specially designed non-lethal weapons designed not to look like weapons."

Excise
"An excise or excise tax is an indirect tax charged on certain goods. As an indirect tax, they are charged by the producer or the merchant who then has to pay the government. For the same reason they are also not considered a sales tax. Excise taxes are commonly part of the retail price of a product such as gasoline, alcohol or cigarettes. Excise taxes may be charged by both state and federal governments."
Excise vs sales tax.
"Excise taxes are different from sales tax in two important ways. First, excise is charged only on specific goods. Sales tax can apply to most things a person might buy although certain jurisdictions may exempt food or clothing. Excise taxes are usually applied to luxury goods or products linked to health issues such as tanning salons or cigarettes. Secondly, sales tax is charged as a percentage of the purchase price. An excise tax is usually a fixed amount added to the price. It can be hard to tell how much excise tax a person pays because it is part of the purchase price. Sales tax is added to the price and is usually shown on the receipt."
US excise taxes.
"In the United States, excise taxes make up about 4 percent of all federal revenues. This is lower than many other countries. The Constitution refers to excise tax as an indirect tax. Some states in the United States have different names for excise taxes. For example, in the state of Massachusetts the excise tax charged on automobiles is called an ""ad valorem tax""."
Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on April 8, 1913, the Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution"
changed the method by which United States Senators were elected. For the first 125 years of the Constitution required US Senators to be elected by the state legislatures. A number of problems in the United States Senate created the need to change how Senators were elected from indirect to direct elections by the people of the United States.
Background.
"When the Constitution was adopted in 1788, Senators were to be elected by the state legislatures. This remained in effect for 125 years. By the late 19th century it became clear there were many problems with this procedure. In addition to long vacancies that lasted for months and even years, political machines had gained control over state legislatures. This corrupted the process and the Senate was seen as a ""millionaire's club"" who served private interests instead of the people. Beginning in the 1890s, the House of Representatives passed several resolutions for a constitutional amendment which proposed Senators be elected by direct election. The Senate refused to even take a vote on these proposals."
"At this point, many states changed their strategy. Article Five of the United States Constitution offers two methods for amending the Constitution. In addition to the common method of a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress, was another method. It stated that if two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for one, Congress must call a constitutional convention. The method had not been used before. When it appeared two-thirds of the states wanted the change, Congress acted."

Order of the Indian Empire
The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire is an order of chivalry founded by Queen Victoria in 1878. The Order includes members of three classes:
"No appointments have been made since 1947, the year of Indian independence and the Partition of India. In 2010 the last surviving knight, The Maharaja of Dhrangadhra, died and the order became dormant ."
"The motto of the Order is """", (Under the auspices of the Empress), a reference to Queen Victoria, the first Empress of India. The Order is the junior British order of chivalry associated with the Empire of India; the senior one is The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India."
History.
"The British founded the Order in 1878 to reward British and ""native"" officials who served in India. The Order originally had only one class (Companion), but a second class, Knights Commander, was added in 1887. The British authorities intended the Order of the Indian Empire as a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India (founded in 1861); consequently, many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter."
"On 15 February 1887, the Order of the Indian Empire formally became ""The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire"" and was divided into two classes: Knights Commander and Companions, with the following first Knights Commander:"
"However, on 5 January 1888, a further proclamation regarding the Order was made; the Order was expanded from two classes to three - Knight Grand Commander, Knight Commander and Companion. Seven Knights Grand Commander were created; they were:"
"Normally the highest grade in British orders is Knight Grand Cross, but Knight Grand Commander was chosen for the two Indian awards because of the Christian symbolism of the cross."
"Appointments to both Orders stopped after 14 August 1947. The Orders have never been formally abolished, and Queen Elizabeth II remains the Sovereign of the Orders to this day. Today, there are no living members of the order."
"The fictional characters Purun Dass (invented by Rudyard Kipling) and Harry Paget Flashman (invented by George MacDonald Fraser) each held a KCIE; Kipling's engineer Findlayson in ""The Day's Work"" (1908) wants the CIE."
Composition.
"The British Sovereign is the Sovereign of the Order. The Grand Master held the next-most senior rank; the position was held, ""ex officio"", by the Viceroy of India. Members of the first class were known as ""Knights Grand Commanders"" rather than ""Knights Grand Cross"" so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the Order."
"At the time of foundation in 1878 the order had only one class, that of Companion. There could be any number of members. In 1887, the Order was divided into the two classes of Knights Commander (50 at any given time) and Companions (no quota). The following year the class of Knight Grand Commander (25 at any given time) was added; the composition of the other two classes remained the same."
"British officials and soldiers were eligible for appointment, as were rulers of Indian Princely States. Generally, the rulers of the more important states were appointed Knights Grand Commanders of the Order of the Star of India, rather than of the Order of the Indian Empire. Women, except the princely rulers, could not be members the Order. Female princely rulers were admitted as ""Knights"" rather than as ""Dames"" or ""Ladies""."
"As well, other Asian and Middle Eastern rulers were also appointed."

The first release was ""My Foolish Heart"" b/w ""Bless You"" by Gene Ammon, which became a hit. In 1952 they started Checker Records for radio play because the stations only played a limited number of songs from one label and in December 1955 the started Argo Records for jazz music. The first LP was produced in 1958."
"In the beginning Leonard Chess was the producer, but later the business was handled by Ralph Bass for the gospel section and Willie Dixon for blues. Dixon wrote a lot of songs which became hits and also played bass on many recordings. The label was also famous for its session musicans who played on most of the company's Chicago soul recordings, such as drummer Maurice White and bassist Louis Satterfield, both later shaped the funk group Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire, guitarists Pete Cosey, Gerald Sims and Phil Upchurch, pianist Leonard Caston, later a producer with Motown and organist Sonny Thompson. 1953 they begun to work together with Sam Phillips' Memphis Recording Service. One of the musicians from Memphis was Howlin' Wolf, who did many hits for Chess."

Origami
"Origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It uses many techniques and various objects can be created. The object is made of origami paper, which is specially made for folding and staying in shape. Many dictionaries and television shows suggest that origami is only paper cranes, waterbombs, and paper planes, but many new models and creatures have been made because new folding techniques have allowed this."
"When the Japanese first folded origami, they used only one piece of paper. A different kind of origami called ""modular origami"" uses many small pieces that are the same, which are combined to form one large model. Also, many mathematical shapes can be made with origami."
History.
"The beginnings of origami are not clear. Paperfolding started in China in the 1st or 2nd century. It finally came to Japan in the 6th century. Instead of making models that looked exactly like things, the first origami models only looked similar to things. People often folded models and gave them to other people for good luck. For example, Shinto nobles celebrated weddings with sake in glasses decorated with origami butterflies, which gave good luck to the bride and groom."
"There were also independent paperfolding traditions in other countries, like Germany and Spain. The earliest evidence of paperfolding in Europe is a picture of a boat in 1490. There was also a paper box from 1440. Finally, in 1845, ""Kan no mado"" was written, and it was the first book of origami models."
"Recently, people have become more interested in origami. In 1954, Japanese paperfolder Akira Yoshizawa created rules to explain how to fold origami models. His instructions on paperfolding are now used in all countries."
Paper.
"Peter Engel, who is a well-known paperfolder, says ""the best paper [for origami] is thin and crisp and absolutely square."" Pre-cut origami paper is sold in many colors, sizes, and patterns. Duo paper, or paper with different colors on each side, is used by paperfolders because it makes areas of different color on the finished model. There are also special papers, like textured, metallic, and patterned."
Life.
"He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He attended Copenhagen University and earned his master's degree in 1841. During this time, he met and fell in love with Regine Olsen in 1837. Although they were engaged for a time, Kierkegaard ended the engagement in 1841."
"After breaking up with Regine, he spent much of his time writing book after book, in a highly dramatic yet subtle way. He also wrote some of his works using pen names, or pseudonyms. He died in Copenhagen. Although his works were not very popular during his lifetime, after his death they became influential in the 20th century."
Works.
"Books by Kierkegaard. ""Either/Or"" and ""Fear and Trembling"", both published in 1843, are thought to be especially significant."
Despotism
"Despotism is a form of government that is controlled by one person or a small group of people. The person who controls the state is called a ""despot"". The despot has complete control of the state, like a dictator or tyrant. In history, the pharaohs of Egypt were despots. The word ""despot"" is thought to come from the Ancient Greek word ""despotes"", which means ""the master""."
"According to Montesquieu, the difference between absolute monarchy and despotism is as follows. In the case of the monarchy, a single person governs with absolute power by fixed and established laws, whereas a despot governs by his or her own will and caprice."
The importance of the idea of despotism is that today it is a very common type of dictatorship or direct rule. Ruling monarchies are today few in number.
"Even when there are elections, as there are for the Russian presidency, opposition candidates are at such a disadvantage that they are rarely, if ever, successful."
"Despotism has always been associated with Eastern rather than Western states. Of the former Soviet Union, it is only the new states to the west which have attempted, with difficulties, to build genuine democracies (such as Moldova and Ukraine)."
Lakshadweep
"Lakshadweep (; ISO: , formerly known as the Laccadive, Minicoy and Aminidivi Islands (), are a group of islands in the Arabian Sea. They belong to India. Their capital is Kavaratti. It covers an area of . Eleven of the 36 coral atoll islands of Lakshadweep are inhabited."
"The islands are the only coral atolls in India. The people living there are Malayalam and Mahl people, who have been influenced by Arab traders. Lakshadweep is a Muslim region just like the neighbouring Maldives, where tourism is strictly regulated. Lakshadweep has the largest percentage of Muslims - 98%, even larger percentage than Jammu and Kashmir and is the only Muslim-majority Indian administrative division entirely within India."
"Apart from the emerging tourism, government jobs, fishing and coconut production are the mainstays of the Lakshadweep economy."
Daman and Diu
"The territory used to belong to Portugal. In 1961, Indian soldiers and air fighters took control of the territory. In 2020, it merged with Dadra and Nagar Haveli to make a new union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu."
Riding helmet
"A riding helmet, sometimes called a horse riding helmet, is a type of helmet made for people who ride horses. It is important to wear a riding helmet when riding. It is easy for a person to fall off a horse and hit his or her head. Riding helmets keep the rider of a horse from being hurt. Horses can accidentally step on a person who has fallen to the ground."
"Helmets should be worn by all riders, but are most often worn by English style riders."
Ketchup
"Ketchup is a kind of thick, liquid sauce. It is made from tomatoes, so it is sometimes called tomato sauce. Usually it is used to add flavour to food. Some people like to eat sausages, burgers, hotdogs or fishsticks with ketchup. Ketchup tastes very unlike the real tomato."
History.
Tomato ketchup.
"Although today's ketchup is tomato based, it did not appear until about a century after other types. By 1801, a recipe for tomato ketchup was created by Sandy Addison. It was later printed in an American cookbook, the ""Sugar House Book"". James Mease published another recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in ""The Virginia Housewife"". This was an important 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's cousin."
"As the century went on, ketchup became more popular in the United States. More Americans began to like tomatoes. Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. A man named Jonas Yerks (or Yerkes) is believed to have been the first man to make tomato ketchup a national phenomenon. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally. Shortly after that, other companies did the same. F. &amp; J. Heinz created their tomato ketchup in 1876. Heinz tomato ketchup was advertised: ""Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household!"""
"The ""Webster's Dictionary"" of 1913 defined ""catchup"" as a ""table sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. [Written also ketchup]."""
"The island of Sardinia has an area of and, after Sicily, is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is long from North to South, and wide from West to East. It lies between 38° 51' and 41° 15' latitude north and 8° 8' and 9° 50' longitude east."
"The island is on the western Mediterranean Sea, between the island of Corsica to the north and Tunisia to the south. The Tyrrhenian Sea part of the Mediterranean is directly east of Sardinia, between the Sardinian east coast and the west coast of the Italian mainland peninsula."
"The Strait of Bonifacio (, , Gallurese: ""Bocchi di Bunifaciu"", ) is the strait between Corsica and Sardinia, named after the Corsican town Bonifacio. It is wide and divides the Tyrrhenian Sea from the western Mediterranean Sea."
Rivers.
"Sardinia has few major rivers, the largest being the Tirso, long, which flows into the western Mediterranean Sea, the Coghinas () and the Flumendosa ()."
Mountains and valleys.
"The highest peak is Punta La Marmora (), part of the Gennargentu group of mountains in the centre of the island. Other mountain chains are Monte Limbara () in the northeast, the Chain of Marghine and Goceano () running crosswise for towards the north, the Monte Albo (), the Sette Fratelli massif in the southeast, and the Sulcis Mountains and the Monte Linas ()."
"The mountain chains of the island are separated by wide valleys; the main ones are Campidano in the southwest between Oristano and Cagliari, and the Nurra in the northwest."
Islands.
There are many small islands around the main island of Sardinia. Some of them are:
Administrative divisions.
Sardinia is divided in eight provinces:
Nuclear reactor
"A nuclear reactor is a machine that uses fission to generate heat. There are different designs which use different fuels. Most often, uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are the main components of these fuels."
"Most nuclear reactors are used to make electricity. In nuclear power plants heat from the fission reactions in the reactor changes water into steam. The steam is then used to power electric turbines which make electricity. As with other steam engines, the turbines take energy from the movement of the steam."
Some reactors are used for other purposes. Some reactors make neutrons for science research and others make radioactive isotopes. Some universities have small nuclear reactors to teach students how reactors work.
The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 by a team of scientists led by Enrico Fermi. This was a part of the Manhattan Project which needed the fuel from the reactor to make the atomic bomb. The first nuclear reactor to make electricity was a small experimental reactor built in Idaho in 1951. It made just enough electricity for four light globes.
"Nuclear reactors are expensive to build because of the many safety features they need to have. There is also a problem with the huge amount of radioactive waste from the reactors. However they produce electricity cheaply, and do not pollute the air. There have been serious accidents at several nuclear reactors: Windscale (UK) 1957, Mayak (USSR) 1957, Three Mile Island (USA) 1979, Chernobyl (USSR) 1986 and Fukushima (Japan) 2011. Concerns about safety have limited the growth of nuclear power. There are about 437 reactors around the world which provide about 5% of the world's electricity."
Samobor
"Samobor is a city in Zagreb County, Croatia, population 36,206 It is west of Zagreb, between the eastern slopes of Samoborsko gorje (Samobor hills, the eastern part of the Žumberak Mountains), in the Sava river valley. It is part of the Zagreb metropolitan area."
"Samobor has been there since 1242, according to a document of endowment by King Bela IV. It is one of the earliest tourist resorts in the region, with the first tourist facilities dating back to 1810, oriented towards anglers, hunters and hikers."
Frankfurt (Oder)
"Frankfurt (Oder) or Frankfurt an der Oder (; abbreviated """", , Low Sorbian: ""Frankobrod nad Odru"", , Upper Sorbian: ""Frankobrod nad Wódru"", lit. 'Frankfurt at the Oder') is a town in Germany. It lies on the Oder river, which marks the current border between Germany and Poland (The so-called Oder-Neisse line). It's in the east of the state of Brandenburg."
"In January 1999, the town added a prefix ""Kleiststadt"" to refer to Heinrich von Kleist, who was born there in 1777. Today, about 65,000 people are living in Frankfurt an der Oder."
Cook Islands
"The Cook Islands are a group of islands in the southern Pacific. They form an independent state, but have strong ties with New Zealand. The 15 small islands have a total land surface of 240 square kilometers. About 18.000 people live on the islands, most of them from tourism. The largest island, Rarotonga, also holds the territory's capital, Avarua."
"The nation also has a distinctive Polynesian language known as Cook Island Maori, which is closely related to the Maori language of New Zealand and to the Tahitian language."
Bill Hicks
"William 'Bill' Hicks (16 December 1961 - 26 February 1994) was an American stand-up comedian known for his controversial act which made fun of religion and politics amongst other areas. Since then, many other stand-up comedians in the United States and United Kingdom have said they have been very influenced by his work, which is still very popular today."
"Hicks was born in Valdosta, Georgia and raised in Houston, Texas. He died of pancreatic cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas."
Gene Wilder
"Gene Wilder (Jerome Silberman; June 11, 1933 – August 29, 2016) was an American actor, author, comedian, director and screenwriter. He was most famous for his acting work and in particular for the movies he made with Mel Brooks which include ""The Producers"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"". He also played the part of Willy Wonka in the musical movie ""Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory""."
Wilder studied Communication and Theatre Arts at the University of Iowa.
"Wilder was drafted into the Army on September 10, 1956."
"An unauthorized biography of Wilder called ""Gene Wilder: Funny and Sad"" by Brian Scott Mednick was published in December 2010 by BearManor Media."
"Wilder died from Alzheimer's disease on August 29, 2016 in Stamford, Connecticut at age 83."
Exeter City F.C.
Exeter City F.C. is an English association football club currently competing in the English Football League. They were founded in 1904 and currently play at the St James Park ground.
Possibly their most famous game was when they drew 0-0 against Manchester United in an FA Cup match in 2005 at United's home ground of Old Trafford.
Die Lollipops
"Die Lollipops is a children's band which formed in Germany in the summer of 2000 under the Edelkids label, a division of a German company named Edel Music. According to the label's website, the primary intended audience for the band is German-speaking children between 4 and 10 years old."
Music.
Their music can be divided into three basic types:
Examples of famous international children's songs whose melody has been borrowed and given entirely new lyrics:
History.
"""Die"" is German for ""the"" (plural); ""Lollipops"" is a loanword from English. The most common German word for lollipop is ""Lutscher"", but Germans now also use ""Lollipop"". The band debuted in July 2000 with an album called ""die Lollipops"" and have released new CDs, videos, and audio books at the rate of about two per year. As of 2005, their label had sold more than 1.5 million of their CDs and videos, of which 8 made it to gold, and one made it to platinum. Note that the meanings of the terms platinum and gold are different for different countries: in Germany gold signifies 100,000 sales and platinum 200,000."
"Die Lollipops has featured two singers at a time for most of its history; generally these have been girls between the ages of about 11 and 16. Because the band has been around for nine years, they must replace their singers with new ones every few years. The current duet started recording in late 2007 with Susi and Fiona (then 12 and 11 years old respectively). They released an album called ""Einfach tierisch"" in March 2008, and plan to release another one called ""Immer in Bewegung"" in July 2009. Peter Hoffmann has remained the producer since the group was formed. The band has attracted composers from other bands registered by Edel Music; a singer named Klaus Büchner had written a song about drinking alcohol called ""Wir feiern wieder Feste"" in 1987 when he was singing in his own band, called Klaus &amp; Klaus; he then re-wrote it as a children's song about a never-ending party for die Lollipops. The title of the song is still the same and the syllable rhythms are similar, especially in the chorus."
"Due to the language barrier, the Lollipops are largely unheard of outside the German-speaking world. Their music can be downloaded via websites such as Amazon.com."
Water opossum
"The water opossum (""Chironectes minimus"") is also known as the yapok. It is an aquatic marsupial and a member of the opossum family. It has black and grey waterproof fur and webbed hind feet. It is ""the only living marsupial where both sexes have a backward-pointing pouch""."
"The animal is found in the freshwater streams and lakes in Mexico, Central and South America. The water opossum lives in bankside burrows. It comes out after dusk to search for fish, crustaceans and other aquatic animals, which it eats on the bank."
The yapok's webbed back feet helps it chase its prey in the water.
Blazing Saddles
"Blazing Saddles is a 1974 comedy western movie directed by Mel Brooks starring Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder and Harvey Korman. It tells the story of a black Sheriff, played by Little, who is appointed Sheriff of a small Western town and how he must try to make friends with the racist towns people and stop a ruthless businessman from knocking down the town to make way for a railway line."
"AJ Lee held the Divas Championship 3 times in the WWE, successfully retaining her title at WrestleMania XXX. the night after on 'Raw' she was defeated and lost her title to NXT Woman's Champion, Paige. On the June 30, 2014 episode of ""Raw"", Lee returned to the WWE. She challenged Paige for the Divas Championship and won her second championship."
"On April 3, 2015, it was announced that AJ decided to retire from the company."
Basset Hound
"The Basset Hound is a short-legged dog, of the hound family. Bassets are used in hunting to detect the scent of game. Their sense of smell for tracking is second only to that of the Bloodhound."
"The name ""Basset"" comes from French words meaning ""rather low""."
"Basset Hounds usually have coats of brown, black or white and are most often spotted. Sometimes they can be other colors. Basset Hounds have been bred from the nineteenth century. They are said to descend from the Basset d'Artois. Basset Hounds are tall, and can weight up to ."
Alvin Plantinga
"Alvin Plantinga (born November 15, 1932, Ann Arbor, Michigan ) is an American epistemologist, philosopher of religion and professor at the University of Notre Dame. He is a founding member of the Society of Christian Philosophers."
Plantinga's aim in philosophy is to defend believing in God as rational. His epistemology is one that tries to say that knowledge is only possible if you accept the possibility of some form of intelligent design by God.
Acute radiation syndrome
"Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness or radiation toxicity, is a syndrome or group of health effects which occur within months of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. The term generally refers to acute (serious, rapid onset) problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period. It is mainly damage to the blood, digestive system, and nervous system."
Castorocauda
"Castorocauda was a genus of small, semi-aquatic proto-mammals which lived in the Jurassic period, about 154 million years ago."
"Its fossil was found in lakebed sediments of the Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia. ""Castorocauda"" was highly specialized, with adaptations like those of modern semi-aquatic mammals such as beavers, otters, and the platypus (convergent evolution). It is the earliest animal found with fur."
"""Castorocauda"" is one of the near-mammals in a group called the Docodonta."
"Although ""Castorocauda"" was not a crown group mammal, it is important in the study of how mammals evolved. It was the first find with an almost complete skeleton. Also it is not a ""small nocturnal insectivore""."
Element Skateboards
"Element Skateboards (sometimes shortened to Element) is an American company. It is known for making skateboards and swimwear. It was founded in 1992 by Johnny Schillereff. The company is based out of Irvine, California. The company was originally known as Underworld Element Skateboards but Schillereff decided to drop the ""Underworld"" part due to the company being absorbed because of financial problems. The Element company also sponsors professional skateboarders like Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Chad Muska, Ray Barbee, Vanessa Torres, Mark Appleyard, Nyjah Huston and"

Gustave Doré
"Paul Gustave Doré (; January 6, 1832 – January 23, 1883) was a French artist, engraver, illustrator and sculptor. Most of Doré's work was wood engraving and steel engraving."
Biography.
"Doré was born in Strasbourg. His first illustrated story was published at the age of fifteen. As a young man, he began work as a literary illustrator in Paris. He was hired to illustrate scenes from books by Rabelais, Balzac, Milton and Dante."
"In 1853, Doré was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron. British publishers asked him to do more work, including a new illustrated English Bible. Ten years later, he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes's ""Don Quixote"". His images of the knight and Sancho Panza have influenced later readers, artists, and stage and film directors' ideas of how the two characters looked. Doré also illustrated an edition of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Raven"" with larger than usual pages. He was paid 30,000 francs by the publisher Harper &amp; Brothers in 1883."
"Doré's English Bible (1866) was a great success, and in 1867 Doré had a major exhibition of his work in London. The Doré Gallery in Covelant Bond Street opened after the show. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold suggested that they work together to make a complete portrait of London. Jerrold got the idea from ""The Microcosm of London"" produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson in 1808. Doré signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant &amp; Co. He had to stay in London for three months each year. He was paid £10,000 a year for the project."
"The completed book, ""London: A Pilgrimage,"" was published in 1872. It had 180 engravings. The book was successful financially and influenced many people. However, many critics at the time disliked it. Some of these critics wrote that Doré paid too much attention to the poverty in parts of London."
and we get:
"This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95, we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter ""μ"" between the stochastic endpoints"
and
"This does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter μ in the calculated interval. Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. In 95% of the cases, ""μ"" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases, it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:"
"As the desired value 250 of ""μ"" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated."
"The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where μ might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. We ""cannot"" say: ""with probability (1 − α), the parameter ""μ"" lies in the confidence interval."" We only know that by repetition in 100(1 − α) % of the cases, μ will be in the calculated interval. In 100α % of the cases, however, it does not. And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens. That is why we say: ""with confidence level 100(1 − α) %, ""μ"" lies in the confidence interval."""
"The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean μ. If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability that it contains the parameter is 95%. However, it is also possible that we may have unluckily picked the wrong one as well."
Emperor Richū
"was the 17th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Richū to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Richū""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
Some scholars identify him with King San in the Book of Song. King San sent messengers to the Song Dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425; and this historical person was succeeded by his younger brother.
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to ""Nihonshoki"" and ""Kojiki"", he was the first son of Emperor Nintoku."
"Richū had two sons; but he was followed on the throne by his brother, who would become known as Emperor Hanzei. The enthronement of Hanzei by-passed Richū's two sons. Few other details have survived."
Two of Richū's grandsons would attain the throne as Emperor Kenzō and as Emperor Ninken.
Events of Richū's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Richū's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"In his sixth year of his reign, Richū died."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Richū.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun"") at Sakai. Richū is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Jacobitism
"Jacobitism was (and, to a much smaller extent, is) the political movement that tried to put the Stuart kings back onto the thrones of England, Scotland, and Kingdom of Ireland. The movement took its name from the Latin form ""Jacobus"" of the name of King James II and VII."
"Jacobitism began after the deposition of James II and VII in 1688. He was replaced by his daughter Mary II jointly with her husband and first cousin William of Orange. The Stuarts lived on the European mainland after that, sometimes trying to get back the throne with the help of France or Spain. The most important places of Jacobitism were Ireland and Scotland, especially the Scottish Highlands. In England, Jacobitism was strongest in the north, and some support was also in Wales."
A great number of Catholic people liked Jacobitism. They hoped the Stuarts would end bad laws. Lots of different helped the military campaigns for all sorts of reasons. In Scotland the Jacobite cause became a lasting romantic memory.
Tadao Horie
was a Japanese football player. He played for the Japan national team.
Biography.
"Horie was born in Hamamatsu on September 13, 1913. He played for Waseda WMW, which was consisted of players from his alma mater, Waseda University. At that club, he played with many futures Japan national team players, such as Motoo Tatsuhara, Yasuo Suzuki, and others."
Primatology
"Primatology is a type of science that is part of zoology. It studies primates (monkeys, apes, lemurs, and humans). Primatology is a part of physical anthropology. A person who studies primatology is a primatologists. They can work in many different fields of study. These include biology, zoology, anthropology and psychology."
"A large amount of information about primatology has been learned since the end of World War II in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Japan. In the United States, primatologists work mostly in the fields of psychology and anthropology."
Orangutan
"Orangutans (""Pongo"") are great apes belonging to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. There are two species of orangutan. They are from Southeast Asia. There are very few of them left, because loss of the jungle has reduced their habitat. There are orangutans on view at the Singapore zoo."
"The name orangutan comes from two Malay words, ""orang"" which means ""person"", and ""hutan"" which means ""forest""; so orangutan means ""person of the forest""."
Appearance.
"Orangutans have red-brown hair. They have long arms. They can be strong like chimpanzees, gorillas and humans. They also have hands that are good for climbing. The ""Sumatran Orangutan"" is smaller and has longer hair than the ""Bornean orangutan"". Orangutans have suffered from forest loss and are on the very edge of extinction."
Life.
"Orangutans are from the rainforests on the islands Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. They mostly live up in the trees. They eat fruit, leaves and bark and also insects and bird eggs. They drink water from rain that has been collected in leaves. Orangutans are not comfortable on the ground since they have to push themselves along with fists. Heavy adults move carefully through the trees, using their flexible feet to grasp the tree branches. Smaller orangutans swing with more ease."
Diet.
"An orangutan's diet consists mainly of fruit, they like ripe fruit. If they cannot find fruit they will eat bark, leaves and termites, rather than move to somewhere else to get food. About 60% of an orangutan's diet is fruit, 25% is leaves, 10% is bark and flowers, and 5% is termites and other insects."
Pregnancy.
"After a pregnancy of 230–260 days the female gives birth to usually one baby, but sometimes two, every eight to nine years. The little ones stay with their mother for years, riding on their mother's back and learning to move through the forest. The young orangutans are playful and affectionate. When they are five or six years old, they become more independent and eventually go off on their own."
Greeting
Greetings are nice things to say when people meet each other. Greetings may be different from culture to culture. These are some greetings used a lot in the English language:
"There are also ways to greet without talking, such as these:"
Sunlight
"Sunlight is the light and energy that comes from the Sun. When this energy reaches the earth's surface, it is called insolation. What we experience as sunlight is actually solar radiation. It is the radiation and heat from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic waves."
"The atmosphere affects the amount of solar radiation received. When solar radiation travels through the atmosphere, some of it is absorbed by the atmosphere (16%). Some of it is scattered to space (6%). Some of it is reflected by clouds (28%). About 47% of it reaches the Earth's surface."
"Without sunlight, there could not be life on the Earth. Plants need sunlight for the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis the plants use the energy of the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, to create glucose (sugar). The glucose can later be used by the plant for energy or animals eat the plant and the glucose in it. Plants need sunlight to grow green. Without enough sunlight but with enough water, the plant grows very tall very quickly, but looks yellow and dehydrated, although when touched, the leaves are very moist."
"Solar radiation can be both good and bad for a person's health. When in the light, the human body uses the ultraviolet part of sunlight to make its own Vitamin D. Without sunscreen too much ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin cancer. Sun angle makes difference in seasons on Earth as well as in the length of day and night. A high angle makes the tropics hot, and a low angle makes the arctic cold."
Intensity of sunlight on planets of Solar System.
Different bodies of the Solar System receive sunlight of different intensities. The table compares the amount of light received by each planet on the Solar System follows:
Use of solar energy.
"Solar energy is used in many different ways by people all over the world both in its traditional way for heating, cooking or drying and to make electricity where other power supplies are absent, such as in remote places on Earth or in the space. Sometimes, it is cheaper to make electricity from sunlight than from coal or oil."
Theism
"The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched across Pangaea 5000 km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine, and was 700 km wide.p6 This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today."
Change of climate.
"The rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the Pennsylvanian, and was replaced by a cooler, drier climate."
"The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia, causing the zone of contact to be raised. The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period. China was too far away to be affected, and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years, into the early Permian.p30"
Structure.
"""Lepidodendron"" had tall, thick trunks that rarely branched and were topped with a crown of bifurcating branches bearing clusters of leaves. These leaves were long and narrow, similar to large blades of grass, and were spirally-arranged."
The closely packed diamond-shaped leaf scars left on the trunk and stems as the plant grew provide some of the most interesting and common fossils in Carboniferous shales and accompanying coal deposits. These fossils look much like tire tracks or alligator skin.
"The scars, or leaf cushions, were composed of green photosynthetic tissue, evidenced by the cuticle covering and being dotted with stomata, microscopic pores through which carbon dioxide from the air diffuses into plants. Likewise, the trunks of ""Lepidodendron"" would have been green, unlike modern trees which have scaly, non-photosynthetic brown or gray bark."
"""Lepidodendron"" has been likened to a giant herb. The trunks produced very little, if any, wood. Most structural support came from a thick, bark-like region. This region remained around the trunk as a rigid layer that did not flake off like that of most modern trees. As the tree grew, the leaf cushions expanded to accommodate the increasing width of the trunk."
"The branches of this plant ended in cone-like structures. ""Lepidodendron"" did not produce seeds like many modern plants. Instead, it reproduced by means of spores."
Stigmaria.
"Stigmaria are a type of branching tree root fossil found in Carboniferous rocks. They were the roots of coal forest lycopsid trees such as ""Sigillaria"" and ""Lepidodendron"". Each trunk had four of those roots. ""Stigmaria"" is a ""form taxon"", as the genus and species of the plant bearing the root cannot be identified."
DuPont
E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (often DuPont) is an American chemical company. Eleuthère Irénée du Pont founded it in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill. DuPont was the world's third largest chemical company based on market capitalization and ninth based on revenue in 2009. Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
"In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the cooling industry and later, more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair."
"Some of DuPont's trademarked brands have become genericized. For instance, “neoprene” was originally intended to be a trademark, but quickly came into common usage."
Melendi
"Ramón Melendi Espinosa (born 21 January 1979 in Oviedo, Asturias) is a Spanish pop and rumba singer. He studied in the school, Leopoldo Alas ""Clarín"" with the Formula 1 pilot Fernando Alonso. He wrote a song for him called ""Magic Alonso""."
Career.
"In 2003, Melendi made his first album ""Sin noticias de Holanda"" which had 12 songs. In December of the same year, he wrote two new songs, ""Asturias"" and ""Moratalá"", which were very successful. In 2004, one of his songs, ""Con la luna llena"", was chosen as the official song of a Spanish bicycling event called ""La vuelta ciclista España"". One year later, he made his second single album ""Que el cielo espere sentao"". He sold more than 200,000 copies of it. Some years later he made three more albums."
Melendi sings in concerts around Spain and South America.

"On September 15, 2014, Microsoft bought Mojang for 2.5 billion United States dollars. After the deal was made, Markus Persson announced that he would leave Mojang. In May 2020, Mojang was re-branded to become Mojang Studios."
Marsupial mole
Marsupial moles (Notoryctidae) is a family of marsupials of the order Notoryctemorphia. There are only two extant species:
Description.
The two species of marsupial moles are rare and poorly understood burrowing mammals of the deserts of Western Australia.
"Khat is very popular in Yemen. Much of the country's farming resources are used for it because farmers get more money than for other cash crops. It is estimated that 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it. Its production is said to increase by about 10% to 15% every year. It uses so much water that groundwater levels in the Sana'a basin are getting lower. For this reason, government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of Sana'a to the coast of the Red Sea."
"Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while it was only 0.57 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown. This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits. It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8,000 hectares to 103,000 hectares."
Matsui Keishirō
"Matsui Keishirō (, 28 March 1868 - 4 June 1946) was a Japanese diplomat during the Showa period and later Minister of Foreign Affairs. He graduated from the Law School of Tokyo Imperial University in 1889, and entered the Foreign Ministry the same year. In 1890, he was given a post in the Japanese embassy in Seoul in 1890, and in 1895 was sent to the United States. In April 1889, he served in London. In 1902, he was re-assigned to Beijing. He returned to Japan in 1913."
"During World War I, Matsui served as Japanese Ambassador to France from November, 1915. When he finished this mission, he was awarded with the title of baron (""danshaku"") under the ""kazoku"" peerage system. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 7 January to 11 June 1924 under the government of Kiyoura Keigo."
Country code
"Country codes are in mostly times created by few letters or numbers that represent geographical codes (geocodes) of countries that use certain country code, it is in use in data processing and communications. There are few different systems created for this. The most known is ISO 3166-1. The term ""country code"" in many times refers to international dialing codes, the E.164 country calling codes."
National Capital Region (Canada)
"The National Capital Region () is an official federal name for the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, and neighbouring Gatineau, Quebec, and the area near them. The National Capital Region has an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The National Capital Region covers an area of 6,287.03 square kilometres (2,427.44 square miles). It has a population of 1,235,324. The Ottawa part of the region is part of the eastern subregion of Ontario. The Ottawa-Gatineau CMA is the only CMA in Canada to include parts of two provinces."
"The National Capital Region is not a separate political jurisdiction, although the National Capital Commission is deeply involved in political, cultural, and land use planning matters in the National Capital Region. Proposals have sometimes been made to separate the National Capital Region from its two respective provinces, and transform it into a separate capital district, like the District of Columbia in the United States or the Australian Capital Territory. Such proposals have never come close to passage, and there does not currently appear to be any political will or necessity to pursue this option."
"Cities, towns, and populations within Ottawa-Gatineau CMA."
"""Source:"" 2006 Census of Canada"
Other towns within National Capital Region.
"While not officially in the CMA, the following municipalities (most of which are adjacent to the CMA) are included in the National Capital Region, due to their close economic and social ties with Ottawa."
Gatineau
"Gatineau (as of 2006 census population 242,124) is a city in western Quebec, Canada. It is on the northern bank of the Ottawa River, immediately across from Ottawa, Ontario, within Canada's National Capital Region. Ottawa and Gatineau comprise a single Census Metropolitan Area."
Orientability
"In the Euclidean space, ""R3"" is called orientable if a two-dimensional figure (for example, ) cannot be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image (). Otherwise the surface is non-orientable. A concept connected to this is chirality. This means that no matter what, a human right hand, cannot be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand. The right hand is therefore orientable."
"Manzanillo, Colima"
Manzanillo is a city in Colima in Mexico. The city has the busiest port in Mexico.
Los Mochis
"Los Mochis is a city in Sinaloa, Mexico. In 2005, the population was 231,977."
Real analysis
"Real analysis is an area of mathematics that deals with sets and sequences of real numbers, as well as functions of one or more real variables. It provides a rigorous logical foundation to calculus, the study of continuous change."

Prytaneion
"The Prytaneion was a building at Olympia, Greece. It was here that feasts in honor of the Olympic victors and official guests were held in ancient times. The Prytaneion was built towards the end of the 6th century BC. It was located northwest of the Temple of Hera at Olympia. During Roman times (as evidenced by the many bricks), it was reconstructed and extended many times. The Altar of Hestia (the Greek virgin goddess of the hearth) was in the building. It was on this altar that the Olympic eternal flame burned day and night. Every year, Olympian priests would daub the Great Altar of Zeus with a mixture made from the ashes of the Altar of Hestia and the water of the River Alpheios. The Altar of Hestia was in a square room on the southern side of the building. The rooms on the west side and the peristyle court on the north side were used for feasting and cooking."
Elizabeth Arden
"Florence Nightingale Graham (31 December 1884 – 18 October 1966), better known as Elizabeth Arden, was a Canadian–American business woman who founded what is now known as Elizabeth Arden, Incorporated. She built a cosmetics network in the United States. At the peak of her career, she became one of the richest women in the world. She was born near to Woodbridge in the Province of Ontario."
Pinocchio
"Pinocchio is a fictional character from the 1883 book ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" by Carlo Collodi."
"Pinocchio is a puppet, made by wood carver, Gepetto. When he tells lies, his nose gets longer. Pinocchio learns about being a real life boy and wants to be a real human being instead of a puppet made of wood and strings."
"The most well-known version of the story is the 1940 animated Disney movie ""Pinocchio""."
Diplomacy
"Diplomacy is the use of tact to gain strategic advantage or to find mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge. It may include the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner. Diplomacy often involves countries making an agreement with each other, such as a treaty. Diplomacy is the talk between the representatives of states, such as their heads of state. Sometimes, these talks are about trade or business, and sometimes they are about war and peace. Diplomacy happens a lot when two or more countries fight."
"Diplomats are people that are sent from their home country, to meet with and talk to diplomats and leaders of foreign countries. An important type of diplomat is called an ambassador. An ambassador lives in a foreign country and works in an embassy to be available for meetings with the government of that country."
Acellular
Acellular or non-cellular life is life that exists without a cellular structure. Some scientists say that a virus is a type of life form.
Mexico (state)
"The state of México is one of the administrative divisions of the country of Mexico. It is one of 32 administrative divisions. It is in the centre of the country. It borders Hidalgo, Querétaro, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Michoacán, Morelos and Guerrero as well as Mexico City. The capital of the state is Toluca. Its biggest city is Ecatepec de Morelos, which borders Mexico Federal district. Teotihuacan is also in this state. It is about 21.355 km² in surface. About 14 million people live there as of 2005."
Yawn
"A yawn is a reflex. It involves a large, long taking in of air, the stretching of eardrums as the jaw opens wide, and last a (sometimes loud) breathing out. Pandiculation is the act of yawning and stretching simultaneously. It is easy to see when someone is yawning, but no-one knows what its function is."
"Yawning is commonly associated with tiredness, stress, overwork, lack of stimulation and boredom. In humans, yawning is often triggered by others yawning (e.g. seeing a person yawning, talking to someone on the phone who is yawning) and is a typical example of positive feedback. This ""infectious"" yawning has also been observed in chimpanzees and dogs. Cats both yawn and stretch, though not necessarily at the same time."
Contagiousness.
"The yawn reflex has long been observed to be contagious. In 1508, Erasmus wrote, ""One man's yawning makes another yawn.,"" and the French proverbialized the idea to ""Un bon bâilleur en fait bâillier deux."" (""One good gaper makes two others gape""). Often, if one person yawns, this may cause another person to ""empathetically"" yawn. Observing another person's yawning face (especially his/her eyes), even reading, or thinking about yawning, or looking at a yawning picture can cause a person to yawn."
"The immediate cause for contagious yawning may be the mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which, upon being exposed to a stimulus, activates the same regions in the brain. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for imitation which lies at the root of much human learning such as language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse."
"Reasons, functions."
"Charles Darwin argued, in ""The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals"", that if a behaviour was present in many cultures, then it must be inherited (wholly or partly). All traits which appear in a wide range of animals must have some function which is supported (or was supported) by natural selection. In most cases the function is obvious, but with yawning we do not know what that function is. Suggestions have been made, but they do not seem to account for its widespread occurrence in mammals, and possibly in other vertebrates."
Other vertebrates.
"Because mammals have similar emotions, and can show their emotions very clearly, it is agreed that when they look as if they are yawning, it is yawning in every sense. The reasons for this are similar to the reasons why we think other humans feel the same as us when the show the same signs."
Constantine
Constantine can mean:
Constantine Maroulis
"Constantine Maroulis (born September 17 1975) is an American singer, actor and writer from New York. He was on the popular television program ""American Idol"". With his past work experiences, he stands out from other ""American Idol"" singers. Before he was on television, he sang in the rock band Pray for the soul of Betty. Right now, he is taking a break from his band to sing on his own. He is the first ""Idol"" alum to sign a contract for the making of a new television sitcom."

"Ķekava was a small village until 1970s (with population of 333 people in 1967). After, a new chicken meat factory was built. A new workers village was built and it grew the population."
Roads.
"Roads from Ķekava: Riga—Warszawa (A7), Riga bypass road (A5), Ķekava-Plakanciems (V6), Ķekava bypass road (not built yet). The center of Riga is 17 km from Ķekava to north-west."
Attempted assassination of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner
"On 1 September 2022 Argentina's former president and current vice president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had a gun pointed at her head by a man outside her official residence in the neighborhood of Recoleta, Buenos Aires. As the man tried to kill her, the gun failed. No shots were fired. He was arrested on the scene."
Facts.
"On September 1, 2022, at 8:50 p.m. (local time in Argentina), the vice president of Argentina arrived at her home after a session in the Senate. Fernández was signing copies of her book ""Sinceramente"" outside her home, when Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel, about 35 years old, pointed a 32-caliber Bersa gun at the president's head. He pulled the trigger twice but none of the magazine's five serviceable cartridges were chambered. The object had a damaged serial number."
Supporters of the vice president gathered at the scene to sing songs in her support.
Attacker.
"Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel is the person who tried to fire at Cristina Fernández. He has a record for carrying a knife. He lives in the La Paternal neighborhood. In photographs of the attacker released by the media, a tattoo of the black sun, a neo-fascist symbol, can be seen on his elbow."
Investigation.
Sabag was quickly arrested by the victim's security and police elements. He was taken to a police tent where he is interrogated. Elements of the Argentine scientific police carried out expert investigations on the site.
"Alberto Fernández, president of Argentina, announced that María Eugenia Capuchetti is the judge in charge of the investigations and the prosecutor is Carlos Rívolo."
The president asked the judicial authorities for speed in the clarification as well as to take care of the detainee's life.
Background.
"For a week, the corner of the vice president's apartment has been in constant presence of sympathetic protesters, this presence responded to the previous presence of opposition protesters, in turn incited in response to a breakthrough in one of the corruption cases linked to Lázaro Báez on August 22."
Controversy.
"After the event, several doubts arose from some sectors of the population and the media, due to the way in which the assassination attempt against Fernández was raised. For example, the police had mistakenly broken into a home of the detainee, Sabag Montiel, but his real home had been located after a person showed up at a police station claiming that he had rented it for eight months , citing the serious lack of security on the part of the police to protect Fernández, Sabag Montiel came to aim just a few centimeters from his face."
"The attacker posted photos of his tattoos with Nazi symbols, such as the black sun, on Instagram, which generated speculation that if he worked alone or is part of an organization; political scientist Pedro Núñez told DW Español that ""the Justice obviously has to act quickly, since the worst that could happen is that this is diluted over time and more and more conspiracy theories appear about what happened."""
"Some Peronist politicians accused the opposition of promoting ""hatred"" towards Cristina Kirchner. The former president of Bolivia, Jeanine Áñez, accused Fernández of ""self-victimizing"" and ""blaming"" the opposition without any investigation and impose a political holiday. The provincial deputy of Santa Fe, Amalia Granata, said that the attack on Fernández was ""armed"" and is ""a pantomime"" to victimize her."
The attack is added to the list of presidents of Argentina who suffered assassination attempts
Michelle Visage
"Michelle Visage (born Michelle Lynn Shupack; September 20, 1968) is an American radio DJ, singer, actress, media personality, television host producer and former showgirl."
"As a member of the band Seduction, she earned five singles with the group that charted on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. In 1993, as lead vocalist in The S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M., she reached the top of the dance charts. In 2011, she joined the American reality competition series ""RuPaul's Drag Race"". She has served as a permanent judge since season three. She is also a permanent judge on ""RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars"", ""RuPaul's Drag Race UK, ""and ""RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under""."
"There were 193 households of which 25% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40% were married couples living together, 10% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40% were non-families."
"The median household income was $34,375, and the median family income was $55,750. About 22% of families and 25% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 and older."

The climate of Hanalei is mild.
Probability density function
"In probability and statistics, a probability density function is a function that characterizes any continuous probability distribution. For a random variable ""X"", the probability density function of X is sometimes written as formula_1. The integral of the probability density function in the interval formula_2 yields the probability that a given random variable with the given density is contained in the interval provided. By definition, the probability density function is non-negative throughout its domain, on which the integral sums up to 1."
Probability density versus probability mass function.
The probability mass function is to a discrete probability distribution what the probability density function is to a continuous probability distribution. The probability density function is necessary to be able to work with continuous distributions.
"A random variable with a continuous probability distribution can take on any value within that distribution. Casting a dice will give the numbers 1 to 6, with a probability of formula_3, but this is not a continuous function, as only the numbers 1 to 6 are possible."
"In contrast, two people will not have the same height or the same weight. Using a probability density function, it is possible to determine the probability for people between and , or between and , even though there are infinitely many values between these two bounds."
Model airplane
A model airplane is a small sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. It may be a replica of an existing airplane or an imaginary aircraft.
"Model aircraft are generally divided into two basic types, flying and non-flying. Non-flying models are also called static, display, or shelf models. Flying models range from simple toy gliders to powered scale models. Some can be very large, especially when used to simulate the conditions of a real flight. Static models range from mass-produced toys to highly accurate models used for museum display."
Aircraft manufacturers and researchers use wind tunnel models. They are used for testing new designs and development of new ones. Sometimes only part of the aircraft is modeled.
Heidi Cruz
"Heidi Suzanne Cruz (née Nelson;born on August 7, 1972) is an American investment manager at Goldman Sachs. She is the spouse of Republican Texas senator and 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruz."
Personal life.
"Heidi Suzanne Cruz was born on August 7, 1972 in San Luis Obispo, California, and grew up in a Seventh-day Adventist family. Cruz's political interest developed when she traveled to Washington with her parents at age 8, and grew when she was age 12 and read an issue of Time magazine concerning the 1984 presidential election."
"She graduated with a B.A. in Economics and International Relations from Claremont McKenna College in 1994. She was active in Claremont McKenna's Republican group, but was asked to resign after spying on Bill Clinton's campaign for reelection. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management in Brussels, Belgium and in 2000, she graduated with a M.B.A. from Harvard Business School."
"Heidi married Ted Cruz on May 27, 2001. Heidi met Ted Cruz while the two were working together on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. In April 2008, Cruz gave birth to her first child, Caroline Camille Cruz. Her second daughter, Catherine Christiane Cruz, was born in 2011."
Career.
"In 2003, she worked for the Bush administration on economic policy, eventually becoming the director for the Western Hemisphere on the National Security Council under National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice in 2003. She left Washington DC in 2004 to support Ted Cruz's run for elective office in Texas."
"Cruz has worked for three investment banks, JP Morgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs."
"In 2005, she joined Goldman Sachs, serving as a private wealth manager and is currently the Region Head for the Southwest Region in the Investment Management Division of Goldman Sachs in Houston."
2016 presidential election.
"Ted Cruz said that the decision for him to run for president was difficult for his wife, because she was busy with her business career and raising their 2 children. She changed her mind after listening to a CD from her sister-in-law."
"Cruz was there the day her husband announced his run for president in March 2015. When Ted Cruz was criticized for not being born in the United States and running for president, Heidi defended Cruz by saying that the questioning showed that Ted Cruz was winning and his opponents wanted to defame him as a result."

Notes
Financial modelling
"The financial model for a start-up is an exercise in creativity and forward-thinking. It’s an opportunity for entrepreneurs to let their imagination run wild, finally voicing their visions on paper. As startups are generally risky investments, the financial model is a tool that helps investors evaluate the venture before committing funds. The main purpose of the startup financial model is to show investors that your company can reach profitability within a reasonable time frame and make them enough money to justify their investment."
Importance.
"Financial modeling is an integral part of the startup world. You can use models to predict future growth, understand the impact of certain decisions, and help raise funding. It's also a great tool to see how sensitive your business is to certain assumptions. You can change certain inputs to see how they affect your bottom line or different stages in your model. Models are also good tools for learning about new industries and understanding valuations (if you're looking at acquiring another business)."
Types.
"Financial models are mathematical representations of a financial situation. They can range from simple to complex, depending on the purpose and users of the model. Different model types are appropriate for different purposes, such as long-term strategic planning or annual budgeting."
"A company may use several different types of models at the same time. For example, a company may have a long-term strategic plan that it uses to inform its capital investment decisions, but it will also create an annual budget model to plan out how much cash it expects to spend and earn over the course of the year."
Financial modeling for startups.
Financial modelling for startups is the creation of a financial representation of a startup business. It's used to forecast future cash flows and profitability.
"Financial modelling is often used to assess a company's current financial health, its valuation and its potential for future growth. Financial modeling for startups is often used to prepare a document known as a pitch deck. This document is presented to investors and contains information such as: the company's business model, its target market, how it will make money, founders' backgrounds and its revenue projections."
"A financial model is not complete without a full set of business assumptions that make up the model. These assumptions are typically broken down by revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, depreciation and amortization (D&amp;A) and capital expenditures (CAPEX). The process of building a startup financial model is usually referred to as financial modeling."
The Heavenly Play
"The Heavenly Play () is a 1942 Swedish drama movie directed by Alf Sjöberg and starring Rune Lindström, Eivor Lindström, Anders Henrikson, Holger Löwenadler, Gudrun Brost, Arnold Sjöstrand, Emil Fjellström, Hugo Björne."
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
"The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was a United States federal agency. It was founded on March 3, 1915. The agency researched flight technology and aircraft. On October 1, 1958, the agency was dissolved. Its employees were moved to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)."
Founding.
"NACA was founded on March 3, 1915. At that time, technology and culture were changing quickly. American flight technology was not as advanced as Europe's. The American public had mixed feelings about flight technology. Some people thought that flying was dangerous and foolish. Some thought that it was an important achievement in technology. But in Europe, people were more confident in flight technology."
"When World War I started in Europe, the Europeans were already using advanced flight technology. The Germans used airships to bomb British cities. Airplanes were used to spy on enemies. This worried the Americans, who realized that their flight technology is behind Europe's. In response, the federal government of the United States created NACA on March 3, 1915."

"By the 1920s, the NACA's mission was to promote military and civilian flight. The NACA did this by researching new flight technologies. To help this research, the NACA built many testing facilities. This included wind tunnels, test stands, and flight test facilities. The agency received a budget of $5000 in 1915."
World War II.
The NACA was involved in World War II. They helped research many flight technologies. A lot of the research that the NACA did before World War II was used to make American fighter planes fly better. They researched how to reduce drag. Drag slows down airplanes when moving in the air. They also researched how to stop the propellers of the plane from freezing.
NASA.
"On November 21, 1957, Hugh Dryden, NACA's director, established the Special Committee on Space Technology. This committee was created to help develop a space program."
When there were sic a stock of Dandies O.&lt;/poem&gt;
Dandies in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States and Great Britain were often men from middle-class backgrounds who were trying to become people from high society.
"The model, or archetype, of a dandy was Beau Brummell from the Regency period of George IVth. He was a friend of the then Prince of Wales. Lord Byron is also an example. The writer Oscar Wilde is another, later example. Less extreme versions were the American artist who lived in London, James McNeill Whistler, and the French composer Maurice Ravel. ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" is a famous example from literature."
"Today, in the 21st century, the word ""dandy"" is often used as a joke word to mean ""fine"" or ""great""."
Robert Costanza
"Robert Costanza (born 14 September, 1950) is an American ecological economist and the Gund Professor of Ecological economics and Director of the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics at the University of Vermont."
Biography.
"Robert Costanza was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He studied architecture and urban and regional planning from the University of Florida and got a Masters degree. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Florida in 1979 in systems ecology, with a minor in economics."
"In 1982 he was selected as a Kellogg National Fellow, in 1992 he was awarded the Society for Conservation Biology Distinguished Achievement Award and in 1993 he was selected as a Pew Scholar in Conservation and the Environment. In 1998 he was awarded the Kenneth Boulding Memorial Award for Outstanding Contributions in Ecological Economics. In 2000 he received an honorary doctorate in natural sciences from Stockholm University."
"Before he moved to Vermont in August 2002, he was director of the University of Maryland, College Park Institute for Ecological Economics, and a professor in the Center for Environmental Science, at Solomons, and in the Biology Department at College Park."
"Costanza is co-founder and past-president of the International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE) and was chief editor of the society’s journal ""Ecological Economics"" from its inception until 9/02. He serves on the editorial board of eight other international academic journals. He is president of the International Society for Ecosystem Health."
Work.
"Dr. Costanza's research has focused on the interface between ecological and economic systems. This includes landscape level spatial simulation modeling; analysis of energy and material flows through economic and ecological systems; valuation of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and natural capital; and analysis of dysfunctional incentive systems and ways to correct them."
Literature.
"Costanza is the author or co-author 16 books. and over 300 scientific papers. Books, a selection:"
"His work has been cited in more than 1700 scientific articles since 1987 (according to the Science Citation Index) and more than 80 interviews and reports on his work have appeared in various media, including Newsweek, US News and World Report, the Economist, the New York Times, Science, Nature, National Geographic, and National Public Radio."
Ifriqiya
"In medieval history, Ifriqiya or Ifriqiyah () was the area of the coastal regions of what are today western Libya, Tunisia, and eastern Algeria. This area included what had been the Roman province of Africa."
"In modern Arabic, the term simply means ""Africa"". It comes from the Latin term ""Africa""."
Roman province
"In Ancient Rome, a province (Latin, ""provincia"", pl. ""provinciae"") was the basic and, until around 300, largest territorial and administrative unit of the empire's territorial possessions outside of the peninsula of Italy. The word ""province"" in modern English came from the term used by the Romans."
Bring Me the Horizon
"Bring Me the Horizon are a British metalcore band from Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. The band was formed in 2004 from members of other bands within their local area. They play a style of music that combines rock and metalcore, but they have taken on a more rock style with their latest album. Their album in 2006 called ""Count Your Blessings"" was a deathcore album and often people nickname that type of music ""Screamo"". The band's name comes from a Pirates of the Caribbean quote."
Africa Province
"The Roman province of Africa was established after the Romans defeated Carthage in the Third Punic War. It roughly includeded the territory of present-day northern Tunisia, north-eastern Algeria and the Mediterranean coast of modern-day western Libya along the Syrtis Minor. The Arabs later named roughly the same region as the original province Ifriqiya, an other word for ""Africa""."
Economics.
"The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture. Called the ""granary of the empire"", North Africa, according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits. By the second century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivation of slaves, and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery and wool."
He was playing in the Iran U-20 1991–1993 and the Iran U-23 1993–1995

Life skills
Life skills are abilities which help people to deal with the demands and challenges that they face in life.
The World Health Organization in 1999 identified cross-cultural areas of life skills:
Most of the times children get life skills when they play or discover new things with adults.
"Fordtown, Tennessee"
"Fordtown is an unincorporated community in Sullivan County, Tennessee, United States, The community's name was adopted due to the number of people with the last name Ford, who lived in the area. It is accessed by the road named after it, Fordtown Road."
Orientalism
"Orientalism is an idea that the Eastern world and the Western world have opposite ways of thinking in terms of being and knowledge. It is often shown in the superiority of the West and the inferiority of the East. Edward Said was the first person to use the word this way in his 1978 book ""“Orientalism”"". He describes Orientalism as “a style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and ‘the Occident’ ”. Before the term Orientalism was used by Said, it had a different meaning. In 1798, after Napoleon invaded Egypt, an era started. During this era, it was easier for European colonial powers to use their economic and political power over much of Asia and Africa. This allowed for more academic study of the East than before. This was called “the Oriental renaissance” in the 19th century. It had a large and broad effect on literature, art, and architecture in Europe."
"During the 19th and 20th centuries, the term Orientalism was used to describe the effects of the Orient’s influence on art, literature, and architecture fields. It was also used to label the academic study done by philologists (people who study the history of language) who were focused on the Oriental languages and the understanding of ancient Oriental texts. This knowledge was thought to be enough to understand Oriental civilizations. There was no interest to the day-to-day life of these Oriental communities and their heterogeneous customs and traditions."
"During the time of colonial power in the 19th and 20th centuries, the role of the Orientalist academic changed. The knowledge that was learned in this field of study was used to justify European colonialism over the Arab world."
"Orientalism in architecture, art, and literature."
"Beginning in the 19th century, the ""Oriental Renaissance"" influenced European culture in many ways. In the architectural field there are many different revivals in Europe. The Indo-Saracenic revival at the end of the 18th century, or the Egyptian revival, recreated buildings with motifs taken from the Indian subcontinent and Egypt."
"The “Oriental Renaissance” affected also the Romantic movement. In fact, romantic writers and artists showed a great interest in this Oriental rediscovery. A great example can be found in Flaubert’s (one of the most important French writer of the 19th century) novel Salammbò in 1862, where the Orient is depicted as something opposite of the Occident, eroticized and exoticized. Travelers’ accounts were very popular and contributed to form an imaginary vision of the Orient in the Western societies. Lord Byron, Victor Hugo, Nerval, Chateaubriand are some of the famous writers of the time that evoked exotic scenes and wild adventures by their accounts."
"During the 19th century, Orientalist painting movement also developed. The drawings of the French painters Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Eugene Delacroix, or the English painter William Holman Hunt are important examples of this movement. They depicted the East as something different, dangerous, wild, sexual, often because of their imagination and not because of the reality. For example, the French painter Ingres drew images of nude Oriental women using ancient Greek and Roman sculptures rather than real models. It would have been very difficult to persuade a woman in the Arab and Indian world to pose naked."

Prison
"A prison or jail is a building where people are forced to live if their freedom has been taken away. The main use for prisons is as a punishment for breaking the law. Those who break the law and are convicted (found guilty) in court can receive a prison sentence, which is an order to spend an amount of time in prison. Prisons are usually run by the government."
"There are other reasons why someone might be held in prison. Sometimes, people can be held in prison before their trial (known as pre-trial detention or remand). In times of war, captured soldiers may become prisoners of war and civilians (non-soldiers) may be placed in an internment camp. In some countries, prisons are also used for political prisoners (people who disagree with the country's leader or government)."
"Other words for a prison include a gaol (pronounced like ""jail""), penitentiary or correctional facility. In the US, the words ""prison"" and ""jail"" mean separate things. A US ""jail"" is run by a local government and holds people who have not yet had their trial or who have been convicted for a minor crime. A US ""prison"" or ""penitentiary"" is run by the state or federal government and holds people who are serving a long sentence for a serious crime. Outside of North America, ""prison"" and ""jail"" mean the same thing. There are lots of slang words for prisons."
"In the United States and many other developed countries, inmates have most or all their personal possessions confiscated until release and are forced to wear prison uniforms."
Prison buildings and facilities.
Prisons are usually surrounded by walls and gates. There are usually many locked gates inside the prison to control the inmates.
"The inmates sleep in small locked rooms called cells. Cells have a bunk bed, a toilet, and a sink. Inmates are allowed to leave their cell every day for exercise. Some inmates work in the prison during the day, either in a factory or doing cooking or cleaning. Law enforcement officers called prison guards watch the inmates. The manager of a prison is called the warden (US, Canada), superintendent (some parts of the US, India) or governor (UK, Australia)."
"Prisons usually also include other buildings and facilities, such as a chapel, a library, an exercise yard, a gymnasium, an infirmary (small hospital), visiting rooms (for visits from family and lawyers), kitchens, and accommodation for prison staff."
"The level of security a prison has depends on the type of prison. A ""maximum security prison"" has even more protection than a regular prison. Some prisons in the United States have a section called ""death row"", where people who have been sentenced to death are kept in prison until their execution. On the other hand, an ""open prison"" is a prison where inmates can often travel out of the prison. These are used for prisoners who have been convicted of minor crimes, or who will soon be released."
"The United Nations made the ""Standard Minimum Rule"" for human treatment for prisoners in 1955. Also the Article 10 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also affirm the treatment with humanity for them in prison. In some prisons, people imprisoned for child sexual abuse are separated from other prisoners for their own safety."
Purpose.
There are four main ideas about what prisons should be used for:
Pre-trial detention.
"A person who has been charged with a crime, but has not yet been convicted for it in a court, may be sent to prison if:"
"In some parts of the US, a person who is arrested may be held at a county jail until they decide whether to charge or release the person. In other places, a person who is arrested will be held at a police station, not a prison."
Special prisons.
"Male and female inmates are usually kept in separate locations, and often in separate prisons."
"There are special prisons for people under the age of 18 who commit crimes. These inmates are called young offenders or juvenile offenders. These places will not always have the word ""prison"" in their name, instead having names like ""Young Offenders' Institution""."
"While not called ""prisons"" most of the time, psychiatric hospitals often share characteristics with prisons, such as residents staying against their will and the various security measures implemented."
"A penal colony is a correctional facility operated in one country by the government of another. These were common during the 18th and 19th centuries when France, Spain, and Britain had colonies. Soviet gulags were a form of penal colony."
A labour camp is a simplified prison in which inmates are forced into manual labor. Prisoners tend to be accommodated in bunkhouses or barracks.
"Concentration camps (also called internment camps) are facilities for confining people without trial based on perceived threat, ethnicity, religion, etc."
Controversy.
Prisons are a controversial topic that people have different views about.
Red Bull Brasil
"Red Bull Brasil, also known as RB Brasil, is a Brazilian association football club from Campinas, São Paulo. The club was founded in 2007 by initiative of energy drink-maker Red Bull GmbH. Red Bull Brasil plays in the top tier of Campeonato Paulista, the São Paulo state league. In 2017, Red Bull Brasil makes their second appearance in the fourth tier of Campeonato Brasileiro (the first was in 2015)."
Great American Interchange
The Great American Interchange was an important zoogeographic event about three million years ago. Land and freshwater fauna migrated between North America and South America.
"The migration happened during the Pliocene, 3.6–2.6 million years ago (mya). The volcanic Isthmus of Panama rose from the seafloor and bridged the two continents."
The land bridge in what is now Panama joined the Neotropic (roughly South America) and Nearctic (roughly North America) ecozones to form the Americas.
"The interchange is visible from both stratigraphy and nature. Its most dramatic effect is on the distribution of mammals, but weak-flying or flightless birds, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods and even freshwater fish also migrated."
"The differences in the fauna of North and South America had been known for some time. Both Humboldt and Darwin discussed it. The interchange as a concept was first fully laid out in 1876 by the ""father of biogeography"", Alfred Russel Wallace. Wallace had spent 1848–1852 exploring and collecting specimens in the Amazon Basin. Others who made significant contributions to understanding the event in the century that followed include Florentino Ameghino and George Gaylord Simpson."
"Similar interchanges occurred earlier in the Cainozoic, when the former Gondwana continents of India and Africa made contact with Eurasia, about 50 and 30 mya respectively."
Plate tectonics.
"When the global continent Pangaea broke up early in the Jurassic period, the great southern supercontinent Gondwana was formed. It separated from Laurasia 200–180 mya."
"In stages, Gondwana also broke up, eventually into half-a-dozen continents we recognise today. They were Australasia, Indian subcontinent, Africa, Madagascar, Antarctica and South America."
"South America drifted west from Africa, starting about 130 mya in the Lower Cretaceous. There was open sea between them by 110 mya. The last connection of South America with any part of Gondwana was a link with West Antarctica, which broke in the Oligocene, only 30 mya."
Relevance to biogeography.
"When Gondwana was separated from Laurasia, evolution of most animals and plants went on separately in the two great supercontinents. Later, as Gondwana broke up, most of its fauna and flora also evolved separately."
"This is not obvious in Africa and India, since they moved north and joined the Eurasian continent long ago. Animals and plants moved north and south there also, but the original pattern is now hard to see. But in Australasia and South America the pattern is clear."
"The mammals are a good example. Eutherian mammals evolved in Laurasia but few got to Gondwana before it was separated. Earlier groups of mammals did get to Gondwana. They were the marsupials, the monotremes and other (now extinct) therian mammals."
"Thus, when South America was completely separated, it had only the earlier types of mammals, including some early eutherians such as the Xenarthra. The groups which evolved later, and which dominate the northern continents, only got to South America by the Great American Interchange."
South America's endemic fauna.
"After the late Mesozoic breakup of Gondwana, South America spent most of the Cainozoic era as an island continent."
"Its ""splendid isolation"" allowed the fauna to evolve into many forms found nowhere else on earth, most of which are now extinct."
Early mammals.
"The endemic mammals initially consisted of metatherians (including marsupials, xenarthrans, and a diverse group of South American ungulates."
Marsupials appear to have travelled from South America through Antarctica to Australasia in the late Cretaceous or early Tertiary.
"Ratites (relatives of South American tinamous) probably migrated by this route about the same time, in the direction from South America towards Australia/New Zealand."
"Other taxa that may have dispersed by the same route (if not by flying or rafting) are parrots, chelid turtles and (extinct) meiolaniid turtles."
"One living South American marsupial, the tiny Monito del Monte, is more closely related to Australian marsupials than to other South American marsupials. Since it is the most 'basal' (= primitive) australidelphian we know, its group probably evolved in South America and then colonized Australia."
A 61 mya old platypus-like monotreme fossil from Patagonia may be an Australian immigrant.
"Marsupials in South America included didelphimorphs (opossums), shrew opossums and several other small groups."
Predators.
"The borhyaenids and the sabertooth ""Thylacosmilus"" were once considered to be marsupials. They are sparassodont metatherians, the sister group of the marsupials. Sparassodonts were the only South American mammals to specialize as carnivores. Their relative inefficiency left opportunites for nonmammalian predators to be more prominent than usual (similar to the )."
Wouter Bos
"Wouter Jacob Bos (born July 14, 1963) was a Dutch minister of finance, deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Dutch Labour Party. He won the election of Dutch Labour Party leader, defeating Jouke de Vries. He led the party until March 12, 2010, the day he left. His successor is Job Cohen, who used to be the mayor of Amsterdam. He left because he wanted to spend more time with his family."
"He left as minister of finance and deputy Prime Minister because the government felt over the decision of Uruzgan. The Dutch Labour Party was in the coalition, together with Christen Democraten Appèl and the ChristenUnie, both Christian parties. The Dutch Labour Party did not agree and stepped out of the coalition."
Hughes Medal
The Hughes Medal is awarded by the Royal Society of London for original discoveries in electricity and magnetism or their applications.
"The medal was first given to J.J. Thomson in 1902 ""for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases"". It has been awarded over a hundred times. At first it was awarded annually, now it is every two years."
"Unlike some other Royal Society medals, the Hughes Medal has never been awarded to the same person more than once. Only one woman has won it: Michele Dougherty in 2008, who was awarded the medal ""for innovative use of magnetic field data that led to discovery of an atmosphere around one of Saturn's moons and the way it revolutionised our view of the role of planetary moons in the Solar System""."
"The medal has been awarded to more than one person at once; in 1938 it was won by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton ""for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles"", in 1981 by Peter Higgs, Thomas Walter and Tom W. B. Kibble ""for their international contributions about the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in elementary-particle theory"", in 1982 by Drummond Matthews and Frederick Vine for explaining the magnetic properties of the ocean floors which then led to the plate tectonic hypothesis, and in 1988 by Archibald Howie and M.J. Whelan for their work on the theory of electron diffraction and microscopy, and its use in the study of lattice defects in crystals."
J. J. Thomson
"Sir Joseph John ""J.J."" Thomson, OM, FRS (18 December 1856 – 30 August 1940) was a British physicist and Nobel laureate. He discovered the electron and isotopes, and invented the mass spectrometer. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 for his discovery of the electron and his work on the conduction of electricity in gases. John Joseph Thomson in 1893 said: ""There is no other branch of physics which affords us so promising an opportunity of penetrating the secret of electricity."""
"In 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle of very small mass compared to its electric charge. It was later called the electron and was the first subatomic particle to be found. Thomson also found the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, while studying anode rays (positive cations)."
"In atomic theory he hypothesized that atoms were spheres of evenly spread positive charge, where an individual negatively charged electron resided. He later concluded there was more than one negatively charged particle in an atom."
Many of the young men who studied and worked with him at University of Cambridge also became famous physicists.
Johann Wilhelm Hittorf
"Johann Wilhelm Hittorf (March 27, 1824 – November 28, 1914) was a German physicist who was born in Bonn and died in Münster, Germany. He was the first to compute the electric capacity of charged atoms and molecules (ions)."
Flor-de-Lis
"Flor-de-Lis are a folk music group from Lisbon, Portugal. They competed in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the song ""Todas as ruas do amor"" where they finished 15th."
Gulf Air
Gulf Air is an airline based in the Middle East. They operate scheduled flights in the Middle East and international flights.
Terraforming
"Terraforming is changing a planet or large natural satellite that we cannot live on at present without spacesuits and similar technology. The idea is to change it so some life from Earth could exist there. It would need a suitable atmosphere (air), heat, and water. ""Paraterraforming"" or ""worldhousing"" is a variant of terraforming that would involve building domes over the majority of a planet or moon."
"Some think it is possible to terraform Mercury, Venus, Mars, Ceres, Pluto, our Moon, Titan, Callisto."
"It is arguable that we have already succeeded in terraforming right here on Earth. Thanks to modern technology, humans can now thrive in places that should be impossible to live in such as deserts and the Arctic."
"A related concept is paraterraforming or worldhousing which would involve constructing greenhouse-style geodesic domes and similar structures to cover most of, if not the entire surface of the planet or moon."
Court
"A court, in law, is a part of the government in which people come together to decide how to apply the country's laws to a specific situation, especially when there is an argument over how to apply the law. Some disagreements a court may decide are whether a person is guilty of a crime, who is the legal owner of property, or who the children of two divorced parents should live with. A court is usually in a special building called a courthouse."
"Most countries have multiple courts to deal with different issues. For example, civil courts deal with private disputes between people or organizations, while criminal courts deal with people who have been accused of crimes."
Appellate courts.
"An appellate court is one that can change a decision made by a lower court. This is called court hierarchy. The decision made by a low court can be appealed to a higher one, asking the higher court to change the decision. Higher courts usually have more experienced judges in charge. The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in that country."
Constitutional courts.
Some countries have a constitutional court. These courts decide if a law is in agreement with the constitution of the country.
Punishments.
"Courts usually set the punishments for breaking the law. Common punishments include paying fines and spending time in prison. In some countries, courts have the power to sentence people to death (the death penalty)."
Birth
"Birth (to be born) means when a baby animal comes out of its egg, or out of its mother after pregnancy. It is sometimes thought of as the beginning of life. It is also known as calving in livestock or whelping in meat-eating mammals."
Changes in pelvis during human pregnancy.
"In adult females the pelvis is shaped differently from males. The differences are connected with allowing the baby to pass through the birth canal successfully. Also, during pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin softens the ligaments in the pelvis area. This produces a little bit of extra space for the baby's head to get through. The process is hard to describe in words, but fortunately there is an excellent video which explains what goes on."
Pollution
"Pollution is when harmful substances are added to the environment and then change it in a bad way. There are five kinds of pollution of the environment: water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution, soil pollution and thermal pollution."
"As pollution grows, ways to combat it have been in demand. Solar energy and wind energy give people clean opportunities to power their homes. But these may also have environmental issues depending on the situation. When people use these alternative forms of energy, they put less carbon dioxide into the environment."
Water pollution.
"Water pollution is the presence of harmful materials in water, such as sewage, dissolved metal, waste from farms, factories and crude oil spilled from oil tankers. The three main substances that pollute water are nitrates from fertilizers, sewage and detergents."
"Activities such as bathing and washing clothes near lakes, ponds or rivers add nutrients like nitrate and phosphate into the water bodies.This leads to excessive growth of algae on the surface of water. It blocks the penetration of sunlight and air, thus reducing oxygen."
"It causes harm to organisms living in water and can also harm people's health. In extreme cases, it may cause diseases like cancer. It also leads to loss of a large amount of aquatic life."
Epidemic diseases.
"Water pollution has been a problem from the time human population increased, and live in cities. Cities have been prone to cholera and typhoid fever and other infectious diseases since Roman times. Existing water systems put in place in the 19th century are overwhelmed by the rapid growth of population in cities."
Air pollution.
"Air can be polluted by many things. Examples include poisonous gases, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and very small particulates. Smoke and harmful gases released by fires, industries, and thermal power plants cause air pollution. Using coal and wood as fuels for fire causes a lot of air pollution. Petroleum produces less pollution per ton, but it causes a lot of pollution since a lot of it is burned globally. Air pollution may cause health problems such as asthma or other breathing problems."
Air pollution causes global warming and acid rain. This makes it difficult for some living things to survive.
Noise pollution/Sound pollution.
"Noise pollution, also known as sound pollution, is harmful to the brain and hearing of all animals and humans. This includes the sound of vehicles, loud speakers, airplanes, jets, train horns etc. Noise pollution can cause ear problems or even permanent deafness, especially to older people. The schools which are beside the roads suffer from noise pollution. Students cannot concentrate in their studies. People in hospitals near main roads also suffer."
Thermal pollution.
Thermal pollution is the harmful release of heated liquid into a body of water or heat released into the air as a waste product of an industry.
Irish migration to Great Britain
Irish migration to Great Britain has occurred from the earliest recorded history to present.
Gengan Tonaki
"Gengan Tonaki (渡名喜元完; ""Tonaki Gengan"", 30 October 1884 – 24 January 1997) was a Japanese (Okinawan) farmer and supercentenarian, and at the time of his death at age 112 years, 86 days the oldest Japanese man ever (although the claimed 120-year-old Shigechiyo Izumi was believed to have been older) before being beaten by Denzo Ishizaki."
"Tonaki was born in late October 1884 in Sashiki (today Nanjō), Okinawa, as the second child and only boy of seven siblings, of whom one sister, who was eight years younger, was still living at the time of his death. In mid-1st decade of the 20th century, Tonaki fled to Hawaii to avoid the Russo-Japanese War and worked at a sugar refinery for about ten years before returning to Okinawa, working as a farmer until age 89. He married a woman named Kame (who was eight years younger and died at age 61 during the Battle of Okinawa) and had six children (of whom one died young of liver disease and four, all except his second son, died during the Battle of Okinawa)."
"Tonaki became the oldest living man in Japan on 20 September 1991, after 108-year-old Gihei Oka's death and also the oldest living Japanese man overall, later on 16 February 1992 after the 109 years, 13 days old Russo-Japanese War veteran Mamoru Eto's death, as Eto who was just 4 days younger than Oka emigrated to the United States, and later on 30 October 1994 only the second Japanese man who became a supercentenarian, after Eiju Tsuru who died on 11 January 1990, just 24 days before his 111th birthday, although Shigechiyo Izumi who died on 21 February 1986 was still believed to have been aged 120 years, 237 days and Denzo Ishizaki claimed to have been ten days older than Tonaki, as his birth register which showed a birth year of 1886 rather than 1884 was claimed to have been delayed by two years."
"After 111-year-old Frenchman Émile Fourcade's death on 29 December 1995, Tonaki became the last living man born in 1884 as well as the second-oldest living man behind Danish-born Americanman Christian Mortensen, although Americanman Johnson Parks has been verified to have been 15 days older than Tonaki but recently become disputed after a study proving that he may have been born around ten years later than he claimed."
French migration to the United Kingdom
French migration to the United Kingdom is a phenomenon that has occurred at various points in history.

"The company was known for several pioneering innovations in U.S. multichannel television, including its satellite uplink of local Atlanta independent station WTCG channel 17 as one of the first national ""superstations"", and its establishment of CNN—the first 24-hour news channel."
George Little (New Brunswick politician)
"George Little (May 22, 1937 – May 15, 2021) was a Scottish-Canadian teacher and politician who led the New Brunswick New Democratic Party (NDP) from 1980 to 1988. He died on May 15, 2021 at Saint John Regional Hospital in Saint John, New Brunswick, a week before his 84th birthday."
Cyclone Tauktae
Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Tauktae () was a powerful Arabian Sea tropical cyclone that became the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Indian state of Gujarat since the 1998 Gujarat cyclone and one of the strongest tropical cyclones to ever affect the West Coast of India.
"The cyclone made landfall in Gujarat the same day as India recorded its, at the time, highest single-day COVID death toll, with 4,329 deaths reported."
"Tauktae resulted in at least 82 deaths in India, and left another 81 people missing."
Darwin's Arch
"Darwin's Arch was a natural rock arch on the southeast of Darwin Island on the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The arch sat on a rocky plateau, nicknamed ""the theatre""."
"The arch collapsed because of natural erosion on May 17, 2021, leaving two freestanding pillars."
Lee Evans (sprinter)
"Lee Edward Evans (February 25, 1947 – May 19, 2021) was an American sprinter. He won two gold medals in the 1968 Summer Olympics, setting world records in the 400 meters and the 4 × 400 meters relay."
"Evans co-founded the Olympic Project for Human Rights and was part of the athlete's boycott and the Black Power movement. He was born in Madera, California."
Cattrall is a strong supporter of Liverpool F.C.
Christian mission
"Christian churches often send individuals, or small groups of people to a foreign country. These people should then convince the local population to convert to the Christian faith. Very often, this couples evangelisation with humanitarian work. The missionaries are priests as well and can administer sacraments, but sometimes they are laypeople. Today, missionary activity often means cooperating with the local church. As an example, the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Tanzania has sent missionaries to Mozambique."
"Missionary work is often criticized for the ways used. Examples are forced baptisms, proselytism, and that during colonial times, there were strong ties between colonialism and missionary work. Sometimes, there is the problem that the moral standards of the societies are very different from the moral standards of Christianity, missionary work will force different standards onto indigenous societies."
Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville
"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville (23 February 23 1680 Montreal, Quebec – March 7, 1767). He helped colonise North America for France, and was governor of French Louisiana 4 separate times between 1701 and 1743. He is also known as Sieur de Bienville."
His older brother was the explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.
Evolution of the eye
The evolution of the eye is an example of a homologous organ which many animals have.
"Some components of the eye, such as the light-sensitive opsins, seem to have a common ancestry. They evolved once, early in the evolution of animals. They control the conversion of photons into electrical signals. For example, an opsin found in the mammalian retina, melanopsin, is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex but not in vision."
"On the other hand, complex image-forming eyes evolved some 50 to 100 times – using many of the same proteins and genetic toolkits in their construction."
"Complex eyes seem to have first evolved in a few million years, in the rapid burst of evolution known as the Cambrian explosion. There is no evidence of eyes before the Cambrian, but many eyes can be seen in fossils from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale."
"Eyes show many adaptations to meet the needs of the organisms which have them. Eyes vary in their acuity (accuracy of sight), their sensitivity in low light levels, and their ability to detect motion or identify objects. Their sensitivity to wavelengths decides whether they can see in colours, and which colours they can see."
Rate of evolution.
"The first fossils of eyes appeared during the lower Cambrian period, about 540 million years ago. This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution, dubbed the 'Cambrian explosion'. The evolution of eyes perhaps started an arms race that led to a rapid spate of evolution."
"Earlier than this, organisms may have used light sensitivity, but not for fast movement and navigation by vision."
"It is difficult to estimate the rate of eye evolution. Simple modelling supposes small mutations exposed to natural selection. This shows that a primitive optical sense organ based on good photopigments could evolve into a complex human-like eye in about 400,000 years."
Early stages of eye evolution.
"The earliest light sensors were eyespots. They are photoreceptor proteins found in protists. Eyespots can only distinguish light from dark. This is enough for the daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They cannot distinguish shapes, nor decide from which direction the light is coming."
"Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups. The ""Euglena""'s eyespot, called a ""stigma"", is at the front. Its red pigment shades a collection of light sensitive crystals. Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light to do photosynthesis, and to predict day and night. These movements are the main circadian (daily) rhythms."
"There are visual pigments in the brains of more complex organisms. They are thought to help synchronise spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms can synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the fertilisation of their eggs."
Vision itself relies on the basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes. How this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism's environment varies widely. Eyes have a wide range of structures and forms. All of these have evolved much later than the underlying proteins and molecules.
"At a cellular level, there appear to be two main ""designs"" of eyes, one possessed by the protostomes (molluscs, annelid worms and arthropods), the other by the deuterostomes (chordates and echinoderms)."
PAX6.
"PAX6 is the protein which is encoded by the ""PAX6"" gene."
"""PAX6"" is a master control gene or ""transcription factor"" for the development of eyes and other sensory organs. It is medically important because various mutations produce eyesight defects."
Rudolph Boysen
"Charles Rudolph Boysen (July 14, 1895 – November 25, 1950) was a California horticulturist. Boysen worked as Anaheim City Parks superintendent from 1921-1950. He created the boysenberry, a hybrid between several types of blackberries, raspberries, and loganberries."
"A common cause of thermal pollution is using water as a coolant by power stations and industrial manufacturers. This puts back warm water, and so raises the temperature and decreases how much oxygen is in the water. The heat released into the air will make the air warmer which increase global warming."
Immunity (medical)
"Immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself from 'foreign bodies'. This means rejecting infections, clearing up dust which gets in the lungs, and killing cancer cells."
"Immunity is of two types. Innate immunity protects the host against infection, but has no 'memory', and so gives no long-term immunity."
"The second type is adaptive immunity, which does have a kind of 'memory'. It does give long-term protection against specific pathogens."
"All animals, plants and fungi have some innate immunity. Vertebrates also have adaptive immunity."
People can be immunised from some diseases by having a vaccination
"(injection of some dead or weakened virus, or bacteria that causes the disease). By doing so, the body learns how the virus/bacteria harms the body, and will react more quickly to fight the virus/bacteria when it comes in contact with the virus/bacteria again. When your body has defended itself against the virus/bacteria it will trap the certain virus/bacteria in a ""net"" so when the virus/bacteria comes back it will be easier to trap those viruses/bacteria as well."
History of immunology.
Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease.
The earliest known mention of immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.
"In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom."
"This and other observations of acquired immunity was later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory."
"It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed."
"Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral immunity (antibodies) and cellular immunity (T cells and dendritic cells)."
"Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Mechnikov."
Humoral immunity.
"Humoral immunity is immunity that is done by macromolecules. Antibodies, complement proteins, and certain antimicrobial peptides are in extracellular fluids."
Cell-mediated immunity.
"This is an immune response which does not involve antibodies. Cell-mediated immunity is the activation of phagocytes, antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen."
Roman numerals
"Roman numerals are a numeral system that was used by ancient Rome. Numbers in this system use letters from the Latin alphabet. Currently, it uses seven symbols:"
"The Europeans still used Roman numerals even after the fall of the Roman Empire. From the 14th century, the Europeans replaced Roman numerals with Arabic numerals. However, people still use Roman numerals to this day."
"One place in which they are sometimes seen is on clock faces (the front of a clock). For example, on the clock of Big Ben, the hours from 1 to 12 are written as:"
"The and can be read as ""one less than 5"" (4) and ""one less than 10"" (9). On many clocks that use Roman numerals, however, 4 is written as ."
Subtraction rule.
"Instead of writing the same letter four times, a rule for subtraction is used. The letter is written once, then the next largest Roman numeral is written. When a lower number (such as ) appears before a higher one (such as ), the lower number is subtracted from the higher one. For example, 4 is not written as , but instead as , because is (5) minus (1). The same is done for 9 - it is not written as , but instead as , because is (10) minus (1)."
Example.
"It is very easy to write a number as a Roman numeral. Simply subtract the largest possible Roman numeral as many times as possible from the number. This system will result in a valid Roman numeral, but will not take the subtraction rule into account."
"Getting the number from the numeral is equally simple, by adding the values of the symbols."

The Abstract House (Milan)
"The The Abstract House or La Casa Astratta is a palace in Viale Beatrice d'Este 24, Milano, Italy in the historic center of Milan inside the luxurious Quadronno District, which collects the open-air masterpieces of numerous archistars of the fifties."
"The Palazzo La Casa Abstract was built by Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani together with the painter Francesco Magnelli in 1952, and is inspired by the reworking of the pictorial theories of Kandinsky that dialogue with Italian rationalism,Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani also completed the adjacent building in Viale Beatrice d'Este 26 in 1952, while Giordano Forti and Camillo Magni in 1957 created the masterpiece adjacent to ""The Abstract House"" known as Palazzo Forti, making the whole area an open-air museum."
"The Abstract House of Viale Beatrice d'Este in Milan is the iconic masterpiece of the MAC artistic movement, full of suggestions and the deepest conceptual meanings of the entire Movement for Concrete Art with global significance."
Description.
"The abstract house is the maximum expression of the architectural conceptual theories of Perogalli and Mariani synthesis of the artistic movement MAC, founded in 1948 in Milan with Atanasio Soldati, Gillo Dorfles, Bruno Munari and Gianni Monnet with the aim of overcoming figurative art by referring to the lesson of Kandinsky."
"The inseparable unity of the arts is significantly manifested in this example, the so-called ""abstract house""; it presents a composition of the facade inspired by the work of Alberto Magnelli, a well-known abstract painter of Tuscan origins who moved to Paris."
"The Palazzo is a unique expressed synthesis applied to a building of the MAC-Movimento d'Arte Concreta artistic movement. It is defined by the art critic of Claudio Camponogara as ""one of the richest and most significant buildings of the entire Movement for Concrete Art""."
"The painter Francesco Magnelli, active in Paris, collaborates with the designers in particular to layout the facade where the apartments of the Abstract House in Viale Beatrice d'Este are distributed according to a pictorial scheme, also finding inspiration from the artist Alberto Magnelli. The same design is taken up in negative inside the entrance hall with an artistic inlay in the rubber floor with the aim of establishing a close relationship between the facade and the interior space. In the atrium a sculpture was created by Attilio Mariani."
Style.
"Thus, for a short period of time (from 1948 to 1958), for architects and artists, Milan became the city where they could experience a new conception of the relationships between the arts. The Palace shows how the concrete forms are not simply paintings applied to the walls of a building designed separately by another person, but are born and developed together with the architecture with which they identify. The task of breaking the stereometry of the building is entrusted to the balconies which, united in a clever play of colors, enliven the front with beams of intense blue and give the impression of a large abstract composition pleasing to the eye and functional. The same design is taken up in negative inside the entrance hall, where an inlay of the rubber floor has the purpose of establishing a close relationship between the external facade and the internal space, where there is also a Mariani sculpture. Perogalli also considers this creation one of the most original and significant in which ""the synthesis of the arts ... is also notable for the strong chromatic component: the facade of the building has a cladding in white marble and blue ceramic tiles. The decoration is expressed both in the free composition and in the choice of colors on the facade."
"""The façade endowed with movement and plasticity for the protrusions of the balconies and bow windows that the chromatic play enhances: cladding in white marble, mirrors in black ceramic mosaic, balconies in blue ceramic mosaic."""
Bruno Morassutti
"Bruno Morassutti (Padua, December 8, 1920 - Belluno, September 4, 2008) was an Italian architect and designer. Morassutti is an archistar among the protagonists of the birth of Italian design active in the fifties, a protagonist of Italian rationalism."
"Morassutti's best known masterpiece is the Bosco Verticale in the exclusive Quadronno district of Milan, which anticipates Boeri's recent construction."
"Which was, uh,"
"I, I find that fascinating that, uh,"
"Yeah,"
"I do, too."
Do you ever listen to the radio
"or any,"
"I listen to K R L D, and, uh, uh, K L I F, the news talk radio."
Uh-huh.
And I actually listen to C N N radio.
Do you know it was on radio now?
"No,"
I don't.
It's on eleven ninety.
"Um. I really, uh, have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of, even music"
"and, uh,"
"Well, when I go to work I listen."
"Yeah,"
my husband does
"and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes, and says, oh, I just heard on the news that such and such happened, you know, if it's something really interesting"
"and and then I'll know to, to keep an eye out for it,"
Yeah.
but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio.
"Well, with, with your, you know,"
"if you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is"
and then they start repeating everything.
Uh-huh.
"And, and so it's kind of a, oh,"
"that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh,"
"I don't think, I'm trying to think if it's much local."
I listen to a little of that
and I listen to a little of ninety point one.
"I, I'm, I'm inveterate switcher."
"Where, where are you?"
I'm in Dallas.
"Oh, yeah."
Are you in Dallas also?
"No,"
I'm in San Antonio.
"Oh, really,"
okay.
I get my news from a combination of sources.
I take the paper every day
Uh-huh.
"and I read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool."
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and I watch the, uh, actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work."
"And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news."
Uh-huh.
"I normally find that uh, I'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,"
"so I don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch."
"I, I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because I used to get it during the week"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time, reading it in the morning."
Yeah.
"So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work."
"Um, the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television"
Uh-huh.
and I enjoy that quite a bit.
Yeah.
"Um, one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian."
Uh-huh.
So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
"I will admit I work with, uh, someone who's Iranian,"
"but since it's just the two of us, it's"
"Yeah,"
yeah
Well that happens to us sometimes too.
Yeah.
"But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,"
but we eat in the kitchen
and their heads are always poking past the door.
"Uh-huh,"
to see what's happening.
Yeah.
"Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing"
and some people don't like to do this
"but I like to uh, cook with my kids."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help."
"And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh,"
"I I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it."
"Oh, I've seen those in the magazines."
"Yeah,"
they're so simple.
Uh-huh.
And the kids love to do that.
"Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them."
Yeah.
"And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that"
and it's just really hard
"and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that."
Yeah.
"So, that's, uh,"
"they like to eat it,"
"but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, but in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it."
"Uh, we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks."
"Oh, no."
"And one of the things that I, I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation  down there."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, because they were just,"
"it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because  everybody went to work, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"and then the houses were left unguarded, uh,"
"but yeah,"
"I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it,"
"that's a good way to, to work it, with a neighborhood  watch."
Yeah.
"Well, you know, uh, also I've heard that, uh, the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home.  Like on the weekends."
"Oh, is that right?"
"A high percentage of, uh, free time,"
"I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, uh, spent doing yard work outdoors."
Oh.
"So they wait while you're out, outdoors."
They know the house is unlocked
"and then they just slip in. Slip in, slip out, you know."
That's amazing.
They know exactly what they're going for.
Yeah.
"So, I've heard that's really on the rise as far as  uh, you know, a new type of crime."
"Uh,"
"Yeah,"
it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter.
Yeah
"Really, you know."
"Unfortunately, yes."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"well, that, that was number one for the week actually, too,"
"so, so it was a little bit, uh,"
"I was thinking, Wow,"
people must be into crime movies again.
"But, but in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an, um, an interesting point."
Last year's number one movie for the year was GHOSTS.
Is that right?
I don't know if you saw GHOSTS or not.
I did see GHOSTS.
"Yeah,"
"and, and, and that was, that, that helped us sort of feel good about, you know, about ourselves and about one around us, in that at least, at least, if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that, at least they're still going to see the real good movies, you know."
Yeah.
I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good.
Yeah.
And it turned out to be an excellent movie.
Yeah.
"It was, it, I was absolutely enthralled by it."
"I've forgotten the guy's name who was in it, who had the lead role."
"Oh, Patrick Swayze?"
"Yeah,"
and I especially like him.
"Yeah,"
he's very good.
He's a really good guy.
"Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any,"
"Really,"
I'm trying to think what else I've seen recently.
What else have we seen recently.
"Oh, you know, what's pretty cute actually. Um,"
DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.
"Well, maybe this year you can find a more central location."
"Well, but the majority of them are in, like, just like how you said in close, close quarters."
So it is easier for us few stragglers to go home.
"Oh, okay."
Then the majority of them are still in the Missouri area.
Yeah.
Okay.
"You know our family right now, uh, the most of it, there is only a few stragglers, uh, with any distance."
"There is one cousin out in Colorado, uh, uh, some cousins over in Phoenix, uh,"
"I got a sister over in, in, uh, Washington State"
"Uh, the rest of them are within, you know, a couple hours drive."
"Well, uh, how do you all communicate? Like to plan it and every thing."
"Do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it,"
or do you all like mail out stuff?
That is pretty much it.
Yeah.
"It is going to be such and such, uh, weekend"
"and, uh, you all come."
Yeah.
That is about it
And you know this is the standard pattern.
"It, uh,"
everybody brings their favorite dish
"and, somebody brings the volleyball net,"
somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon
"and,"
"Well, uh, uh, I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably ten, over ten years."
"It was like, don't you remember me."
And I am like no
Am I related to you?
Yeah.
I know.
So he didn't go howl?
"No,"
"he wouldn't go howl,"
"so all the, all the people that worked with the father ostracized him"
"Oh, how funny."
It is.
"It, it, it's, it's real interesting to watch the show,"
"and, and the relationship between the family is, is really now, now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them."
Huh.
"So it's,"
"our, our grandson, our oldest grandson is the one that, that got us to watching it."
"But it really is, it moves real fast."
"It's a real short,"
"and there's always, like I say, a moral to it"
"and,"
"It's just a half hour,"
or is it hour?
"Well, half hour."
Oh.
"That, that's all there is to it."
"And, and, uh, they ..."
"There's not many half hour shows,"
"it seems like that,"
"Yeah,"
"it, it, they, they're trying to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW. Uh, the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth,"
Uh-huh.
"and I guess maybe there are some parts of that,"
but I didn't really see that in there.
"But what I've read about it, they talk about that."
"But anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,"
"and, and, uh, I guess mostly I, I like the news shows too, the news magazines, like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY, TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if I can do it,"
"Yeah,"
but  I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"God, it's amazing"
"And for our age group it's too late, too little, too late."
Right.
Right.
"But I, I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Two income families I think are here to stay.
"Well and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do you know, the, the people that work in big business have families"
Uh-huh.
Right.
they have children.
Yeah.
"So, it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and  working"
Oh sure.
"and, uh,"
You retain employees and keep them longer.
"That's, that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that  they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Right.
Right.
"So, I, I hope it helps."
It seems to help the new mothers  not have to come back full-time.
Oh that's good.
because that's hard.
That's good to know.
"I have a couple of friends that, have, have found the, uh, you know, a a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age."
"Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um,"
"my first, when I first thought of it, I thought it, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful."
"And then, I wondered if people were unwilling"
"but, but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long."
"Um, but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
that's probably true  You know
"But, I, I think that's a small, uh, number could,"
"but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to?"
"No,"
"um, not since, um, not as much as I remember growing up."
"And that was something, uh, I think in the fifties and sixties, um, seemed more common in the last two decades."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I think that's probably true.
"But,"
"I think it's probably more true, still in the, in the smaller communities then in the larger cities."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Where, uh, where abouts do you live?"
What part of the country?
"Well, I live in Richardson right now. Which is just,"
"Oh, okay."
We're in Plano
so we're not far apart.
Right.
"Yeah,"
okay.
"One of the calls I'd gotten before was, uh, down to Austin"
"and, and I know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest"
so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area.
"And, uh, since, since everyone is going out and working now, whether it be because of finances or just the economy,  uh, the mother's not there anymore"
"and restructuring, stepfamilies,"
yeah.
"and the children are,"
"I think, I think a lot of society is suffering."
"Not to say that women shouldn't, you know, go out and do what they want to do"
"but I think that, um,  society's really going to have to get used to it."
Right.
And they're not quite used to it yet
"and that's I,"
"The schools or the the schools or the parents,"
yeah.
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"Um, I'm trying to think of what else."
I have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden I went blank
"A lot of the things, um, the demographics do,"
"I mean, there are more,"
"I don't have the numbers in my head right now,"
"but, a lot of the things that brought feminism, I mean there are just more women in, in, in the demographics, just generally,  in the United States, in terms of being,"
"Right,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I'm the typical baby boomer,"
"I hate that term,"
"Oh, yeah."
"but in terms of women,  women going out, I mean twenty-three, I remember that."
Yeah.
"What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman today,"
"I mean, when I was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married,"
Uh-huh.
"um, those were the general issues."
"and, uh, of course, the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing, the more you can trust their, their judgment and their insight."
Right.
Right.
Uh-huh.
"But the media insight, as you said,"
I just kind of read and kind of be aware
Yeah.
"and then, uh, I don't like to make a whole lot of, uh, judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that, uh,"
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
That's a real different topic.
"I'm not sure I'm familiar with, with what they mean of invasion of privacy."
I know.
"I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day that would, you would think of about."
"See, I'm a college student,"
"so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like that."
Yeah.
"But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic."
Yeah.
"I think, personally, you know,"
"I'm, I used to be a college student ten years ago"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, golly."
"You're like, No, you don't, no."
"It's like, how do you know my name,"
"where did you get my phone number,"
and why do you think it's a deal for me?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, there, I know, you know, John Wylie Price,"
"I don't know if you kept up,"
"but he's been protesting,"
Yes
I have
"and, uh, I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're, you're more likely to get,"
"Yeah,"
and I think he has legitimate argument.
"I mean you can, uh,"
"I, I, I grew up in Alabama"
"and so I, I have some prejudices."
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs"
"but I think that, uh, in some cases this should be some real opportunity and, and some diversity, and and this kind of thing"
Yeah.
"and I think that, Dallas, it turns out, though from what I understand, has quite good,"
I occasionally go to Saint Louis.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, there for a few days and watch the news and, and think Dallas really does have, have quite good news."
"I think channel eight is the number one, uh, A B C affiliate in the U S."
"I think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he,"
"Oh, really?"
Course he pumping his own
"Well, we, you know,"
"like all of the stations seem to be pretty good,"
it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into.
Where'd you move from?
Houston.
"So we had a, a favorite,"
"Yes,"
it's a very good book.
It's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do with the money that you save.
Legally?
"Legally, cut money on your taxes."
"Yes,"
"yes,"
Huh.
"legally, legally cut money on your taxes, and on your insurance,"
"and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to, uh, you know, be wealthier. Uh,"
"he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet. Um,"
"FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it. Uh,"
"the man, uh, has a lot of good ideas,"
"some of them I already knew about,"
some of them I had already practiced.
"But I suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because, uh,"
And that includes everyone at T I.
"Yes,"
I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety-one.
Yes.
"Well, even, the, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet."
Yet.
But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter.
"You know, survival is a funny state."
"Yeah,"
I know what you mean.
"I, uh, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor,"
"and I had four non exempts, um, under me."
Yeah.
"And, uh, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them."
I just couldn't believe it.
"Did, well, I've been with the company for sixteen years now."
"I mean they, they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"they said, she said that this was almost believable"
that could really happen.
"You know, you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things,"
and you never know.
"Almost,"
"yeah,"
"I, I, it's a little far fetched to, find a bunch of medical students doing it,"
"but but, it was, um, it was, it was odd enough, you know,"
Yeah.
and they didn't just sort of make it silly.
"It was, you know, it was done fairly well, I think."
"So. Actually, I actually enjoyed that as well."
Yeah.
I like it when they will do something and not get too silly.
"I've been disappointed in some movies that, they don't know how to end it, it seems like,"
so then they get crazy
"and, and it doesn't end like the story has been going."
The story sort of keeps going and going.
Well I guess that covers our topic.
"Yeah,"
great.
"Well, it was, nice talking to you."
Nice talking to you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
That sounded like one.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system, as far as, uh, people dropping out of school, uh, grades on test scores being low, uh, more and more people taking G E D trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school."
Uh-huh.
No.
"Actually I'm a spectator,"
"and I'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's, or my late husband's, interest in golf."
Uh-huh.
"My husband likes golf also,"
"he's, uh, I guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it"
"But he, he limits it pretty good."
"I, um, have tried to go out and play golf."
"He would love it if I would go out and play with him,"
"but I stand there and swing and swing,"
Uh-huh.
and I can't even hit the ball
I can't even play miniature golf well.
"Yeah,"
I don't either
"Well, there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not,"
but I am very good at watching it on television.
Right.
"And he was really, uh, enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments."
"He could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held, and what the nature of the hole was and,"
"Oh, so he's really into it."
"Oh, yeah,"
he was a good golfer.
Wow.
"And as, and did some, you know, instructions at the country club for a while."
Oh.
"But, uh, golf tended to be"
"I am not really deeply involved in any, following any of the sports."
Yeah.
"But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers,"
and therefore I enjoyed following those particular players.
"Right,"
Uh-uh.
I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot.
Very few I would imagine.
Yeah.
"But, uh, I get,"
I just couldn't
"I mean it's more money that I make in a year,"
so
"You know, it, you know,"
"me being one person with a above the median income, for New York state, you know,"
Yeah.
"I'm a I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now,"
"and, uh, I,"
Uh-huh.
"even as a somebody making twice what I was making, how could you put half of that into, to your child's education"
Uh-huh.
"and then just when they make, made, make it to the college years it's,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"My God, I can't imagine."
"Well, my, my real feeling about, about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time,"
"yes,"
"you do get an education, you do learn some things,"
but you eventually forget most of it.
Yes.
But what you don't forget is the growing up.
It's really the period when people become adults.
I mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways.
"But, really,"
"it's the entry into adulthood, I think."
"And I think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become, you know, as you gain new social skills, as you become, you know, more of a functioning member of society."
"And maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect,"
"In a big city like that most houses, I would think, would be sort of like what we live in. Just a you know, basic tract house."
"Well, in the, uh, newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together,"
Yeah.
if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow.
That's exactly right.
That's the way we are.
"We have, uh, one thing we have that we really enjoy here, is we have a hot tub in the back."
"So we have, we have quite a few parties,"
"and uh, seems like everyone that lives around us, ends up, you know, hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone."
"So, uh, that's true"
"that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it, is the houses are too close together."
"But, uh, you know, it's fine for now,"
"hopefully, eventually, we'll move in a larger home."
The only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small.
"You know, it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that,"
so.
Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home?
"Because it seems like then, that they built the homes much larger"
is that true?
Yeah.
And they've got better closet space.
Yeah.
new houses that I've seen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really it.
That's a plus.
At least we do have like three walk-in closets here.
"So that's, that's maybe not so typical,"
"but, uh,"
It helps a bunch.
Yeah.
"Well, I haven't counted."
"I, I would have guessed eight even"
but you might be right.
I don't have any idea.
"Well, I remember, uh, uh,"
"thinking, I think it was the last time I did hear that we get about the average."
"Maybe even a little more, a day or so more than the average."
Yeah.
"But, uh, government is ridiculous."
Wow.
Just think of the money they could save.
"I mean, they're, they're paying out this money anyway."
Yeah.
Why not get the work out of the people.
Yeah.
"And, well, anyway that would, of course, eventually come back to taxes."
"But, uh, as far as income tax is concerned, I can't complain too much about it."
"Uh, I'm single,"
"I have no, uh, dependents or anything,"
my children are all grown
and they're out worrying about their own income taxes.
Yeah.
"Well, I, I have another thing that I thought about too, for instance, when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is"
"and, you know, we're not typically talking about big dollars"
"but here you feel like you've, you've done something good"
"you've, you've earned your interest"
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it.
"So, the real amount of your savings on that is, is, not much."
"Uh, very true."
"That's,"
"You know, it's kind of a vicious circle there."
"And then they tell you to, uh, well, invest it in, uh, is it I R A or something"
"I was a W F for several years,"
and it just never seems to improve.
"It, and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twenty-eight or above."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
It's really a shame.
"Well, I, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very high payroll."
Oh.
"And, uh, the, you know, I thought I was making a good wage,"
"So, how do you feel about the metric system?"
"Oh, I like it."
"I, I, I have a foreign, actually I have more than one foreign automobile."
"And I, I, I find the, uh, I find the, the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters,"
I was trying to build a shed
and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches
"and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, uh ..."
"Yeah,"
"and it's,"
I forget how many millimeters.
So you used the metric?
"Well, no."
"What we did was wind up using,"
"and you just go, you just go down"
"and, and you get out the, the, so many inches"
"and, and we just marked a little bit less than that, uh, which is somewhat awkward"
"but had it been millimeters, you could have done."
"I think what's interesting,"
"the way engineering people do is they,"
"they, in essence, have gotten around it by, by listing, uh, decimal inches."
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
Do are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that?
"Well, that's nice comfortable stuff."
Yes.
"Open shirt, open at the neck, you know, no tie."
Wow.
"And, uh, just, uh, reasonable looking, how shall I say it, uh, sports clothes or some guys wear, some people even wear Levis."
Wow.
That's nice.
"Now, being from Philadelphia, I don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed, right?"
Well actually right now I'm a full time college student
"so my dress code is very, very (( ))."
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah,"
I usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime.
"But over the summers I've had a job, internships with the newspaper."
Uh-huh.
"And that's so,"
"generally then I dress, you know, nicer."
"Usually nice summer slacks or more, sometimes skirts, stuff like that."
"So, then it's still, you know, the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming out of office"
but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing. To go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that
Yes.
so.
"Yeah,"
"well I, uh, I just recently applied for a different job in the company here"
and so I decided well I'd wear a suit.
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
"And it, it was very interesting,"
"uh, like I said, most of the people at, at this company don't wear suits."
"Uh, most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual, almost the same clothes that, that you'd wear to school."
Wow.
That must be nice atmosphere then.
"I'm not with you so far,"
"Oh, shoot, I'm going to hit myself after I hang up."
I'll remember the name.
"But, uh, anyway, that was a French movie"
Uh-huh.
"it was, um, that was the last one I saw downtown,"
"but I live in D C well, actually Falls Church, Virginia, outside the city"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, so a lot of times they have the, the, the, international films downtown"
"Oh, yeah."
"but, uh, so this, uh, French I guess are into the"
"I guess they would like Jerry Lewis, too."
"They have, they have a"
Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated of sophisticated American everywhere.
Right.
"But they have this one guy who does slapstick comedy,"
"and there's something about it that's so innovative, you know,"
"he'll have trouble picking up his hat, or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind, or something,"
"but there's something about it that just, it isn't just slapstick,"
there's something about the human character in it
"Oh, uh-huh."
"and that's what I find lacking in a lot of, you know, like HOME ALONE."
There was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying
Right.
"and there was a lot of human character there,"
"but when it was, the real slapstick moments, him versus the criminals kind of thing, it just sort of lost the human element and became purely a caricature"
Uh-huh.
Right.
does that make since to you?
"Yeah,"
"uh-huh,"
"Well,"
"and, yeah,"
"and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person"
"and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know."
"But that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there."
"It seems like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get"
"so,"
"Well, that's for sure."
"Which is the same,"
"but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,"
"that's,"
"Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, just in this size of organization,"
Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive.
Where do you live?
I live in San Antonio.
San Antonio!
Uh-huh.
"Well, uh, I live in Garland"
"and we're just beginning to,"
"we, we just built a real big recycling center, that recycles everything imaginable"
Uh-huh.
"but, as far as, uh, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing, they're testing that."
Uh-huh.
"So, they're really not full, full force into it,"
"but they're trying,"
"so we're attempting it,"
but I wish we could do more.
"Yeah,"
"there's, there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio."
I used to work for the power company here
"he's, he's making straight A"
"and, you know, it just, it, it was there, it was just, I guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time."
"Yeah,"
"it, uh,"
"right,"
"survival becomes more of a priority than, than education,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"and unfortunately, you know, there's, uh, there's and old joke about, uh, you know,"
education's wasted on the youth anyway.
"You don't, you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway."
"Right,"
exactly.
"I know when I went to school, uh, my attitude was kind of one of, you know, these people are, you know, taking a tremendous amount of my time, you know,"
Uh-huh.
and I've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again.
exactly.
"I guess today that would be, uh, some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing,"
but.
Um.
"The, uh, the cure, some of the cures that I've heard for this that, that sort of make sense,"
Uh-huh.
"uh, most teachers after they have taught for a very long, especially at the, the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's kind of these intervention programs."
"Now, a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism"
"and that's communism,"
Right.
"and that's, you know,"
and then it gets political.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, boy."
Uh-huh
"That and ninety-eight point seven, I'm eclectic approach."
Do you have a particular local channel that you watch?
"Well, I watch channel five"
"but that has to be,"
that's another bias.
Uh-huh.
That has to do with the weather reporting.
"I'm not sure that,"
"actually I think channel eight is probably,"
"but I know Dave Fox,"
he goes to our church
"so,"
"Um. Well I am, we're fairly new to the area"
and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel.
"Well the, Channel eight when they came here thirteen, fourteen years ago, Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together, uh, from Oklahoma City"
Uh-huh.
and apparently channel eight was way down
and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job
and then they've been some people move around
"and, uh, John Chriswell is, anyway, the,"
"I, I don't know,"
"do you, do you, do you seem to,"
"can you tell much difference between the local radio, T V stations?"
"Well, I really think so."
"I noticed on channel eight that there's all of the, uh, anchors, are seem to be like white Anglo Saxon protestant type people"
"and they all seem to be, you know, fairly similar"
"and I kind of prefer a, you know, some females,"
I don't recall that they have any female anchors
"and I like different, I like the anchors to be different kinds of people."
"I think that adds to the diversity,"
"I think that, uh, I like that."
The title is a play on new wave music.
"After John Lennon's murder in December 1980, Starr returned home to England to live at Tittenhurst Park, which Starr had purchased from Lennon in 1973. In early 1982, Starr was eager to move on to his next solo project. Deciding that he needed more consistency this time around, he would work with only one producer, Joe Walsh, a former member of the recently disbanded Eagles. Walsh and Starr had known each other since the mid-1970s, having met and befriended each other in Los Angeles. Walsh immediately agreed to work with Starr and they met at Tittenhurst in February to begin writing material. Recording shortly afterwards begun and instrumental backing tracks for seven songs were recorded at Startling Studios, after Starr had previously converted Lennon's recording studio. Engineering duties were handled by Jim Nipor. These sessions were mainly done with a team consisting of Starr on drums and percussion, Walsh on guitar and backing vocals, Mo Foster on bass and keyboardists Gary Brooker and Chris Stainton."
"Sessions came to a halt when Walsh and Nipor went to California on 19 March. Sessions recommenced on 6 April for a few days until 16 April. On 15 April, ""Rolling Stone"" broke the news that Starr was ""in London working on a new album with Joe Walsh acting as the producer."" Lead vocals were laid down from 19 to 23 April. Sometime in May, Starr requested permission to build a new building on his Tittenhurst Park land, which he would use for video and recording purposes, from Windsor and Maidenhead District Council. Sessions resumed from 31 May until 10 June; the next day, taking the masters recorded up to that point with him, Starr and his wife Barbara Bach fly from London to Los Angeles, and return on 14 June. The album was finished with a third batch of sessions from 24 June into early July."
"""Everybody's in a Hurry But Me"" came about from a jam session between the Who's former bassist, John Entwistle, drummer and percussionist Ray Cooper and also Cream's former guitarist, Eric Clapton. ""As Far as We Can Go"", was originally recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 23 July 1978. From that original rendition, only the vocal was used. Walsh re-recorded an entirely new track utilizing one of the latest technology synthesizers."
"The album was originally titled ""It Beats Sleep"". The portrait on the album cover was shot in a booth in northern England. As Starr's RCA contract had been cancelled, he needed to find a new label for ""Old Wave"". Though it was just over a decade after the Beatles' dissolution, no major UK or US record company was interested in signing him. Starr would not accept that and was determined to have ""Old Wave"" released any way he could. The album was due to be released on the Boardwalk label, but never appeared due to the death of the label's head, Neil Bogart. RCA Canada ended up distributing the album in June 1983 in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Brazil; while in Germany, the album and lone single pulled from it, both released on 16 June, appeared on the Bellaphon label. The Canadian release of the album occurred on 24 June. However, ""Old Wave"" failed to achieve success in any of these territories, and would be Starr's last studio album until 1992's ""Time Takes Time"". Two singles were pulled from the album: one in Germany, ""In My Car"", backed with ""As Far as We Can Go"", and the other in Mexico (""I Keep Forgettin'"" b/w ""She's About a Mover"")."
"Walsh's 1987 album ""Got Any Gum?"" included a cover of ""In My Car"", which was released as a single and became a moderate hit. Four tracks from the album appear on Starr's US compilation """" in 1989. The album was reissued on CD, on the same day as ""Stop and Smell the Roses"" (1981), in the US by The Right Stuff on 22 August 1994. A further release, on 6 September, as both CD and cassette deluxe editions, included a bonus track, the original 1978 version of ""As Far as We Can Go"". ""In My Car"" was re-released, this time on yellow vinyl, with ""She's About a Mover"" as the B-side, on The Right Stuff on 1 November 1994. A promotional CD was released in 1994 by Capitol, featuring three songs from both ""Old Wave"" and ""Stop and Smell the Roses""."
Track numbering refers to CD and digital releases of the album.

= = = Payroll Room = = =
"The ""Payroll Room"" is how much money in a National Hockey League (NHL) team's salary cap is left to acquire players, whether such players are signed as free agents or join the team via a trade or waivers. The term originated in 2005 with the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which was negotiated following a season-long lockout. The new CBA includes a salary cap (formally titled the ""Upper Limit"" of the ""Payroll Range"" in the agreement). Payroll room is often called cap room in the media."
"A team can increase its cap room if it trades high-salary players to other teams and gets lower-paid players in their place. A team cannot trade its cap room to another team or defer its cap room to subsequent seasons. Other practices once common in the NHL, such as exchanging cash for players or agreeing to pay a portion of a player's remaining salary after trading him, have been explicitly forbidden in the new CBA to try to prevent wealthier teams from evading the restrictions of the cap."

= = = Blas Ruiz = = =
"Blas Ruiz de Hernán González or Blas Ruiz de Fernán González was an explorer from Ciudad Real, Spain."
"In the last decade of the 16th century, along with the Portuguese adventurer Diogo Veloso from Amarante, Blas Ruiz was the first European to ever set foot in Laos."
"Ruiz's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Ruiz met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Veloso of Portugal. When Lovek was invaded by Ayautthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Ruiz to flee to the Spanish colony of the Philippines, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Ruiz returned with Veloso, who had fled to the Portuguese colony of Melaka, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam. Ruiz and Veloso decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek."
"Ruiz and Veloso arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian Elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Ruiz and Veloso were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Ruiz and Veloso returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayatthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos. Eventually Ruiz returned to the Philippines. It is not known whether he died there, Spain, or somewhere else."
"In July 1593 king Satha I sent an embassy to Manila asking for Spanish military help to defend Cambodia. The embassy consisted of Portuguese Diogo Veloso, who had been living in his court since 1583, and Spanish Gregorio de Vargas Machuca. Satha I kept Spanish Bias Ruiz de Hernan Gonzalez as captain of his bodyguard. Veloso came back in February 1594, alone and without help. After Ayutthaya's attack on Cambodia, Veloso, Bias Ruiz and de Vargas Machuca found themselves in Manila. They continued to ask for help, and at last, Spanish Manila agreed to send 3 ships with 120 Spanish and Mexican soldiers, some Japanese and Philippino auxiliaries and some friars, under the commander Suarez Gallinato. The ship with Bias Ruiz was the only one that reached Cambodia. The one with Veloso was wrecked off the Mekong delta and Gallinato's ship was forced to go to Malacca due to the weather. Veloso rejoined Bias Ruiz at Phnom Penh in March 1596. They were both killed at Phnom Penh in July 1599 during a fight between Christians (Spanish and Philippinos) and Muslim Malay mercenaries of Barom Reacha II, who was Satha's son. Satha had died in October 1597 after contracting disease after he fled to Lan Xang."

"WLMG (101.9 MHz, ""Magic 101.9 FM"") is a commercial FM radio station licensed to New Orleans, Louisiana. Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts an adult contemporary radio format. From mid-November to December 25th each year, it switches to all-Christmas music. The station's studios and offices are located at the 400 Poydras Tower in New Orleans' downtown district."
"WLMG has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for non-grandfathered FM stations. The transmitter site is off Bahrman Highway in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans. WLMG broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format."
"On March 15, 1970, the station first signed on the air as WWL-FM. It was owned by Loyola University of the South, now known as Loyola University New Orleans. Loyola also owned Channel 4 WWL-TV and AM powerhouse 870 WWL."
WWL and WWL-FM had the same call sign but separate formats. The AM was a full service middle of the road station while WWL-FM played beautiful music. It featured quarter hour sweeps of instrumental cover versions of popular songs with Hollywood and Broadway show tunes.
"In the mid-1970s, station management decided to go in a radically different direction, seeking a younger demographic for WWL-FM. Out went the soft instrumental musicians such as Henry Mancini and Percy Faith, trading them in for Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. WWL-FM flipped to a Top 40 sound. But this was an era where most young people still were listening to inexpensive AM radios for their favorite hits. The station failed to make much headway against AM Top 40 leader 690 WTIX (now WQNO)."
"By May 1976, WWL-FM returned to easy listening music. The format featured mostly instrumental songs with several soft vocals each hour. On December 26, 1980, to separate the FM station's image from its AM and TV counterparts, the call letters were changed to WAJY. The station, calling itself ""Joy 102,"" moved closer to a 50/50 mix of instrumentals and vocals, some from soft rock artists such as Elton John, Olivia Newton-John, Stevie Wonder and Chicago."
"Through the 1980s, the easy format saw its audience continuing to age, while most advertisers seek young and middle-aged listeners. In 1987, the station completed its transition to a soft adult contemporary sound, eliminating the instrumental songs. The call sign was changed to WLMG using the moniker ""Magic 102."" With most radios in the 1990s going from analog dials to digital, the station began calling itself ""Magic 101.9"" in 1995."
"Over the next decade, WWL and WLMG switched hands several times. In 1989, Loyola University sold the stations to Keymarket Communications. The TV station was sold to a group of its employees, using the name Rampart Broadcasting. In July 1995, the radio stations were acquired by River City Communications. Later ownership switched to Sinclair Broadcasting. And in December 1999, WWL and WLMG were acquired by Entercom."
"In the early 2000s, WLMG moved to a mainstream adult contemporary sound. The tempo of the songs was picked up and the disc jockeys added more personality. The playlist extends from the 1980s to current day AC hits. In 2006, the WWL-FM call sign returned to New Orleans, on another station. Entercom decided to give AM 870 WWL an FM simulcast on 105.3 MHz, allowing WWL listeners the choice to hear the station on FM or AM."
= = = Louis Armstrong Stadium (1978–2016) = = =
"Louis Armstrong Stadium was a tennis stadium of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and one of the venues of the U.S. Open. Armstrong was the main stadium before Arthur Ashe Stadium opened in 1997, after which it served as the No. 2 stadium. It is named after the noted jazz musician Louis Armstrong, who lived nearby until his death in 1971 and was a significant figure in the Civil Rights Movement."
"The stadium was originally built as the Singer Bowl for the 1964 New York World's Fair, and hosted special events and concerts afterwards. It was renamed the Louis Armstrong Stadium in 1973 but closed the following year."
"In the early 1970s, the United States Tennis Association was looking for a new place to host the US Open as relations with the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, which had hosted the tournament, were breaking down. The USTA was initially unable to find a sufficient site, but the association's incoming president, W.E. Hester saw the old Singer Bowl from the window of an airplane flying into LaGuardia Airport. The old, long rectangular stadium was heavily renovated and divided into two venues, becoming the square Louis Armstrong Stadium, with the remaining third becoming the attached Grandstand, with a seating capacity of about 6,000."
"In 1997, the stadium was replaced as the US Open's primary venue by the new Arthur Ashe Stadium. Armstrong Stadium was renovated again, with the top tiers of seating being removed. The stadium held close to 18,000 at its peak, but this was reduced to around 10,200 with the renovation, which also added a brick facade to match that of Ashe Stadium."
The stadium was demolished in October 2016.
"A new 14,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium opened for the 2018 US Open. This new stadium features a retractable roof and is the largest of No. 2 stadium at a Grand Slam site. For the 2017 tournament, while construction was still ongoing on the new stadium, a temporary 8,800-seat stadium was built on the site of the demolished ticket office and East Gate entrance, on Parking Lot B, close to the boardwalk ramp to the subway and LIRR trains."

= = = Ion Moța = = =
"Ion I. Moța [or Motza] (5 July 1902, Orăștie, Austria-Hungary—13 January 1937, Majadahonda, Spain) was the Romanian nationalist deputy leader of the Iron Guard killed in battle during the Spanish Civil War."
"Son of the nationalist Orthodox priest Ioan Moța, who edited a journal called ""Liberty"", Ion I. Moța studied law at University of Paris (1920-1921), the University of Cluj, University of Iași and University of Grenoble. His thesis, finished in 1932 at the University of Grenoble, was entitled ""Juridical Security in the Community of Nations."""
"At Cluj, he founded Acțiunea Românească (""Romanian Action""), a nationalist group inspired by Charles Maurras' Action Française. This organization fused with A. C. Cuza's National-Christian Defense League in 1925. Moța met Corneliu Zelea Codreanu at a meeting of antisemitic students in August 1923. The two formed a plan to assassinate Romanian politicians and leaders of Romanian Jewry seen as traitors and corruptors of Romanian national life. They were arrested in Bucharest on 8 October 1923 and sent to Văcărești prison. Acquitted in March 1924, Moța shot Vernichescu, the member of their conspiracy who betrayed it to the authorities, seven times (but not fatally). He spent two months in Galata prison before being acquitted and released on 29 September 1924."
"Codreanu made Moța leader of ""Frăția de Cruce"", a group of peasants and students who would fight for nationalistic renewal (founded on 6 May 1924). Moța attended the World Anti-Semitic Congress in September 1925; upon the founding of the Iron Guard (the ""Legion of the Archangel Michael""), on 24 June 1927, he became deputy Captain to Codreanu."
"Ion Moța represented the Legion at the 1934 Fascist International meeting in Montreux. He was vice-president of the Iron Guard political creation, the ""Everything for the Country Party"". From 1934 through 1936, he served as a correspondent for ""Welt-Dienst"" / ""World-Service"", an anti-Jewish publication founded by Ulrich Fleischhauer in Erfurt, Germany. Fleischhauer was a staunch believer in the veracity of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and appeared as an ""expert witness"" for the pro-Nazis at the famous Berne Trial."
"In late 1936, Moța formed a Legionary unit to fight against the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. He and Vasile Marin (another prominent Legionary) were killed on the Madrid Front on the same day of fighting (13 January 1937). Their funerals in Bucharest (13 February 1937) were an immense and orderly procession (""see Funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin""), attended by the Ministers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Francisco Franco's Spain, representatives of Portugal, the Japan of the early Shōwa period, and delegates of the Polish Patriotic Youth."

"The Giver is a 2014 American social science fiction dystopian film directed by Phillip Noyce and starring Jeff Bridges, Brenton Thwaites, Odeya Rush, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård, Katie Holmes, Cameron Monaghan, Taylor Swift, and Emma Tremblay. The film is based on the 1993 young adult novel of the same name by Lois Lowry."
"""The Giver"" premiered on August 11, 2014, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2014, grossing $67 million on a $25 million budget. It received a People's Choice Award nomination for ""Favorite Dramatic Movie"". However, it received generally mixed reviews from critics."
"Following a calamity referred to as The Ruin, society has been reorganized. Conflict, pain, and suffering have been mostly removed from human experience, but emotion, love, freedom, individuality, and joy have also been removed. Babies are brought into being through genetic engineering, and sexual desire is chemically suppressed. All memories of the past are held by one person, the Receiver of Memory, for the purpose of shielding the rest of the community from pain. The Receiver of Memory and his/her protégé are the only persons able to see in color, an ability otherwise eliminated from the community to prevent envy. The community is ruled by elders, including a Chief Elder."
"Jonas is a 16-year-old boy whose best friends are Asher and Fiona. On graduation day, Jonas is told that he will become the next Receiver of Memory and will progressively receive memories from his predecessor, the Giver. During his training with the Giver, Jonas gradually learns about the past and about joy, pain, death, and love. Jonas stops taking his daily injections and begins to experience emotion. Those who leave the community are said to have been ""released to Elsewhere"", but Jonas learns that this is really a euphemism for death by lethal injection. Jonas also learns that the Giver's daughter, Rosemary, had preceded Jonas as Receiver of Memory. When she began her training, however, Rosemary became so distraught from the memories she received that she asked to be euthanized."
"Jonas begins to teach his findings to Fiona and shares the concept of emotion with her. Jonas then tells her to stop taking her daily injection. The next day, he kisses her; kissing is an antiquated action that is unknown to the community and which Jonas learned about through memories received from the Giver, and touching a non-family member is against the rules. Jonas also shares his memories with a baby, Gabriel, who was brought home by his father. He develops a close relationship with Gabriel after discovering that he shared the birthmark Jonas has—the mark of a potential Receiver of Memory."
"Appalled by the deception of his community and by the Elders' disregard for human life, Jonas comes to believe that everyone should have memories of the past. Eventually, the Giver and Jonas decide that the only way to help the community is for Jonas to travel past the border of their land into the area called ""Elsewhere"". Doing this would release memories and color back into the community. When Jonas tries to leave his neighborhood, he encounters Asher. Asher tries to stop Jonas, but Jonas punches him. Jonas retrieves Gabriel—who is to be ""released"" for having failed to meet developmental markers—at the Nurturing Center; Fiona kisses Jonas and helps him escape with Gabriel."
"Meanwhile, Jonas' mother and Asher go to the Chief Elder to tell them Jonas is missing. Jonas steals a motorcycle and drives away with Gabriel. Asher is assigned by the Chief Elder to use a drone to find Jonas and ""lose"" him. When Asher finds Jonas and Gabriel in the desert, Jonas implores Asher to trust him and let them go. Instead, Asher captures them with the drone, but then sets them free by dropping them into a river; when questioned by the Chief Elder, Asher lies and says that he has followed her orders."
"Fiona is condemned to be ""released"" for helping Jonas. Just as she is about to be ""released"" by Jonas's father, the Giver tries to persuade the Chief Elder that the Elders should free the community. Unmoved by the Giver's arguments, the Chief Elder asserts that freedom is a bad idea because left to their own devices, people make bad choices."
"Jonas and Gabriel enter a snowy area. Jonas falls to the ground, overcome by the cold weather. However, he sees a sled like the one that he rode in a memory he received from the Giver. Jonas and Gabriel ride the sled downhill and cross the border into Elsewhere, freeing their community. This action saves Fiona's life, as Jonas's father realizes what he is doing and stops short of ""releasing"" her. Jonas realizes that he has succeeded in his quest."
"Jeff Bridges initially wanted to film the movie in the mid-1990s, and a script was written by 1998. Various barriers marred the production of the film, including when Warner Bros. bought the rights in 2007. The rights then ended up at The Weinstein Company and Walden Media."
"Bridges originally intended that his own father, Lloyd Bridges, would play the title character, The Giver, but he died in 1998."
"Principal photography began on October 7, 2013 in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Meryl Streep had some of her scenes shot in England, where she also filmed Rob Marshall's ""Into the Woods"", before doing additional filming two months later in Paarl, a town near Cape Town. The filming was completed on February 13, 2014 in Utah."
"The score for ""The Giver"" was composed by Marco Beltrami. The song ""Ordinary Human"" by OneRepublic was featured in the movie. The film also features Tori Kelly's ""Silent"". The soundtrack was released on August 5, 2014 by Interscope Records."
"The first official trailer for the film was released on March 19, 2014. On April 11, 2014, more footage from the film was revealed. A second trailer was released on June 4."
"On July 11, 2014, it was announced that The Weinstein Company and Walden Media would be teaming up with Fathom Events to stream the red carpet premiere to more than 250 theaters in the US on August 11, four days before its official release. Ziegfeld Theatre hosted the film's premiere in New York City."
"""The Giver"" grossed $45.1 million in North America and $21.9 million overseas for a worldwide total of $67 million, against a production budget of $25 million."
"The film earned $4.7 million on its opening day. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $12.3 million, finishing in 5th place at the box office."
"On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 35% based on 160 reviews with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Phillip Noyce directs ""The Giver"" with visual grace, but the movie doesn't dig deep enough into the classic source material's thought-provoking ideas."" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 47 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews."""

"After playing for various youth teams in Germany and the United States, Zelalem initially played with Arsenal's youth squads after joining the team in early 2013, and made his senior squad debut for Arsenal in an FA Cup match in January 2014."
"Internationally, Zelalem made appearances for Germany's under-15 team, under-16 team and under-17 team during 2012 and 2013. He became a U.S. citizen on December 2, 2014, and FIFA subsequently approved his eligibility to play for the United States on May 13, 2015."
"Zelalem was born in Berlin, Germany, to Ethiopian parents. He started playing football at the age of five for German club BFC Germania 1888. After this, he changed to Bundesliga side Hertha BSC's academy."
"Zelalem emigrated to the United States with his father in 2006, following his mother's death in the previous year, and settled in Washington, D.C.. He played with several teams: first with MSC United, Bethesda Soccer Club and BNC Revolution, before joining the elite club team Olney Rangers and the varsity team at Walter Johnson High School in Montgomery County, Maryland."
"Arsenal scout Danny Karbassiyoon discovered Zelalem in the United States playing for Olney Rangers during a Dallas Cup match. After contacting his coaches, Zelalem was flown to London for summer training with the Arsenal youth academy; following the end of this camp, he was offered a permanent place in the Academy. Zelalem started out playing in Arsenal's under-16s squad, before graduating into the under-21s in April 2013. His début for the under-21 side came against Liverpool U21 that month, but was unable to prevent Arsenal slipping to a 3–2 defeat at Anfield; however, he drew praise for his performance. He made his second appearance for the side less than a week later in a 3–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers U21, once again drawing praise for his performance."
"In July 2013, Zelalem was included in Arsenal's 24-man squad for their Asia tour. Although regarded as a surprise inclusion, strong performances against an Indonesia Dream Team, the Vietnam national team and Japanese side Nagoya Grampus led to him being touted as a future star, and being compared favorably to Cesc Fàbregas."
"Following these strong performances, Zelalem stated that he hoped to make a few appearances during the 2013–14 season. He remained in the team for the Emirates Cup match against Galatasaray on August 4, but was unable to keep Arsenal from sliding to a 2–1 defeat. Zelalem was selected on the bench in Arsenal's second Premier League game of the season, a 3–1 victory over Fulham on August 24, but did not make an appearance. However, on September 10 Zelalem announced on Twitter that he had sustained an injury that would keep him out of action for up to two months. Although he announced his return to training in late October, Arsène Wenger confirmed that he would not be fit enough for the League Cup match against Chelsea on October 29, dismissing a previous rumor. He returned to action for Arsenal's youth side a week later in a UEFA Youth League fixture against Borussia Dortmund on November 6, playing the entire match in a 2–2 draw."
"On January 24, 2014, Zelalem made his debut with Arsenal's senior squad, coming on as a substitute for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the 71st minute of their 4–0 home FA Cup victory against Coventry City. And later that year, on March 18, 2014, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal to last until 2017. Zelalem soon made his second appearance for Arsenal, coming on as a substitute in the beginning of the second half, in a 4–1 away win against Galatasaray in UEFA Champions League on December 9, 2014."
"On August 24, 2015, Zelalem was loaned to Rangers until January. He made his debut in a 5–0 win over Airdrieonians in the Scottish League Cup, setting up goals for Martyn Waghorn and James Tavernier. He made his league debut in Rangers' Scottish Championship game against Queen of the South which Rangers won 5–1. In January 2016 his loan was extended through to the end of the season."
"He played in 21 Championship matches, helping Rangers clinch the second-tier title, and was an unused substitute as they beat Peterhead 4–0 to win the 2015–16 Scottish Challenge Cup. A week later, Rangers played old firm rivals Celtic in the Scottish Cup semifinal. Zelalem converted a penalty in the shootout to help his club progress to the final, and started in that match, which Rangers lost 3–2 to Hibernian."
"On January 24, 2017, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal and accepted a loan move to Dutch second-tier club VVV-Venlo, lasting until the end of the season. He made nine league appearances as VVV Venlo won the 2016-17 Eerste Divisie title."
"After no first team appearances at Arsenal upon returning in 2017, Zelalem joined MLS club Sporting Kansas City for free on March 10, 2019."
"After Zelalem's option was not picked up by Sporting Kansas City, he signed for fellow Major League Soccer side New York City FC on January 11, 2020."
"Zelalem began training with the United States under-15 side in 2012, but was unable to play in matches at that time due to being classified as a permanent resident, but not yet a U.S. citizen. In May 2014, it was reported that Zelalem's father, Zelalem Wolydes, held U.S. permanent residency and intended to apply for U.S. citizenship. If Wolydes gained U.S. citizenship before his son turned 18, then under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Gedion would also acquire U.S. citizenship and become eligible to represent the United States internationally. He would also be able to retain his German passport which allows him to live and work in the European Union without restrictions."
"In addition, common Fulani were inspired by Adama's exploits and formed into bands. Adama created a new position for their leaders: The ""lamido"" (plural: ""lamibe""), who was the leader of a particular territory, as opposed to an ardo, leader of a particular people. Both groups received flags of command and shared the same status in Adama's armies. Before his death, Adama would appoint over 40 non-ardo lamibe. They would prove his most loyal lieutenants."
"Adama turned his attentions on the only major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an attractive target. It lay between Bornu to the north and Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not be an easy prize. The people who lived there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another crack at an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamaré Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high."
"Adama reached Guringa in 1809 with a large army in good morale. He quickly conquered the Mandara settlement at Guider and headed north, taking several more villages along the way. Outside of the Mandara capital, Dulo, Adama demanded that the king, Bukar Djiama, swear his allegiance and convert to Islam untainted with paganism. Bukar agreed to acknowledged Adama's right to rule his own subjects, but he refused to yield his own sovereignty. Adama and his men took Dulo with little fighting."
"Adama searched for someone to rule the settlement, but he found no one whom he felt adequate for the post. Meanwhile, his troops revelled in their plunder. No one expected the Mandara counterattack, which was launched from nearby Mora. Adama fled the town, and Dulo fell from his grasp forever."
"Adama and his men retreated to Yola (in present-day Nigeria). The town would become his capital by 1841. From here, he and his lieutenants continued to expand the emirate, which he named Adamawa after himself. The subordinates had to send him tribute in the form of cattle. Large settlements such as Maroua, Garoua, and Ngaoundéré fell to Adama or his lieutenants. By 1825, the Fulani had penetrated the Adamawa Plateau. Nevertheless, Adama lived in relatively moderate surroundings and never acquired great wealth."
"From Yola, Adama began the administrative tasks necessary for his nascent state. He did this with Usman's advice; he was to foster understanding between his people and their governors, facilitate communication between elders and their subordinates, and prevent the stratification of society based on class or wealth. The empire eventually took on three administrative tiers. At the centre was the ""emir al-Mu'minin"" (""commander of the faithful""), Adama himself, ruling from Yola and answering only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. A contingent of councillors and administrators directly aided him, and a household staff of non-Fulbe and slaves doubled as his bodyguard. Below him were a number of district leaders, the lamibe, who ruled key settlements. Under them were a number of villages, each headed by a village chief."
"Meanwhile, some of the older ardo'en grew powerful through their own conquests. They regarded the unconquered areas near their territories as their own private backyards and defended these zones from all comers. This sometimes surfaced in their relations with Adama, such as when Bouba Njida of Rai refused to come to Adama's aid when the emir was fighting the Namchi at Poli. Instead, Bouba waited for Adama to retreat from the area to bring in his own forces and finish the enemy off. He then sent prisoners from the battle to Adama as a gift."
"Adama died in 1847 and was laid to rest at Yola (his tomb survives to this day). Adamawa covered 103,000 km² from Lake Chad to Banyo and was inhabited by 1,500,000 people. Further expansion to the south had proved difficult and undesirable since the presence of the tsetse fly and thick jungle made cattle rearing difficult there."
"Adama's son Muhammadu Lawal succeeded him after a brief regency under Hamidu bi Adama. Eventually, three of Adama's other sons would at some point serve as Emir of Adamawa. Not until the British and German colonial periods would the emirate come to an end."
"Despite their loss of independence, the Fulani were now the preeminent ethnic group of Northern Cameroon. They spread Islam throughout the region, establishing it as the dominant religion. Education also flourished, as new converts learned Arabic writing and studied the Qur'an. Trade flourished, and communications with it. The conquests were also important ecologically. Lands that had once been used for cultivation now became part of Fulani pastureland. Herdsmen cut down trees to make way for cattle, and they burned grasses that their herds later trampled. Centuries of such behaviour have replaced the region's forest with savanna."
"Ironically, the Adamawa was more sparsely populated after Adama's conquest. Rather than fight the Fulani invaders, many peoples fled, displacing others in turn. The Adamawa Plateau, once home to many of Cameroon's ethnic groups, soon became a pastureland, and the forest zone of Cameroon became more heavily populated."

"In 2010, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list as the most influential Muslim in the world for the second consecutive year. Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei maintained second place. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan moved into third place. Jordanian King Abdullah II was placed fourth above Moroccan King Mohammed VI who moved down to fifth place."
"In 2011, achievements of a lifetime were given more weight than achievements within the current year. which meant that the lists of names were going to change gradually, rather than dramatically, year-on-year. The Arab Spring had no impact on Saudi King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's influence, it had boosted King Mohammed VI of Morocco's influence, who moved up to second place, and it had no effect on Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who came in third place."
"Erdoğan was expected by many to receive the top spot in light of the Arab Spring. Erdoğan was credited with Turkey's ""Muslim democracy"", and was seen as the leader of a country that, as the Brookings Institution said, ""played the 'most constructive' role in the Arab events."""
"Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani influence rose during the Arab Spring, moving him to sixth place. He had driven much of the Arab Spring through the coverage given by ""Al Jazeera"", given financial support to protesters and political support to Libya, making him arguably the biggest enabler of the Arab Spring."

It lists the winners according to 13 categories, including spiritual guides, Quran reciters, scholars, politicians, celebrities, sports figures, radicals, and media leaders."
"For the fourth year running, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list. He was followed by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at second place. Erdoğan's advance gave him advantage over Moroccan King Mohammed VI who took the third place. Fourth place went to Dr Mohammed Badie, whose name appeared in the top 10 for the first time. He was followed by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who took the fifth place. Sheikh Al-Azhar Dr. Ahmad el-Tayeb and prominent Islamic scholar Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi who is President of Global Association of Muslim Scholars, also made it to the top 10 ranks."

"The top of the list went to Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Sheikh of the Al Azhar University for the prominent role played by him in Egypt's troubled democratic transition His astute decision making over the past couple of years has preserved the traditional approach of Al-Azhar which faced threats from Islamists and Salafis in the years that have followed Mubarak's fall. His public support of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's coup also gave it a strong religious grounding that was necessary for it to achieve the legitimacy needed to prevent a civil war, effectively making him a ""king-maker"" and cementing his place at the top of the list. He was followed on the listing by Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud and Iranian Grand Leader Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei."
"Reflective of the wider trajectory of the Arab Spring, this year's list showed a decline in influence from Muslim Brotherhood associated figures Dr Mohammed Badie, Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi and ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. Coup kingpin General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who was previously unlisted now ranks at 29."
"The US dominates the list again with 41 inclusions including Muhammad Ali, Dr Mehmet Oz, Rep. Keith Ellison, Yasiin Bey (Mos Def), and Fareed Zakaria. Representing the UK are Mo Farah, Yusuf Islam, Riz Khan, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Cambridge's Dr Timothy Winter and 18 others."
"In 2014, the chief editor of the list was again Professor S Abdallah Schleifer. The top spot went back to Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, due to his being the ""absolute monarch of the most powerful Arab nation."" The list accords him the place in light of Saudi Arabia being home to Islam's two holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, which millions of Muslims visit throughout the year, as well as the kingdom's oil exports. Rounding out the top three are Dr Muhammad Ahmed al-Tayeb, grand sheikh of Al-Azhar University and grand imam of Al-Azhar mosque, and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The top nine are all political leaders and royals, including Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan."
"The top 50 fit into six broad categories: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are ""preachers"", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations. In total 72 Americans are among the 500 most influential Muslims, a disproportionately strong showing, but only one among the top 50, Sheikh Hamza Yusuf Hanson of Zaytuna Institute listed at number 38."
"In 2015, the top 50 was again dominated by religious scholars and heads of state. The top five, was King Abdullah of Jordan; Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand sheikh of Egypt's Al-Azhar University; King Salman of Saudi Arabia; Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan came in at Number eight, but surprisingly Syrian President Bashar al-Assad did not make the Top 50 this year or last, though he is still listed in the 500. The prime minister of Iraq did not make the list, but Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Hussein Sistani did, coming in at number nine."
"There was 32 newcomers to the 2016 list. 22 Indians featured on the list. As in past years, there continued to be more Muslims from the United States than any other country.

The Royal Victorian Aero Club is an Australian aero club based at Moorabbin Airport in Melbourne. Originating in 1914 (six years before the national airline Qantas) it is amongst the world's oldest Aviation organisations.
"Founded by pioneer aviators in 1914 at Point Cook, the club is one of Australia's oldest flying training organisations."
The Australian Aero Club was formed on 28 October 1914 (and formally established on 9 April 1915) and was subsequently affiliated with the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain. The original hand-written minutes of this historic meeting establishing the club are preserved today.
"Renamed the Victorian Aero Club in October 1934, on 13 March 1935 approval to use the ""Royal"" prefix was granted and since that date the institution has been known as the Royal Victorian Aero Club."
"While originally formed at Point Cook, in 1919 the Club transferred operations to what was then the Commonwealth Aerodrome (or sometimes referred to as ""St Johns Field"") on Bulla Road in Essendon. Club operations were some of the first from St John's Field, as the aerodrome was not officially opened until 1922."
"The Civil Aviation Department provided support to the Australian Aero Club, by providing an establishment gift of six DeHavilland"
"Gypsy Moth aircraft two of which were allocated to the Victorian Chapter. The two Victorian Gypsy Moths, (G-AUAL and G-UAUG) arrived in July 1926 by ship and within a month they were taking part in a major aerial display at Essendon to celebrate the arrival of solo flyer A. J. Cobham from England. The Flying Section of the Club was officially opened by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Irvine on 21 August 1926."
In 1934 club member 28-year-old Freda Thompson flew her DH Moth Major solo from England to Australia in 19 days – the first Australian women fly the route (also notable for her record 5 hr flight from Koepang to Darwin). Freda Thompson was Club President in 1948.
"Operations were somewhat limited during the Second World War, and Essendon Airport subsequently became the primary commercial airport for Melbourne, the increased airliner traffic limiting private operations. Thus, in December 1949 the Club transferred to and became the first operator on what were once market-gardens on Centre Dandenong Road, at the newly established Moorabbin Airport, southeast of the city. A massive growth in the number of flying hours took place in the 1950s and 1960s, aided in part by a Commonwealth Government edict providing some subsidies for private flying training."
The Foundation Members of the Royal Victorian Aero Club were:
Some of those who played a vital role in Club flying operations and who have trained thousands of Australian aviators include:
"Laurie McPherson, Instructor 1950–1951. CFI 1952–1960, 1969–1970 and Manager 1961–1968 and 1978–1985. Pilot who conducted tests on behalf of the Australian Department of Civil Aviation to closely examine the spinning characteristics of the DHC Chipmunk."
"John Lindsay, Honorary Life Member, one-time CFI and manager and pre-eminent club member from 1945 to 2007."
"H Owen Jones, an employee for 42 years."
"Roy F Goon, first flew with RVAC in 1933, flew CAC Boomerang aircraft during Second World War in Darwin and Gove (Sqdn. Ldr. 83 Sqdn). Commanding Officer of l l l MFCU at Labuan. He held this position from 14 February 1943 to 7 September 1945 and was a test pilot with the RAAF, Commonwealth Aircraft Factory and Royal Flying Doctor Service. Held Commercial Pilot Licence No 511 and was an Instructor at the RVAC for 40 years and Chief Flying Instructor in 1977. Goon was a member of the well-known Chinese-Australian family from Ballarat, Victoria."
"George Campbell referred to by pioneer aviatrix Nancy Bird-Walton as """"a man who became a great trainer of pilots in the last war years."""
The Royal Victorian Aero Club provides aircraft and facilities for pilot training and private flying at Moorabbin Airport.
The Club currently trains pilots from various overseas countries and also offers an annual Scholarship as well as fly-aways and regular competitions.
"Additionally, the club (with the RAAF Roulettes as Patron) operates the Young Eagles programme for Victorians between 12 and 17 years of age, designed to introduce flying to potential aviators."
In the boom times of the 1950s much of the training and private flying was undertaken in the legendary De Havilland Moth series of aircraft (primarily the de Havilland Tiger Moth).
"The De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk and Victa Airtourer were used in the 1960s followed subsequently by a limited number of Beechcraft aircraft and in much greater numbers, the reliable Piper Aircraft and Cessna, current models of which remain the backbone of the fleet today."

"The Flehe Bridge, is a single tower cable stayed bridge located in Düsseldorf, over the Rhine. It connects the A 46 motorway from the left bank of the Rhine (Neuss, Aachen, Heinsberg district, the Netherlands) with the Bergisches Land on the right bank (Wuppertal, Solingen, Hagen) and the south of Düsseldorf. It forms at the same time the southern part of the ring of motorways around Düsseldorf. It includes a pedestrian and cyclist strip."
"This bridge opened in 1979 and eliminated a considerable amount of transit traffic south of Düsseldorf and the South Bridge (B 1), both then the only southern access from the left bank of the Rhine to Düsseldorf. Also, it connected the A 46 with the A 57. The Flehe Bridge has in each direction three vehicle lanes and a hard shoulder. The bridge does not cross the Rhine in a right angle, in order to preserve the area of water procurement of the old water company Flehe. A remarkable feature of the Flehe bridge is the reinforced concrete suspension tower, which looks like a Ypsilon turned on its head. In the handles of the pylons an elevator and stairs are accommodated above the roadway. The handles are in bridge longitudinal direction only broad. They were manufactured with a climbing formwork.

= = = Rappbode Dam = = =
"The Rappbode Dam () is the largest dam in the Harz region as well as the highest dam in Germany. Together with several other dams and retention basins, it forms the flood protection system for the eastern Harz."
"The earliest discussions about building flood protection barriers took place following devastating floods at the beginning of the 20th century. These envisaged a number of masonry dams being constructed across the tributaries of the Bode river. The first concrete plan, however, was to build just one dam but this would have meant sacrificing a number of villages. The eventual project work was completed in 1938 and proposed a plan which avoided flooding any of localities by constructing a number of dams. Construction on the Rappbode Valley Dam began in 1938. Construction was halted due to the war in 1942. After 1945, the newly founded East Germany, the project got under way again and was extended by including the treatment of drinking water, the original layout being retained and the technology being adapted. The foundation stone was laid on 1 September 1952 and, on 7 October 1959, the dam went into service. It was reconstructed between 2000 and 2003 and the national emblems of East Germany on the inscriptions at the tunnel exit of the road across the dam were removed. The two inscriptions on the left and on the right read:"
"The barrier is a straight gravity dam, which holds the water back by its sheer weight. It was built in several sections and finished in 1959. It is high and long. In recent years (before 2002) the crest of the dam was renewed. The roadway and the concrete had weathered and could no longer handle the weight of traffic. The lake behind the dam acts primarily as a reserve drinking water reservoir for the towns east of the Harz. The pressure pipes go to Aschersleben, Halberstadt, Bernburg (Saale), Halle (Saale) and even Leipzig. Its water quality is particularly good; water hardness averages 3° on the German hardness scale. So the water is ideal for use for steam generation and washing. The reservoir also contributes to generation of hydro-electric power to a small extent."
Thiocyanic acid is a chemical compound with the formula HSCN which exists as a tautomer with isothiocyanic acid (HNCS). The iso- form tends to dominate with the material being about 95% isothiocyanic acid in the vapor phase.
"It is a weak acid, bordering on strong, with a p""K"" of 1.1 at 20 °C and extrapolated to zero ionic strength."
HSCN is predicted to have a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. It has been observed spectroscopically but has not been isolated as a pure substance.
"The salts and esters of thiocyanic acid are known as thiocyanates. The salts are composed of the thiocyanate ion (SCN) and a suitable metal cation (e.g., potassium thiocyanate, KSCN). The esters of thiocyanic acid have the general structure R–SCN."

"Ypiranga Clube, or Ypiranga as they are usually called, is a Brazilian football team from Macapá in Amapá, founded on May 15, 1963."
"Home stadium is the Zerão stadium, capacity 5,000. They play in blue and black striped shirts, black shorts and black socks."
"The club was founded on May 15, 1963, by the initiative of the father Vitório Galliani, vicar of Igreja Nossa Senhora da Conceição, who lead young members of Juventude Oratoriana do Trem (JOT), a movement connected to Vitório Galliani's church. Under influence of Vitório Galliani, it was established that the club's official colors would be black and blue, the same colors of Italy's Internazionale, club supported by the father. Guaracy Freitas was elected as the club's first president."
"In 1963, the club joined Federação Amapaense de Desportos. In 1964, Ypiranga disputed its first competition, the Second Division of the Amapaense Amateur Football Championship, and managed by Francisco Sales de Lima (nicknamed ""Chicão""), the club won the competition, after defeating Independente 6–3 in the final, at Augusto Antunes Stadium. The champion team was composed of the following players: Manguinha, Lindoval, Barata, Guaracy and Suzico, Adauto and Ary, Peninha, Artur, Narciso and Almeida. The reservers: Elcio, Horácio, Otílio, Gadelha, Lery, Trombone, Tônati, Sabá Balieiro, and Joaquim Neto."
"In 1976, Ypiranga won its first state championship, after the club and Santana drew 0–0 at Estádio Municipal Glicério de Souza Marques. The champion players were Emanuel, Buiuna, Damasceno, Waldir and Pitéo, Duranil and Dival, Ananízio, Tadeu, Jason and Dilermano, and the reserves were Odival, Paulo César, Bolinha, Orlandino, João Oliveira, Padeirinho Dewson and Nena. In 1986, after a poor campaign, Ypiranga was relegated to the Second Division of Campeonato Amapaense. However, the team won the second division in 1987, returning to the first division in 1988."
"In 1991, under the administration of the chairman Luiz Góes, Ypiranga became a professional team. In 1992, Ypiranga reached its first professional competition title, after winning the state championship. The players of that team were Maurício, Zé Preta, Ponga, Cid and Neirivaldo, Edgar, Edvaldo and Serginho, Tiaguinho, Miranda and Jorginho Macapá, managed by Dadá Maravilha, who had won the 1970 World Cup as a player."
"Ypiranga's home stadium is Estádio Milton Corrêa, usually known as Zerão, inaugurated in 1990, with a maximum capacity of 5,000 people. It is famous for having its halfway line positioned exactly over the Equator."
"Ypiranga's logo is uncommon, because it features a church's tower. This church's tower is located at Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, which is a church located in Trem neighborhood. The club's nickname, Clube da Torre, is also a reference to the church's tower, and means ""Tower Club"" in English. Ypiranga's mascot is a creature very similar to Warner Brothers' Taz, but wearing the club's shirt, a club's themed Baseball cap and black leather jeans."

"Shakespeare Santa Cruz was an annual professional theatre festival in Santa Cruz, California, which ran from 1981 to 2013. After losing the financial support of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the company was relaunched through crowdfunding as Santa Cruz Shakespeare."
"Shakespeare Santa Cruz was founded in 1981 and performed annually on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Plays by Shakespeare and other great dramatists were performed indoors on the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage and outdoors in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen. Bringing in professional actors, directors and designers from throughout the country, the Company's season ran from July to early September and presented three or four plays that ran concurrently in repertory six days a week (no performance on Mondays). With a mission to “cultivate the imagination, wit, daring, and vision that the greatest playwrights demand of artists and audiences alike,"" SSC sought to present a festival of theatre which showcased contemporary approaches to directing, designing and acting. Attendance grew from 7,716 people in 1982 to 31,013 in 1992. Since its founding, the company's artistic directors have been Audrey Stanley (1982–86), Michael Edwards (1987–92), Danny Scheie (1993–95), Risa Brainin, Paul Whitworth (1996–2007), and Marco Barricelli (2008–2013). Some of the rising theatre stars who have worked at SSC are: David Aaron Baker, Bryan Cranston, Maria Dizzia, Dan Donohue, Caitlin FitzGerald, Richard Gunn, Peter Jacobson, Carrie Preston, Reg Rogers, and Michael Stuhlbarg."
"In 1997, Artistic Director Paul Whitworth introduced the SSC annual Winter Holiday season. In keeping with the tradition of Shakespeare Santa Cruz’s fresh take on the classics, the holiday shows were original musicals written for SSC by playwright Kate Hawley with music composed by Gregg Coffin, Craig Bohmler and Adam Wernick. A fusion of the traditions of the British pantomime and the American musical, ""Cinderella"", ""Gretel and Hansel"", ""The Princess and the Pea"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" were based on traditional fairy tales and appeal to audiences of all ages. The winter season performed in November and December."
"In addition to the summer repertory season and the holiday show, Shakespeare Santa Cruz had two performance programs which sought to engage student actors with Shakespearean and other classical texts---the summer Fringe show and the Shakespeare to Go program. The Fringe show was an opportunity for the summer Company's acting interns to perform their own production in the Glen two nights each summer. Past productions included ""Lysistrata"", ""The Antipodes"", ""Fools in the Forest"", and ""The Mock-Tempest"". Shakespeare to Go was an educational engagement program—and recipient of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) funding—featuring University of California Santa Cruz Theater Arts students who toured local schools in the spring performing one-hour versions of one of the full-length plays to be featured in the summer repertory season. Additionally, Shakespeare to Go presented a limited number of free public performances."
"The festival was responsible for supporting itself, but had recently run deficits which were paid by the University of California. In 2008, with California's budget crisis having resulted in reduced funding, the university could no longer afford to cover these debts. An agreement was reached that if the theater could raise $300,000, it could continue operation. Within 10 days of the agreement's announcement, over $400,000 was raised. Claiming continuing financial problems, however, the UCSC Arts Division dean announced several years later that Shakespeare Santa Cruz would end after its 2013 holiday production."
"Following this announcement, the theater company began a campaign to raise money to become an independent company. By February 2014, they raised over $1 million (USD) through crowdfunding to continue on without the financial support of the university. In March 2014, the new company changed its name to Santa Cruz Shakespeare."

"The Maple River is a tributary of the Sheyenne River, about long, in the Red River Valley of eastern North Dakota in the United States. Via the Sheyenne River, the Red River of the North, Lake Winnipeg and the Nelson River, the Maple is part of the watershed of Hudson Bay."
"The Maple River flows through Steele, Barnes, Cass and Ransom counties. It begins as an intermittent stream near the town of Finley in Steele County, and flows generally southward to Enderlin, where it turns to the northeast and flows past Mapleton. It joins the Sheyenne River about north of West Fargo, not far upstream of the Sheyenne's confluence with the Red."

"Valērijs ""Val"" Kalmikovs (born March 4, 1973) is a Latvian former swimmer, who specialized in breaststroke and individual medley events. He is a two-time Olympian (1996 and 2000) and a top 16 finalist in the 200 m breaststroke on his Olympic debut in Atlanta (1996). He still holds a Latvian record in the 200 m breaststroke (2:16.21) that stood for more than a decade. While studying in the United States, Kalmikovs achieved a sixth-fastest of all time in the 200-yard breaststroke at the 2000 NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships. He has also been named a three-time Big-12 Conference Champion and a nine-time All-American, as a member of the University of Nebraska swimming and diving team. Since his sporting career ended in 2004, Kalmikovs has extensively traveled across the United States and Europe, working as a swimming coach."
"Kalmikovs, a native of Riga, Latvia, started swimming at the very young age under a Soviet system. Both of his parents were swimming coaches that motivated and inspired him to undergo training to an elite level and to become part of the Latvian squad. He has one younger sister, Margarita Kalmikova, who is also an elite breaststroke swimmer. Kalmikovs and his sister shared a sibling tandem in the sport, when they both competed together in two editions of the Olympic Games (1996 and 2000)."
"Kalmikovs accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he competed for the Nebraska Cornhuskers swimming and diving team under head coach Cal Bentz. While swimming for the Cornhuskers, Kalmikovs received a total of nine All-American honors, captured three Big 12 Conference titles, and held four school records in the 100 and 200-yard breaststroke. At the 2000 NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, during his junior year, Kalmikovs posted a sixth-fastest time of 2:10.64 in the 200-yard breaststroke, where Ed Moses set a new world record. In his senior season, Kalmikovs served as an assistant volunteer coach for the team before he graduated from the University in 2001 with a bachelor of arts degree in international affairs."
"Kalmikovs made his official debut, along with his sister Margarita Kalmikova, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He failed to reach the top 16 final in two out of his three attempts, finishing twenty-first in the 200 m individual medley (2:06.16), and eighteenth in the 400 m individual medley (4:28.04). In his third attempt, 200 m breaststroke, Kalmikovs powered home with a thirteenth-place effort in the B-Final at 2:16.23."
"At the 1998 FINA World Championships in Perth, Australia, Kalmikovs placed twenty-second in the 200 m breaststroke (2:21.22), and thirty-eighth in the 200 m individual medley (2:10.28), all from the prelims."
"At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Kalmikovs decided to drop half of his medley double, and experiment instead with 100 m breaststroke. He achieved FINA B-standards of 1:04.89 (100 m breaststroke), 2:16.30 (200 m breaststroke), and 2:04.83 (200 m individual medley) from the European Championships in Helsinki. On the first day of the Games, Kalmikovs placed thirty-fourth in the 100 m breaststroke. Swimming in heat four, he enjoyed a sprint finish with Puerto Rico's Arsenio López, as they both hit the wall first in a matching time of 1:04.02. Three days later, in the 200 m breaststroke, Kalmikovs established a new Latvian record of 2:16.21 to pull off a nineteenth-place effort from the heats, but missed the semifinal cut by more than half a second (0.50). In his final event, 200 m individual medley, Kalmikovs placed twenty-fourth on the morning prelims. Swimming again in heat four, he came up short in second place by 0.11 of a second behind New Zealand's Dean Kent in a lifetime best of 2:04.18."
"At the 2001 FINA World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Kalmikovs competed only in a breaststroke double. He failed to produce best results for the semifinals in any of his individual events, finishing thirty-fifth in the 100 m breaststroke (1:05.36), and twenty-first in the 200 m breaststroke (2:19.23)."
"Kalmikovs also sought his bid for his third Olympics in Athens, but forced to drop out from the Games, because of a wrist injury. Shortly after his qualifying bid, he announced his retirement from swimming."
"Since he graduated from the University of Nebraska in 2001, Kalmikovs continued to serve as an assistant swimming coach. He completed his master's degree in sports management and athletic administration at Valparaiso University in 2003, and later moved to California to coach numerous age group swimmers for Bakersfield Swim Club. He was awarded the 2004 Central California Coach of the Year after a few of his swimmers won USA Junior National Championships."
"Since his sporting career ended in 2004, Kalmikovs has extensively traveled across the United States and Europe, working as a swimming coach. He is married to Australian swimmer Joy Symons, and currently resided together in Rockhampton, Queensland, along with their two children Jett and Cooper."

"Euler gained his doctorate (Ph.D.) in 1979 at Gießen university (Prof. Rolf Hiersche) with a theses on parallels in nominal formation between Indo-Iranian languages and Greek. The study was received as a contribution to the identification of Greek being part of the phylogenetic Eastern group of indoeuropean languages, despite of the Western geographic location of Greece. Up until today, Euler has published about 80 scientific articles and books covering most branches of the Indoeuropean languages; major contributions refer to the Baltic, Indo-Iranian, Greek and Germanic languages."

"The album was produced by Ed Buller at ICP Studios in Brussels, Belgium"
"On 18 August 2013, the album debuted at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart."
"In an interview with ""NME"" in January 2013, bassist Charles Cave said that the album was the band's most melodic record, but continued the definitive White Lies sound. The album follows a story of a couple who leave a provincial area for a big city and, according to Cave, the idea of equality in a relationship is a recurring theme."
"""Big TV"" was the first White Lies album to feature 12 rather than 10 tracks, two of which (""Space I"" and ""Space II"") are instrumental interludes."
"The album was released as both as a regular CD and a deluxe 2CD hardback book edition, featuring seven original demos of songs from the album and stills from the studio sessions. The Japanese version included the seven demos from the hardback book edition as well as a remix of ""There Goes Our Love Again"", all on one disc. ""Big TV"" was also released digitally and on 180gsm vinyl."
"The cover artwork for the album is a painting, ""Pilot 2"", by New York City-based artist Michael Kagan."
"The track ""Getting Even"" was released on 4 June 2013 as a free download on White Lies' SoundCloud page. The song charted on Polish radio station Eska Rock, peaking at No. 1."
"There is no official Triple Crown for these Melbourne races, but racing fans consider these three Group 1 races to be the major interconnected component of the spring carnival package, while also acknowledging that only a superhorse could win them all in the same season to complete a . Only one horse has ever managed this feat, the great New Zealand galloper Rising Fast, in 1954. More recently, popular Might and Power won all three races, though not in the same year."
"The ""Spring Grand Slam"" in Melbourne is considered by some in the racing industry to be more difficult to win than the famous Triple Crown in the United States because the Australian races contain many more variables."
"The Triple Crown — involving the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes — is contested only by three-year-olds who race over distances between 1910 metres (Preakness) and 2400 metres (Belmont). The horses all carry the same weight (fillies a little less than colts and geldings), and none of the horses are being asked to race around the track in an unaccustomed direction."
"In Melbourne, the races are open to all horses aged three and over, and they race between 2,040 metres (Cox Plate) and 3,200 metres (Melbourne Cup)."
"The weight carried by horses can vary immensely, both in each race and from race to race, because three different handicapping systems are employed. The Caulfield Cup is a handicap race, the Cox Plate is a weight-for-age race, and the Melbourne Cup is a combination of both, a weight-for-age-handicap."
"Furthermore, in the U.S., horses race counter-clockwise on all tracks, but in Australia and New Zealand, there are both clockwise and counter-clockwise tracks. All ""Spring Grand Slam"" races in Melbourne are raced counter-clockwise, so horses domiciled in areas with predominantly clockwise tracks can be disoriented and not perform to potential."

= = = Rule of 78s = = =
"Also known as the sum-of-the-digits method, the Rule of 78s is a term used in lending that refers to a method of yearly interest calculation. The name comes from the total number of months' interest that is being calculated in a year (the first month is 1 month's interest, whereas the second month contains 2 months' interest, etc.). This is an accurate interest model only based on the assumption that the borrower pays only the amount due each month. If the borrower pays off the loan early, this method maximizes the amount paid (interest paid) by applying funds to interest before principal. In other words, in comparison to a simple interest loan, a rule of 78s loan will charge more interest if the loan is paid early."
"A simple fraction (as with 12/78) consists of a numerator (the top number, 12 in the example) and a denominator (the bottom number, 78 in the example). The denominator of a Rule of 78 loan is the sum of the digits, the sum of the number of monthly payments in the loan. For a twelve-month loan, the sum of numbers from 1 to 12 is 78 (1 + 2 + 3 + . . . +12 = 78). For a 24-month loan, the denominator is 300. The sum of the numbers from 1 to n is given by the equation n * (n+1) / 2. If n were 24, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 24 is 24 * (24+1) / 2 = 12 x 25 = 300, which is the loan's denominator, D."
"For a 12-month loan, 12/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of the finance charge, 11/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the second month's portion of the finance charge and so on until the 12th month at which time 1/78s of the finance charge is assessed as that month's portion of the finance charge. Following the same pattern, 24/300 of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of a 24-month precomputed loan."
Formula for calculating the unearned interest:
formula_1
"where formula_2 is the unearned interest, formula_3 is the total agreed finance charges, formula_4 is the number of months paying off early, formula_5 is the total term of loan in months"
"The earliest official use of the Rule of 78s to calculate the unearned portion of a loan's finance charge was in Indiana in 1935. Most loans in 1935 were for small amounts at low interest rates for short periods of time. It reduced the cost of loan calculations in a pre-computer era and was well suited for the small, short, and low interest rate loans of the era."
"In the United States, the use of the Rule of 78s is prohibited in connection with mortgage refinancings and other consumer loans having a term exceeding 61 months."
"On March 15, 2001, in the U.S. 107th Congress, U.S. Rep. John LaFalce (D-NY 29), introduced H.R. 1054, a bill to eliminate the use of the Rule of 78s in credit transactions. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services on the same day. On April 10, 2001, the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, where it died with no further action taken."
"In the UK, as part of the Consumer Credit Act of 2005, the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1483) which does away with the Rule of 78 in consumer credit lending was issued and brought into effect on 31 May 2005."
"The Rule of 78s deals with precomputed loans, which are loans whose finance charge is calculated before the loan is made. Finance charge, carrying charges, interest costs, or whatever the cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the finance charge has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the finance charge to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the finance charge as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed finance charge is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal."
"A simple explanation would be as follows: suppose that the total finance charge for a 12-month loan was $78.00. That figure is representative of the sum of digits by adding the numbers together, i.e., 12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 = 78. If a person repaid a consumer loan after 3 months, the financial institution would refund the sum of the ""remaining"" digits...(i.e. 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 or $45.00. In essence, they would retain the first three (3) numbers...12,11,10 or $33.00. Thus the consumer would not receive as much of a refund if it were divided equally by 12 months ($6.50 per month). Under this scenario they would have received a refund of $58.50, which is more beneficial than the $45.00 refund."

"Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio (1902–1964) was an Italian painter, the formulator of industrial painting, and a founding member of the Situationist International. He was also a scholar of popular culture, archaeology, nomadism, and botany."
"Pinot-Gallizio was born in Alba, Piedmont, where he became an independent Left councilman and a chemist. In 1955, he met Asger Jorn, with whom he co-founded the Experimental Laboratory of the Imaginist Bauhaus in Alba, which was part of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, in opposition to the return to productivism by others in the Bauhaus school, in particular Max Bill. It was held in Pinot-Gallizio's studio, a monastery from the seventeenth century, and was attended by such artists as Enrico Baj who experimented with nuclear painting techniques, Walter Olmo, who experimented with musical interventions, Ettore Sottsass, Elena Verrone, and Piero Simondo."
"Pinot-Gallizio drew from his background as a chemist in developing new painting techniques. In 1956 he, along with Jorn, organized the First World Congress of Free Artists, at which a representative from the Lettrist International spoke, foreshadowing the foundation of the Situationist International in 1957 by members of both groups, including Pinot-Gallizio. At this conference the Italian artists withdrew from the Laboratory, and after the formation of the SI only Pinot-Gallizio and his son, Giors Melanotte, remained. He helped to make the SI known in the art world with an exhibition in Paris in 1959."
"He left the SI in 1960 as it became focused on political, rather than artistic, action. He died in Alba in 1964, and the laboratory continued its work until his death."
"Many of Pinot-Gallizio's works were industrial paintings. Rather than a small image to be interpreted, these huge canvases were intended to cover a large area. The first of these was the cavern of anti-matter, prepared in 1957 after the formation of the SI. It was composed of 145 meter canvases which were painted by hand or with the aid of spray guns and machines using resins invented by Pinot-Gallizio himself. It was displayed at the Galerie René Drouin in 1959, draped around the gallery and sold by the meter."

"Hop-tu-Naa is a Celtic festival celebrated in the Isle of Man on 31 October. It is the celebration of the traditional Celtic festival of Samhain, the start of winter (). (The lenited form of the genitive singular of ""Samhain"" is ""Shamhna"".) It is thought to be the oldest unbroken tradition in the Isle of Man."
"Hop-tu-Naa is a continuation of the Manx ""Oie Houiney"", which is exactly the same as the Irish ""Oíche Shamhna"" and which was pronounced the same (though not in revived Manx). The exact status of Oíche Shamhna and its role in the Celtic calendar has been a matter of debate. Oíche Shamhna eventually mutated into Halloween in northern England and in Ireland, it was carried to America by Irish immigrants and developed into the modern Halloween."
"The term ""Hop-tu-naa"" comes from a Manx Gaelic song traditionally sung during the festival which included the nonsense Hop-tu-naa as a refrain; such nonsense rhymes are common theme in Irish and Scottish Gaelic music."
"On the Isle of Man today, many groups of people continue the tradition of singing Hop-tu-Naa songs ""around the houses"" (which traditionally referred to waits going around visiting houses, especially those of the wealthy, and soliciting gifts; beggars going ""around the houses"" are featured in The Deemster) with turnip lanterns. In addition to this, many public Hop-tu-Naa events take place across the Isle of Man each year, most of which today include competitions for artistically carving turnips and the singing of traditional songs. As well as the many events run within local communities, the National Folk Museum at Cregneash hosts an event to teach the traditional Hop-tu-Naa song and to help people to carve turnips."
"At the modern Hop-tu-Naa, children dress up and go from house to house hoping to be given sweets or money, as elsewhere. The children carry carved ""turnip"" lanterns (which are known as ""moots"" by the Manx) and sing Hop-tu-Naa songs. There are regional varieties of how turnips should be carved for Hop-tu-Naa, with variations focusing on which way up the turnip is and the nature of the decorations. It is believed that turnip-lanterns do not date earlier than the start of the 19th century, as the vegetable had only been introduced at the end of the previous century. In the past children would bring the stumps of turnips with them and batter the doors of those who refused to give them any money, in an ancient form of trick or treat. This practice appears to have died out."
"A hop-tu-naa dance was collected by both Mona Douglas and Leighton Stowell. It was believed to have been danced through the streets on Hop-tu-Naa night by couples carrying their turnip-lanterns. It is a simple procession dance for pairs of dancers which involves the Manx reel step and a combination of arches only. This dance is taught in many schools on the Isle of Man during October each year, and it is danced at many of the Hop-tu-Naa events across the island."
"Some of the older customs are similar to those now attached to the January New Year. It was a time for prophesying, weather prediction and fortune-telling. Last thing at night, the ashes of a fire were smoothed out on the hearth to receive the imprint of a foot. If, next morning, the track pointed towards the door, someone in the house would die, but if the footprint pointed inward, it indicated a birth."
"The bridge was a masterpiece of Victorian-era engineering. For its time, it was a highly sophisticated structure. It astonished the local population, many of whom had had little exposure to such state-of-the-art engineering work."
"Very quickly, urban legends began to spread."

"Of course, there is no truth in any of these stories. The bridge was constructed as planned; von Rieppel’s complex calculations, (all carried out without the aid of computers or arithmetic aids), were correct – he died about 30 years later after an unrelated illness."
"What might be true are rumours about Emperor Wilhelm II's boycott of the inauguration ceremony. According to legend, the Emperor was annoyed that such a state-of-art structure was named after his grandfather, Wilhelm I, not after himself. He therefore decided not to attend the celebrations in person."
"What is true is that the bridge has attracted an unknown, but large number of suicides during its more than 100-year existence."
"= = = Eldol, Consul of Gloucester = = ="
"Eldol was Consul or Count of Gloucester in Geoffrey of Monmouth's circa 1136 work ""Historia Regum Britanniae"" (""The History of the Kings of Britain""). In this pseudohistory he was the sole British leader to escape from the massacre of Salisbury, to which Hengist had invited all of the British Leaders to a peace treaty. When all of the leaders were there, about 460 in number, Hengest ordered his men to draw their long knives and kill every leader. Vortigern was spared, but every other ruler was slain, save Eldol, who grabbed a stick up off the ground and killed 70 men in his escape."
"After the massacre, Eldol was a key supporter of Aurelius Ambrosius and helped him defeat the Saxons. Eldol defeated Hengist in hand-to-hand combat at the battle at Kaerconan/Cunungeburc, which may be the town of Conisbrough, and beheaded him. He was also at the siege of Vortigern's tower. Eldad, Bishop of Gloucester, was his brother."
"Thomas Rudge gives an account in his 1811 ""The History and Antiquities of Gloucester"":"
"Eldol, or Edel, a Briton, is said to have been Earl of Gloucester in 461; he was, according to the account of Robert of Gloucester, and other historians, a knight of great prowess. He attended King Vortigern at the treaty of Ambresbury in Wiltshire, to which they were invited by Hengist, the Saxon, with the express stipulation that neither party should go thither armed; but the Saxons having, contrary to their engagement, concealed long knives under their clothes, murdered great numbers of the Britons. Eldol is said at this time to have exerted himself so powerfully with a stake he happened to find, as to slay no less than seventy of the Saxons, and after having disabled many more, he escaped to Gloucester, his own city. He is also said to have behaved with uncommon courage, in a subsequent battle between Ambrosius, King of the Britons, and Hengist, when ... he rushed through the Pagan army, took Hengist prisoner, and cut off his head."
"It is not stated whether Morvid, Consul of Gloucester during King Arthur's reign in the ""Historia Regum Britanniae"", is related to Eldol."
"In later Welsh legend, Eldol became Eidol or Eidiol 'Gadarn' ('Mighty'), recorded as one of the three strong men of Britain, having, at the meeting on Salisbury plain, slain 660 Saxons with a billet of wood."
"There was a Welsh hero Eidiol mentioned in ""The Gododdin"" who may have inspired the use of the name in Geoffrey's work."

"Yidl Mitn Fidl (, ""Yiddle With His Fiddle"", ), is a 1936 musical Yiddish film."
"Arye and his daughter Itke are musicians, or ""klezmorim"", who became impoverished and were evicted from their home in Kazimierz Dolny. Arie sees no choice but to embark on a career of a travelling band, but fears for the safety of his daughter on the dangerous roads. Itke solves the problem by disguising herself as a boy and adopts the persona of ""Yidl"", ostensibly Arie's son."
"During their voyages, they meet another pair of merrymakers, the father-and-son duo Isaac and Ephraim Kalamutker, with whom they form a quartet and roam through the Polish countryside seeking engagements. ""Yidl"" falls in love with Ephraim, who is utterly oblivious to the true sex of his companion. The four are hired to perform in the wedding of young Teibele to the old, rich man Zalman Gold. The bride had to cancel her prior engagement with her true love, Yosl Fedlman, for her late father left many unpaid debts. Yidl takes pity on Teibele and the quartet smuggle her out of the party and have her join them as vocalist. To Yidl's dismay, Ephraim is enamored with the young woman. Itke reveals her true self to Isaac, who determines to assist her and leaves to locate Yosl."
"When arriving in Warsaw, the group become a success and are hired to perform in a concert. However, personal tensions between the members run high. Efraim signs a contract with a local orchestra. Teibele's lost match finally arrives, and they run off together before the show. Yidl, quite by accident, takes her place and recounts her entire story and love for Efraim in song form. She is applauded and signed on a contract for a career in the United States. Having learned the truth, Efraim abandons his commitments and joins her on the ship to New York."
"After the success of ""Joseph in the Land of Egypt"", a silent film dubbed into the Yiddish language by Joseph Green, met with success, he decided to create an entirely Yiddish film, and returned to his native Poland to do so. ""Yidl Mitn Fidl"" was the most successful Yiddish film of all time and the most popular of Green's films as well."
"The film was shot on location in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, with local inhabitants as extras. Based on a novella by Konrad Tom, the screenplay was written by Green. Its score was composed by Abraham Ellstein, and the lyrics to the songs were written by Itzik Manger. Jakob Jonilowicz was the photo director of the film."
"It was filmed in Poland to minimize costs: the total budget was $50,000. Picon was contemplating entering English-language entertainment and had to be paid an astronomical fee in terms of Yiddish cinema, $10,000 or a fifth of the entire expenditure, to star in the main role. Besides her, all actors were Polish. The film turned into a resounding commercial success and covered the producers' expenses even before opening in the United States. When it premiered in the Ambassador movie theatre, Frank S. Nugent wrote in the ""New York Times"": ""It must be set down to her credit that, despite the fact that there is not a single new thing in the whole bag of tricks emptied on the screen, Miss Picon puts so much infectious gayety, not forgetting the proper modicum of sadness, into the action that the result is genuine entertainment."" It was exported to most of Western Europe, Australia and South Africa, and was screened in the British Mandate of Palestine with Hebrew dubbing. In Britain, it opened at Academy Cinema, Oxford Street, on 21 July 1937. The picture was exported outside of London and was quite a success; In a review for ""Night and Day"" from 29 July 1937, Graham Greene wrote of ""Yiddle"": ""a story in which even the music seems to have the dignity and patina of age and race. An odd feeling of freedom pervades the film full of ugly people in bowler-hats strumming in courtyards... Freedom even from the closer tyranny of a well-made script, as if the whole picture were an impromptu performance, like the stories in the Decameron."" Several copies were sent to Nazi Germany, where Jews were not allowed to attend regular cinemas, and viewing was restricted to ""members of the Jewish Race."" Premiere in the hall of the Jüdischer Kulturbund took place on 2 May 1938, and it then ran in communities across Germany."

= = = Cherry Hill Park = = =
"""Cherry Hill Park"" is a song written by Robert Nix and Billy Gilmore, arranged by Buddy Buie, James Cobb, and Emory Gordy, Jr., and produced by Buie and Bill Lowery. Its original by Billy Joe Royal was a hit in 1969 reaching #15 on both the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart and the ""Cash Box"" chart, and #8 in Canada. It was on Royal's 1969 album ""Cherry Hill Park"". Buie also produced its cover version performed by the Classics IV which was released by United Artists Records in 1971. He and the Classics IV's manager Paul Cochran were two of the four owners of Studio One. The cover was actually marketed with its title combining the first two words of the original's (""Cherryhill Park"")."
"The subject of the song is one Mary Hill, a girl who has frequents the titular Cherry Hill Park. During days she acts as a tease to the boys in the park but at night when they return to the park she gratifies them, as noted in the barely disguised suggestive lyrics. However, she ""married away"" to a ""man with money"". As a result, she stopped coming to Cherry Hill Park."
"Royal came up with the song's title after a friend described seeing Cherry Hill, New Jersey on a visit to nearby Pennsylvania."

= = = Tadao Yasuda = = =
"He made his professional sumo debut in March 1979 at the age of 15, after leaving junior high school. He was recruited by Kokonoe stable. In 1980 he adopted the ""shikona"" of Fujinomori, before switching to Takanofuji in 1984. He first reached ""sekitori"" status in March 1985 upon promotion to the second highest ""jūryō"" division, but could manage only 4 wins against 11 losses and was demoted back to the unsalaried ""makushita"" division. After winning promotion back to ""jūryō"" in January 1986 he made his debut in the top ""makuuchi"" division only two tournaments later in May 1986."
"Takanofuji was ranked in the top division for 33 tournaments, winning one special prize for Fighting Spirit. His two gold stars for defeating ""yokozuna"" were both earned against Futahaguro (who, as Koji Kitao, also turned to professional wrestling). Takanofuji had the advantage of belonging to a stable that included two ""yokozuna"", Chiyonofuji and Hokutoumi, which under sumo regulations meant he never had to face them in tournament play. However, his height of meant he had a higher centre of gravity than was ideal for a sumo wrestler, and he seemed to struggle when promoted above the mid ""maegashira"" ranks. Though he managed to reach the fourth highest ""komusubi"" ranking in July 1990 he could not maintain the rank, winning only two bouts there. He was demoted from the top division after the September 1991 tournament and announced his retirement in May 1992. His career coincided exactly with that of his stablemate Hokutoumi, who made his debut alongside him in March 1979 and also retired in May 1992. At Takanofuji's own request, it was the previous head of Kokonoe stable, ex-""yokozuna"" Kitanofuji, his long time coach, and not his successor, ex-""yokozuna"" Chiyonofuji, who performed the topknot cutting at Takanofuji's official retirement ceremony or ""danpatsu-shiki."""
"Takanofuji's most common winning ""kimarite"" were ""yori-kiri"" (force out), ""hataki-komi"" (slap down) and ""tsuki-otoshi"" (thrust over)."
"Reverting to his real name, he joined the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotion in June 1993, making his debut in February 1994. Yasuda spent the majority of the 1990s as an undercard wrestler, primarily competing in opening matches or as the fall guy in tag team matches with wrestlers such as Shinya Hashimoto and Kensuke Sasaki, achieving little success. In late 2000, Yasuda, along with Kazuyuki Fujita, became somewhat of a pet project for Antonio Inoki, and both of them were sent to the United States to train in mixed martial arts. Yasuda returned to Japan soon after, and was victorious in his first fight against veteran Masaaki Satake at Pride 13. Yasuda's win helped further legitimise him as a pro wrestler in the eyes of Inoki, and this was rewarded with Yasuda reaching the semi finals of the 2001 G1 Climax, where he lost to Keiji Mutoh. After earning one win and one loss in MMA throughout 2001, Yasuda earned the biggest win of his career in December by choking out veteran Jerome Le Banner. His defeat of Jerome led to Yasuda's stock in New Japan skyrocketing almost overnight, and Yasuda soon found himself elevated from over the hill veteran to top title contender in early 2002. Yasuda earned the biggest win of his pro wrestling career on February 16, defeating Yuji Nagata in a tournament to win the vacant IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Yasuda held the title for 48 days, before dropping it to Nagata in April. In August 2002, Yasuda and Kantaro Hoshino formed their own faction, the Makai Club, a group of wrestlers primarily with MMA backgrounds who worshipped Antonio Inoki like a god. Yasuda was viewed as the leader of the group, and in early 2003 he partnered up with his second in command Kazunari Murakami to enter the IWGP Tag Team Championship #1 Contender Tournament. Despite losing to Jim Steele and Mike Barton in the final, an injury to Steele would give the title to shot to Murakami and Yasuda who unsuccessfully challenged Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono on February 16. Having retired from MMA, the aging Yasuda's position in the New Japan card began to fall again, and in late 2004 he left the promotion. After leaving New Japan, he started making sporadic appearances for ZERO-ONE and Hustle."
"In October 2007 he reportedly attempted to commit suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, using a yeontan. A friend however, interrupted the alleged attempt. He was hospitalized with fears of possible brain damage, but this proved not to be the case and he eventually made a return to wrestling. Speaking to ""Tokyo Sports"" Yasuda later denied attempting suicide, saying the poisoning was accidental. On January 11, 2011, Yasuda announced his retirement from professional wrestling. He wrestled his final match on February 4, 2011, in which he was defeated by Genichiro Tenryu."
"Though very past his prime physically, Yasuda made his transition to mixed martial arts as a NJPW representative in March 2001. He had his debut at the PRIDE 13 against similarly retired kickboxer and karate champion Masaaki Satake. Yasuda received damage and bled from his face, but he nullified most of Satake' attacks by rushing him through sumo techniques against the ropes every time they were separated. At the end, the unanimous decision was given to Yasuda for controlling the fight."
"Yasuda returned to MMA in the K-1 Andy Hug Memorial event, taking on Rene Rooze in a special rules match, but he lost via head kick KO at the third round. He would be more successful in December 2001, when he fought popular K-1 player Jerome Le Banner at an Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye event: Yasuda managed to take him down and submit him by pressing his forearm against Le Banner's throat, getting the biggest win of his MMA career."
"He would later lost to fellow NJPW wrestler Kazuyuki Fujita in an Universal Fighting-Arts Organization event. Yasuda then fought superheavyweight kickboxer Jan Nortje, but he had to retire from the match when he hurt a leg seriously. His last fight was a rematch against Rooze, losing the fight again, this time by TKO."
Yasuda's daughter Ayami was born in 1987 and is a model.
"In April 2005, the New York City based Film Forum premiered an ""expanded"" version featuring several restored scenes, along with a new musical score by Christopher Caliendo. This expanded version was actually the 136-minute cut authorized by producer Jerry Bresler before he left Columbia Studios. Recently unearthed in Sony Pictures' archives, the restored version played in selected cities in North America and has been released on a Region 1 DVD. All of the cuts were edited out of the released version at the last minute; it is highly unlikely that Peckinpah's director's cut will ever be fully restored."
"Restored scenes are listed below. These include both brief inserts and additions to existing scenes, as well as four major scenes restored to the film."
"Available as extras on the DVD are an unfinished knife fight scene between Potts and Gomez in a Mexican village, a longer version of Teresa and Dundee's interlude at the lake, and several silent outtakes – including a master shot which would have opened the massacre scene at the beginning, of Lt. Brannin and his men riding past a sheep farmer to the Rostes Ranch."
"For the 2005 restored version, a new score was composed by Christopher Caliendo. This score was composed and recorded with a small studio orchestra to authentically sound the way director Peckinpah might have approved it had he been alive at the time of the film's restoration, and the way the music might have been done in its original 1965 release as opposed to today's larger orchestra-type scores. The new score is regarded by some critics as being better than the original, which was disliked by film experts and featured the title song performed by the Mitch Miller Sing-a-Long Gang, though many concede the new music is far from perfect; for example, there has been criticism of Caliendo's decision to leave unscored several sequences which did have music in the original version."
"Upon its theatrical release, ""Major Dundee"" received generally negative reviews while acknowledging the film's potential. In his review in ""The New York Times"", Eugene Archer wrote that the film had ""an interesting cast, a superior visual texture, unexpected bits of character revelation and a choppy continuity that finally negates its impact."" He praised Peckinpah for ""seeking a fresh approach to the Western"" and acknowledged that the director ""displays a fine eye for panoramic vistas."" Archer concludes:"
"Many of the flaws identified by film critics in 1965 were addressed in the 2005 restored version, and film reviews of the DVD are much more positive. In his review in ""Alt Film Guide"", Dan Schneider called ""Major Dundee"" ""a near-great film that has a checkered history"" and ""likely the most gritty and realistic Western ever made."""
"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% positive rating from top film critics based on 32 reviews, and a 67% positive audience rating based on 3,478 ratings. Metacritic, another review aggregator, reports a score of 62/100 based on 12 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews""."

The track was extended in 1960 to form the present Long Course. There is also a ""Short Course"" of , now used only by meetings organised by the Vintage Sports-Car Club."
"The track is owned by the Bugatti Owners' Club (BOC), founded in 1929, who were looking for a permanent home and bought the land in 1937. The club had previously run events at Lewes and on the Chalfont Heights Estate, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. The club also ran a one-off event at Joel Park, Northwood Hill, Middlesex, on 22 June 1935, which was won by Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth, on a Bugatti, in a time of 30.16 sec.

Unfortunately, the noise nuisance, which is a disease not unknown to motor-race course promoters, broke out and the project was reluctantly abandoned..."""
"The first event at Prescott was staged in April 1938, on what is now the Short Course. As announced in ""Motor Sport"": ""The Opening Rally on April 10th will comprise an assembly at Cheltenham for lunch, followed by a run to Prescott and possibly timed runs up the hill, followed by tea at the Prescott club-house. Prescott will be ready for the first official meeting on Sunday, May 15th."" Unofficial fastest time in April was set by I. Craig in a 4.9-litre supercharged Bugatti in a time of 55.58 seconds. Fastest time of the day at the inaugural meeting in May was set by Arthur Baron in a 2,270 c.c. supercharged Bugatti in a new record time of 50.70 seconds. Sydney Allard set the sports car record driving Hutchison's V12 Lincoln-engined Allard Special in a time of 54.35 seconds. On 3 July 1938 George Abecassis broke the Prescott outright record with a climb of 47.85 seconds in his supercharged 1½ litre Alta. Joe Fry bettered this unofficially when he climbed in 47.62 seconds in the 1,100 c.c. ""Freikaiserwagen"", on 27 August 1938.

Second overall at that meeting was Jean-Pierre Wimille in a 4.7-litre supercharged Bugatti, in the first international meeting held at Prescott."
"There is a part of the course at Prescott named for Sydney Allard and known as Allard's Gap, sometimes shortened to Allard's. This resulted from an incident at the Bugatti Owners' Club meeting on 15 June 1947, when Sydney: ""shot through the hedge at the semi-circle and landed well out in the field in the single-seater Allard.<br>"

"TLRC sold Win FM to the Tindle Radio Group in September 2006, and the new owner rebranded the station as Dream 107.2 in October 2007, adopting a soft adult contemporary music policy."
"With extensive competition in the South Hampshire marketplace from numerous regional rivals - including Ocean (now Heart), Wave 105 and Original 106 (now 106 Sam FM) - Dream 107.2 struggled to build an audience, and Tindle Group subsequently decided the station was not viable as a business and should be sold off."
"In November 2008, Tindle Radio Group sold Dream 107.2 to Town & Country Broadcasting, who sought and received permission to largely absorb the Winchester service into their existing Radio Hampshire service at Southampton. The Winchester studios were closed and the 107.2 FM Winchester frequency switched to sharing content with Southampton's service 20 hours a day. A separate local daily breakfast programme for the Winchester licence area was maintained, though this was broadcast from the Southampton base."

The local FM service for Portsmouth went on air on 19 September 1999 as a revived version of Radio Victory; this was acquired soon after launch by The Local Radio Company (TLRC) and later relaunched as 107.4 The Quay (also known as Quay Radio). The Quay broadcast from studios on Twyford Avenue in Portsmouth.
"Portsmouth F.C. subsequently entered into a joint-venture with TLRC to run the station (along with Spirit FM in Chichester and Isle of Wight Radio), with the club taking full control of The Quay when the partnership was dissolved in August 2009 (TLRC retained Spirit FM) and renaming the station Quay Radio."
"In the summer of 2010, Portsmouth F.C. went into administration; Quay Radio was shut down at noon on Friday 30 July 2010 as a result.

It was the brainchild of County Sound CEO, Mike Powell who successfully lobbied the IBA for permission to put separate programming for the Haslemere district on what was originally intended to be a relay transmitter for Guildford's County Sound. The station was launched by County Sound's Terry Mann, formerly Programme Director of Radio 210, Reading."
"After County Sound merged with Radio Mercury to form Allied Radio, Delta Radio was closed down by its new owners in 1992 and the transmitter went back to being a relay. However, when Mike Powell's UKRD Group won the Guildford licence (after it came up for renewal), Delta Radio was relaunched in 1996. Wey Valley Radio had already been operating as a full-time service in nearby Alton and Four Marks since 1992. This station was launched as a ""community"" station by David Way and Paul Mann after years of campaigning for such a licence. David Way and Paul Wisdom are the new Wey Valley Radio licence holders today. It was acquired by UKRD in 1994."
"The decision to merge the two stations operationally was made in 1998 and the Wey Valley service was renamed Delta, and then in 2000, the Haslemere licence (which had previously been a part of the Surrey and North East Hampshire franchise) was merged with the Alton licence to finally form a single radio station."
"On 28 May 2009, Radio Hampshire ceased broadcasting due to Town & Country Broadcasting deciding to sell the station. On 5 June 2009, the two licences for Radio Hampshire in Southampton and Winchester were acquired by internet station Play Radio UK."
"The new station for Southampton and Winchester, named Play Radio, launched on the 107.2 and 107.8 FM frequencies at 10am on 4 July 2009. As under Radio Hampshire, the station operated a split breakfast programme (one for Southampton and one for Winchester), with all other programming shared across the two frequencies."
"In April 2010, the licences were purchased by Celador Radio Broadcasting for an undisclosed sum."
"It was announced on 21 June 2010 that the service would be relaunched as The Breeze 107. The new station would be aimed at upmarket 40- to 59-year-olds and broadcast classic and contemporary easy listening music with a slight female bias. It was also announced that the station would relocate, leaving its longtime base at St. Mary's Stadium to share facilities with sister regional station Jack FM in the Kingsway area of Southampton."
"Celador subsequently sought and received permission from Ofcom to end the split breakfast programme, meaning that as of the Breeze relaunch, listeners in Southampton and Winchester were receiving identical programming at all times."
"The Breeze 107 launched on-air to Southampton and Winchester on 4 July 2010, exactly a year after its predecessor Play Radio had officially replaced Radio Hampshire."
"In late July 2010, following Celador's purchase of the Portsmouth licence, the broadcast area of The Breeze expanded."

"Erta Ale (or Ertale or Irta'ale) is a continuously active basaltic shield volcano in the Afar Region of northeastern Ethiopia. It is situated in the Afar Depression, a badland desert area. Erta Ale is the most active volcano in Ethiopia."
"Erta Ale is high, with one or sometimes two active lava lakes at the summit which occasionally overflow on the south side of the volcano. It is notable for holding the longest-existing lava lake, present since the early years of the twentieth century (1906). Volcanoes with lava lakes are very rare: there are only eight in the world."
"""Erta Ale"" means ""smoking mountain"" in the local Afar language and its southernmost pit is known locally as ""the gateway to Hell"". In 2009, it was mapped by a team from the BBC using three-dimensional laser techniques, in order for the mapping team to maintain a distance and avoid the lakes' searingly hot temperatures."
"Erta Ale is centered over the East African Rift system, which is a triple junction setting whose movements are resulting in the formation of a pull-apart basin or rift. The volcano comprises mainly mafic material which has been brought up to the surface caused by unroofing of the mantle due to this rift formation."
"There was a major eruption on 25 September 2005 which killed 250 head of livestock and forced thousands of nearby residents to flee. There was further lava flow in August 2007, forcing the evacuation of hundreds and leaving two missing. An eruption on 4 November 2008 was reported by scientists at Addis Ababa University. Another eruption was reported in January 2017."
"Not much is known about Erta Ale, and the surrounding terrain is some of the most inhospitable on Earth, making travel difficult and dangerous. The Afar region also experiences intermittent ethnic violence due to unification struggles by the native Afar people. On January 16, 2012, a group of European tourists was attacked at Erta Ale. Five tourists were killed, two taken as hostages and seven others wounded. The Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF) claimed responsibility for the attack and released the two kidnapped tourists in March 2012. One travel guide recommends hiring ""one or maybe two armed guards or police"" as guides to visit Erta Ale. Commercial tour companies offer tours to Erta Ale which are generally accompanied by military escort."
"In December 2017, a German tourist was fatally shot while descending Erta Ale."
"In a Des Moines Register interview Fallon said, “We think it’s very important. We think this is a tool that will help mobilize people to understand the problem and to do more about it…this needs to become the defining issue of this century.” Fallon was inspired in part by another cross-country march, the 1986 Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, for which he coordinated the Iowa logistics. Although this was a national campaign, it was intended to have an international audience and was desired to include participants from multiple nations, as climate change is a global phenomenon."

"Ben Bushwick, a student at Ohio University, marched most of the way. “I’m marching because quite frankly I don’t see any other choice,” Bushwick said. “Atmospheric disruption is a real threat that people do not take seriously and will make mitigation and adaptation efforts a lot more difficult.”"
"Faith Meckley, a student at Ithaca College, says, “I was interested, but only for a three-week walk from Pittsburgh to Washington. ... After thinking about it and talking to my academic advisor at Ithaca, I decided to take the spring semester off and do the walk from Taos, N.M., to Washington. I am committed to this issue. I want to do more than my environmental blog and sign petitions.

"An average day’s walk was expected to be 14–15 miles. Campsites for tents were prearranged. Organizers had hoped to haul all of the gear and supplies via bicycles to minimize energy consumption and maximize sustainability, but after some intensive research this proved infeasible, so trucks running on biodiesel or vegetable oil fuel were used. Research into solar cookers, composting toilets, determined how far the marchers were able to use sustainable methods to handle food and energy needs, and human waste. Participants and volunteers shared daily chores including but not limited to setting up camp, food preparation and clean-up. Interactive workshops focused on climate change, the anthropogenic effect on the environment, and active solutions."
"Throughout history, marches have been associated with political and social change. Examples include but are not limited to: the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913, Gandhi's Salt March to defy Britain's imperial power, Martin Luther King Jr's Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights and the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. Peace walks have been particularly popular in the peace movement."

= = = HMS Calypso (1783) = = =
"HMS ""Calypso"" was a Royal Navy Echo Class ship-sloop. She was built at Deptford between 1781 and 1783, launched on 27 September 1783 and first commissioned on 1 December 1783 for service off Northern Ireland and Scotland. She served in the North Sea, Atlantic, and the West Indies. ""Calypso"" was sunk whilst acting as a convoy escort on 30 July 1803 after colliding with a West Indiaman merchant ship during a violent storm."
"""Calypso"" was built to the same technical drawings as the five other ""Echo""-class ships: , , , , and . The class was designed to be 16-gun ship sloops with quarterdecks and forecastles."
"All use the same plans for frame, Inboard profile, Lines, Stern, and upper and lower decks"
"""Calypso"" was first commissioned in September 1783 under Commander Ralph Dundas for service on the Irish and Scottish stations. She was then refitted at Plymouth and placed in ordinary in October 1785. She was paid off in October 1786."
"Her second commission began in January 1787 under Commander William Mitchell. After fitting for Channel service she sailed for Jamaica on 16 April 1787, returning to home waters in 1790 and once more being placed in ordinary."
"""Calypso"" underwent a period of repair and was refitted at Portsmouth between July 1793 and March 1796. Her third commission began in January 1796 under Commander Andrew Smith, who took her to sea following her repair and refit to join Admiral Duncan's North Sea Fleet."
"In January 1797 Commander Richard Worsley took command and operated ""Calypso"" as a convoy escort and cruiser. Commander C. Collis succeeded Worsley in November 1797. Collis continued operating in this role until April 1798 when ""Calypso"" returned to Portsmouth for refit."
"Commander Henry Garrett took command in April 1799 and was succeeded by Commander Joseph Baker in November of that year. Baker took ""Calypso"" to the Caribbean, sailing for the Leeward Islands in February 1800. Whilst under Baker's command on this station, ""Calypso"" participated in several notable actions."
"In October 1801 Commander Robert Barrie assumed command, followed by Commander Edward Brenton in April 1802, and finally by Commander William Venour in August 1802."
"On 30 July 1803, ""Calypso"" and the 74-gun ""Goliath"" were escorting a convoy of heavily laden West Indiamen from Jamaica. The convoy was caught in a violent storm that dismasted 21 of the vessels. One of the merchantmen ran down ""Calypso"", sinking her with the loss of all hands."
"As an unrated sloop-of-war ""Calypso"" was too small a ship to warrant a Post-captain and was instead commanded by an officer in the rank of Commander, although aboard ship he was afforded the courtesy title of Captain. The commanders of HMS ""Calypso"" were:"
"From 1794 the Admiralty allowed a crew of 121 for a 16-gun sloop such as HMS ""Calypso"". The Commander and Lieutenants were professional sea officers, trained in gunnery, navigation and seamanship in equal measure and appointed to the ship by Admiralty Commission. The Lieutenants were all at least nineteen years of age, having served a minimum six-year apprenticeship as Midshipman or Master's Mate before undertaking and passing the examination for Lieutenant. The Commander would usually have been an experienced Lieutenant who had come to the attention of the Admiralty or his Commander-in-Chief through some distinction in service or by having an influential patron. The Commander's duties were almost identical to those of a Post Captain, although on a smaller scale, the exception being that as a Commander he had no automatic rights of promotion to the flag list and could quite easily remain a Commander for the rest of his career."
"The Warrant Officers were specialists appointed to the ship by Navy Board Warrant. The Wardroom Warrant Officers were allowed all the privileges of a Commissioned Officer, eating and sleeping with the Lieutenants. The Standing Warrant Officers stayed with the ship throughout its commission and remained aboard when the ship was placed in ordinary. They were heavily involved with the fitting out of the ship and general maintenance. Cockpit Officers had a higher status than the Petty Officers and could generally expect to reach the Wardroom in time, with its members aspiring to be Lieutenants, Masters, Pursers or Surgeons. Petty Officers performed particular roles that required additional skills or expertise, and they were usually rated by the Captain or First Lieutenant on joining the ship. Unlike the Warrant Officers, the Petty Officers had no security in his rank; the Captain could demote a Petty Officer for negligence. A Petty Officer could also lose his rating on moving to a new ship."

"Kevin Lamont Hardy (born July 24, 1973) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Dallas Cowboys, and Cincinnati Bengals. He played college football at the University of Illinois."
"Hardy attended William Henry Harrison High School, where he received numerous awards and accolades as a high school football player. As a senior, he posted 127 tackles (47 solo), 2 interceptions, 32 receptions for 610 yards and 13 touchdowns, 55 carries for 410 yards, returned 6 punts for 42 yards and 15 kickoffs for 344 yards. He received All-Evansville, City Player of the Year, All-Southern Indiana and Conference and Region Player of the Year honors."
"He also was a cum laude honor roll student, played basketball and ran track. His basketball teammates included Calbert Cheaney, an All-American at Indiana, Walter McCarty, who played at Kentucky, and Chris Lowery who played at Southern Illinois and is now an assistant coach at Kansas State University."
"Hardy accepted a football scholarship from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. As a redshirt freshman, he was third on the team with 67 tackles. As a sophomore, he started all 11 games and ranked fourth on the team with 78 tackles."
"As a junior, he registered 80 tackles. During his time at Illinois, the Fighting Illini had a number of outstanding linebackers. In the 1994 season, the four linebackers in coach Lou Tepper's 3–4 defense were Hardy, fellow Butkus Award winner Dana Howard, future NFL player John Holecek, and Simeon Rice. Because of this, Hardy was often overlooked as a linebacker. At his position, he was not prolific in accumulating tackles like Howard, or in quarterback sacks as was Rice, who as a ""rush linebacker"" played on the line of scrimmage like a defensive end."
"Hardy was recognized as being among the very best linebackers in college football as a senior, winning the Dick Butkus Award and receiving consensus first-team All-American honors. He started every game at ""drop"" linebacker, finishing with 105 tackles (second on the team), 11 sacks, 15 tackles for loss, 5 forced fumbles and 3 interceptions (tied for the team lead). He had 18 tackles against Michigan State University and 3 sacks against Indiana University."
"Hardy finished his career ranked ninth on the Illinois All-time list with 330 tackles, fourth in sacks with 18, and fourth in tackles for loss with 38. He was a business major and was initiated as a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity."
"Hardy was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the second overall choice in the 1996 NFL Draft, signing a six-year $14.8 million contract with a six million dollar signing bonus. Hardy's fellow linebacker at Illinois, Rice, was selected with the third overall choice. Hardy became the first defensive rookie in franchise history to start on opening day, going on to start 15 games. He recorded 130 tackles (second on the team), 5.5 sacks (third in the NFL among rookies), 7 quarterback hurries, 2 interceptions (tied for the team lead), 7 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and was named to the NFL All-Rookie team."
"In 1997, he was limited with injuries, starting 11 out of 13 games at strongside linebacker. He tallied 73 tackles (3 for loss), 2.5 sacks and 5 quarterback hurries. He suffered a sprained left medial collateral ligament against the Dallas Cowboys, missing 3 contests and seeing limited action in several games the remainder of the season because of the injury. He was able to start the wild card playoff game against the Denver Broncos, collecting 8 tackles."
"In 1998, with the signing of free agent Bryce Paup, he was moved to weakside linebacker and started all 16 games. He had a franchise record 186 tackles, while also making 1.5 sacks, 10 quarterback hurries, 2 interceptions, 7 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery."
"In 1999, Hardy led all AFC linebackers with 10.5 sacks and led the team with 153 tackles. He also had 7 tackles for loss, 24 quarterback hurries, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery, helping the Jaguars achieve a 14-win season. Hardy was selected to the Pro Bowl as well as named to the AP All-Pro first team."
"In 2000, he registered 149 tackles (led the team), 3 sacks, 16 quarterback pressures, 6 tackles for loss, one interception, 5 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries."
"In 2001, he was moved back to strongside linebacker, but injured his knee in the ninth game of the season. At the time he had 98 tackles (second on the team), 5 1/2 sacks (tied for third on the team), 9 quarterback pressures, one interception and 4 passes defensed. It would be his last game with the Jaguars, who eventually moved him to the injured reserve list, due to needing a microfracture surgery which was thought to be career threatening, because in those days not many players fully recovered from this medical procedure. He left as the franchise's All-time tackles leader, after playing six seasons, which included four trips to the NFL playoffs."
"The Dallas Cowboys gambled that he could return from the complex surgery and signed him on April 14, 2002, as an unrestricted free agent, counting $2.5 million in his first year and structuring the rest of the $23 million contract with a $5.025 million option in the second year."
"Hardy recovered from his injury and played for the Cowboys in the 2002 NFL season, finishing the season ranked third on the team in both total (114) and solo tackles(73), while making 2 sacks, 18 quarterback pressures, 8 tackles for loss, 10 passes defensed and 3 forced fumbles. He played outside linebacker, lining up as a defensive end in some passing downs. Because of salary cap issues, he was released on February 27, 2003, in order to avoid a $5.025 million option bonus if the Cowboys retained him."
"On March 6, 2003, he signed a four-year, $14 million USD contract with the Cincinnati Bengals as an unrestricted free agent, to be the Bengals new middle linebacker, after playing outside linebacker in his previous seasons. Hardy was an integral part of the Bengals' defense, starting all 16 games, leading the team in defensive snaps played (1,030 of 1,038 for 99.2%) and was second on the team in tackles (91)."
"In 2004, he was moved to strongside linebacker after the signing of free agent Nate Webster, starting 14 games and making 84 tackles. The Bengals terminated Hardy's contract in a salary-cap move on May 3, 2005."
"Hardy finished his career with 742 tackles (563 solo), 36 sacks, 43.5 tackles for loss, 11 forced fumbles, seven fumble recoveries, 45 pass deflections, five interceptions for 59 yards, and one touchdown in 134 games."
"Hardy currently resides in Jacksonville, Florida. In August 2007, he built his South Beach club venture, Dream Nightclub, centered around a motto that ""reality is overrated."" ""I've been around and entertained people all my life, so I made a business out of it"" said Hardy."

"Cyber Sunday was an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). From 2004 to 2005, the event was known as Taboo Tuesday and was exclusive to the Raw brand."
"During the event's ""Taboo Tuesday"" years, it was the first regularly-scheduled pay-per-view held by the company on a Tuesday since 1991's This Tuesday in Texas, the first regularly-scheduled non-Sunday pay-per-view since the 1994 Survivor Series, and the first non-Sunday pay-per-view of any kind since in 1996. The inaugural event was held in October, and the 2005 event was pushed back to early November. By 2006 the show was moved to a more traditional Sunday night slot—alleviating problems with the taping schedule of ""SmackDown!"" (usually held on Tuesdays)—and renamed Cyber Sunday."
"The most distinctive feature of Cyber Sunday was the ability for fans to vote on certain aspects of every match. The voting typically began in the middle of an episode of ""Raw"" a few weeks beforehand and ended during the pay-per-view, often moments before the match was slated to begin. Because of this, Cyber Sunday was billed as an ""interactive pay-per-view"". For the first four events, voting was made online through WWE.com, with the official tag line for the PPV being """"Log On. Take Over."""" In 2008 however, this was replaced by votes through text messaging but this was only available to United States mobile carriers. However, the match between The Undertaker and The Big Show was made universal, as fans were allowed to vote for the match stipulation on WWE.com."

Anchor stores include Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, JCPenney, Macy's, Sears, and Target."
"In the early 1980s, a proposal for a two-story indoor mall in Poughkeepsie, New York was submitted. Despite much conflict and many protests, the proposal was submitted, and the mall opened on August 1, 1987 as the Poughkeepsie Galleria Mall."
"Upon opening, the mall had five anchor stores: G. Fox & Co., Jordan Marsh, Lechmere, Filene's, and J. C. Penney. Due to underperformance, the Filene's store closed in 1989 and was replaced with Steinbach, which relocated from South Hills Mall next door. Sears also announced plans to relocate from South Hills Plaza at the same time. Steinbach closed in 1995 and became Dick's Sporting Goods and DSW Shoe Warehouse the same year. Filene's returned to the mall in the early 1990s by taking over the defunct G. Fox chain, while Sears ultimately opened at the mall after Jordan Marsh was vacated.

Supported by the local communities of Guam, it is primarily conducted from Andersen Air Force Base and Yokota Air Base, and targets Micronesia."
"The operation was first conducted in 1951. Then, the aircrew of a WB-29 aircraft assigned to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, formerly assigned to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, was flying a mission to the south of Guam over the Micronesian atoll of Kapingamarangi. When they saw the islanders waving to them, the crew quickly gathered some items they had on the plane, placed them in a container with a parachute attached and dropped the cargo as they circled again."
"A witness to the first drop on the island of Agrigan said ""We saw these things come out of the back of the airplane and I was yelling: 'There are toys coming down'"". At the time the island had no electricity or running water, and the islands were periodically hit by typhoons. Some of the first containers failed to arrive where intended, and islanders swam out to retrieve some, while others were discovered months later some miles away."
"Today this unique Christmas tradition is continued with the donations from the residents and businesses of Guam. Each box dropped from a C-130 aircraft weighs nearly and contains items such as fishing nets, construction materials, powdered milk, canned goods, rice, coolers, clothing, shoes, toys and school supplies."
"It is the oldest ongoing Department of Defense mission which remains in full operation, and the longest running humanitarian airlift in the world. By 2006, more than of supplies were delivered. The operation gives troops the chance to practice humanitarian aid drops, as the troops will later be expected to conduct drops over Iraq or Afghanistan after deployment."
"Volunteers from Andersen Air Force Base, including 734th Air Mobility Squadron, and both crew and aircraft from the 36th Airlift Squadron at Yokota Air Base, Japan, participate in the operation. Members of the Guam community also help the operation. Money is raised for the operation by sponsored activities such as golf tournaments and sponsored runs, as well as local businesses sponsoring individual boxes."

= = = John McCabe (composer) = = =
"John McCabe, (21 April 1939 – 13 February 2015) was a British composer and pianist. He created works in many different forms, including symphonies, ballets, and solo works for the piano. He served as principal of the London College of Music from 1983 to 1990. Guy Rickards described him as ""one of Britain's finest composers in the past half-century"" and ""a pianist of formidable gifts and wide-ranging sympathies"" ."
"McCabe was born in Huyton, Liverpool on 21 April 1939 (; ; ; ; ). His father was a physicist . McCabe was badly burned in an accident when he was a child and was home schooled for eight years . During this time, McCabe said that there was ""a lot of music in the house"", which inspired his future career . He explained ""My mother was a very good amateur violinist and there were records and printed music everywhere. I thought that if all these guys – Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert – can do it, then so can I!"" . By the age of 11 McCabe had composed 13 symphonies, but he later suppressed them, believing they were not good enough (; ). He subsequently attended Liverpool Institute ."
"After studies at the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern) and in Munich, with composers Humphrey Proctor-Gregg, Thomas Pitfield, Harald Genzmer and others (; ; ), he embarked upon a career as both a composer and a virtuoso pianist (; ). Guy Rickards considers McCabe's early works to have been overlooked because he was perceived as a pianist rather than a composer . One of his early successes was the orchestral song cycle ""Notturni ed Alba"" (1970), based on a set of poems in medieval Latin about the theme of night (; ), which was described in ""Gramophone"" as ""an intoxicating creation, full of tingling atmosphere and slumbering passion"" (quoted in }}). His Concerto for Orchestra (1982) brought him international recognition , but it was not until the 1990s that he came to be viewed primarily as a composer, with the successes of the piano work ""Tenebrae"" (1992–93), which marked the deaths in 1992 of musicians Sir Charles Groves, William Mathias and Stephen Oliver, and was written for Barry Douglas; his Fourth Symphony, ""Of Time and the River"" (1993–94); and his third ballet ""Edward II"" (1995) , which won the 1998 Barclays Theatre Award ."
"He worked in almost every genre, though large-scale forms lie at the heart of his catalogue with seven symphonies, two dozen concertante works and eight ballet scores to his name . His numerous concerti include four for his own instrument, the piano (1966–76), three for one or two violins (1959, 1980, 2003) as well as for viola (1962), harpsichord (1968), oboe d'amore (1972), clarinet (1977), orchestra (1982), trumpet (1987) and flute (1990), and double concertos for viola and cello (1965) and clarinet and oboe (1988). His chamber works include seven string quartets, the third of which (1979) was inspired by the landscape of the Lake District . His solo instrumental music was mainly written for the piano; he composed 13 studies for the instrument, including ""Gaudí"" (1970), inspired by the architect; ""Mosaic"" (1980), inspired by Islamic art; and a series of seven (2000–9) each explicitly drawing inspiration from a different composer (; }. Other significant piano works include the ""Haydn Variations"" (1983), written to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth (; ; )."
"McCabe's style evolved gradually from an initial lyrical constructivism through a serialist phase, with a fascination with repetitive patterns leading to a more complex combination of processes to achieve more subtle forms of continuity . Rickards states that his influences included Vaughan Williams, Britten, Tippett and Karl Amadeus Hartmann , and he was also influenced by non-classical music including rock and jazz ."
He had a long-lasting association with the Presteigne Festival .
"McCabe first became known as a pianist. His repertoire was wide, from pre-classical to modern composers . He specialised in twentieth-century music, particularly by English composers. He gave the UK premiere of John Corigliano's Piano Concerto . Another specialism was the music of Haydn; McCabe's ""definitive"" mid-1970s recording of Haydn's complete piano sonatas was described in ""Gramophone"" as ""one of the great recorded monuments of the keyboard repertoire"" (quoted in ). He recorded several CDs with the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber ."
"From 1965 to 1968 McCabe was pianist‐in‐residence at University College, Cardiff . He served as principal of the London College of Music from 1983 to 1990, where his efforts to enhance the college's profile resulted in its merging with Thames Valley University (; . He also held visiting professorships at the universities of Melbourne, Australia and Cincinnati, USA during the 1990s . Among his notable pupils is Canadian composer Gary Kulesha ."
"McCabe wrote guides to the music of Haydn, Bartók and Rachmaninoff, and a book on contemporary English composer Alan Rawsthorne ."
McCabe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1985 for his services to music (; ; ) He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool .
"In 2014, McCabe won the Classical Music Award at the 59th Ivor Novello Awards ."
"He married Monica Smith, a former head of the Sittingbourne Music Society, in 1974 (; ). In December 2012 McCabe was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He continued to compose music during his treatment (; )."
John McCabe died after a long illness on 13 February 2015 .

A retirement ceremony was held in his office on July 23, 2007, where his family, friends and present and former Supreme Court colleagues honored him for his 42 years of service on the court, longer than any other justice in the history of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Then-Governor Brad Henry read a quote that Lavender had made when he first took office. ""My sole ambition as a member of this court is to study the cases, work hard, and so conduct my personal life as to inspire confidence and earn the trust of the people in this court as an institution. It is my opinion that a strong and independent judiciary composed of men of unimpeachable integrity is an absolute essential to the continuation of our society.”"
"Later, Governor Henry appointed John F. Reif to succeed Justice Lavender."
"Lavender married Maxine Knight on December 22, 1945. The couple had met while both were attending Catoosa High School. Lavender's wife worked as a child development specialist and, after her retirement, as a consultant for blind and visually-impaired students in nearby school districts. They were married until her death on March 5, 2010."
= = = Kirana gharana = = =
"Kirana gharana is one of the most prolific Indian classical khyal gharanas, and is concerned foremost with perfect intonation of notes (swara)."
"The central concern of the Kirana style is swara, or individual notes, in particular precise tuning and expression of notes. In the Kirana Gayaki (singing style), the individual notes (swaras) of the raga are considered not just random points in the scale but independent realms of music capable of horizontal expansion. Highly emotional ""pukars"" in the higher octaves form a part of the musical experience. Another unique feature of this gharana is the highly intricate and ornate use of the ""sargam taan"" (weaving patterns with the notations themselves) introduced by Abdul Karim Khan under influence from the Carnatic classical style."
In the late nineteenth century Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan revolutionized the khayal gayaki by introducing the vilambit (a slow tempo section) to delineate the structure of the raga note by note.
"Frequently performed ragas by musicians of the gharana include Todi, Lalit, Multani, Patdeep, Puriya, Marwa, Shuddha Kalyan, Darbari Kanhara, and Komal-Rishabh Asavari. Noted Marathi thespian PuLa Deshpande has pointed out that performers from the Kirana gharana are particularly fond of the Komal Re/Rishabh (or minor second in the western system) note of the classical music scale, a frequent feature of these commonly performed ragas."
"In the 19th-century the Kirana gharana coalesced around Miyan Bande Ali Khan, a player of the rudra veena. The gharana's style was further developed, and established as one of the prominent styles in modern Indian classical music in the late 19th / early 20th centuries by the musicians Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was an extremely popular musician, and was thus highly influential in popularizing the gharana. Some trace the gharana's roots back farther to the 13th-century musician Gopal Nayak, a Hindu musician (of the dhrupad style) who later converted to Islamic Sufism and in the process assimilated the predominantly Muslim khyal musical style."
"The name of this school of music derives from Kirana or Kairana, a town and tehsil of Shamli District in Uttar Pradesh. It is the birthplace of Abdul Karim Khan (1872–1937), who was one of the most important musicians of this gharana and of Hindustani music in general in the twentieth century. A frequent visitor to the Court of Mysore, Abdul Karim Khan was also influenced by Carnatic music, and roots of the tradition can also be traced back to his great-grandfather Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula, the brother of Ghulam Ali."
"Owing to the popularity of Abdul Karim Khan, most contemporary Hindustani musicians from Karnataka are exponents of Kirana gharana, and Kirana gharana in turn has absorbed many of the features of the Carnatic tradition. The culturally rich border region between Karnataka and Maharashtra is particularly well known for its association with the gharana."
"The other primary master of the gharana, in the early 20th century, was Abdul Karim Khan's cousin Abdul Wahid Khan who chose to settle at Lahore, Pakistan after the 1947 Partition of British India."
= = = James Robinson Graves = = =
"James Robinson Graves (April 10, 1820 – June 26, 1893) was an American Baptist preacher, publisher, evangelist, debater, author, and editor. He is most noted as the original founder of what is now the Southwestern family of companies. Graves was born in Chester, Vermont, the son of Z. C. Graves, and died in Memphis, Tennessee. His remains are interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis."
"In 1855, Graves established Southwestern Publishing House in Nashville, Tennessee. The company's name was chosen because, at that time, Nashville was in the southwestern part of the United States. Southwestern originally published ""The Tennessee Baptist"", a Southern Baptist newspaper, and religious booklets which were sold by mail for 20¢ and 30¢ each."
"Prior to the Civil War, most Bibles were printed in the North, rather than the Confederacy. Graves acquired stereotype plates from the North and began printing Bibles for sale in August 1861. He also produced and sold educational books. After the 1864 Battle of Nashville resulted in a Union victory, Graves relocated to Memphis, as he felt vulnerable because of articles he had published against the North. The company resumed publishing in 1867."
"In 1868, Graves discontinued the company’s mail order business, and began training young men as independent dealers to sell Bibles and educational books door-to-door as a way to earn money for college. Graves retired in 1871."
"Though raised in a Congregationalist family, Graves joined a Baptist church at age 15. Contemporary fellow ministers in the Southern Baptist Convention praised his preaching abilities. Thomas Treadwell Eaton wrote, ""We have seen him hold a congregation packed uncomfortably, for three hours and a half without any sign of weariness on their part. This was not done once or twice, but scores of times."" Denominational leader James Bruton Gambrell described one of Graves' sermons at a small church in Mississippi as ""The Greatest Sermon I Ever Heard."" Scholars have recognized Graves as an early and chief promulgator of the Landmark movement. The subject's Nashville publishing house, Graves, Marks, & Co, which later became South-Western Publishing, published all of fellow 'Landmarker' Amos Cooper Dayton's books. Both were expelled as 'schismatics' between 1858 and 1859 from the Nashville First Baptist Church due to their theological perspectives on their apostolic connection."

= = = Half-pass = = =
"The half-pass is a lateral movement seen in dressage, in which the horse moves forward and sideways at the same time. Unlike the easier leg-yield, the horse is bent in the direction of travel, slightly around the rider's inside leg. The outside hind and forelegs should cross over the inside legs, with the horse's body parallel to the arena wall and his forehand leading. The horse should remain forward, balanced, and bent, moving with cadence. The inside hind leg remains engaged throughout the half-pass, and the horse should not lose its rhythm."
"The half-pass is a variation of haunches-in (travers), executed on a diagonal line instead of along the wall. At higher levels it is used to perform a counter-change of hand, combining more than two half-passes with changes of direction in a zig-zag pattern."
"John Francis Donoghue (August 9, 1928 – November 11, 2011) served as the second Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte and then as the fifth Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Atlanta in the United States of America."
"Donoghue was born and raised in Washington, D.C., the second of four brothers born to Irish immigrant parents, Daniel and Rose (née Ryan) Donoghue. On June 4, 1955, after receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and a graduate degree in Sacred Theology from St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore, Maryland and Roland Park, Maryland, and after ordination to the transitional diaconate, he was ordained to the priesthood for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, by the then-Archbishop of Washington, Patrick O'Boyle, who was later a Cardinal."
"While originally planning to remain a parish priest, Donoghue was asked in 1964 to study for a Licentiate in Canon Law, and was then assigned to the Archbishop of Washington's Office (he did serve in a variety of parish assignments)."
"For the next 18 years, he served on the staff under three successive Cardinals, all now deceased, who were Archbishops of Washington: Cardinals Patrick O'Boyle, William Wakefield Baum, and James Aloysius Hickey. From 1972 until 1983, he also filled the offices of Chancellor and Vicar General for that Archdiocese; in 1984 he also became Moderator of the Archdiocesan Curia, serving in that capacity until his episcopal consecration. He was consecrated and installed as a Bishop on December 18, 1984, following his appointment by Pope John Paul II, as the second Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte."
"In June 1993, he was appointed as the sixth Metropolitan Archbishop of Atlanta, Georgia by John Paul II, replacing the Most Reverend James P. Lyke, O.F.M., who had died of cancer on December 27, 1992, after only two years in office. He led the Archdiocese for over ten years. Donoghue retired as Archbishop on December 9, 2004, and was succeeded by Wilton D. Gregory, who had served as an Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago."
"Donoghue died, on November 11, 2011, aged 83. His body lay in state at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus until his Funeral Mass at 11:00 AM on November 17 at the Cathedral of Christ the King."
"Donoghue's episcopal motto was: """"To Live In Christ Jesus""""."
= = = Bubba Wells = = =
"Charles Richard ""Bubba"" Wells (born July 26, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player, playing mostly for minor leagues. He played collegiately for Austin Peay State University and was named 1997 Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year. Selected 34th by the Mavs in the 1997 NBA draft, the little-used small forward's NBA career was short-lived, consisting of just 39 games of the 1997–98 season. However, he did start two games in March 1998, in place of the injured Cedric Ceballos. His brief NBA career did feature one memorable game where he set the record for the shortest amount of playing time (less than 3 minutes) before fouling out, as part of a failed strategy to intentionally foul Dennis Rodman (a notoriously bad free throw shooter) to limit his scoring."
"His NBA career came to an abrupt end in 1998, after he was traded to the Phoenix Suns along with Martin Müürsepp, the draft rights to Pat Garrity, and a future first-round draft pick in exchange for point guard Steve Nash. Wells never played a game for the Suns. He was later traded to the Chicago Bulls, also for whom he never played. He later played for the LaCrosse Bobcats of the CBA, the Oklahoma Storm of USBL, the Memphis Houn'Dawgs of the ABA, and overseas in Greece and the Philippines. He played for the Harlem Globetrotters in 2004–05. From June 2005 through May 2015, Wells was an assistant men's basketball coach at Austin Peay."
"On May 28, 2015, his appointment to the staff of Jon Harris at SIU Edwardsville was announced."
"Bubba Wells holds the dubious distinction of being the player with the quickest disqualification due to personal fouls in an NBA regular season game. In a December 29, 1997 game against the Chicago Bulls, then-Mavericks coach Don Nelson employed a desperate tactic to limit the Bulls' offense. He inserted Wells into the game with the express purpose of fouling power forward Dennis Rodman, a notoriously poor free throw shooter, away from the ball."
"The plan failed, however, when Rodman hit 9-of-12 free throws and Chicago went on to win the game 111–105. Wells fouled out late in the third quarter after registering his sixth personal foul in a total of three minutes' playing time. This strategy of intentionally fouling a bad free throw shooter is sometimes called Hack-a-Shaq, since it was later famously used against Shaquille O'Neal."
"The previous record-holder was Dick Farley of the Syracuse Nationals who was disqualified in five minutes on March 12, 1956."
"In August 2007, Wells married Tracee Jones, the former head women's basketball coach at Tennessee State University. The previous summer Wells served as a supporter to Jones on NBC TV game show, ""Deal or No Deal"". Wells has a daughter, Alyiah, and a son, Chase."
= = = Muttart Conservatory = = =
"The Muttart Conservatory is a botanical garden located in the North Saskatchewan river valley, across from the downtown core in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. One of the best-known landmarks of Edmonton, the conservatory consists of three city-operated greenhouses, public gardens, as well as four feature pyramids for display of plant species found across three biomes, with the fourth pyramid hosting as a seasonal display. A fifth minor skylight pyramid lights up the central foyer."
"A donation from the Gladys and Merrill Muttart Foundation provided momentum for the conservatory's construction, with the remaining funding supplied by the Province of Alberta and the City of Edmonton. The conservatory is staffed and operated by the Edmonton Parks and Recreation Department."
"The conservatory's unusual structure, designed by architect Peter Hemingway, is composed of four glassed pyramids built around a central service core. The two larger pyramids are in area, and the two medium-sized ones are in size. Three of the pyramids are devoted to displays of plants from the tropical, temperate, and arid regions respectively, the fourth being used for shows that change with the seasons and which feature massed displays of ornamental flowering plants."
"The Temperate pyramid houses plants typical of temperate climates, from such zones as the southern Great Lakes, Australia, and even the mountainous areas of Asia. Near the entrance and fed by a stream is a bog area, with white water lilies and parrot's feather. The bog merges into a woodland with mostly eastern deciduous trees and low shrubs but including redwoods, cedars and pampas grass. Eucalyptus trees and flowering shrubs complement the Australian section. In the woodland floor and alpine section are many tiny flowering plants, some native to Alberta and others from all over the world. Carefully controlled environmental conditions allow the plants to go dormant in winter and burst into spring growth of green leaves and colourful blooms."
"The plants from the Arid pyramid come from hot and cold dry areas spanning five continents. They share an ability to thrive in environments with dry air, irregular moisture and wide day/night temperature fluctuations. In spring 2013, the Arid Pyramid featured an Agave Americana plant bloom which reached a height of 30 feet before reaching the top of the pyramid. This plant was planted a year after the Muttart Conservatory first opened."
"The Tropical pyramid provides an enormous diversity of species; under a canopy of tall palms, banana and weeping fig are orchids, various hibiscus and the bird of paradise. The plants come from tropical rainforests, evergreen forests or grasslands, and are often showy and bright. A waterfall cascades into the centre of the pyramid where small fish and water lilies make their home. This pyramid has also been home in the past to a kiwi bird and a sloth. On March 11, 2013, the bud to an imported Amorphophallus titanum plant (commonly known as the corpse flower) budded and bloomed here on April 22."
"The ""Feature pyramid"" offers seasonal displays that change several times per year, focusing on themed displays and seasonal celebrations."
"Other amenities at the facility are an outdoor gazebo, gift shop, and the Culina Muttart Café. The café serves several menu items made with locally-sourced ingredients, including herbs and salad greens grown on-site at the greenhouse."
"The facility, owned and operated by the City of Edmonton, is also a popular site for special events, such as weddings. The conservatory underwent a $6.3 million renovation that was completed in June 2009."

"The waving of the hand is a nonverbal gesture that has an unclear origin but is said to have dated back to as far as the 18th century however, it was not called waving and was not used as saying ""hello"", or ""goodbye."" The original gesture of waving was saluting. In the 18th century, knights removed the guard of their helmets to show their identity, following with a salute to show they come in peace; saluting is also used to show others that they are not armed with weapons and do not pose a threat. The action of saluting was formalised only in the 1780s by European armies, and since then, it has become a common way of properly addressing one another in the military setting. There is also an alternate ASL origin. In the 1800s, waving handkerchiefs was a way to show approval or excitement or to call attention for the deaf, and the Romans, which is known as the ""Chautauqua salute."" It is recorded during a Canadian event in 1884 that multiple attendees forgot their handkerchief and so waved their hands in the air as a way to clap during the event.. In modern days, the accepted and common way for a deaf individual to applaud is raising hands in the air and simultaneously shaking their open hand and moving their fingers back and forth."
"Waving ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" to the deaf requires a different protocol and has an alternate meaning than the standard, one action waving gesture that means both ""hello"" or ""goodbye."" For an ASL user or a deaf individual, saying ""goodbye"" is done by repeatedly opening and closing the right hand, and it faces the receiver of the gesture. This method is used to say ""goodbye"" to a group of people; saying ""goodbye"" to an individual is done with a different method. Saying ""hello"" is done by the traditional waving of the right hand. This method is used to say ""hello"" to a group of people, likewise with implying ""goodbye"", there is a different method to say ""hello"" to an individual."
"The waving of the hand has multiple variables and styles of performing the gesture. The common waving of the hand to mean ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" is done by moving the hand side to side, but there are more than one form of waving, each form having its own meaning."
"Waving has four variables: the open palm (is the palm curved or straight), the angle of the wave (big waves or short waves), the elevation of the hand (above the head or held low), and the movement pattern of the wave (sideways rotation, up and down motion, side to side motion)."
"There are different ways to wave the hand; some include the standard side-to-side wave, palm wide wave, wiggly wave (finger wiggle wave), ""flirtatious"" wave, open-and close finger wave, arm wave, and the ""Miss America"" wave."
"People wave by raising their hand and moving it from side to side. Another common wave is to raise one's hand and repeatedly move the fingers downward toward the palm. A variant known as the wiggly wave consists of holding the hand near shoulder level and wiggling the fingers randomly. This can be used to appear cute or flirtatious to the target of the wave. The gesture can be used to attract attention at a distance. Most commonly, though, the gesture means quite simply ""hello"" or ""goodbye"
"The royal wave, also known as a regal wave, pageant wave, parade wave, or Miss America wave, is a similar but distinct kind of hand waving gesture in which a person executes something alternatively described as either a 'plastic grin' with 'fingers cupped' and 'forearm swaying side-to-side' or a ""vertical hand with a slight twist from the wrist"". The gesture is often performed, to various degrees, by different members of the British royal family, signaling anything from regality, class and control to elegance, restraint and character."
"In American culture, waving is a known gesture that means ""hello"" or ""goodbye"". That gesture can also be used to call the attention of someone, for example waving down a taxi, or waving at a friend from a great distance. That gesture can may be interpreted differently and have a different meaning or even be highly offensive in South Korea, Europe, Nigeria, Greece, Bulgaria, Latin American countries, India, Japan, and other places.<ref name=""book/web ref""></ref>"
"In Nigeria, waving the hand with the palm facing outward in front of someone's face is highly offensive and should be avoided."
"In China, women greet other women by waving."
"In Japan, hand waving while the palm is kept outward and near the face is a gesture used to display confusion or that the individual waving does not know or understand."
"In South Korea, it is inappropriate to call the attention of someone with a palm-up arm wave. Instead, the proper way to wave to someone or call for attention is to wave vertically, making sure the palm of the hand is in a downward position. It is not uncommon to see waving among the younger population (in South Korea) to display their departure rather than bowing, which is the traditional way of greeting one another. Waving the hand outward towards the face is also used to grab the attention of a pet or child."
"In Europe, there are two different common forms of waving: the palm-show and the palm-hide. The palm-show is dominant across most of Europe, but Italy predominantly uses the palm-hide wave."
"Waving the hand to say ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" is done by moving the fingers down towards the wrist and back to an open palm position while keeping the palm facing out. Another way to say ""goodbye"" is done by wagging the fingers. That motion (wagging fingers) is also used to say ""no."""
"In Greece, waving the hand with the palm facing out is an insult, rather than a greeting."
"Holding the hand out, palm facing out and all five fingers exposed is offensive and dates back to the Byzantine times, when ""moutza"" would involve prisoners' faces being tainted with charcoal by their own hands and being forced to parade down town streets, ""moutza"". In American culture, holding the hand out like that can be used to call someone's attention or to greet someone."
"In Ireland, the deaf use the hand wave to greet one another. Deaf women use an ""open palms up half moon shape"" type of wave to greet one another. Men, however, use a different way of greeting one another or women."
"In Latin American countries, people greet one another by kissing, hugging or shaking hands. Waving their hand is uncommon, but it neither has any negative representation nor causes offense."
"In Nicaragua, waving to someone is tolerated but does not display proper etiquette. Instead, it is common to hug, kiss, or shake hands, following with the proper time of day (""good morning,"" ""good afternoon,"" or ""good evening"")."

= = = Women's rugby union = = =
"Women's rugby union is a sport identical to men's rugby union with the same rules, same sized pitch, and same equipment. However, it has a history which is significantly different, due to various social pressures, and the self-image of rugby union in general. As a result, this history has been largely hidden until comparatively recently, although the game is gaining a higher profile thanks to international tournaments and financial investment."
"The secretive nature of the early years of women's sport—and especially rugby union—ensures that we do not really know where it began. Public reaction to women playing contact sports could be disrespectful, or even violent. In 1881, when two teams played a number of exhibition ""football"" games in Scotland and northern England, several games had to be abandoned due to rioting in or around the grounds."
"While most of these games appear to have been played to the new Association Football rules, it is clear from reports in the ""Liverpool Mercury"" of 27 June 1881 that at least one of these games, played at the Cattle Market Inn Athletic Grounds, Stanley, Liverpool on the 25th, involved scoring goals following ""touchdowns"" and may therefore have been played to at least a version of rugby rules."
"Whether this was the case is unknown. However, a series of sporting cigarette cards, published 1895 in the Liverpool, includes an image of a woman apparently playing what looks like rugby in kit very similar to that described in reports of the 1881 team (see left). It is therefore possible that these ""exhibition"" games similar to those in 1881 may have continued (with no press reporting) or the pictures may have been reprints for earlier illustrations inspired by the 1881 games, or they may just be an ""amusing"" cartoon or an illustration of a sport that was not actually being played. Again no further details are available."
Other than this the official record is silent for most of the nineteenth century. Some girls played the game unofficially as part of their school teams—and the earliest confirmed record of any female definitely playing rugby at any level anywhere in the world comes from a school game.
"This happened at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Emily Valentine's brothers were responsible for the formation of the school's first rugby team in c1884. Emily practised with the team and in c1887 she played for the school, scoring a try."
The first documented evidence of an attempt to form a purely women's team is from 1891 when a tour of New Zealand by a team of female rugby players was cancelled due to a public outcry.
There are also early reports of women's rugby union being played in France (1903) and England (1913) but in both cases the game was largely behind closed doors.
"During the First World War some women's charity games were organised, the most well documented taking place at Cardiff Arms Park on 16 December 1917, when Cardiff Ladies beat Newport Ladies 6–0. Maria Eley played full-back for Cardiff and went on to become probably the oldest women's rugby player before she died in Cardiff in 2007 at the age of 106. The Cardiff team (who all worked for Hancocks a local brewery) all wore protective headgear, which predates their male counterparts by some decades."
"In Sydney in 1921, two women's teams played a game of rugby league in front a crowd of 30,000—a photograph appeared in ""The Times"" in 1922—but pressure from authorities ensured that they did not play again. Throughout the 1920s a popular form of women's football game very similar to rugby called ""barette"" was played across France. The game had only minor differences to the full game (games were 10-a-side and had some minor restrictions on tackling) and there were national championships throughout the decade. It received support from several male rugby players and film also exists of a game being played in 1928. Both barette and the full game of rugby featured in several newspaper cartoons and many photographs exist. For reasons unknown the game appears to fade away in the 1930s."
"In 1930 a women's league playing the full game was formed in Australia, in the New South Wales areas of Tamworth and Armidale, which ran until halted by World War Two. Photographs of women's teams also exist from New Zealand from the same period and during the war Maori women took up the game. After the war in 1956 The ""Belles of St Mary’s""—an Australian women's rugby league team—played games in New South Wales—but even as late as the 1960s Women's rugby was banned in Samoa."
"The 1960s was the decade in which the game finally began to put down roots, initially in the universities of Western Europe. In 1962 the first recorded UK women's rugby union team appears at Edinburgh University, in 1963 female students participate in matches against male students in London, and in 1965 university sides are being formed in France."
"As the pioneering students left university an adult game began to evolve. Initially (1966) this tended to be confined to charity matches between male and female teams (especially at Worthing RFC, England), though the UK's ""Daily Herald"" newspaper includes photographs of girls' teams training in Thornhill, near Dewsbury in Yorkshire in 1965, and at Tadley in Hampshire in 1966—and appealing for fixtures. It is not recorded whether these teams did arrange any games, and so it is not until 1 May 1968 that the first fully documented and recorded women's club match takes place, in France, at Toulouse Fémina Sports in front of ""thousands of spectators"". The success of the event lead to the formation of the first national association for women's rugby union—the ""Association Francaise de Rugby Feminin"" (AFRF) at Toulouse, in 1970."
"1970 also saw the first reports of women's rugby union in Canada, and by 1972 four universities in the United States were playing the game: University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the University of Illinois and the University of Missouri. By 1975 university students at Wageningen in the Netherlands were playing, and in the same year clubs appeared in Spain (Arquitectura in Madrid and Osas in Barcelona). The first non-university clubs formed in 1978 in Canada and Netherlands, and in Italy (Milan) a year later."
"By 1980 there were club championships in the United States and Sweden, and provincial championships in New Zealand. The game first appeared in Japan in 1981 and in February 1982 University College, London's women's team went on a tour to France playing, amongst other teams, Pontoise—the first recorded overseas tour by a UK team (and possibly the first international tour by any team). A few months later on 13 June 1982 the first women's international—Netherlands 0, France 4—took place at Utrecht (see Women's international rugby union for more details on the history of the international game)."
"In the UK 1983 saw the Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU) formed to govern the game across the British Isles. Founder member clubs are: Leicester Polytechnic, Sheffield University, University College London, University of Keele, Warwick University, Imperial College, Leeds University, Magor Maidens, York University and Loughborough University."
"The game began to be organised on a more formal basis elsewhere, including:"

= = = The Impossible Voyage = = =
"The Impossible Voyage (), originally released in the US as An Impossible Voyage and in the UK as Whirling the Worlds, is a 1904 French silent film directed by Georges Méliès. Based in part on Jules Verne's play ""Journey Through the Impossible"" and modeled in style and format on Méliès's earlier, highly successful ""A Trip to the Moon"", the film is a satire of scientific exploration in which a group of geographers attempt a journey into the interior of the sun."
"Since the film is silent and has no intertitles, the proper names and quotations below are taken from the English-language description of the film published by Méliès in the catalog of the Star Film Company's New York Branch."
"A geographic society called the Institute of Incoherent Geography plans to make a world tour in such a way as to ""surpass in conception and invention all previous expeditions undertaken by the learned world."" At a meeting headed by President Polehunter, ""assisted by Secretary Rattlebrain, by the Archivist Mole, by the Vice-president Humbug, the members of the office, Easily-fooled, Daredevil, Schemer, etc., etc.,"" the members listen to Professor Daredevil's plan for the world tour, but reject it for being out-of-date. The president then welcomes the eccentric engineer Crazyloff (in French, Mabouloff; ""maboul"" is French for ""crazy"" or ""crackpot""), who explains his project for a new ""impossible"" voyage, using ""all the known means locomotion—railroads, automobiles, dirigible balloons, submarine boats…"" The unusual plan is accepted enthusiastically, and preparations begin."
"When work is complete, the machines and travelers are loaded onto a train and are sent to the Swiss Alps, where the travelers will begin their journey. The first board an automobile, the Auto-Crazyloff, and journey through the mountains. In an attempt to run over the summit of the Rigi, the travelers crash at the bottom of a precipice. They are saved by mountaineers and rushed to a Swiss hospital."
"After they have recovered, they board a train with their vehicles, and make a second attempt at running over a summit: this time, the Jungfrau. Getting higher and higher every minute, with dirigible balloons attached to the train, they rise into space and are swallowed by the Sun. The travelers land with a crash. They are happy to be alive, but the heat is too much. All but one of the travelers are loaded into an icebox but are suddenly frozen. The remaining traveler, Crazyloff himself, finds a bundle of straw among the debris and starts a fire to melt the ice. The travelers thaw and are happily moved over to the expedition's submarine, which is launched off a cliff on the Sun, plummets through space, and falls into an ocean on Earth."
"After a few minutes of underwater travel, a boiler problem causes the submarine to explode. The travelers are thrown up into the air, landing safely at a seaport amid the wreckage of the submarine. They return in triumph to the Institute of Incoherent Geography, where a grand rejoicing is held for them."
"An optional 50-meter-long epilogue, ""Supplément ""Voyage à travers l'impossible"""" (advertised in the US as ""Supplementary Section of the ""Impossible Voyage""""), was sold separately. The epilogue begins in Crazyloff's study, where he is criticized by the Institute of Incoherent Geography for losing so much transportation equipment during the voyage. At the top of the Institute's tower, he presents his plan for recovering the equipment: a powerful magnet able to attract the automobile lost in Switzerland, the train that was eaten by the Sun, and the submarine destroyed at sea. The plan is a success and is celebrated at a banquet where Crazyloff is applauded by his scientific colleagues."
"The supplementary section was believed lost until the 1970s when the Méliès scholar John Frazer discovered and examined it in the archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences among surviving negatives from Star Film's New York offices. However, a 2008 Méliès filmography by Jacques Malthête lists the supplement as lost."
"""The Impossible Voyage"" was made during the summer of 1904. The film, running to 374 meters, was Méliès's longest film to date, and cost about 37,500 (7,500) to make. In its staging and design, the film is symmetrical with Méliès's ""A Trip to the Moon"": while the astronomers' progress toward the moon in that film is consistently depicted as left-to-right motion, the Institute of Incoherent Geography's progress toward the sun in ""The Impossible Voyage"" is consistently right-to-left. While most of the film was shot inside Méliès's glass studio, the scene at the foot of the Jungfrau was filmed outdoors, in the garden of Méliès's property in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis."
"A print of the film (though not the supplemental epilogue) was deposited for American copyright at the Library of Congress on October 12, 1904, and the film was sold in French, American, and British catalogs by the Star Film Company. As with at least 4% of Méliès's entire output (including such films as ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""The Rajah's Dream"", ""The Kingdom of the Fairies"", and ""The Barber of Seville""), some prints were individually hand-colored and sold at a higher price."
"Garde Church (, sometimes also Garda Church) is a medieval church in Garde on the Swedish island of Gotland. Built in stages during the Middle Ages, it retains much of its medieval character. It contains medieval frescos, some of which were probably executed by artists from present-day Russia. It lies in the Diocese of Visby."
"The remains of an early stave church were discovered at the site of the presently visible church during an excavation in 1968. In the vicinity, Christian graves from the Viking Age have also been discovered, still containing the clothes of the deceased. A number of picture stones, pre-dating Christian times, have also been uncovered in the church, where they were used by the earliest builders as building material."
"The first stone church was begun in the 1130s, remains of which are still preserved in the nave of the church, including a few still usable, carved stone benches, and the base of the tower. The tower was heightened during the 13th century to its present altitude. The choir is the most recent part of the church. It is from the second quarter of the 14th century and replaced an earlier, Romanesque choir with an apse. The construction of the new choir was planned as the first step in a major rebuilding scheme; however for one reason or another, the builders seem to have run out of funds and the rest of the plans were never executed - hence the somewhat unusual shape of the church. A similar fate is not uncommon for churches on Gotland, as the region suffered an economic downturn at the end of the Middle Ages."
"The church retains much of the ambience of the earliest churches on Gotland: it is rather dark, the windows are small, the ceiling is flat and wooden, and the portals narrow."
"One of the most distinguishing features of the interior are a number of wall paintings or frescos. They depict two saints and were probably executed by a Russian artist (possibly from Staraja Ladoga) as they are Russo-Byzantine in style. The church also has a baptismal font made by the anonymous sculptor Byzantios sometime during the middle of the 12th century, and a triumphal cross made in the 13th century. The altarpiece is Baroque in style, and locally crafted."

= = = La Haine (drama) = = =
"La Haine ""(Hatred)"" is a drama in five acts and eight tableaux by Victorien Sardou, premiered at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in Paris on 3 December 1874. Jacques Offenbach, director of the theatre, composed extensive incidental music for chorus and orchestra to accompany the play."
"Offenbach had composed songs and incidental music for eleven classical and modern dramas for the Comédie Française in the early 1850s, gaining valuable experience in writing for the theatre. Sardou and Offenbach created their first joint work in 1872 with the opéra-bouffe-féerie ""Le Roi Carotte"", which ran for 195 performances, and this encouraged the two to renew their collaboration."
"By 1874, Jacques Offenbach had become the director of the Théâtre de la Gaîté. To follow a revival of ""Orphée aux Enfers"" on 7 February, he decided to mount Sardou's drame using the under-used theatrical troupe at the theatre."
"""Orphée aux Enfers"" closed on the 18 November to allow the rehearsals for ""La Haine"" to start, directed by Sardou himself who did not spare his efforts. ""Le Figaro"" reported that ""Sardou is the most meticulous director in the world"" and that he ""places particular importance on the extras being actively involved as much as any of the actors."" Rehearsals increased and the dress rehearsal took place on 27 November."
"The premiere was announced for the 29 November, but was postponed on the day itself, due to the flu epidemic in the capital which indisposed two principal actors, Lafontaine et Clément Just. First of all it was postponed until 30 November but only took place on Thursday 3 December, but as the actors had not completely recovered, Sardou cut the final scene."
"The premiere audience marvelled at the magnificence of the production. The scenery was especially dazzling. Francisque Sarcey noted ""It is only right to recognize that, of the décors, several are masterpieces of exquisite taste; the cathedral dome is a marvel of lightness and grave; the inside of the church is superb."""
"Everything was done to dazzle : dramatist and composer went so far as to transport a Cavaillé-Coll organ into the theatre. The settings were grand and impressive: the stage accommodated 535 persons.: ""The war-cries of the soldiers, the moans of the terrified women, the clanking of armour, the booming of guns, the conquerors' entrance in the city, the sacking of the palace, all was of an exact and admirable motion."""
"The words of Victorien Sardou were also noted, but critics commented that the direction was rather against the drama. Francisque Sarcey regretted that the principal roles appeared crushed : ""The supernumeraries and props are too prominent. The crowd is the principal character. Tableaux follow tableaux, and in this new work, they are equally dark."""
"For Auguste Vitu the play evoked painful memories of 1870 : ""Streets full of bodies, palaces in flames, the homeland forsaken in the presence of the dumbfounded foreigner, and as if scandalized by so many distractions, such are the unforgettable sights which our consciousness is still soured, and of which our hearts still bleed. The widows and orphans in black, I have seen them bowed in our churches, the air rent with their sobs. The door of deathly memory re-opens wide within us; and sadness envelops us with its great black wings."""
"While receipts came to around 8,000 francs per performance in mid-December, they fell to around 5,000 francs during the second fortnight On 28 December ""Le Figaro"" printed a letter from Sardou requesting that Offenbach recall his piece from the stage; Offenbach replied that as the public prefer lively art he would bring back ""Orphée"". The announcement had the effect of filling the theatre for the last performances of ""La Haine"". After 27 performances the play closed on 29 December 1874 and ""Orphée aux Enfers"" was brought back. The short run left the theatre in a parlous financial position. Some costumes were used in the revised version of ""Geneviève de Brabant"" which opened on 25 February 1875."
"Despite the failure, Sardou and Offenbach did contemplate a further collaboration on a spectacular production of the playwright's ""Don Quichotte""."
"A modern performance with reduced text but complete score took place on 19 July 2009 at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc Roussillon, with Fanny Ardant and Gérard Depardieu playing Cordelia and Orso. The concert was broadcast on France Musique on 30 July 2009."
Guelph chiefs
In 2006 the autograph orchestral score of the incidental music was found in the archive of the Offenbach family.
Some early sketches preserved in the Archives Historiques de la ville de Cologne were destroyed in an accident on 3 March 2009.
"Jean-Christophe Keck, responsible for the 2009 critical edition, commented that ""Offenbach composed a rich score of 30 numbers. The first sketches were noted down while travelling in his barouche where he had set up a work-table - the manuscripts bear witness to the jumping pen as it rode over Parisian cobbles. It consists of many mélodrames, off-stage choruses, interludes...""."
"During Offenbach's tour of the USA, he conducted with much success the Marche religieuse from ""La Haine"" for American audiences."
"Keck notes that just before he died, Offenbach recalled the opening of the overture to ""La Haine"" in the opening bars of the finale of the Venetian act from ""Contes d'Hoffmann""."
"The action takes place in Siena in 1369. Historically, the Republic of Siena has passed through much civil unrest and political upheavals at that period, and in general Siena tended to be Ghibelline, in opposition to Florence's Guelph position. The play's specific events and its main characters are, however, fictional."
"LSI conducts Quick Counts during General Elections and District Head Elections (Pilkada.) The vast and geographical nature of Indonesia tend to cause delayed announcements of election results—typically, those results can only be known around 2 weeks or even 1 month after the election. Once, people required a significant amount of time in order to finding out the victors of such elections, and this can cause a less than conducive atmosphere on the political situation on areas where those elections are held. Participants of the elections may take numerous visits to the office The General Election Commission (KPU) demanding the results—visits that are often accompanied with violence and demonstration, which in turn will cause a domino effect on the stability of the region (either economically or socially.) These undesirable possibilities of outcomes can be mitigated by using Quick Count: a rapid counting method using scientifically collected results from voting locations (TPS) during elections Done correctly, Quick Count can achieve a result with less than 1% margin of error compared to the official results announced by the General Election Commission (KPU). Through Quick Count, result calculation can be finished very rapidly—at the very least, only 4 hours after the votes are officially collected and counted the results can already be summarized and concluded."
"Since 2005, LSI has conducted hundreds of Quick Counts and made the results available via press conferences and national television channels TV One and Metro TV. The Indonesia Museum of Record (MURI) gifted LSI with various awards such as (1) The Quick Count Accuracy for Sumbawa Election on November 2010 with 0% margin of error when compared to official results. . Before that record, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia has also achieved a record for Quick Count results for the District Head Election on East Tanjung Jabung, Jambi, with only 0.05% difference when compared to the official results (2) The Fastest Announced Accurate Quick Count results (1 hour post voting period ends) on 2009 Presidential Election. This Quick Count was broadcast live by TV One. (3) The first 100 times successively accurate Quick Count results"
"Since 2005, LSI has conducted national surveys to gauge public opinion regarding various public issues/policies, such as democracy, Islam, tolerance and the performance of public institutions."
"Quick Poll is a type of survey introduced by LSI in 2011. Quick Poll results are routinely broadcast by TV One every Mondays and Thursdays Quick Poll displays results on how public view recent, up-to-date cases and issues. Quick Poll is a quick survey of public opinion. The main point of difference is that the interview is not done face to face but rather by utilizing handsets connected to all selected respondents. In order to create a representative group of respondents (representing targeted populations in Indonesia), the Quick Poll is conducted in three steps. The first step is the respondent selection process. In this first step, respondents’ characteristic data will be recorded as comprehensively as possible—from job, income, household expenditure, religion, race, education, and any other relevant information. This data includes not only the selected respondent but also his/her members of family. The second step is to give the selected respondent a handset; for a certain kind of respondent however (for example, those who are illiterate or those living in secluded area with no signal), special treatment will be given. The third step is conducting interviews through the handset—all answers from the respondent will be automatically recorded into the server that has been equipped with automatic data processing function able to computerize all data fed into it."

He contributed to the American Civil Liberties Union's efforts to fight the internment, and after World War II resigned from the Department of Justice to join the ACLU, where he rose up through the organization and eventually served as its president from 1969 to 1976."
"Ennis graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1932, and went on to work for the Department of Justice for fourteen years. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild in the 1930s, but withdrew from the organization, believing it to be under the influence of Communists. He held a variety of positions in the Department of Justice, including as general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, director of the alien enemy control unit, and administrator of foreign travel control. His role made him the administrator of the Japanese American internment. Ennis chose not resign from his role at that time, but he did help American Civil Liberties Union head Roger Baldwin to come up with legal strategies to oppose the internment, and testified at the trial of Gordon Hirabayashi about the Department of War's withholding of evidence relating to Japanese Americans' loyalty to the United States."
"In 1946, Ennis did resign from the Department of Justice, and joined the board of the ACLU himself. He became the ACLU's general counsel in 1955, and was elected chairman of the ACLU in 1969, succeeding Ernest Angell who was retiring after 19 years with the organization. He served as ACLU president until 1976, during which time he called for the resignation of President Richard Nixon and an end to the property tax exemption enjoyed by religious organizations. Notwithstanding the former, he was critical of the zealousness of opposition to Nixon shown by Charles Morgan, Jr. of the ACLU's Washington, D.C. office. He was succeeded as ACLU president by Norman Dorsen. He remained a member of the ACLU executive committee until 1985."

Post several literary meetings and reviewing poetry collections by fellow students, she began working on some of her own pieces. Following school, she studied Siddha medicine and got a bachelor's degree in Siddha medicine and surgery, one of the oldest medical systems in the world that derived from her native Tamil Nadu. She had been pursuing her doctoral research in medical anthropology at the Madras Institute of Development Studies in Chennai. Revathi received the Sigaram 15: Faces of Future award for literature from India Today and was awarded a travel grant in 2005 by the Sahitya Akademi to meet leading litterateurs from India. She is a contemporary Tamil poet and has published numerous controversial poetry collections."
"Works by her are noted to be much women-centric. ""Panikkudam"" the first Tamil feminist magazine by her claimed varied aspects such as family, politics, business, discovery of feminine language, introducing modern play, novels, short stories and poetry created by women writers. Interviews of women writers, introduction to modern poetry and short stories, translations of such works into Tamil from World languages, discussions of the creative process and sangam literature were some of the elements that made the part of the magazine. In the field of poetry, her first release in the year 2000 was ""Poonaiyai Pola Alaiyum Velicham"". Kutti Revathi's second book, ""Mulaigal"" that was published in 2002, evoked a storm of protest and stirred controversies from the conservatives of the Tamil literary establishment. The consequences of release were such that a group of outraged male film lyricists damned the book. The debate extended to parameters of cultural debate: obscene calls, letters and threats ensued, and comments on the author's morality were freely aired. While one lyricist demanded that writers of her types must watch out for dire consequences, the other exhorted the public to burn them on Chennai's Mount Road. However she explained, ""My aim is to explore 'Mulaigal' (breasts) as an 'inhabited' living reality, rather than an 'exhibited' commodity."" Adjoint to the content, an essay titled ""With Words I Weave My Body"", she discussed the ways in which a patriarchal tradition, fearful of sharing the power of the written word, compelled women to imprint narratives on their bodies. Her third release was ""Thanimaiyin Aayiram Irakkaigal"" in 2003."

"The slur ""Oaxaquita"" (""Little Oaxacan"") is sometimes used as a derogatory term that is used by Spanish-speaking Mexican-Americans against Indigenous Mexican-Americans. The term carries the connotation that being from Oaxaca is negative and is often used against any Mexican-American who is short or fat. The slur ""indito"" (""little Indian"") is also used against Indigenous Oaxacans. Indigenous Mexican-Americans have been subjected to ridicule, derision, stereotyping, teasing, bullying, and other forms of discrimination and abuse by non-Indigenous Mexican-Americans. Dynamics of racism and discrimination that exist within Mexico also exist within Mexican-American immigrant communities."

After receiving Czechoslovakian citizenship in 1923, he renounced his British citizenship and later moved to Java."
"Strickland was born in Westminster while the family estate was at Hildenley Hall near Malton, North Yorkshire. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Trinity College, Cambridge.

= = = Saarbahn = = =
"The Saarbahn is a regional Stadtbahn operating on the tram-train principle in the German state of the Saarland. It consists of a core line in Saarbrücken and Riegelsberg operating under tram operating procedures (BOStrab), connected to two lines that are operated under railway operating procedures (EBO), the Lebach–Völklingen railway to the north and the Saarbrücken–Sarreguemines railway in the south. ""Stadtbahn Saar GmbH"" is responsible for the infrastructure of the central section of line, while the outer tracks are operated by the national railway infrastructure companies, DB Netz AG in Germany and Réseau Ferré de France in France. ""Saarbahn GmbH"" is the train operating company for the whole system."
"The route of the new line of the Saarbahn that was opened in central Saarbrücken in 1997 is essentially line 5 of the Saarbrücken tramway, which was closed in 1965. This line ran between Rastpfuhl and Schafbrücke and was the last line of the old metre-gauge network."
", the current network operates on of route, and serves 43 stations."
"The first considerations of building a regional rail network in and around Saarbrücken began in the 1990s. The bus service in central Saarbrücken then ran at such a high density that the vehicles sometimes operated at one-minute intervals. Following the example of the Karlsruhe model, which had operated with great success since 1992, the Saarland began to plan to build a regional Stadtbahn. The core of the concept was the building of an inner-city railway line, while the outer branches would share the existing Deutsche Bahn railway infrastructure. As early as 1992, it borrowed a light rail vehicle from the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn and ran it on the Fürstenhausen–Gersweiler Bahnhof–Saarbrücken Messebahnhof route on the Rossel Valley Railway (""Rosseltalbahn""), south of the Saar."
"Before the opening of the Saarbrücken city centre line, there was a trial operation between Saarbrücken Central Station (""Hauptbahnhof"") and Hanweiler with Saarbahn vehicles. However, as it was still in the Deutsche Bahn timetable, replacing the previously locomotive-hauled trains on this section, it was operated by Deutsche Bahn. This forward operation began on 29 September 1997 and ended on 24 October 1997, the opening day of the new line through the city centre."
"On 24 October 2007, the Saarbrücken Stadtbahn celebrated its tenth train anniversary. Since inception more than 100 million passengers had been carried, almost twice as many as originally planned. Thus, it had become a great success as a model for other cities considering the establishment of a light railway."
"The core of the Saarbahn—the new line between Brebach station and Ludwigstraße—was put into operation on 24 October 1997, after just under two and a half years of construction. Since its opening, there has been a system separation point between Römerkastell and Brebach station. This is a 90-metre-long non-energised section of the overhead line, which is traversed using momentum, while the vehicle's electric system automatically switches to the other system. Saarbahn railcars coming from central Saarbrücken change from 750 volts DC to 15,000 volts AC and run via Kleinblittersdorf to Sarreguemines, Lorraine. The French section from the border station at Hanweiler has been equipped with the German electric system since 1983. The first light rail vehicle that reached Saarguemines was two-system railcar 810 of the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG), which ran there on 11 September 1993 during a presentation ride."
"The extension in the northerly direction took place in several stages. It was extended to Cottbuser Platz on 31 July 1999, to Siedlerheim on 13 November 2000, to Riegelsberg Süd on 24 September 2001 and to Walpershofen/Etzenhofen on 26 September 2009. Construction of the Riegelsberg Süd–Walpershofen/Etzenhofen section, required the contribution of additional costs of around €630,000 per year (an amount that was until recently disputed) from the city of Saarbrücken, the municipality of Riegelsberg and indirectly from the Saarland. Clearing work was performed on the former route of the Koller Valley Railway (Lebach–Völklingen railway) through Walpershofen and Dilsburg in January and February 2009, the railway overpass in the center of Walpershofen was renewed in 2009/10 and the reactivation of Heusweiler Markt was largely completed in the summer of 2011. This stretch of track was inaugurated on 30 October 2011."
"Although another system separation point between BOStrab and EEO was instituted at Walpershofen in 2011, the electrical system does not change there because the electric system for the Saarbahn on the Koller Valley Railway also runs at 750 volts DC."
"With the exception of a small section between Riegelsberg-Güchenbach and Walpershofen/Etzenhofen over which the Saarbahn runs in an east-west direction along the Russenweg (L 267), which had never been used by a railway, the Saarbahn follows two very different historical railway lines:"
"From Saarbrücken through the Köllertaler Wald (Köller valley forest) and Riegelsberg to Riegelsberg-Güchenbach, Saarbahn follows the course of the historical Riegelsberg tramway: an interurban tram line from St.Johann/Saarbrücken via Riegelsberg to Heusweiler, which was opened in 1907. The line broadly followed today's federal highway 268, which also continues directly from Güchenbach to Heusweiler. The line served the mines in Heusweiler-Dilsburg and Von der Heydt. The tramway was replaced by trolleybuses in 1953 and was replaced in turn by diesel-powered buses in 1964."
"After the new section between Riegelsberg-Güchenbach and Walpershofen/Etzenhofen, the Saarbahn reaches, at the Walpershofen/Etzenhofen stop, the line of the former Koller Valley Railway, over which it continues north through Walpershofen to its temporary terminus at Heusweiler Markt."
"A extension of the current line, from the current northern terminus, Heusweiler Markt, north to Lebach-Jabach opened for service on 5 October 2014. This extension will expand the Saarbahn line to cover a total of of route."
"Currently the cross-city route is operated as line S1 between Heusweiler Markt and Sarreguemines, with services every 7.5 minutes during the day on the core section between Siedlerheim and Brebach station. Originally, a five-minute interval service was planned for the central area, but this was rejected because it would have led to operational problems. On the sections using rail tracks between Brebach and Kleinblittersdorf and between Heusweiler Markt and Siedlerheim there is a 15-minute interval service and on the Kleinblittersdorf–Sarreguemines section services operate every 30 minutes only in the morning and every 60 minutes at other times."
"In the off peak hour, services operate at 15-minute intervals in the central section, every 30 minutes to Kleinblittersdorf or Siedlerheim and every 60 minutes to Sarreguemines. In the morning peak for professional and school transport and in the afternoon peak, coupled vehicles are used, otherwise single sets are operated. The Saarbahn carries approximately 40,000 passengers daily."
"Currently there are 28 Flexity Link tram-trains in use, which were manufactured by Bombardier in Vienna and Bruges. Six sets were temporarily loaned to Kassel, where they operated trial runs for RegioTram Kassel. From the timetable change in December 2009, three tram-trains were lent to the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe for use on line S9."
"A line is proposed towards Schafbrücke. Another proposal would include an extension via Burbach to Völklingen station, but this plan has been put on hold, as the effects of mining have to be remedied first. Other plans include an extension to the University, to Rotenbühl, to Alt-Saarbrücken, to Forbach and to Eschberg. , no work has been carried out on any of these proposals."

"Goldstein was the first to write a learned commentary specifically on Rebbe Nachman's teachings, giving scholarly legitimacy to the Breslov movement after the death of Reb Noson in 1844. Many of today's English-language translations of Breslover works were only made possible because of the Tcheriner Rav's meticulous research and elucidation."
"He collected and published Noson's eight-volume magnum opus, ""Likutey Halachot"", as well as an expanded version of Noson's ""Likutey Etzot"" (Advice) with additional material from Rebbe Nachman's teachings, under the title, ""Likutey Etzot HaMeshulash"". Altogether, the Tcheriner Rav authored about 20 works, including halakhic responsa. Some were only seen by Breslover Hasidim in manuscript form before they were lost during World War II.

= = = Alameda Terminal = = =
"Alameda Terminal (a.k.a. Alameda Wharf) was a railroad station and ferry wharf at the foot and west of present-day Pacific Avenue and Main Street in Alameda, California, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay with ferry service to San Francisco. It was built in 1864 and operated by the San Francisco and Alameda Railroad. In 1869, it served as the original west coast terminus of the U.S. First Transcontinental Railroad, until the opening of Oakland Pier two months later. The western terminus was inaugurated September 6, 1869, when the first Western Pacific through train from Sacramento reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus completing the first transcontinental railroad to the Pacific coast."
"The Pacific Railroad Act passed by the United States Congress in 1862 authorized construction of the First transcontinental railroad and telegraph line, which included connecting the Central Pacific Railroad in the west with the Union Pacific Railroad in the east. In 1863, the first construction activity took the Central Pacific line eastward from Sacramento. In October 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad assigned all the rights of the Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 to the Western Pacific Railroad for the route between Sacramento and San Jose, including land grants. The plan was that the transcontinental railroad would follow the Western Pacific to San Jose and then connect with the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad (SF&SJ), completed in 1864, to San Francisco."
"By 1866, the Western Pacific had built of track north and east from San Jose, reaching halfway into Niles Canyon, to about Farwell near MilePost33. The Western Pacific used 500 Chinese laborers to grade and construct the rail line into the rugged canyon with its tight curves and narrow banks. Construction was then halted because of disagreements between the railroad’s contractors and its financiers."
"In 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad, a subsidiary of which had acquired the Western Pacific and Oakland Point in 1868, restarted work on the railroad line through Niles Canyon, also using Chinese laborers, and added a new line from the mouth of the canyon northwest towards the city of Oakland and Oakland Point. The new plan was to connect with Oakland with its ferry service to San Francisco. In June 1869, J. H. Strobridge came to Niles (then Vallejo Mills and now part of Fremont) to oversee the construction of the new line heading towards Oakland. In September 1869, a temporary connection was made at the bay side of San Leandro with the old tracks of San Francisco and Alameda Railroad, which led to the SF&A Alameda Wharf with ferry service to San Francisco."
"On September 6, 1869, the first Western Pacific train reached the shores of San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, thus achieving the transcontinental ""Pacific Railroad"" envisioned in the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act. According to the ""Daily Alta California"", this first through train left Sacramento at 10 am, got delayed by some construction trains, exited Niles Canyon late at 9:30 pm, and an hour later arrived at Alameda Terminal to a cheering crowd. Two months later, Central Pacific Railroad switched the western transcontinental terminus to its expanded Oakland Pier, which was inaugurated on November 8, 1869, in another round of celebration."
Alameda then went back to local train service only. In 1870 the SF&A was absorbed into Central Pacific and in 1873 the original SF&A pier was abandoned.
The railroads and their wharfs are gone from Alameda. The last rails were removed in 1960 from Lincoln Ave (formerly Railroad Ave and along which the SF&A rails ran).
"The achievement of the first transcontinental railroad reaching Alameda Terminal on September 6, 1869 is marked by a plaque in the Naval Air Station Alameda and a California Historical Landmark (CHL #440) nearby. The GPS coordinates of the two markers are given respectively by ""37.786779,-122.30292"" (plaque); and ""37.77535,-122.276891"" (CHL #440)."
"On 6 September 2019, a ""golden spike"" ceremony was held in Niles Canyon, where the Western Pacific tracks laid in 1866 met the Central Pacific tracks laid in 1869, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the 6 September 1869 completion of the first transcontinental railroad to the original Pacific coast terminus at Alameda Terminal. Also, the mayor of the City of Alameda issued a proclamation recognizing ""the outstanding contributions of the many Chinese immigrants who helped make the Transcontinental Railroad a reality""."

Horsetail Falls (or Horse Tail Falls) is a waterfall along the Columbia River Gorge in the U.S. state of Oregon.
"The waterfall is easily accessed, in contrast to its near neighbor Oneonta Falls, as it is right next to the Historic Columbia River Highway. The shape of the falls and the rounded rockface over which it flows cause it to resemble a horse's tail."
"There are actually two waterfalls along the creek. The upper falls, called Upper Horsetail Falls or Ponytail Falls, can be accessed from a footpath."
= = = Route poisoning = = =
"Route poisoning is a method to prevent a router from sending packets through a route that has become invalid within computer networks. Distance-vector routing protocols in computer networks use route poisoning to indicate to other routers that a route is no longer reachable and should not be considered from their routing tables. Unlike the ""split horizon with poison reverse"", route poisoning provides for sending updates with unreachable hop counts immediately to all the nodes in the network."
"When the protocol detects an invalid route, all of the routers in the network are informed that the bad route has an infinite (∞) route metric. This makes all nodes on the invalid route seem infinitely distant, preventing any of the routers from sending packets over the invalid route."
"Some distance-vector routing protocols, such as RIP, use a maximum hop count to determine how many routers the traffic must go through to reach the destination. Each route has a hop count number assigned to it which is incremented as the routing information is passed from router to router. A route is considered unreachable if the hop count exceeds the maximum allowed. Route poisoning is a method of quickly forgetting outdated routing information from other router's routing tables by changing its hop count to be unreachable (higher than the maximum number of hops allowed) and sending a routing update. In the case of RIP, the maximum hop count is 15, so to perform route poisoning on a route its hop count is changed to 16, deeming it unreachable, and a routing update is sent."
"If these updates are lost, some nodes in the network would not be informed that a route is invalid, so they could attempt to send packets over the bad route and cause a problem known as a routing loop. Therefore route poisoning is used in conjunction with holddowns to keep update messages from falsely reinstating the validity of a bad route. This prevents routing loops, improving the overall efficiency of the network."

= = = Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery = = =
"Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery was a place of burial. It is located in the town of Orpington in South East London, South-East England. Belonging to the Middle Anglo-Saxon period, it was part of the much wider tradition of burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England. Fordcroft was a mixed inhumation and cremation ceremony."
"Archaeologists affiliated with the local Orpington Museum began excavating in 1965, expecting to find evidence of Romano-British occupation, but after discovering the cemetery decided to focus on it. Excavation continued for four seasons, ending in 1968."
"The site was located in Orpington, close to the border with St. Mary Cray. It sits between Bellefield Road and Poverest Road, near to the junction with the A224 road. The source of the River Cray lies half a mile south of the cemetery, while the river itself passes by 200 metres away from the site. The plot of land on which it was discovered was 1/8 of an acre in size. The soil is largely brick-earth, resting on the Flood Plain gravel which covers the valley floor."
"The nearest settlement that is known to be long-established is the farmstead of Poverest, the name of which can be traced to the early-14th century."
"The area remained agricultural land lying between the two villages until the mid-19th century, when increasing development led to the area becoming suburban. Several Victorian cottages had been built atop the cemetery, but were demolished during the following century, when the site became ""overgrown with weeds and littered with rubbish"" prior to excavation."
"With the advent of the Anglo-Saxon period in the fifth century CE, the area that became Kent underwent a radical transformation on a political, social, and physical level. In the preceding era of Roman Britain, the area had been administered as the ""civitas"" of ""Cantiaci"", a part of the Roman Empire, but following the collapse of Roman rule in 410 CE, many signs of Romano-British society began to disappear, replaced by those of the ascendant Anglo-Saxon culture. Later Anglo-Saxon accounts attribute this change to the widescale invasion of Germanic language tribes from northern Europe, namely the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Archaeological and toponymic evidence shows that there was a great deal of syncretism, with Anglo-Saxon culture interacting and mixing with the Romano-British culture."
"The Old English term ""Kent"" first appears in the Anglo-Saxon period, and was based on the earlier Celtic-language name ""Cantii"". Initially applied only to the area east of the River Medway, by the end of the sixth century it also referred to areas to the west of it. The Kingdom of Kent was the first recorded Anglo-Saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record, and by the end of the sixth century, it had become a significant political power, exercising hegemony over large parts of southern and eastern Britain. At the time, Kent had strong trade links with Francia, while the Kentish royal family married members of Francia's Merovingian dynasty, who were already Christian. Kentish King Æthelberht was the overlord of various neighbouring kingdoms when he converted to Christianity in the early seventh century as a result of Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission, who had been sent by Pope Gregory to replace England's pagan beliefs with Christianity. It was in this context that the Polhill cemetery was in use."
"Kent has a wealth of Early Medieval funerary archaeology. The earliest excavation of Anglo-Saxon Kentish graves was in the 17th century, when antiquarians took an increasing interest in the material remains of the period. In the ensuing centuries, antiquarian interest gave way to more methodical archaeological investigation, and prominent archaeologists like Bryan Faussett, James Douglas, Cecil Brent, George Payne, and Charles Roach Smith ""dominated"" archaeological research in Kent."
"The Fordcroft cemetery contained a mixture of cremation and inhumation burials. The two forms of burial were interspersed within the cemetery, leading excavators to believe that they were contemporary with each other. Archaeologists have discovered a total of 19 cremations and 52 inhumations from the site. Due to the grave goods found at the site, Tester suggested that the site was probably active as a place of burial between ""circa"" 450 and 550 CE. He noted that culturally, the artefacts and forms of burial were similar to those found around the Thames Valley."
"There is evidence of nearby Romano-British occupation, which numismatic evidence shows extended to at least ""c"". 370. and Tester suggested that the Anglo-Saxons might have intentionally adopted Fordcroft as a cemetery site because of this. Equally, he thought it possible that the reuse of the site was simply fortuitous."
"Many of the skeletons were heavily decayed, although in many cases the teeth and long bones were sufficiently preserved for osteoarchaeologists to determine the age and sex of the individual."
"Most of the inhumation graves had the head facing westward, though in some cases they instead faced south. Most of the grave cuts were roughly rectangular with rounded corners, but some were less regular in form."
"Due to 19th century construction on the site, it was impossible for the archaeologists to accurately determine where the Anglo-Saxon ground level had been, and therefore how deep the graves had been cut."
"In the 1940s, a service trench had been excavated in the adjacent Bellefield Road by workmen, who revealed pieces of Romano-British pottery. Archaeologist A. Eldridge published this discovery in the ""Archaeologia Cantiana"" journal, suggesting that there might have been a building dating to Roman Britain nearby. In the 1960s, local archaeologists decided to test this theory by investigating the derelict site at Fordcroft following the demolition of the houses on that site. Test excavation took place at the site from July 1965, sponsored by Orpington Museum, under the authority of the London Borough of Bromley, to whom the site legally belonged. The borough council provided a mechanical digger to remove surface rubble, allowing excavation to commence. Much of the investigation was organised by M. Bowen, curator of Orpington Museum, where the site finds were initially stored."
"The first archaeological discoveries at the site were Romano-British in origin, although no evidence of buildings from this period were discovered. Soon, an Anglo-Saxon cremation urn was found, followed by several inhumations, revealing that this had been the site of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. Thenceforth, the excavation of the cemetery became the primary objective of the archaeologists. In the first two-seasons' work, 16 cremations and 29 inhumations were discovered. At the time of its discovery, it was recognised as the first ""well-authenticated"" archaeological evidence for Anglo-Saxon settlement along the River Cray. Elderly members of the community who had formerly lived in the cottages on the site visited the excavation, providing ""likely and amusing comments"" following the revelation that they had dwelt above a cemetery."
"A test pit was opened in the garage of No. 17 Poverest Road, uncovering another grave, and it is believed that further burials might be located under the house. The team excavated all available areas, although were unable to dig under either of the roads enclosing the site, or under the houses to the east and west."

"The Battle of Apros occurred between the forces of the Byzantine Empire, under co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos, and the forces of the Catalan Company, at Apros on July 1305."
"The Catalan Company had been hired by the Byzantines as mercenaries against the Turks, but despite the Catalans' successes against the Turks, the two allies distrusted each other, and their relationship was strained by the Catalans' financial demands. Eventually, Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and his son and co-ruler Michael IX had the Catalan leader, Roger de Flor, assassinated with his entourage in April 1305."
"In July, the Byzantine army, comprising a large contingent of Alans as well as many Turcopoles, confronted the Catalans and their own Turkish allies near Apros in Thrace. Despite the Imperial Army's numerical superiority, the Alans withdrew after the first charge, whereupon the Turcopoles deserted ""en block"" to the Catalans. Prince Michael was injured and left the field and the Catalans won the day."

Halicki directed the 1974 film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" as well as producing and starring in several other action films. He was killed in an accident while filming ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"" in 1989. Wishing to preserve his legacy, his widow, Denice Shakarian Halicki, produced a remake in 2000 along with Jerry Bruckheimer."
"Halicki was born in a Polish-American family in Dunkirk, New York in 1940 and was one of thirteen children. All thirteen children were given nicknames; his was ""Toby"". Toby started to develop his fascination with cars while working in the family towing business, which was established back in 1919. His father was also a second-hand car dealer. Halicki started driving at a young age and developed a wide knowledge of automobiles by the age of ten. When he was a teenager, after the loss of two of his brothers, Halicki decided to move to California and live with one of his uncles."
"Halicki moved from New York to California and worked on vehicles, eventually owning his own impound and towing business. H.B. Halicki Mercantile Co. & Junk Yard was known for its extensive antique automobile and toy collections."
"Halicki wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" in 1974."
"There was no official script for the movie, apart from several pages outlining main dialog sequences. Halicki supplied most of the cars and used repeated footage of the same vehicles and shots of public incidents to increase the footage. The scene in which a train derailment is observed was not part of the original shooting script; it is in fact a real train that derailed. When the director heard about the wreck, he wanted to incorporate it into the film."
Halicki compacted 10 vertebrae performing the film's jump finale and walked with a limp afterwards.
"Halicki married Denice Shakarian in 1989, shortly before he began filming his 1989 sequel, ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"", in which both of them would star. Halicki bought over 400 automobiles to destroy in the film, which was to feature improved car chases and storyline."
"On August 20, 1989, while filming in Dunkirk and Buffalo, New York, Toby was preparing for the most dramatic stunt sequence in the film, during which a water tower was supposed to topple to the ground. When a cable attached to the tower snapped unexpectedly, it sheared off a telephone pole, which fell on Halicki, killing him instantly. The accident occurred in an area behind the former J.H. Williams Tool factory at 400 Vulcan Street in Buffalo."
"In 1995, Denice Shakarian Halicki began work with Jerry Bruckheimer and Touchstone Pictures to produce a 2000 remake of the original 1974 film. The remake included the Fastback Mustang ""Eleanor""."
"In its opening weekend, the remake grossed $25,336,048 from 3,006 US theaters, leading all films that weekend. By the end of the film's theatrical run, it had grossed $101,648,571 domestically and $135,553,728 internationally, comprising a total gross revenue for the film of $237,202,299 worldwide. The popularity of the 2000 remake resulted in illegal copies of the custom ""Eleanor"" car being produced. Denice Halicki successfully sued to stop trademark and copyright infringement."

His last appointment in Canada was that of fellow in Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Study der University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

"In 2011, Stehr created the European Center for Sustainability Research (ECS) at Zeppelin University."
"His research interests center on the transformation of modern societies into knowledge societies and associated developments in different social institutions of modern society (e.g. science, politics, and the economy) and is focused on these field of attention:"
Knowledge: Knowledge is not merely a model of reality but a model for reality. Knowledge represents a capacity to act.
Knowledge and information: The substance of information primarily concerns the properties of products or outcomes while the stuff of knowledge refers to the qualities of process or inputs.
"Post-industrial society: Innovation are increasingly derivative from research and development; there is a new relation between science and technology because of the centrality of theoretical knowledge, and the weight of the society—measured by a larger proportion of Gross National Product and a larger share of employment—is increasingly shifting toward the knowledge field."
Knowledge society: The foundation for the transformation of modern societies into knowledge societies is based on changes in the structure of the economies of advanced societies. The source of economic growth and value-adding activities—increasingly relies on knowledge. The significance of knowledge grows in all spheres of life and in all social institutions of modern society.
"Common sense and scientific knowledge: The growing significance of science and its manifold social utility has led to its having a virtual monopoly on the production of new socially, economically and politically relevant knowledge in modern societies; knowledge that rarely can be contested by religion, nor by politics, and in particular not by daily experience. But this does not mean that ordinary citizens are now the slaves of scientific experts."
Stehr is one of the authors of the Hartwell Paper: A new direction for climate policy after the crash of 2009. The Hartwell Paper arises from a meeting convened by Professor Gwyn Prins of the LSE in February 2010 to consider the implications of developments in climate policy in late 2009.
"Climate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years. The underlying reason for this is that the UNFCCC/Kyoto model was structurally flawed and doomed to fail because it systematically misunderstood the nature of climate change as a policy issue between 1985 and 2009. However, the currently dominant approach has acquired"
immense political momentum because of the quantities of political capital sunk into it. But in any case the UNFCCC/Kyoto model of climate policy cannot continue because it crashed in late 2009. The Hartwell Paper sets and reviews this context; but doing so is
not its sole or primary purpose.
The Paper proposes that the organising principle of our effort should be the raising up of human dignity via three overarching objectives: ensuring energy access for all; ensuring that we develop in a manner that does not undermine the essential
"functioning of the Earth system; ensuring that our societies are adequately equipped to withstand the risks and dangers that come from all the vagaries of climate, whatever their cause may be. It explains radical and practical ways to reduce non-CO2 human forcing of climate. It argues that improved climate risk management is a valid policy goal, and is not simply congruent with carbon policy. It explains the political prerequisite of energy efficiency strategies as a first step and documents how this can achieve real emissions reductions. But, above all, it emphasises the primacy of accelerating decarbonisation of energysupply. This calls for very substantially increased investment in innovation in noncarbon energy sources in order to diversify energy supply technologies. The ultimate goal of doing this is to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less"
than those using fossil fuels. The Hartwell Paper advocates funding this work by low hypothecated (dedicated) carbon taxes. It opens discussion on how to channel such money productively.
"While small generators may be cooled by air drawn through filters at the inlet, larger units generally require special cooling arrangements. Hydrogen gas cooling, in an oil-sealed casing, is used because it has the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity which reduces windage losses. This system requires special handling during start-up, with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly flammable hydrogen does not mix with oxygen in the air."
The hydrogen pressure inside the casing is maintained slightly higher than atmospheric pressure to avoid outside air ingress. The hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing. Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. Seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere.
"The generator also uses water cooling. Since the generator coils are at a potential of about 22 kV, an insulating barrier such as Teflon is used to interconnect the water line and the generator high-voltage windings. Demineralized water of low conductivity is used."
The generator voltage for modern utility-connected generators ranges from in smaller units to in larger units. The generator high-voltage leads are normally large aluminium channels because of their high current as compared to the cables used in smaller machines. They are enclosed in well-grounded aluminium bus ducts and are supported on suitable insulators. The generator high-voltage leads are connected to step-up transformers for connecting to a high-voltage electrical substation (usually in the range of 115 kV to 765 kV) for further transmission by the local power grid.
"The necessary protection and metering devices are included for the high-voltage leads. Thus, the steam turbine generator and the transformer form one unit. Smaller units may share a common generator step-up transformer with individual circuit breakers to connect the generators to a common bus."
"Most of the power station operational controls are automatic. However, at times, manual intervention may be required. Thus, the plant is provided with monitors and alarm systems that alert the plant operators when certain operating parameters are seriously deviating from their normal range."
"A central battery system consisting of lead–acid cell units is provided to supply emergency electric power, when needed, to essential items such as the power station's control systems, communication systems, generator hydrogen seal system, turbine lube oil pumps, and emergency lighting. This is essential for a safe, damage-free shutdown of the units in an emergency situation."
"To dissipate the thermal load of main turbine exhaust steam, condensate from gland steam condenser, and condensate from Low Pressure Heater by providing a continuous supply of cooling water to the main condenser thereby leading to condensation."
The consumption of cooling water by inland power stations is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power stations by 2040–2069.
= = = Lathe center = = =
"A lathe center, often shortened to center, is a tool that has been ground to a point to accurately position a workpiece on an axis. They usually have an included angle of 60°, but in heavy machining situations an angle of 75° is used."
"The primary use of a center is to ensure concentric work is produced; this allows the workpiece to be transferred between machining (or inspection) operations without any loss of accuracy. A part may be ""turned"" in a lathe, sent off for hardening and tempering and then ground ""between centers"" in a cylindrical grinder. The preservation of concentricity between the turning and grinding operations is crucial for quality work."
"A center is also used to support longer workpieces where the cutting forces would deflect the work excessively, reducing the finish and accuracy of the workpiece, or creating a hazardous situation."
"A center lathe has applications anywhere that a ""centered"" workpiece may be used; this is not limited to lathe usage but may include setups in dividing heads, cylindrical grinders, tool and cutter grinders or other related equipment. The term ""between centers"" refers to any machining operation where the job needs to be performed using centers."
"A center is inserted into a matching hole drilled by a center drill. The hole is conical near and at the surface, and cylindrical, deeper."
"A dead center (one that does not turn freely, i.e., ""dead"") may be used to support the workpiece at either the fixed or rotating end of the machine. When used in the fixed position, a dead center produces friction between the workpiece and center, due to the rotation of the workpiece. Lubrication is therefore required between the center and workpiece to prevent friction welding from occurring. Additionally the tip of the center may have an insert of cemented carbide which will reduce the friction slightly and allow for faster speeds. Dead centers are typically fully hardened to prevent damage to the important mating surfaces of the taper and to preserve the 60° angle of the nose. As tungsten carbide is much harder than steel, a carbide-tipped center has greater wear resistance than a steel center."
Soft centers are a special version of the dead center in which the nose is deliberately left soft (unhardened) so that it may be readily machined to the correct angle prior to usage. This operation is performed on the headstock center to ensure that the center's axis is aligned with the spindle's axis.
"A revolving center, also known as a live center in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel; it moves and is therefore live."
"A pipe center, also known as a bull nose center is a type of live center which has a large diameter conical nose rather than a sharp point. This allows the center to be used in the bore of a pipe or other workpiece with a large interior diameter. While a pipe center ensures the workpiece remains concentric, its main advantage is that it supports the workpiece securely, and can be used for parts whose larger inner diameter prevents the use of a normal pointed center. Thin-walled material such as pipes easily collapses if excessive force is used at the chuck end."
"There are two types of cup centers. The woodworking variety is a variation of the traditional live center. This type of cup center has a central point like a normal live center and also has a ring surrounding it. The ring supports the softer material around the center point and prevents the wood from splitting under pressure from the central point. A different variety of cup center is used for metalworking. The metalworking variety of cup center has a tapered hole rather than a conical point. It supports the part by making contact with the outside diameter of the end of the part, rather than using a center hole."
"A drive center, also known as a grip center, is used in the driving end of a machine (headstock). It is often used in woodworking or where softer materials are machined."
"It consists of a dead center surrounded by hardened teeth, which bite into a softer workpiece allowing the workpiece to be driven directly by the center. This allows the full diameter of the workpiece to be machined in a single operation, in contrast with the usual requirement where a carrier is attached to the workpiece at the driven end. The use of modified shell end mills in a drive center, instead of hardened pins, enables better gripping and prevents breakdown time due to pin stop."
"A spring center is a metalworking lathe center for maintaining a cutting tool like a reamer or a tap, in axial alignment with a hole being worked on. It consists of a point backed by a spring to push the cutting tool into the workpiece."

The codice_25 data type represents a variable-length text string. For example:
"In addition to the static array used in design, SystemVerilog offers dynamic arrays, associative arrays and queues:"
"A dynamic array works much like an unpacked array, but offers the advantage of being dynamically allocated at runtime (as shown above.) Whereas a packed array's size must be known at compile time (from a constant or expression of constants), the dynamic array size can be initialized from another runtime variable, allowing the array to be sized and resize arbitrarily as needed."
"An associative array can be thought of as a binary search tree with a user-specified key type and data type. The key implies an ordering; the elements of an associative array can be read out in lexicographic order. Finally, a queue provides much of the functionality of the C++ STL deque type: elements can be added and removed from either end efficiently. These primitives allow the creation of complex data structures required for scoreboarding a large design."
SystemVerilog provides an object-oriented programming model.
"In SystemVerilog, classes support a single-inheritance model, but may implement functionality similar to multiple-inheritance through the use of so-called ""interface classes"" (identical in concept to the codice_26 feature of Java). Classes can be parameterized by type, providing the basic function of C++ templates. However, template specialization and function templates are not supported."
SystemVerilog's polymorphism features are similar to those of C++: the programmer may specifically write a codice_27 function to have a derived class gain control of the function. See virtual function for further info.
"Encapsulation and data hiding is accomplished using the codice_28 and codice_29 keywords, which must be applied to any item that is to be hidden. By default, all class properties are public."
"Class instances are dynamically created with the codice_30 keyword. A constructor denoted by codice_31 can be defined. SystemVerilog has automatic garbage collection, so there is no language facility to explicitly destroy instances created by the new operator."
Example:
"Integer quantities, defined either in a class definition or as stand-alone variables in some lexical scope, can be assigned random values based on a set of constraints. This feature is useful for creating randomized scenarios for verification."
"Within class definitions, the codice_32 and codice_33 modifiers signal variables that are to undergo randomization. codice_33 specifies permutation-based randomization, where a variable will take on all possible values once before any value is repeated. Variables without modifiers are not randomized."
"In this example, the codice_35 field is not randomized; in practice it will be computed with a CRC generator, and the codice_36 field used to corrupt it to inject FCS errors. The two constraints shown are applicable to conforming Ethernet frames. Constraints may be selectively enabled; this feature would be required in the example above to generate corrupt frames. Constraints may be arbitrarily complex, involving interrelationships among variables, implications, and iteration. The SystemVerilog constraint solver is required to find a solution if one exists, but makes no guarantees as to the time it will require to do so as this is in general an NP-hard problem (boolean satisfiability)."
"In each SystemVerilog class there are 3 predefined methods for randomization: pre_randomize, randomize and post_randomize. The randomize method is called by the user for randomization of the class variables. The pre_randomize method is called by the randomize method before the randomization and the post_randomize method is called by the randomize method after randomization."
The constraint_mode() and the random_mode() methods are used to control the randomization. constraint_mode() is used to turn a specific constraint on and off and the random_mode is used to turn a randomization of a specific variable on or off. The below code describes and procedurally tests an Ethernet frame:
"Assertions are useful for verifying properties of a design that manifest themselves after a specific condition or state is reached. SystemVerilog has its own assertion specification language, similar to Property Specification Language. The subset of SystemVerilog language constructs that serves assertion is commonly called SystemVerilog Assertion or SVA."
"SystemVerilog assertions are built from sequences and properties. Properties are a superset of sequences; any sequence may be used as if it were a property, although this is not typically useful."
Sequences consist of boolean expressions augmented with temporal operators. The simplest temporal operator is the codice_37 operator which performs a concatenation:
This sequence matches if the codice_38 signal goes high one clock cycle after codice_39 goes high. Note that all sequence operations are synchronous to a clock.
"Other sequential operators include repetition operators, as well as various conjunctions. These operators allow the designer to express complex relationships among design components."
An assertion works by continually attempting to evaluate a sequence or property. An assertion fails if the property fails. The sequence above will fail whenever codice_39 is low. To accurately express the requirement that codice_38 follow codice_39 a property is required:
"This example shows an implication operator codice_43. The clause to the left of the implication is called the antecedent and the clause to the right is called the consequent. Evaluation of an implication starts through repeated attempts to evaluate the antecedent. When the antecedent succeeds, the consequent is attempted, and the success of the assertion depends on the success of the consequent. In this example, the consequent won't be attempted until codice_39 goes high, after which the property will fail if codice_38 is not high on the following clock."
"In addition to assertions, SystemVerilog supports assumptions and coverage of properties. An assumption establishes a condition that a formal logic proving tool must assume to be true. An assertion specifies a property that must be proven true. In simulation, both assertions and assumptions are verified against test stimuli. Property coverage allows the verification engineer to verify that assertions are accurately monitoring the design."
Coverage as applied to hardware verification languages refers to the collection of statistics based on sampling events within the simulation. Coverage is used to determine when the device under test (DUT) has been exposed to a sufficient variety of stimuli that there is a high confidence that the DUT is functioning correctly. Note that this differs from code coverage which instruments the design code to ensure that all lines of code in the design have been executed. Functional coverage ensures that all desired corner and edge cases in the design space have been explored.
"A SystemVerilog coverage group creates a database of ""bins"" that store a histogram of values of an associated variable. Cross-coverage can also be defined, which creates a histogram representing the Cartesian product of multiple variables."
"A sampling event controls when a sample is taken. The sampling event can be a Verilog event, the entry or exit of a block of code, or a call to the codice_46 method of the coverage group. Care is required to ensure that data are sampled only when meaningful."
For example:
"In this example, the verification engineer is interested in the distribution of broadcast and unicast frames, the size/f_type field and the payload size. The ranges in the payload size coverpoint reflect the interesting corner cases, including minimum and maximum size frames."
"A complex test environment consists of reusable verification components that must communicate with one another. Verilog's 'event' primitive allowed different blocks of procedural statements to trigger each other, but enforcing thread synchronization was up to the programmer's (clever) usage. SystemVerilog offers two primitives specifically for interthread synchronization: ""mailbox"" and ""semaphore"". The mailbox is modeled as a FIFO message queue. Optionally, the FIFO can be type-parameterized so that only objects of the specified type may be passed through it. Typically, objects are class instances representing ""transactions"": elementary operations (for example, sending a frame) that are executed by the verification components. The semaphore is modeled as a counting semaphore."
"In addition to the new features above, SystemVerilog enhances the usability of Verilog's existing language features. The following are some of these enhancements:"
"Besides this, SystemVerilog allows convenient interface to foreign languages (like C/C++), by SystemVerilog DPI (Direct Programming Interface)."
"In the design verification role, SystemVerilog is widely used in the chip-design industry. The three largest EDA vendors (Cadence Design Systems, Mentor Graphics, Synopsys) have incorporated SystemVerilog into their mixed-language HDL simulators. Although no simulator can yet claim support for the entire SystemVerilog , making testbench interoperability a challenge, efforts to promote cross-vendor compatibility are underway. In 2008, Cadence and Mentor released the Open Verification Methodology, an open-source class-library and usage-framework to facilitate the development of re-usable testbenches and canned verification-IP. Synopsys, which had been the first to publish a SystemVerilog class-library (VMM), subsequently responded by opening its proprietary VMM to the general public. Many third-party providers have announced or already released SystemVerilog verification IP."
"Euthanasia is a criminal offense in China. For example, in Shanghai a 67-year-old man was sentenced to 5 years in prison when he euthanized his 92-year-old mother when she emerged from a hospital procedure only able to move one finger and one toe. The sentence was considered lenient because he had displayed filial piety toward his mother."
"While active euthanasia remains illegal in China, it is gaining increasing acceptance among doctors and the general populace."
"In Hong Kong, support for euthanasia among the general public is higher among those who put less importance on religious belief, those who are non-Christian, those who have higher family incomes, those who have more experience in taking care of terminally ill family members, and those who are older."
"Since World War II, the debate over euthanasia in Western countries has centered on voluntary euthanasia within regulated health care systems. In some cases, judicial decisions, legislation, and regulations have made voluntary euthanasia an explicit option for patients and their guardians. Proponents and critics of such voluntary euthanasia policies offer the following reasons for and against official voluntary euthanasia policies:"
Proponents of voluntary euthanasia emphasize that choice is a fundamental principle for liberal democracies and free market systems.
"The pain and suffering a person feels during a disease, even with pain relievers, can be incomprehensible to a person who has not gone through it. Even without considering the physical pain, it is often difficult for patients to overcome the emotional pain of losing their independence."
"Those who witness others die are ""particularly convinced"" that the law should be changed to allow assisted death."
"Today in many countries there is a shortage of hospital space. Medical personnel and hospital beds could be used for people whose lives could be saved instead of continuing the lives of those who want to die, thus increasing the general quality of care and shortening hospital waiting lists. It is a burden to keep people alive past the point they can contribute to society, especially if the resources used could be spent on a curable ailment."
"Critics argue that voluntary euthanasia could unduly compromise the professional roles of health care employees, especially doctors. They point out that European physicians of previous centuries traditionally swore some variation of the Hippocratic Oath, which in its ancient form excluded euthanasia: ""To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.."" However, since the 1970s, this oath has largely fallen out of use."
"Some people, including many Christians, consider euthanasia of some or all types to be morally unacceptable. This view usually treats euthanasia to be a type of murder and voluntary euthanasia as a type of suicide, the morality of which is the subject of active debate."
"If there is some reason to believe the cause of a patient's illness or suffering is or will soon be curable, the correct action is sometimes considered to attempt to bring about a cure or engage in palliative care."
"Feasibility of implementation: Euthanasia can only be considered ""voluntary"" if a patient is mentally competent to make the decision, i.e., has a rational understanding of options and consequences. Competence can be difficult to determine or even define."
"Consent under pressure: Given the economic grounds for voluntary euthanasia, critics of voluntary euthanasia are concerned that patients may experience psychological pressure to consent to voluntary euthanasia rather than be a financial burden on their families. Even where health costs are mostly covered by public money, as in most developed countries, voluntary euthanasia critics are concerned that hospital personnel would have an economic incentive to advise or pressure people toward euthanasia consent."
"Non-voluntary euthanasia is sometimes cited as one of the possible outcomes of the slippery slope argument, in which it is claimed that permitting voluntary euthanasia to occur will lead to the support and legalization of non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia."
The right to life movement opposes voluntary euthanasia.
Euthanasia brings about many ethical issues regarding a patient’s death. Some physicians say euthanasia is a rational choice for competent patients who wish to die to escape unbearable suffering.
"Physicians who are in favor of euthanasia state that to keep euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) illegal is a violation of patient freedoms. They believe that any competent terminally-ill patient should have the right to choose death or refuse life-saving treatment. Suicide and assistance from their physician is seen as the only option those patients have. With the suffering and the knowledge from the doctor, this may also suggest that PAS is a humane answer to the excruciating pain."
"An argument against PAS is the violation of the Hippocratic oath that some doctors take. The Hippocratic oath states ""I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan""."
"Another reason for prohibiting PAS and euthanasia is the option of abusing PAS if it were to become legal. Poor or uninsured patients may not have the money or no access to proper care will have limited options, and they could be pressured towards assisted death."
"During the 20th century, efforts to change government policies on euthanasia have met limited success in Western countries. Euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of NGOs, most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations."
"There are many different religious views on the issue of voluntary euthanasia, although many moral theologians are critical of the procedure."
"Euthanasia can be accomplished either through an oral, intravenous, or intramuscular administration of drugs, or by oxygen deprivation (anoxia), as in some euthanasia machines. In individuals who are incapable of swallowing lethal doses of medication, an intravenous route is preferred. The following is a Dutch protocol for parenteral (intravenous) administration to obtain euthanasia:"
"Intravenous administration is the most reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg sodium thiopental (Nesdonal) in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then a triple intravenous dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular muscle relaxant is given, such as 20 mg pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) or 20 mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should preferably be given intravenously, in order to ensure optimal availability. Only for pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) are there substantial indications that the agent may also be given intramuscularly in a dosage of 40 mg."
"With regards to voluntary euthanasia, many people argue that 'equal access' should apply to access to suicide as well, so therefore disabled people who cannot kill themselves should have access to voluntary euthanasia."
"Apart from ""The Old Law"", a 17th-century tragicomedy written by Thomas Middleton, William Rowley, and Philip Massinger, one of the early books to deal with euthanasia in a fictional context is Anthony Trollope's 1882 dystopian novel, ""The Fixed Period"". Ricarda Huch's novel ""The Deruga Case"" (1917) is about a physician who is acquitted after performing euthanasia on his dying ex-wife."
"""Quality of Mercy"" in ""The Prosecution Rests"" is a fable exploring the facets of aging, Alzheimer's disease, and euthanasia. The story line makes no judgement but frees the reader to decide."
"The plot of Christopher Buckley's 2007 novel ""Boomsday"" involves the use of 'Voluntary euthanasia' of seniors as a political ploy to stave off the insolvency of social security as more and more of the aging US population reaches retirement age."
"The films ""Children of Men"" and ""Soylent Green"" depict instances of government-sponsored euthanasia in order to strengthen their dystopian themes. The protagonist of the film ""Johnny Got His Gun"" is a brutally mutilated war veteran whose request for euthanasia furthers the work's anti-war message. The recent films ""Mar Adentro"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" argue more directly in favor of euthanasia by illustrating the suffering of their protagonists. These films have provoked debate and controversy in their home countries of Spain and the United States respectively."
"In March 2010, the PBS ""Frontline"" TV program in the United States showed a documentary called ""The Suicide Tourist"" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and the Swiss group Dignitas, and their decision to help him commit assisted suicide in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)."
"Thrash metal band Megadeth's 1994 album ""Youthanasia"" (the title is a pun on euthanasia) implies that society is euthanizing its youth."
"The documentary film ""How to Die in Oregon"" follows the lives of select terminally ill individuals who weigh the options of continuing to live and euthanasia. This film employs emotional appeal to the audience on the controversial topic of voluntary euthanasia."
