That's temperature and that's rainfall.
"Yeah but which line refers to which, how can I tell?"
You need to put the dotted line there  and square there
No you can look like that.
How?
"Rain, ten millimetres of rain equals one millimetre  ten of rain equals one millimetre and this one  one degrees  celsius  equals"
Well I'm sorry  I don't think that is very clever  for you!

"Yeah, you're right I am!"
And he was being really nasty!

"But like  then er, she, she just turned round to him and she goes  tell you what, I would really, really, love it if you woke up tomorrow and you had ginger hair, cos that'd really, really give you a dose of your own medicine!"
"Then  then er  and he was going, oh don't be childish Rachel and all this!"

But I mean you know as you just said then they'd wanna charge you per hour it's
Yeah.
beyond the working man.
"Now Shirley, you're still messing about with this little job here."
Well I wanted the sander.
We're just coming in a minute.

"Yes I like this business of putting your what's a name on this d with this  you know, the glue on."
"Well it was so  flaky, the wood"
Yeah.
And that sort of seals
But

Well it seals it but it also helps to erm  give you some purchase you see for
"Yeah,."
So that'll be a speaker  day .
Okay.
.
"Will, will you follow that up?"
"You, you've got the name of the person have you?"
"Erm,shout that out again and"
"Erm, Birchwood high school."
"No, the, the, I've got all that"
Linda
"Linda , yeah."
"Yes, it'll be worth following that up, cos that's, that's one of the erm, they, they've done quite a lot of work of Amnesty and general studies in the past, there was a sheet of sort of quotes of, how good the Amnesty  was, and there was one from the teacher at Birchwood or what, what's Margaret Dane School, so erm, yes, if, if you could definitely follow that up erm John"
Yeah.
cos that'll be a very useful school to have interest .
Erm.
"Erm I also have a letter er from a Kate , I'm not sure from which school she goes to, but she's fourteen and she's going to one of the local schools,"
Mm.
"but, erm, she was hoping to come to the meeting this evening, but she phoned at the last minute and said she couldn't make it, but erm, I don't know if it would be more appropriate perhaps for the schools groups to get in touch with her and I"
Did she leave her name and .
"Er, yes, but I, it's at home."
"Yes, could you, perhaps you could find out which school she's at"
"Yes, okay."
Erm.
"could give her a ring, find out what school she's at and then"
"And then if, if it's fine with her, we'd have some, well you'd let you know,contact"
", what's the time ."
"Alright, yeah, okay."
Right.
"Because it's, I mean  it would be very good if we could have several schools"
Yeah.
interested.
"Er  have you got, all these people waiting to be told ."
Mm.
And I think we ought to get him over to one of our meetings.
And  and he said he would.
And I think if we could make it get one of the Uttlesford  chaps to the same meeting
marvellous thing they did.
Yeah.
Well what he did say was don't  you know  don't go over the top in criticizing that because
Yeah.
you know he he says that there's a lot of things which are happening.
He's got all sorts of schemes  a lot of schemes in the pipeline.
I suppose he doesn't want to be seen to be just reacting to your letter he's obviously started doing these things off his own bat anyway hasn't he?
Oh yes.
Yeah.
I mean and and he he feels that er  pressure groups like ourselves are very positive because it gives him a bit of  weight  when he's arguing for things.
Yeah
Well they can't push it from the top
But I mean  on a sort of wider thing  erm
Yeah.
You know one of the things that we could do  is to do another directory.
Yeah.
I think  because I think I think
But
it's a real shame  we're so out of date.
Mhm  but I I you know we we're  can we actually do it?
I mean we would need  fifty people
No I would not distribute it
to deliver
er from door to door.
"I would erm put it out in the library, put it out in in surgeries."
Put it out in public places and that's it because  I mean  the number of people  erm they went to these directories like hot cross buns.
I mean every week I supplied them with a new stack of  everybody wanted them.
"What, the recycling directory?"
is it an important part of it?
yeah
you know when you have french
yeah
"we'll have to take a, french kids and that talking"
oh yeah
that's to do with the Norway from English
"yeah, but, there's a thingy on it, they'll be a  but it ain't just us school, it's other schools in it as well"
"yeah I know, but, they, they'll all, there, the others is two schools is one after another school and we're the only erm boys school and it's not  an all girls school doing it, otherwise it ain't"
"no, there's more schools than that, cos er the lady said that er, she goes I'm, cos there is  when you  he went what schools are these?, and so reading out a couple of schools, about four of 'em"
and
"no, quite out far they were"
she  that hotel
I know
"oh, er"
all what?
the what?
"how do you know it's thingy?, how do you know it's for the kids in Norway?"
"she said something about it in school, she goes she wants their names right and their occupation  cos say like you go to the butcher shop and then you go to  that and the other"
yeah
so Norwegian they learn in English don't they though
"oh yeah  oh but, yeah, but, this is gonna be done mostly on the streets in it for us?, so what they gonna learn about that?don't remember when thingy"
the last
remember when he hit the first stone and hit that car window
I don't
"well  this thing weren't it, it was parked up, this was ages"
yes
"this was two years ago, just before er activities week weren't it?"
he goes what
away and
he found that
legged it
"I will try and remind you about that, er, on other occasions, so that it doesn't er, slip into the recesses."
"Er, and the other thing, just to comment on the programme."
"I hope that we shall have the Deputy Lord Mayor, er, Bob  on the last Wednesday of our session."
"The reason the programme's taken so long, was to find a time when he's available."
"That Wednesday is in the school holiday, although we shall be continuing."
"It means that he can slip out of school, er, in the afternoon, when normally, in nor on a normal school day, he would not be able to do that."
"Erm, so I'm hoping that that will work, it's it's down in the diary for him to do that, and and I've given a little note about what the Adult School is all about."
"And I'll write to him to confirm, and er, if I do bump into him, I shall jog memory of that one."
"Erm, with the change of programme, then, the Black Sheep of the, of the Family."
"Er, which I have already found."
"It is on page a hundred and thirty- nine, for those of you who wish to er, follow."
It starts off with.
"Baa Baa Black Sheep, Have you any Wool?"
How does the black sheep of the nursery rhyme appear to children?
"Other sheep they see, are unlikely to be black, so a black sheep is different."
"They soon learn that anyone referred to as a black sheep, is not only different, but is regarded as being in disgrace."
This is all politically incorrect.
"Yes, yes, yes it is, indeed,"
I was thinking about that.
"isn't it, nowadays."
"Wh wh wha what shall we do, if they were saying a black sheep?"
Erm.
A green one.
"Erm, a green."
"Yes, yes, yes."
"I don't think you can even say, non-white, can you, nowadays."
Yes.
A Jacob.
a Jacobs sheep.
A Jacob.
A Jacob's sheep.
Yeah.
It is.
"See a few of them, you know right at beginning where it shows you preface?"
Yeah.
"That's where it's jumped, not on the film itself."
"Yeah you know why, it's, it's because of cont continuous rewinding."
You always get damage at front of tape.
Best thing to do is just cut it off.
Ah we will do later cos
Well or yeah.
he uses  cuts it all off and gets rid of it.
"Yeah it's erm  any damage on tape, nine out of ten times i is the first foot  it's because when they wind them back i it, it's a jag"
tight innit?
complete jag all the time when they wind them back.
Yeah.
Aye well that doesn't bother us.
No.
Ta-ta.
Ta-ta love.
"shorts and  so I thought right, clean or mucky, you're in the wash."
"So , thought I'll get them all washed and put back in bedroom before he notices they're missing."
So that's what I did.
"Now what we're on about   yeah as I were on about, that er  what I do is, with days like this, cos you can never guarantee  if they're gonna be dry, wet or what, so I watch to see if it rains, if it don't  they're virtually dry when I fetch them in."
So that's what I've been doing.
I don't know whose T-shirt's whose.
That one's mine.
So that's what I've been doing.
"I fetch them all in, stick them on clothes horse, they're all round fire while I'm on lollipop and then nip to shop and when I come in within half an hour they were bone dry."
Easy.
That's one way to do it innit?
Fetch them in at half past three.
But if they're dry I just fold them up and put them away anyway.
I'm just transferring socks.
Yeah.
ten p or twenty p.
"Oh that that would be a different ball game, selling it in places wouldn't it?"
Oh yeah.
Ho how many
"That's our, I mean, you know you can go round in newsagents or doctor's surgery and dump them."
But to actually say right can you s can you collect the money for us!
Well one could put a  box next to it.
"Well in some places, yeah ."
"Yeah but I mean, mm."
a copy's a lot.
"It is, yeah."
Well although
I mean it I'm not suggesting that isn't cheap but erm  to produce at five p a copy
Oh yeah.
thousand it's gonna cost what's it gonna cost?
Er.
What's five thousands?
Five thousands.
Fifty pounds.
Mm.
Mm.
"I mean I'm, I'm, I'm only going on the fact that I I tend to do everything on the cheap so I tend to get  if I can find somebody who does photocopying I can  do it then we'll do it."
"For me to produce that'll cost me  basically  my time and my  my you know I, say my laser copies' paid for by my business  erm"
copies.
"So I mean if I, if I produced for instance si five or six masters  and then people can go and do copies here and there that's actually not a bad way of doing it."
"And that'll be, I've got about a ream of, well it's only about a ream  paper."
Just pr producing new copies as you need them rather than produce five thousand and I think we we have sort of hundreds to throw away in the end.
But I  it to to er  recycling.
Yeah.
Well I'll get in touch with this  East Herts guy to get all his information.
Good.
"But the problem is the lower level at that,i i i it's at the N C O level where complaints are made by soldiers and because the complaint has to be made through the regiment, then the the pressure is for the soldier to withdraw his complaint  ."
"Rea really brief so how widespread is it in the Army, bullying or intimidation?"
"How how can we tell, because as an officer, and this is this is Richard's point, as an officer how do you know what goes on in the barrack room?"
Nicky can I have a word ?
With wa Andrew I've got somebody else to speak to.
If I
Okay.
get a chance I'll come back to you.
Er where's James ?
James.
Now you're on the run from the Army at the moment?
Mm.
Er why did you run away?
"Er mental torture, I just couldn't handle it no more."
What were they doing to you?
Er I was handcuffed to a radiator in the nude and urinated on.
I was tied into a sleeping bag and hung upside down from a tree overnight.
Er
"Why did they pick on you do you think Andrew, er James ?"
My size.
Yeah.
And you know
Did you s did you te did you say for god's sake stop doing this to me?
"Did you try and stop them, did you try and make them see reason?"
"Th there was no point, the chain of command to make a complaint was blocked."
There was just no way.
Did you see this happening to other people?
Yeah.
What sort of things were they doing to other people?
"Erm two people back to back with their trousers round their ankles, newspaper shoved up their backside, lit in the middle, first one to move got a kicking."
And is this common?
Or were these just a few isolated sadists ?
Okay.
"Don't know what, don't know what they'll make of all that gobbledegook.   bye bye love."
Have a good weekend.
See you soon .
See you next week.
"This is the wrong side, they must have rewound it without meaning to."
Well you're supposed to use side A
it won't tape it doesn't matter .
"But it does to them, because they've got side A and side B on every tape."
Yeah.
"And if they haven't got  side  side one tape two following  I mean side two side, tape two side A following tape one side B, it puts them out a bit I should think  are you going up the dog path?"
"Yeah, come on ."
"When, when did you get all this stock of perfume?"
"Erm, four years ago, three or four years ago  ."
.
"He went out on Christmas Eve, to find you present"
"That's right, I remember that ."
"and he got this job lot of  perfume, and he said oh I can shot these out over the next few years, I said, oh if you really want to ."
Where does he keep them?
"I've no idea, in fact last year, did he give you some last year?"
"I can't remember ,"
"Yes, he did ."
"he said alright, I, I, I was in trouble because I forgot where I hid them."
A miniature one.
I had to look in the top of his wardrobe.
You'll have to look somewhere.
"Take it all away, he probably gave it to girls at work as well or something."
Yes.
"Well no, cos it would be too late after Christmas wouldn't it?"
"Probably, no he doesn't give presents ."
"Oh he does, he gives er his secretary and switch board girl a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine and  but I do all the Christmas cards"
"Yeah, I know you do"
"Erm nineteen er probably just about erm nineteen nineteen, nineteen twenty time that one."
"There's another similar loco, Railway, one seventy eight, spinner."
Nottingham behind.
Underneath the old  bridge over the top.
"Again a train to er out to Lincoln, one of the two four Os."
Very much in use on the Lincoln line until certainly during the wars.
Till till about the beginning of the second world war.
Along with and the other guns of four four O.
"Mainstay of the motive power at the n, and on the Nottingham Suburban Services, erm the old er  built erm er round top fire box, with the  safety valves er and erm er  well no condensing here or anything on it."
"And that's got a bell pipe fire box, and er  valves on that."
"Again all in Nottingham Station, on local."
"And there we are ladies and gentlemen, as er all things should finish with the Queen."
Erm
That er concludes my little contribution to the evening's entertainment.
Erm I hope it may be of some interest.
Erm it is I assure you but a fraction of what I've got.
but erm they difficulty is in erm let's say keeping within a couple of hours.
Well that's fantastic..
Erm anyhow thank you er all very much.
Right.
Is there anybody
how you got started singing?
How I got started singing?
Aye.
"Well me, oh, how I got started singing, it was really just  I didn't sing very much really."
My dad was a good singer.
"He wasn't a trained singer or anything, it was, just happened that he, he was a good singer."
My younger brother he's a good singer as well.
But er us
"Did he sing at home, your dad?"
"He just sang round about the house, aha."
They have one now?
They do.
Yes.
Oh!
They suddenly found the room.
Yes  actually.
Well  in a parking block.
Er  would anyone like coffee?
No  thank you.
"one, two."
"Now what was it, I mean  or would you prefer anything else?"
some tea?
Tea?
I'll I'll go and check .
"One thing I  struck me this week there's a new regulation as regard punctures on tyres because I had this completely flat tyre and a whole new set of tyres and I said to him well can't you mend it, can't you put an inner tube in like I I've done before cos there was a nail in it you see."
Yeah.
And I said just get the nail out and re repair the inner tube he said no it's the there's a new regulation  this year that if the outer case of the you know the tyre has
tea.
they're not allowed to repair it because safety regulations because  the whole expanse and then supposedly the actual puncture  comes off.
And I said well what happens to these extra tyres?
Right.
"So he sa , I mean does anybody know anything about anything like that?"
"No, no."
Presum I mean I just lost four
I know this  I just know about about a sort of friend of ours  is making money meanwhile in Germany .
He found  well  of course erm connections so he got the permission through the embassy.
"He's now running lorry loads of worn tyres to Russia, to the Soviet Union and makes money  loads of money because the tyres, they couldn't ha get any tyres so  the tyres he saw there were totally without profile."
You know.
Yeah.
So the old tyres  he could erm find in Germany were a lot better.
He carted them over.
. Making thousands out of it.
"I think they were frightening years ago when they, when we were kids so they're frightening places."
"Well we had no, we had no erm  nothing to stop the pain."
No.
"We had no injections, we were just put in a chair and, and it cost"
That's right
two guineas for every filling
"I know, it's a lot of money."
I mean
"Yeah, week's wages yeah."
"But we, he didn't get more than two or three guineas a week did he when we were first"
"That's right, yeah yes"
"Then we get, I know  our dentist was very good, we've always said that if we had a good dentist and a good doctors we're on our holidays, and we have, we've been lucky wherever we've been"
Mm.
Mm.
"we've had good dentists, good doctors."
Oh it pays you to get a sympathetic one and one that's er not on the
But this one is lovely.
"This one's  young and he's so gentle, you know he"
Yes.
Oh they're marvellous.
"I think that's what Tony's harking back to, the old style when you went and they were a bit er callous."
"Yes indeed well,young, how old is he?"
Twenty  five?
"He's only in his twenties, yeah he ought not, no it wouldn't be would it?"
No.
"Twenty years ago they were, they were alright weren't they?"
What am I thinking about?
No I'm thinking about
"Well you know the first time I went was  oh I dunno, before the war you know when I was about four or five and I went to get one out  I mean my parents"
"but it was terrible I was screaming, I was terrified and, and, and I can still see the place you know, there's something very foreboding about the, the place and the chair was like a"
And everything was hard
wasn't it?
Is it going in The Post?
No.
Didn't we tell you that?
"To have it in er  Daily Post, The Post is the morning one  The Echo's the evening  to have it in for one day in The Post and The Echo, how much?"
"Dunno, about eighty quid."
Three hundred and ninety six pound sixty four pence.
So you said we'll have it in all week?
How big was the advert?
Er about a hundred words in a box.
Two columns wide and  erm eight centimetres down.
We reckoned that was about quarter of a page.
It's a lot of money isn't it?
But see  the reason  I have to send this to Liverpool for them to put it in
Mhm.
cos it has to go through our advertising agents.
Cos we advertise in a special format don't we?
We have the  dash lines round the box
Mm.
and we have the logo on the bottom and that.
So they've had to do it so  I mean she quoted me
thirty six quid for this  thirty six eighty four or something for the local paper.
But erm  you know it might be more but that's
Mhm.
nothing to do with me.
But I mean like  I didn't think it was worth putting it in The Post to start off with anyway.
But if we don't get a good response to this I might stick it in for the day  in The Post.
Mhm.
Is the secretary at  dealing with it or is she gonna forward it all on to you?
No I've put our address.
I said that I didn't like that idea to start off with
No well it
because although it's only a small concern she's gonna have her own stuff to do.
"Right, so that's the temporary staff."
Yep.
"So what we haven't made any progress on  beyond, on that side of things is erm  if we do the coding over in Caernarvon, where that will be."
Yeah.
Erm like I think we all sort of ruled out er
I don't think it's big enough is it?
"Because of the size, no."
Er just out of interest I did ring  the other day
Yeah right.
"Er  the  the room, the smallest room they have is for twenty five to thirty people"
Mm.
which I mean even that may be too big for what we want.
Erm in any case that is in use every week on a Monday and a Wednesday.
So already you're only talking
There was a thing about exams.
Wasn't it  didn't you ring them up and they said we have exams on or something?
No.
That must be something
Something goes on in that room on a Monday and a Wednesday.
Which room is that?
"That's  the, I've got it in the file, a small conference room or something like that, or the committee room or something it's called."
Cos there is a room called the navigation room.
No that wasn't an  that wasn't an option.
There was this one for twenty five to thirty people and then there was another one for say forty or fifty and then it  zoomed up to like a hundred.
And even if we were to use this
"Oh I know now, yes."
"small room, you couldn't leave anything on the walls so it would all be a  come down at night, back up in the morning"
What erm er did you look in the file and see what they hired last time?
Erm  no.
Cos it may
I mean I've probably seen it
Yeah.
they starts running off!
"Well I crapped mesen me, I started running back towards road and they're going Sarah, Sarah come back."
"So I carried on walking and they start going through this bleeding wood, well they had me climbing over three fence things, all like them metal  you know like them metal fences at  wood?"
"Climbing over them, I nearly cut mesen in half."
park.
"Oh yeah we walked past park cos he asked me if I wanted to go on swings  and it led up to his back gate, well, you've never seen me put a sigh of relief on me face, I went"
Is it a longer or a shorter?
It's shorter but it's scarier.
Scarier?
They're on about putting a road round back of there.
Around back of the gardens.
"I tell you something if they put lights up down here I reckon it'd make it even more scary though you know, I don't know why."
Scary.
I hate that road.
Just think there could be dead bodies in
You know what it made me think of?
What?
"Parts of flipping Evil Dead, and they're going ooh there's a house"
Oh I couldn't walk through a wood on a night time.
No way.
We found a tramp in wood once.
Dead?
No.
He were under these covers and erm
Well you were then .
"we walked up we, we thought oh what's this?"
Lifted cover and there were this fella underneath.
"And erm we ran off, I were, we were about sixteen or seventeen  and er  we kept chucking bricks at him."
"He, he was going piss off, piss off."
So you know Dallas?
"He chucked this bit of glass, it cut him so we ran over here."
"And erm  I don't know who it was, he set fire to his quilt"
Get Bert on the phone I want a word with him now.

"I said, I'm frightened someone's in the 'ouse, I'm frightened not waking everybody  well, well what do you do, I says, you don't, unless you have a go, you don't, I mean, if I'd turned out  you know, you don't really know."

"Yes, I said to her, think about it, I I was that frightened, I frightened meself to death, and I I wouldn't I wouldn't."
I hated it.
That's what I used to do every time I thought about selling 'ouse
You just got to do it.
Yeah.
"I thought about it, and thought about it, and then then changed my mind."
But this time I decided it's what I want to do and bugger it.
"If we don't sell it, we we haven't lost anything."
Oh well.
sell it till we move.
I honestly think myself
As long as we're not worse off than what we were before we moved.
"I honestly think meself, that I might have a have a couple of hard months, maybe three, first three months might be a bit difficult for me."
"Oh, it probably will be."
"Well, I think, once he gets established, and once he starts getting work in, I think meself, that work will start, won't say rolling in, but I think the work'll start coming in after about three months and I can get established."
Oh we can always lend you a couple of ten pences.

You you know what's coming.
George Miller called this the span of conception.
The capacity of the brain to conceive or hold on to any information.
You'll see there we've got three boxed a six number a ten number and a twelve number.
What I'm gonna do is just speak out a six digit number.
What I want you to do is try and hold on to it in your brain then when I've finished write it down in the appropriate box and see if you can hold on to it long enough to do that.
"So the first number, listen to this the first number and try and hold on to it."
Three eight one five six two.
Just write that down.
. Okay?
Let's try and ten digit number then.
Listen to ten digits try to hold on to them and then write them down.
"Seven, four, two, nine, eight, one, three, four, seven, six."
I've gone wrong
"Okay, try a twelve digit, just for the experiment."
"Try and hold on to twelve numbers, here we go."
Listen to these.
"Nine, O, five, one, six, two, four, seven, three, eight, two, seven."
". Now that's it's interesting what Joanne said that you you lost it in the middle somewhere, yeah?"
I mean er let's just read them just see how you got on.
"Three, eight, one, five, six, two."
"Okay, Seven, four, two, nine, eight, one, three, four, seven, six."
I've got the  mixed up
"Yeah and nine, O, five, one, six, two, four, seven, three, eight, two, seven"
say that one again
"nine, O, five,one, six, two, four, seven, three , eight, two, seven."
Nearly got it .
So but I mean where was it.
Was it generally in the middle or at one end or
"The first, the first two numbers"
yeah okay

"She says yeah, if I can keep it clean, she got all cushions covered up, well like er, er"
"Keep it clean, there's only them two buggers."
"I know, but what's the point of having a new suite, and having old covers on it like that."
"They make me laugh, when they sit in 'ouse with blanket round them, so they don't have to turn 'eating up."

"Aye, you go in there and it's empty that other"
That's empty.

Don't work.
Aye.
When what?
When I stopped with Colin.
Oh well.
"You don't know how green, how green the grass is until you actually stand"
You can't go till your dad comes.
"Why, I'm going home all by myself, then."
"Well, get off there."
get on with it.
We do
You'll end up with a smack bum.
"Benjy, will you leave her alone."
Are you  have you told her to leave me alone?
But it's still cheaper than a pub.
"Yeah, yeah."
So we'll have  a couple of drinks and that's it for tonight.
Mhm.
"Jane said that last week, cos I thought it was a disco, cos when it first described it me, it was real crap, and there was this colour guy and his friend, and all they wanted to play was  black, they looked like they got no bones when they were dancing."
"You know like, dislocated themselves."
It's really
"Really, oh no."
"And in fact, all they played all night."
"The funny thing was, I find this really amusing, the bloke who was running the disco, he was putting loads of records on, then going dancing."
"Really, excellent."
How was he doing that?
"Yeah, he really did, and the record would end, and then he'd plonk back."
So they were just playing the music that they liked.
It was only those two dancing all night.
"Oh, what."
"That's what made it so obvious, because it was, he would put the records on, and then come out and start dancing, and I thought I'm not going that  No, they played that,sh what's it, shake, shake, shake the room,"
bought that.
"Oh, she didn't, oh remember the other day,Take That."
I didn't ask.
Oh.
I didn't even  supposed
Would it?
"She said, yeah."
"ought to see  lounge, she's got Take That disco, and Take That"
"Oh, Jesus, she's driving us up the wall."
She's trying to go out and get tickets to see 'em.
Is she?
She's got tickets.
"That's the trouble, but we got a note through the door this morning from our friend Kerry."
Don't buy the Take That tickets.
"I'll explain later,and she's  last night ."
"What we did before, was we did counting in flows and circulating."
"I think what we would do  supposing we didn't, supposing we just had  heavy vehicles and light vehicles?"
That's gonna make things a lot easier isn't it?
"Yeah well we, for Queensferry we just had  three classes."
"Motorbikes, cars, light goods  H G V including two three and four axle and buses  for the, for the whole count, now for the samples  Rob didn't even want it classified."
It was just a vehicle regardless  of what it was.
Yeah.
I suppose we could do a classified count  er on the A four eight seven sort of a bit away if we wanted a proper classified count couldn't we?
Yeah.
"Separate, on another day."
Yeah.
Or we could just use whatever we get at the interview side.
Erm  perhaps the thing to do is to look at  how it varied in nineteen eighty six.
Did you get that report out?
Yes you did.
How it varied between the two sides.
There's three thousand one hundred there.
Mhm.
That's two way.
On a twelve hour day.
"So assu you're talking about, well supposing that 's grown, it may be four thousand, so you're talking about two thousand tr vehicles in the interview direction  over twelve hours."
So you're gonna want to interview  forty percent right?
How many do you think you'll need?
"Do you think you'll need  if you have t a team of four on, is that a half team or a six team?"
A half.
A four.
We did have  we worked a six team but it's not as easy to work out.
I'm only thinking that  you've got somebody counting?
Yeah.
There's one person counting?
Two.
Two people counting.
"Right, does Saria had a form, she must cos you said she's booked, Peter have you g , Peter you've got forms have you?"
"Don't think she has got a form, no, Alma have you got any spare forms for that."
"No, I think I've distributed them all, didn't I?"
Mm.
We could get one from British Section couldn't we?
"You think, I thought you said she's booked, she hasn't booked."
"Oh no, she's definitely wants to go, but she hasn't actually filled out the form ."
"Well, she's, she's going to it ."
"Erm, yeah I think she said she'd get one directly."
Erm.
"I think er, I guess that any individual members would get them in their, erm journal."
Yes.
"I might, I might, yes, we, I, well, I'll, looks like it ."
"I'm an individual member, perhaps I've done, got round to opening the  ."
"I'm not sure, I'm not sure, they, they have been there  ."
That's possible .
.
Quite happy you know telephone them to send on
"Ah, right, well, we'll just check, yeah."
"Cos that's  when, when, when we get to that nearer the date, we could, we could just, you know, when you're confirmed that you've been booked and you're definitely going, erm we could look at the finances and see how much we could afford to, to give, erm, something to each person to help with,eit either with the accommodation or, or the transport."
Mm.
"Cos the accommodation is quite a bit, isn't it?"
"It's fifty , sixty or more, probably more this time."
No .
Seventy six pounds .
It's seventy six pounds .
Mm.
More of sixty five last year.
"Mm, yes."
Erm.
"That's nice, I'm, it's very good that people are going anyway, it's got"
That's for the whole weekend
"Imagine what it'd be like, when it's really cold."
"And I thought to myself, oh gosh, just drive up there,"
Yeah.
it's only a ten minute drive.
Yeah.
I picked the right time.
"See that's the thing, if I wanna go and do my studying, I can't just go, I have to  and, and dinner starts at erm, if I've got a lecture, my lecture is sort of one o'clock."
Just before one o'clock and the bus goes at five past one.
So I haven't got time to get any dinner.
No.
See what I mean?
"Well, what about"
No.
"So I have to get a bit, er jump on the bus, and then erm, either get something to eat at their college, but then, by that time, you see, cos dinner starts at quarter to twelve, it's all gone."
"And we went there last time, and all they had left was chips and this fatty stew."
"Er, that's"
And that's it.
"No veggies or nothing, no salad."
No veggies
No.
Oh dear
"So, it's, alright it's not a major problem, but that's the only difficulty with it is it's not, it's good having the bus service where you don't have to pay, right, if you don't, like I didn't realize the bus went at five past one, and I was all ready to go, and er, it was ten past one, and I thought, oh no, so I had to wait till three o'clock."
Do some work.
That's a bit silly really.
"Yeah, and then the next bus from six o'clock, is eight o'clock."
And that's the last bus home.
You would have thought these buses would
"It's only a ten minute, it's about a ten minute journey from Digby to Southlands."
Fifteen to Southlands to Whiteland.
"It's all round in a circle, it's not like then, I don't know why."
How peculiar.
"Yeah, it is a bit of a pain."
Yes.
Bring that ball here!
You got no bloody chance!
"But as I say, people believe everything, it's gospel!"
And you never hear the Labour party criticising.
"You know, but they should be  criticised out of hand what's going on in this country but they bloody don't!"
Well when when  if if the Labour party criticised  and they do criticise
"Oh they criticise Ken, yeah."
"The only time that you will hear about it is whe , if you have the television on  and you see it happening on the parliament  and on your papers."
Well you read your paper don't you?
And we get a middle of the road one which is the Observer
We we'll watch
"which is, they get some  they do some pretty good"
"But how often do the  I mean, they  they don't give you  they don't give you every detail that's gone on all week!"
Oh no they're  or there's certain ar
they only pick
a certain subject or
Yes.
whatever that's been thrashed.
"As you say , we'll see."
Well  he's gone on  seven days of the week  complaining about so and so  we'll just narrow that down to one article about his  his complaint that they may just make a little note  he's complained seven times about this!
So you see a little article
That's right.
he's not complaining!
"Yeah, but I mean basic things Ken, we'll take for example"
the low wages
Yeah.
"we, we haven't got one now, they got one in Germany, they got one in France  I in"
Yes.
Italy.
Well yes.
"Oh there we go, that was mistake number one  George dear have you read the er holiday page at all?"
And I was to show him what to do and I made sure that all .
On the first day I made sur I stayed with that man all day.
As I said I stayed with that man all day.
Although I wouldn't t in interfere with  show him how to do the job and  er I would make sure he understood the job.
If he asked me such and such I'd say now this is how you do it.
"If he said to me, after I'd shown him, that he understood it, I would say alright, show me how you do it."
And then that way the man learnt.
Mm.
The man himself learnt.
"And usually the man telling me he understood if eventually when he starts the job, he hasn't understood at all, he's just saying so, but I wanted to prove to the man himself that he could do it and prove to myself that he could do it."
So I was in a safe  and so was the man.
But
So you were given the responsibility then to train people up?
given the first in this .
Now then that were left on the
Did erm do you still keep up your union er membership right away when you were
"Oh yes, oh yes."
"Aye, yes ."
"In fact I were shop steward in the, in the building trade, I was a shop steward in the building trade."
Mm what did you go on to do after that?
After the business folded?
Was there anything like erm redundancy money or anything like that payed at that time when the place
Er
folded?
And can you remember what year it was?
Oh it's about
Just roughly.
"fifty, fifty seven I think."
It was somewhere thereabout.
Mhm.
And they didn't have all this er legislation about redundancy money or anything then?
No no.
But what if they don't.
You've lost all your  ain't ya.
"Ya, so that's  the end of the world."
Even if you find out they won't.
No.
Why don't you get a free  put on market.
"No, the on the company's, that's coming up with all the money got to"
Oh aye.
do the valuation.
"And they ought to form  value of what, so they know how much it's worth, what the company that's gonna earn them the money want the money for the valuation."
It's just another way of making a bit more money out it.
That's it.
"Well, it's same as when you buying and selling 'ouses."
"You  when it comes out, when, the people that's, mind me cigarette, darling, the people that's gonna buy your 'ouse, who, mortgage company comes out and values it, they've got that to pay as well haven't they."
Yeah.
"The same as, I, them that buys our 'ouse, they'll have to pay whatever it cost for 'em to value our 'ouse, see if it's worth lending money, we'll have the same thing with er bungalow, down there."
Yeah.
"It's only money  I mean, how long are they 'ere."
Yeah.
Ten minutes.
"Mean, that woman come out, when when we had this done, didn't she,"
Mm.
To to see if it were satisfac she weren't here three minutes.
No.
"What was that for, for"
You know when we had extension put up.
"Oh yeah, yeah,"
"Well,"
Did it  value.
"They sent they sent 'em out from er, Abbey National and we had to pay, well we did pay 'im fifty pound, people that put the building on paid."
she keeps getting up.
She's not.
I know they don't like it
"No, er, no especially with a band saw, cos"
Oh hello
"Hello Margaret, well"
"twenty years ago and, and, and they really had to"
and the whole band saw gotta to be resharpened he said and they go to a place in
Most of them don't do their own now do they?
No
"We used to have a shop you know, a saw doctor shop"
I
"when I had the time, did them all tension and set, you know, but erm, as you say now, they probably cost you about fifty pound a go every time they go away"
Yeah it's a
I don't fancy doing by hand
"Well, even that little one of mine"
"No I mean even with a hand saw, you know, I've done it before"
"You had to wait, wait about twenty eight before you went on top I believe I don't know"
"Yes, yes, oh yes"
"and er all his brothers ev , every one of them went, they served their time and"
"and er, it was er, the others were by having the lads and getting the trees down, er the extra wood that they got out of the er, out of the tree"
"they lost so many with, with the thickness of the blade"
"Oh I see, yes, yes, yeah, yeah"
"that's right, yeah"
I think
"bloody hell, that must of been hard work that, they must of been at it all day"
"Yeah, yeah"
"How did they keep, how did they stop the flaming thing from snaking them all, you know?"
I don't know
It must of had a good iron in it.
"Must of had terrific arms on them, oh dear me"
Yeah and I used to see them many a times in
"and what they'd leave them to what, then to, to dry wouldn't they at least?"
"Oh I, yeah"
"Like, I really felt abused."
I mean at the time
Ya.
"I felt sorry for him but  I must admit when I got home and the following morning, and since then I've felt quite angry about it."
That's
The next
isn't it?
the next time you see the girls in the choir
I'll bet they'll turn round and say
"Well I, er, he ca , he was, he was then"
be careful of whatever his name is.
he was then saying erm  now what about a concert this Friday?
"Erm, there's such and such going on."
"And there's one er  a week on Saturday, you know, let's go to both of those and I said erm  I'm away those weekends."
"I said, I'm going away this weekend, I'm going away next weekend"
"Yeah, let's not."
and he said erm  have you got your diary with you?
And I said no.
"And he said, hadn't you better check?"
"And then he said, I don't mean to put pressure on, but I want to get to know you, we've got so much in common and erm  I want to take you out for dinner, not just go to the concert, but, we don't get to know each other that way."
"I'll come down to Richmond and take you out for dinner, how does that sound?"
"I said, I'll see you at choir."
But we don't get to see each other at the choir
"erm, because you don't stay back for a drink afterwards because you're going to Strawberry Hill."
"I know it'll be easier when you're in Fulham, blah, blah, blah, but erm  pressure!"
Pressure.
Pressure.
Pressure.
Crowding me in.
And then he said
"Then it's , it's better to have a two-timer from"
then he said I'm lonely.
"Having came to the  he was hungry, so he was glad to be h hired by a local farmer as a swine herd."
"Even the pods he was giving to the pigs, he would have liked to have eaten himself."
"He decided to go home, and offer to be a servant instead of a son."
"But his father was overjoyed to see him, and at once threw a party."
His elder brother coming home from the fields and hearing dancing enquired what was going on.
"When he heard the explanation, and that even the best calf had been killed, the fatted calf had been killed, to help the party he was furious."
And that is understandable.
"At this point, we are then asked to consider, does the elder brother become the family black sheep, is there a sort of change of position."
I don't know what
I wouldn't think so.
No.
a brother.
The story makes its point to the finish.
Mm.
Mm.
"So th they,yo yo you couldn't see a situation where the person who er was previously in disgrace, was no longer in disgrace, and the one, the the the brother, then showing je jealousy, was himself in disgrace."
Sounds like fiction.
Sounds like fiction.
"No, it's just the father's attitude that changed, not the way that"
Mm.
Mm.
"Well, he, he was repentant, he was only repentant because he was hungry."
"Yes, yes, yeah, yeah."
"Can you stop being a black sheep then, did did did he stop being a black sheep when he came back."
"Was that the end of the story, as Trevor was saying."
"Well, he certainly gave the father the opportunity to say, I told you so."
Mm.
Mm.
"Done, Yeah"
Mm.
Or he could say I was one
"I was one of the black sheep, but I'm no longer."
day in day day out
True.
and it wasn't one of ours that dropped their whip
That's true.
out there so you know you can criticize .
Talking of the whip I mean we're only allowed to hit them five times over here.
In America they seem to hit them twenty five times
And in all sorts
everywhere they want to
anywhere they want to
Yeah
So  but there it's it's a very interesting point there because a lot of our young boys now the Dow Holland Alan Munroes are riding more the American style.
It's an interesting point.
I don't think he's right in what he says but I think it might have been a bit tongue in cheek as well.
They certainly weren't saying it about Lester Piggott on Royal Academy a couple of years back either.
No but I did say about it Lester Piggott on  a few weeks ago .
Yes.
Lester Piggott when he won on .
Mm.
And the next    .
Very good.
Very good impression.
Talking of Lester Piggott he of course was the winner of the first ever Channel Four personality of the year trophy which we awarded for the first time last year.
He was a guest on the morning line at Newmarket and there it is that magnificent  trophy which is valued at five thousand pounds.
Now we couldn't have him in this year to give the others a chance so this is how you voted for the nineteen ninety three racing personality of the year on Channel Four and let's take it in reverse order starting with the person who finished fourth.
In fourth place one of the hardest working and most successful trainers in Britain Jack Barry.
He polled nine percent.
In third place the most successful jockey in the history of national hunt racing Peter Scudimore.
He polled eleven percent.
Runner-up the ever popular Willie Carson.
Willie received seventeen percent of the overall votes.
So who did you vote for?
Playing with me knobs.
Look hang on I've got one queu are you all right there Rachael?
Hello.
"Do you get fed up with people saying, Are you really like that one in Coronation Street?"
No I don't actually cos I'm  nothing like her .
Erm
You look similar.
Well that's er that's a insult.
It's not.
It is.
Yeah.
I thought when we did we did that programme out to lunch in the summer and you came along and we talked all about buses and er your organization and I I I was very nice to you actually.
You were very pleasant.
"And didn't say you know, It's flipping these tour buses in York that cos all the other people trouble because you can't get anywhere they clog the roads up."
Well that's really not our problem I mean that's to do with the deregularization of er bus companies allowing any anybody to start up a bus company.
Oh that's a bit political Rachael isn't it a bit political I wasn't expecting that
featured the last er three years some of the  other companies have only been here since last year and the year before so I mean we're a national tour operator
experienced in running open topped tours around cities.
Could you hang on just a minute don't go away just stay there hold on.
Ah Rita.
Yes James.
Good.
Sorry about that
Still here.
What?
I said I'm still here.
You had to go off and make his nosh didn't you?
No I didn't he's in the kitchen being a very very domesticated husby and he's making own nosh.
He's not is he?
Yeah he is oh heck I've got to get the news in haven't I that worries me.
Well don't worry if you ask him nicely he might even make you a bacon sandwich.
Would he?
"Yeah, right."
"Right, is there anything else?"
"So, yeah there is."
Erm  things like whether I'm using my car and stuff I suppose I need to speak to Mike about?
I haven't done anything about that.
Right.
Erm
erm statutory undertakers?
Bus companies
Yes we'll need to write to all those and  we'll need to write  we need to write to the police
Yeah.
on  in two guises don't we?
Partly because we're doing a survey but partly to warn  partly because of the emergency services aspect.
Yeah.
"So we need to write to the police to er  I suppose the thing to do is we write in a general way to the, the Chief Constable, North Wales police"
Yeah.
which is I think in Colwyn Bay
Yeah it is.
"and  but when it comes to actually organising the police control of the survey sites, we, we speak to the erm  traffic inspector at wherever it is."
I'm not sure
Right so who did you say in Colwyn Bay?
What what
Just write to the Chief Constable.
I think we need to write three letters.
"One to the police, one to the ambulance, one to the fire brigade  just saying  we're proposing to do them."
Obviously that'll have to be when we've fixed the sites
Yeah.
and the dates are on.
Yeah we'll do this
But that's normal.
"general letter to the police saying that we're intending to do these surveys, just putting them in the picture and put a note in that erm  once, you know, dates and whatever, you know, we'll give you further details as and when we know"
"Well I wouldn't, I don't think I'd worry about writing to them until we've got the dates."
Yeah.
"if they don't, that's it."
"They don't come and look at your 'ouse, they come have a look at what they can do with it, you now, have a look like, why you got extension and,"
I don't mind beds being untidy and things like that.
No.
"I mean, you don't look at, your not, who's sleeping in your bed."
"When ours were, it was a right state when we looked at ours, but we still said we'd have it."
"Mind, it's just that, it's worth nowt as we've  name it."
We'll get it right one day.
"One day, Karen, one day."
When the moon comes up and it's in two.
When the
You got two moons.
"Yeah, all I wanted was go in and, now we're bankrupt and we're nowt where we are."
If we were well off we could get it done.
"You'd be employing, you'd be employing builders to come in and do it for you."
"Yeah, that's what I said, it'd be nice, wannit."
It would.
your half of next door to get some

He needs somebody.

"But we don't know how long it'll be, before get any money coming in, and if you go on to family credit, you get it for six months, so that'll be our wages."
"So then, what what comes out of business we'll pay him anyway."
Yeah.
"You might have too much in bank for family credit, that ten thousand, it's only eight, innit?"
"It's got, it's gotta know what  increase, when you running a business."
Yeah.
"Oh, I don't know."
"If you apply for it straight away, could you say you don't know how much monies coming in."
How much money your gonna coming in.

"Well today, poll tax has now gone up one pound, but for the old fogies it's gone down one pound"
"well the phrase at the end, I'm just about get , but,"
Yeah
"get the phrase in the end, it's, what we've done is, at the end they go, they do a"
"rolling, rolling down the river, rolling, rolling, down the river, rolling, rolling down the river"

"Yeah, I"
"I like do the Tom and, I won't, Tom and Jerry, I might do the Tom Jones one, cos I, I feel comfortable at"
Which I don't
You don't have to be beautiful
then then reshape the inside.
Yeah.
Er something before I I always forget everything.
The German Friends of the Earth's people told me never to do the washing on Monday mornings.
I mean that's something to put there as well I think.
Because  it's a peak time for electricity and the Electricity Board  er produces according to peak demands.
That's got nothing to do with recycling has it?
No.
I know but
No.
But you do you think honestly though that that really does still hold true because if everyone ha mostly having automatics now you just wash as you go you don't have a washing day or is it specially Monday they
Like I've got just automatically I wanted to do washing this morning.
Really?
I don't.
"I just put it, when it gets too bad you know if haven't got any clothes to"
It's an interesting though.
I didn't know that they produced according to peak
"Yeah, I think it's important to know"
"It's very important to know, yes."
erm  whatever.
Don't do it Monday mornings.
I usually do mine at midnight when I get home!
Yes.
A lot of people do it overnight
Yeah.
but it's not really a good idea because if something goes wrong with your machine
you're not there to deal with it.
I mean I've had mine flood and I've had its thermostat go and it boiled everything.
I mean that would have been a disaster I mean it's only because I was upstairs and I thought oh I can smell boiling.
You know it was like when you boil up hankies I thought what a!
. There was dye came out of everything it was awful.
And another time it was all pouring all over the floor
"and er, like Christmas, erm, they have these things on the telly when there's about, every, every night there's like a fifteen minutes' programme, just before the close-down, of like, B B C One."
One?
"And there's people, like famous people of the telly just sitting and talking erm, and saying prayers every night, and walking around a typical area that means something to them."
Oh.
"And we watched it one night, and it was Mrs Hewitt off Eastenders."
"Oh, really?"
"And er, she was really"
"by Michael Aspel, weren't she, or Michael Parkinson?"
between them.
Yeah.
Aspel tomato.
"Erm, and so, we had a good old walk around there, and like this place where she was, I swear it's Highgate Cemetery where she was talking,"
"Oh, really?"
"and like she was pointing different things out about this cemetery, and, I mean, you know, you there can't be many cemeteries"
No.
"like that in, in London and she was in London, but we missed the beginning of it,"
Oh.
"and erm, mum was sorry that Mark had been on about it, she said, oh I bet that's where he goes, and erm, like the park beside it was just lovely,"
Yes.
"the whole thing, really, really nice area, and er, all just minutes away from central London, you know."
Oh.
"It was, it was really good."
Had a really nice three hours.
And er
Oh that was nice.
"Then he's gone off to Coventry, and then over to Manchester."
"So er,"
It's quite  to get on with your bruv .
"Yeah, because you know, we're always messing about, or  around, or, you know, never like you know, together, really"
Yeah.
"Because even when I go up to his place, like it's always been, like dropping him off, always being in a hurry."
"I mean, I sat in his room, had a coffee today, it was like, I actually sat here and relaxed and always being on the move, you know."
"Oh well, according to that it's cloud."
"At least it's a white cloud, not a black one"
Did you see your mother?
"No but I get a message, will you tell my brother, no don't tell my brother, they said, she said to one of the nurses and they said, your brother?"
"No, my son."
I said well what did don't you have to tell me?
"She said, we're not gonna tell you."
So I didn't get to know what what they didn't have to tell
Oh.
What was she doing tonight?
I don't know
"Mostly dry, sunny spells"
"Mostly dry, sunny spells"
Sally was quite intrigued by that
We'll have to get her a set of books.
"There's some bottles, jars, for the bottle bank as well"
"You know the last time you  the erm, the last time you missed the television pages, television supplement in the  out of the Mirror."
I don't think they believed me.
And it's erm it'll be twice in a month and Chris is back again as our paper boy.
The other one was so useless but according to the er that new manager in the paper shop everyone else got theirs.
So I said I'm sorry but I'm not included in everyone else and he gave me one.
The Radio Times?
Why?
Because it's got all the
Ah.
Are we staying up all Thursday night?
"Well, it's up to you ."
"Of course, well you could stay in bed all day on Friday  And I could take the kids to schools and go back"
"I need to go, I need to go into the Co-op and Iceland."
What shall I get for your mother?
I'll get some chocolate biscuits I think.
"You would think she would put on a lot of weight, wouldn't you?"
"No, would you tell me what sort of word it is remembering what we did at the beginning of the week"
"yeah, but that's the, what it means, I want to know what kind of a word it is"
Yes I know it's spelt
Is it a verb?
"No it's not a verb, come on, what is it"
A noun
"Yes it's a noun, it's a name of something isn't it?"
"Because we were doing that at the beginning of the week, a scare, you could actually get"
"right, so can you put it back into, into a sentence again then"
Shirley?
"You've got a scare on, I saw Dracula"
"We've got a scare on, we saw Dracula, yes, that was it."
Right what's the next word?
Share
"Share, what does share mean?"
You share out
"You share out, can you put that in a sentence?"
I like to share out my sweets
"Oh that's lovely, I like to share out my sweets"
digging
"Digging, they're going onto double Gs now, why would it be double G?"
One put dig and then and then -ing
"Yes, but there is a rule isn't there"
Oh yeah
"Ah yes, Trevor"
"because, because, is it cos of erm, if you put D"
"no, not quite, you're nearly right, come on"
Is it because the I sounds like
"yes you would actually get, a magic E right, or a magic I making that vowel right say its long name, so it would be quite difficult to say dig giding"
"Right, lets try the next one, what's the next one?"
er bigger
"bigger that's for the same reason, there you've got an E, and so because you've got the E we can double the G to make the I go on, go on say short for"
And the bus left at a quarter past eight.
Hour and a quarter.
I could have travelled home.
Yeah.
Bloody hell.
"Honestly, it was just sitting there, we were just not moving."
"Well, you probably know what it's like, I was just sitting there."
"Is it, is your parking permit saying what college you're at?"
"Yeah, I have to."
"I'm not allowed to park in their colleges, other colleges."
See what I mean?
Yeah.
So I can't drive there
Said you can't get on the bus either .
No.
That's what I said.
"Well, the good thing is, where Southlands is, which is on the south  which is a very nice area."
"Well, it's not that nice, but there's a hell of a lot of little roads, all around it, it's not a like Roundtree is, is it?"
"It's just on a little main road, but it's situated almost in this housing estate."
"They must say, God they must get pissed off with it, so I've already looked around, and there's loads of parking places,"
Mm.
"there's no yellow lines, there's loads of little roads."
That's true.
"I mean, I could park it there, if Nicole didn't want to drive."
"But the, the bus, the erm  staggered."
"You got a bus at eight fifteen, and you got another bus at one o'clock, and you got another bus at three o'clock, and another bus at six"
You serious?
"and, and if you wanna come home, there's supposed to be a bus at half past four, and our lecture finished at quarter to four, so you like, three quarters of an hour to get to the bus, right, and then it didn't turn up."
"So we had to wait for the next bus, which was six o'clock."
Oh no.
It's a long time.
"We were sitting like this, sitting on the pavement, with our umbrellas up"
One girl nearly got knocked off going up Newtown Road.
It's really quite narrow as you're going up there.
What about the  all the cars all parked round corners everywhere like up at Havers.
Mm.
They could do something about that.
Have you every cycled up there?
"Not round Havers,wh they park where those, those sort of shops are  they they park all around the corners so that you have to go out round them."
And of course you meet something coming the other way  wrong side of the road.
Oh yeah.
What annoys me is that everybody parks on the pavement as well.
Mm.
Seem to disobey all laws there are about parking.
"It does, it doesn't really help us does it?"
Do you wanna pass  these around as well if anyone wants to look.
All the replies  got eleven or so replies that I've had for that questionnaire.
There are a few people  willing to help  aren't.
"But I  haven't gone really as I hoped cos I'd envisaged having the membership list with sort of names of who'll make cakes, who'll help on the stall and then know who to phone"
Yeah.
"when I wanted some help or  who to invite to meetings but  because I haven't got a reply from everyone  or most people, it can't work does it?"
Is that all the replies you got?
sent more than fifty out.
I did sixty and Caroline copied even more .
She's a good girl.
Did Georgina reply?
"Erm  did actually, yes."
"Yeah, cos when I phoned she said she's still quite interested."
Mm.
Yeah I thought she was
but she said if the baby .
And  I've got a local group summer questionnaire which I couldn't really fill in.
. Isn't it awful!
I thought I'm just as bad as you know everybody else really.
How many people have said that they're going so far?
Well er me and Steve and Mark and you you're going
Yeah.
too aren't you?
So that's four of us definitely going to.
Erm Alison  says she'd like to but her you know it depends on this that and the other.
Yeah.
I I'm definitely going to  I picked this up from the information places.
It's got all a list of all sort of bed and breakfasts and
Oh.
holiday flats and things.
And the holiday flats in here are quite expensive.
But bed and breakfast are all very cheap.
Erm you know.
Where whereabouts is this is it?
I don't know she didn't say.
Didn't that's one thing I don't know .
Cos if it's two or three miles away it's gonna be a bit of a problem.
Yes that's right.
Erm I I need to check that.
How how much erm are the B and Bs?
Well quite cheap.
I mean about ten pound is the cheapest and perhaps even twelve .
The the extra advantage of the of the house would be cooking which we may get.
Because if if people took advantage of the of these facilities it would make the whole business an awful lot cheaper for them.
And if there's four of us there definitely then that's we only each have to cook once while we're there.
Yeah.
to get out of conference  to go to cook.
If it's close.
Yeah.
If fact it's it's I found it in the past to be a welcome very welcome break from the atmosphere because you can't hang around in in the dining hall without talking a Green Party.
As I remember it conference tends to run through until  new clients so.
Makes a little noise click click click click.
Can I have a chip does anybody hi Rita
Hi.
Lovely Rita meter
Oh don't please.
I hate that isn't it awful to be obvious.
Well that's what everybody sings to me when them and they meet me for the first time or get introduced to me.
Oh they don't.
Where are you calling from we're very loud with callers today I know I'm not the most exciting thing on radio but you know there must be some callers out there somewhere?
Where am I.
I'm at a little place called Ellenthorpe.
Ellenthorpe.
Is the weather as bad as people keep telling me because it was Okay when I drove in this morning.
"No it's not it's it's quite mild, there's no frost on the ground it's all gone."
So what's this about snow at Thirsk?
Well they can keep it we don't want it.
Bit strange in Thirsk anyway I thought.
I think there'd probably somebody with expanded polystyrene ceiling that's been pulled out.
Probably.
Yeah it's it's actually it's not too bad it's a bit misty it's a bid hazy erm slight wind but it's not bad.
It's not?
No it's not bad
No Okay.
I've just got to get something do you mind?
No go and get your chips or whatever.
No I've got I've got  I wanted t
It's all right my hubby can wait for his lunch I aren't bothered.
Jolly well ought to as well.
Er I wanted to talk to Jim Bowen you see about this quiz show host ought to be a a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home.
Well I must admit James I've threatened to put mine on.
Have you?
Well Karen said that if I won the competition she'd ring back.
Mm mm mm mm.
"he's very  fast  er, deduced  comedy."
There's a lot going on  at a very fast speed.
Which makes
Well I thought it was quite farce like.
Sorry?
I've seen the play and I thought it was quite like a farce.
You know
Yeah.
like
Okay.
But
"this is rather what  what it, makes it difficult is that  I had a copy as well farce  right, but don't say farcical."
That's got different meanings.
"Er, like farce  okay?"
As in this.
Any other things that made it  made it difficult for you to read?
So it's only the language?
"The language, if it had been translated in modern language there'd be no, no problem?"
Were there are any reasons?
"It's supposed to be a play, I suppose you have to watch it."
"When we were reading it I found that I was just reading it as a book and the  and that all the coming about you forget who's in, who's there and who's not there."
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
"More, again, much more by the shape of it, an intensely visual dramatic play, that relies on you being able to see"
spatially  in terms of space  on the  stage.
"People knocking on doors, people hiding behind things, people coming on in costume."
"You know, on the page you can't work out  why erm,is suddenly called  erm  nuns, somebody called the Captain, you know, you, you, you think these are three different characters."
"On the stage you wouldn't make that mistake, you'd be able to keep track of the identity."
"So, another reason  that just adds that  is the element of disguise."
"In Shakespeare  you know, you haven't got that many disguises going on."
Mhm.
the ins and outs.
Mhm.
But that happens all over.
"Mhm, what's the pay like compared to other factories in the area?"
It's quite low.
Is it?
Mhm.
Because er  how many years ago is it?
"Seven or eight years ago we, we, we're on piecework, we made our own wage."
"Er and most of us had in excess of a hundred pound, maybe a hundred and six, a hundred and ten pound, but when this guy bought place over, there was a kind of flat rate, and we'd to drop sixteen pounds to ninety"
Mm.
pounds.
"Well at the time you're thinking, God that's better than twenty or twenty five pound if you were unemployed,"
That's right.
"on the brew, kind of thing."
Mhm.
"So you jumped at the chance, but it is, I think th th poverty wage in Europe is it not, not about a hundred and forty, a hundred and forty five pounds?"
"Well we're nowhere near that, nowhere near that."
"Mm, that's right, mm."
That's why when I hear my daughter talking about getting fifteen or twenty K a year I'm going  it would pay me two or three years  for God's sake.
You can look after me then.
But saying that if you want a decent wage in here you have to work a lot of overtime.
Yes.
And most people do.
Mm.
Because er i from the management point of view if you have got four hundred people and you work a lot of overtime that saves you having six or seven hundred people.
Mhm.
And if you want to cut back you can either cut down on your workforce or you can cut down in the
Mhm.
overtime.
"In my department just now they're working seven days a week,"

"We know what the Conservative party thought of Michael Heseltine this week, they cheered him to the echo when he strode on to the platform at Blackpool."
But what does Michael Heseltine think of the party?
And of the direction it has now taken.
"In today's programme he gives us an exclusive interview, the first since his heart attack four months ago."
don't we?
Well we wanna know whether we were gonna try and do them all in that week?
Twenty seventh of April.
Monday Tuesday Thursday.
I think the plan that goes to  to the police  thank you  needs to show the i interview sites on it.
"You remember we had, on the Ormskirk one we did one that had a study area on it?"
Yeah.
But we also had one  that showed the individual locations.
Yeah.
And I think that was the one that went to the police.
Right.
"Er and the fire brigade and, and so on."
Yeah cos they'll want to know.
Well that's it.
Yeah.
"And all you're doing is warning them that they will, the things will be there and we'll make sure that if a  emergency vehicle comes along  erm"
But they will know your precise dates won't they?
Well they'll want to know precise dates.
I can't remember that we did actually.
"No I don't know whether we do give them, even  the precise dates."
"It isn't really much use then is it, just giving them  a rough ?"
Well it's only a warning.
"Well we'll have a look back in, I'll have a look back in the file and see what we did last time."
"Erm  Do you wanna do that, have a look at what we'd said in Ormskirk"
Yeah.
on that side of things?
Yeah.
I think I wrote to them if I remember rightly.
Well I didn't.
Erm  now we need to do something about layout plans.
So we need to get some  if we're going to work on ordnance survey ones we'll need to sort something on that.
Have to have a chat with   Anyway you're not in an immediate rush to do that are you?
Yeah
"They come through the doorstep, through the doors though."
Through the door they they just throw them away.
They didn't read them.
"I said well don't you live in Stortford, didn't you have it delivered?"
No.
And I'm sure they'll pick them up if they see them in the
If they printed
print them up and they do it on their own  will.
Couldn't we do it with him?
With him?
Well yeah pro
I mean they could couldn't they sponsor us to do it or something?
"Well yeah I I've I've  whether he  well I mean if, if he's gonna do this seven page thing then  I you know I  you can look at it two ways."
Either we can influence and help that to be  to be good or or  you know if that's a failure then  see whether they can help us to produce one for the town.
Mm.
I mean I'd much rather they do it  if we can influence him enough.
They've got the right information.
"Well the thing if we did it with our  as they keep saying there's some, there's so much in the pipeline."
I mean it might take us another  two week two months before we get it out.
Three months.
Well
I would say six months.
Yeah
No I would just think of something really straightforward.
"They do want stuff on local levels I mean if he's East Herts he's got a huge area, hasn't he?"
Yeah.
It it might be a help to him to have little local groups that  helped him out with these things.
But I mean if we print something and then suddenly they instal all these new bottle banks which we didn't know about.
Then they are not mentioned
Well
in our recycling directory and we can do the next one
And then you'll need a P S V
Well
licence.
"but, but that's, that's  that's easily remedied if you could get a er  a driving licence holder  to take them  oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents  or somebody who could take the children, er, periodically in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing."
So that was a possibility.
But I haven't seen Miss  about all these sort of things.
"But I did also say  to Mrs , that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September, that it might be better to discuss it with them  after I've discussed with Miss ."
I only know one person  I only know one bus driver with children.
There's ambulance drivers.
And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic School.
Er  this  letter from the Multiple Sclerosis
Yes.
Says any
that says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're not
To sixteen.
you're not reducing the size of the bus.
Well I think that's crazy.
And someone who's been just used to driving a car  are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra
Well
tuition?
"Well I, I"
Whether it's got  whether it's got sixteen people in it or  twenty nine
Well er
it doesn't alter the length of the bus.
I drive the minibus at the hospital
I know.
"which only takes four wheelchairs  and of course there's the drivers of, of the minibus things that bring them."
"I think, I, I would query that anyway, that just"
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
No.
and just drive
"It does actually say together with other said officers and committee members as shall be determined by a general meeting, so if we wish to elect or choose somebody else we can do."
"Erm, but there's be a good idea to have"
She's taken someone's .
"Well I think, we'll, we'll see what, we'll see what comes, if somebody else wishes to compete, compete for the Chair, the post of Chair, erm, then you may perhaps like to invite them to share the Chair with you, or, or, they can become the, the Vice Chair."
"Erm, erm, only too willing to welcome competition cos they're all to aware of my short comings, mm."
Mm.
"Erm, so."
"Well, if, if there isn't anybody else who wishes to  compete with you for the Chair, er, then I think there ought to be a Vice Chair."
Yeah.
Right.
"Now the other thing about, about the meeting is erm, we sometimes arrange for sort of special refreshments or something different in that line, it's at Ann's house, erm do you want, do you want us to do anything about that Ann or?"
"Yeah, interested in any spare wine glasses please."
Sorry?
"Bring some spare wine glasses, I've , I've got some wine glasses."
Wine glasses
"What we have, wine and soft drinks and"
What you want six?
Cheese and biscuits?
"A little bit of that yes, to have afterwards mm?"
.
Cracker wheat.
Cheese
.
"Cheese and biscuits, she's saying."
"What do, do you want help with that Ann, would you like people to bring some or, or, or what?"
.
"Mm, well confir you can confirm with Mary, I think Mary's offer to  possibly."
"Shall I, shall I leave you and Mary to sort that out?"
Okay.
"Between you, mm, mm."
What date is it?.
"I'm not sure what date it is, I haven't got it on here have we really."
"I mean really it, it's erm  er we, we have a form don't we we, we use when people are interviewed for something or other?"
"Well if we put their name and address and phone number on it, I mean  it's probably just as well to use a standard thing that you can xerox."
Yeah.
Maybe Jim and I could
And when they ring up
do that this avo
Yeah.
"When they ring up we can just say oh yes, what's your ?"
Now look this is meant to record
"this, this, this is meant to record"
"life as it is lived, English as she is spoken."
You're not meant to bite your tongue like that.
Right.
Yeah if we
You can swear in the privacy of your own home.
It was your company that I didn't want to swear in front of
not the tape actually
yes alright
"No if we er do something so as they have a checklist and we can all, you know like me and Jim say, have a copy to say oh right, can we take your name and address, telephone number"
"And if you've got a pad of them or or, or some by you you can just fill it in and let it go through."
Yeah that'd be a good idea
Write the name and address and phone number down and then
Yeah.
it's there.
Okay I'll buy that.
Cos you you'll almost certainly need to ring them back.
Yeah.
Even if it's to say erm
Oh sorry!
sorry we've got enough.
Yeah okay.
"Erm and that also makes sure, if you've got it all in front of you, erm that ensures that you're getting all the information that you need rather than thinking oh hang on, what else do I need sort of thing."
Do we need them
Bilingual?
bilingual?
They can't have been bilingual last time because they were hired from Staffordshire County Council.
No.
And the other thing er if they  they just haven't got anything like that.
Yeah.
They use sort of blank
Wasn't there a big fuss though because  there wasn't enough effort made on the bilingual side  the last survey we did?
I don't think so was there?
There's a letter in the file
Well that's
about erm why we didn't use bilingual staff for one of the particular dates.
"Erm it come from the county surveyor, apparently he'd had complaints."
But I mean it was purely a re a recruiting problem.
"Er you know erm the letter, the reply went back from Dave  saying that every  you know, possible thing was done to  get bilingual staff but at the end of the day  you know they couldn't come up with the goods."
"I mean the lengths they went to advertising, I hope we're gonna have more luck now."
"They had temping agencies, job centres, local papers  the job centre only came up with about two people."
So I'm touching wood that we're gonna be in a different situation.
"I wonder if, I wonder if erm  you know if you rang up erm  the county council and said   you know   I mean er  y just make use of a contact and say look, we wanna do this survey, you know, do you happen to know a any members of your family"
Yeah.
You know?
It maybe
Yeah.
You can very often er for instance at Cheshire very often  I mean there were sort of some people's wives would like to do it.
Yeah.
"It may be, you know?"
Yeah.
See how the response goes with this and then
Who is it you've spoken to at Gwyneth?
Er Gwyllam .
And where is he?
I never did like those open topped buses.
Well unclear
So I'll be back to you.
at the moment I can see about half well a dozen people sat on one of the buses.
Can you?
Yes.
No wonder there's no traffic moving out there today.
"There is traffic moving, it's moving quite freely apart from the cars going into the car park just behind Clifford's Tower."
Is that right?
That's right yeah.
There's never any spaces behind Clifford's Tower so I don't know how you're just telling me fibs aren't you?
Well they're all they're all queuing up to go in there so I not sure.
I just don't understand all these buses with the open tops it's freezing out there and all these tourists look they could walk Rachael.
Well are tourists
"They could walk, why don't they walk?"
It's a seven kilometre tour.
It takes an hour and a lot of people don't want to walk around the city they'd like the option of going around on the bus.
What did the Minister of Health say the other day?
Obesity obesity and lack of exercise.
and that's what you're encouraging Rachael .
Not encouraging lack of exercise we're encouraging an informative tour around the city with a qualified guide.
You still got that beautiful blonde hair?
We're not on the air are we?
No no no we're not on the air.
Heaven forbid I wouldn't talk to you like this if we were on the air  would I ?
Anyway so go on.
Right.
What were we talking about?
So you don't mind
Talking about the buses.
Yeah.
"So I mean I think it'd great Guide Friday you run around little flag in the air, I've seen them in London and you can do that and and and people get so fit."
"as he thought, authenticate it"
"What, what they call it, stressing it don't they?"
"Stressing it, yeah stressing it"
Mm
and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable
"contortionist, it says here"
oh
Mm
"but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of"
"Well I mean to the untrained eye with a , this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish"
Yeah
which it turned out to be wax
Oh
to simulate old varnish you see?
Oh
So then he started looking
Yeah
They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers
"Yeah  I mean it's, it's so clever really isn't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that."
"I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in"
"beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future  you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you can't possibly think what's"
"things that are in there, it's astronomical."
"Mm, quite expensive as you say"
"Mm, you silly dog, what are you doing, what are you doing, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, right, right, then, yeah, yeah, yeah, get him, right  oh he said that heaven"
Mm
"yeah, you do  huh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,Where's Muffin, behind the settee?"
Yes  mm
Did you read this erm review about Ruby Wax?
No I haven't read that yet
"She's is a, quite a"
"character actually, mind you she does er, it looks like one of those programmes you know er, when you don't want to be sitting in the front row, if she's going to"
Mm pick on you
That's the only way.
"Our cat, and I've really watched her  makes a point of going and walking slowly in the road."
And I think that is exactly what we have to do as cyclists.
Not squeeze to the side because they might not see you there.
right
"Well you sh you're supposed to ride a fair way out from the gutter, never in the gutter so they can see you round the bends."
Yeah but
And they often hoot you if you're doing it but that's the place
That is their fault if they hoot.
Erm especially going up that hill at Hockerill lights.
They overtake you  and then they slow right down so that you have to go oohooh and stop.
You can't cycle that slowly up a hill can you?
"They come in too quickly on, once they've passed you"
They don't they're in like that aren't they straight in front of you.
frightens me .
cycle underneath a car today .
Oh dear.
Michael  's got  helmet.
That's a good idea.
Yes  idiot wearing it though.
If everybody looks like him!
Oh well.
I mean it looks alright if you've got all the gear on  you know cycling shorts and top and everything
make them like swimming hats with lots of little flowers all over them
Yeah.
But if you do get one you have to be careful you get one that's done to the proper standard because some don't work apparently.
absolutely nothing.
Well that's what I thought it just seemed to say they were gonna have sort of cycle ways going through the green wedges along  where I cycle already.
Mm.
And that's no help at all is it.
we can't complain.
That should do quite well in trying to get the traffic away from the centre in Stortford anyway.
Well wonderfully cool.
They would they would watch where they would where they would excavate this thing out
Mm.
from.
But yes it was wonderfully cool.
Mm.
And the produce was salmon ?
And the prod it was it was sort of kept as within a reason of time of course it wouldn't.
But er and of course stuff was salted.
Venison
Venison of course.
you you buy er salt it away in barrels in boxes and and work on it until it was through.
Now was that your father's own particular task the the salting of the venison?
Oh oh oh n no really I can't say that.
Er we only probably did it when ourselves we got venison beforehand on the last shooting and to keep.
But no no er there was so many hinds having to be shot in the winter time and and and it would be sent away you see.
But not away what they're doing now or but it'd be sent down to their premises down in the in the shooting lodges in the south.
Mm.
And that  and to their friends.
And there would be always a beast or two cut up for to be given to the village.
Mm.
Oh yes that was one thing.
I always remember that.
So where did the venison actually go to?
Well it well ah but ah but they never they never killed it in that quantity as they're doing it now.
Mm.
To make money.
No no there was no money made of it.
It was just for their for their own use.
Mm.
And haunches of venison that was the best part in the  they would be sent away to themselves  the haunches.
But the other parts with the ribs and all that'd be cut up given to the and the lodge itself for the.
Right.
Let's list the tasks of a receptionist.
"Shout now, go on,let let's go for it."
"Telephone, answering it"
"And  telephone, answer."
That's what you think they do.
"Er, you're right, erm I can't think of the right word er"
Re-route.
"Re-route, same thing as what you meant isn't it?"
"Diverts, if I wrote divert up here you might use it against me in later life."
"Erm er route, let's just call it route er to  correct   yeah?"
"Does that make sense, that's for the receptionist we don't expect her to fiddle with the rates for liability, capital or whatever do we?"
Anything else a receptionist does?
Okay?
"Okay, so it's erm  meet  public yeah?"
We need to
Right fair enough.
well I did do stat view in the first year but not very much
Yeah.
"No, no I"
how to use it.
"find stat view very difficult to use myself but er when the time comes, once you've got a few that are filled in we can erm  well I'll show you how to do an S P S S data file and, and erm so you can bash your data in and if you bring it back we can turn it into a system file and analyze it."
Erm so er  that shouldn't be too bad.
"So I don't know do you, do you fancy now kind of giving the different versions to a few people by way of er er"
Yeah.
"another pilot and, and see if erm"
Well I'll just do it in my flat I suppose
Yeah.
"Yeah fair enough if, if that's erm you know how you fancy starting."
And then if you
finish it off.
"any, any sort of, yeah, any sort of changes or anything erm  er  I don't know if you're around sort of early next week we can"
Yes .
Yes.
"So you're really, in a way, you're not much difference than where you started."
"I think Margaret's right, if, if we really want to get through the business we can and however busy we are, erm ."
"I wouldn't we wouldn't to  every time, but I mean it can be, it can be just a very brief report on what's happened, you know, if we want to get through."
"If we said, like, if we, every second month say or every third month, then we, we knew we were going to have a speaker, we could the time before we could then do the business more thoroughly and carefully so that the month of the speaker we could just go through it very quickly ."
.
"Alternatively to, alternative to, to speaker, can we get erm, you know, brief films about different countries and, political systems and so on."
Mm.
"Yes, yes we have the video too, we have, we have the erm the Amnesty video and we, there are, there are schools videos to."
"Do, do, do they do different videos for different countries?"
"Not, they're not, no, the one I've, the one the group has is, is a general one it's on Amnesty's work ."
"Oh, I see ."
"Yeah, yeah, there probably are ones on different countries."
"I'm not sure that Amnesty does produce on, on, one particular country."
"erm, we have."
other organisations that
"Yes they might, yes, mm."
Though even that's the sort of thing that on T V that er
We can video ourselves.
that's right.
"Mm,, mm."
Yeah.
"Yes, there are a lot, mm"
There's all these workshops Margaret.
"Yes, I, I, I have about twelve workshops."
.
On all kinds of things.
.
"On all kinds of things, yes."
I enjoyed that very much that last one.
What was that one?
I bet they don't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter don't they?
"Oh their own, yes"
I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty  so
where you do it
so well where you gonna go for that?
Where else can you try?
Er well I was gonna ask for
"when he comes, gonna ask or ask"
At the college do you mean?
"They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area  and"
the chemist
Mm
he's an old fashioned type
Well why don't you try Mr Bentley I mean
He's bloody finished now
"Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than"
"to get it, I mean he's very obliging."
He lives over the shop still doesn't he?
Or at the back of the shop.
He's a proper character isn't he?
Mm
"But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think"
"a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out"
"Look in the pockets you great pi , oh"
I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you
"Oh jesus, Maggots  I caught a few"
there might be a fiver in one of them
You've got no chance of that
Hey did you know this
Yes  oh god  Muffin you're not going out again you're covered in mud.
"I suppose they get fed up stuck in all the time, don't they?"
"Yeah, and they're only out for a few minutes and they're fed up out there as well, and backwards and forwards like a fiddlers elbow  go on  I want to put those lupins in"
Oh nine.
Right.
"So,."
It's a million so one million
It's a
times minus one million.
Is?
million times
And what is the sign of it though?
Minus.
It's the same
Right.
So it's minus a million squared.
"So wh when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten"
Yeah.
this looks like Y equals minus X squared.
Mm.
"And this part of the graph, in there I mean that wouldn't start showing until we get beyond about say twentyish."
"At that point, it could be doing all sorts of weird things, and you'd think oh, I've got this wonderful graph and I plotted a lot of points close together, so I know my sketch was right, because it looked like this funny W thing or M or something"
Mm.
"erm it might well look like that for that very small piece of graph, but the overall picture you've lost completely by not going far enough so you, you want minus infinity to plus infinity."
"When you substitute infinity in, just think well if it was about a million, what could we ignore?"
"I mean, you could work all this out  right."
Ten X plus another ten X. Okay?
"And then minus a hundred and minus X squared, and put the millions and things in but don't need to."
"You've got it factorized like this, you could just, oh, that's about a million."
"It's about minus a million, so it's about minus a million squared."
And there'll be marks going for .
"It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful."
Mm.
"But you've lost the, the overall shape of it."
"Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient?"
With me so far?
Mm.
But not all of those hundred must vote for the must vote for the closure there must be a hundred people there to take part in the vote is that right?
No.
It is no good putting a closure vote by ninety nine to one or even ninety nine to nought.
The objector cunningly doesn't vote.
We must have a hundred MPs voting for the closure.
All of it ah right okay.
So we need a hundred  present.
Which is where  on a Friday afternoon.
But if if everybody else around the country has been lobbying as hard we have there's a good chance.
After all there's three hundred and three hundred and however many was yes three hundred and sixty MPs who supported it.
Three hundred and twenty seven put their name to an easy end.
So out of those we should be able to manage a hundred surely.
The other thing is if we're successful with Atkins if he's behind the bill the MPs are unlikely to talk it out.
They'll accept it and put send it through on the nod if we can get his support.
So he's crucial.
Why is the Whip so important?
Because surely he's just enforcing the Minister's policy.
Erm yes.
But these people get together.
Right.
I mean it's not as if Robert Atkins  making all the decisions.
"Three hundred people say hang round the bar and say,conservation board I've had lots of letters, well so have I, we'll get get through them they might cause trouble."
That that's the plan.
Well go for democracy the decision being you know for the country being taken by three
Tories rather than
Well that's right yes rather than one.
Well they don't ask John Major of course.
. They can tell  John Major .
So why I'm I'm slightly puzzled as to why Robert Atkins is actually more important than John Selwyn Gummer?
I mean
"just started, aye."
ah swimming on Monday nights and  I'm doing training another three times a week
"I'd love to do th I'm really unfit, I mean like totally unfit."
Sitting here I've got a pot belly and no fucking muscles
"That's what Robert wants then, to do a bit of training and start like getting"
"I'm not like overly fat or anything, I'm the right weight for what I'm, for my height like but I've just got a pot belly"
"They've got a spare room in my mum's flat so  I just took it over and put a weights bench in and, what else, a rowing machine  and I started to do some weights"
I never knew you had all those.
Have you ?
I've had those for years.
Expensive!
"sort of like what happened is that Robert was sort of like, the three of us sort of chipped in and bought it between us and stuff like that you know, so that all three of us would get the benefit of it"
Yeah
"but er  I was the only one that ever  used it  and I used it about once or twice and then, like  like, I used it for about"
Hi there.
six months Steve.
"About  eight o'clock he says be down, be in for eight o'clock."
Right.
after Easter  cos I got   people have  most  go in work experience and I didn't get a place  after Easter like.
You dog!
revision but it's fucking
Aye he's a bastard so he is
What are you doing?
physics  A C theory
A bitch.
the worst like
Yeah
A C theory sucks   some of the questions   You haven't done any mag magnetic stuff ha have you?
Or er
"We've got, you know the"
"All the worst stuff comes at the start of next year   electro-magnetic induction, electron physics,stuff, all the shitty stuff I think"
course but
"You know Ben Lech?hill, red hill going down to ?"
"I was young and foolish at the time,"
Fifty miles an hour on a bike ?
"Very, very high gear on it, we used to go out a couple of us"
And er  we were passing this M
You've got this on tape remember?
Oh no!
"We went past this bloke in a Morris Minor,"
"a convertible, with a  eyes streaming, it was really hard to see, and  clocked his speed at fifty, and er the bloke behind me nearly got hit,because when I went past this bloke  I went"
all over the road.
No you didn't really though did you?
Ooh no.
"No, no you didn't."
No officer I didn't.
Distance okay?
Yeah.
And displacement.
"When they measure your speed, they're measuring your velocity really, they're measuring it in a particular direction, along that road."
Mm.
"Erm so  we'll call it distance, right?"
"But we're actually talking about displacement, just so that you feel more comfortable with it, cos there are other things coming up to make you feel less comfortable you see."
Okay.
So the police say you were doing forty miles an hour.
You say how do you know I was doing forty miles an hour?
"I wasn't driving for an hour, you weren't following me for either an hour or forty miles."
"They say, ah well, we followed you for a tenth of a mile, right, and it took you so long to cover that."
"And we, our little machine here has calculated it that that's forty miles an hour."
Yeah.
"Okay, so what did they do?"
"They had your hundred a hundredth of a mile say, let's say it's erm  let's say it was a tenth of a mile."
Nought point one miles.
And they divided that by erm  nought point O
Not really.
So long as we're talking about sort of half a mile away ma maximum or with other sort of proper travelling arrangements.
If it's half less than half a mile away then it's it's fine but if not it starts to becoming problematical.
The other thing about financing it.
So I haven't done the sums in my head.
How much is it actually to get a  place?
Well if it's six pounds for six people that's thirty six pounds a night isn't it?
For four nights
Plus three
Plus a bit.
So it's about forty quid a night and there's Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.
It's four nights.
So that's  that sounds quite a lot to ask the political party
Oh I wouldn't ask them to pay
Yeah.
That would be too much.
But it's one way of distributing any money that the party wants to give to subsidize people so that everybody can benefit from it erm rather than means testing.
I'm happy as long as we we get the definite six people definite.
We I think you know we can do go into just four four people .
I I'm quite happy to come in on it.
I think I probably would like a single room though.
Are there two single rooms?
Two single and two double.
Yeah well on a first come first serve  basis a single room I'd come in on it .
Well strangely enough I think we'll have to have double rooms .
Well if if we do only get four people it's going to be more isn't it?
Yeah.
It's going to be ten pounds a night each
Yes erm.
roughly and you don't get breakfast thrown in.
No that's right.
I I would hope to be able to  party conference probably only  which would mean turning up either Friday night or Saturday morning.
But it
Or was that last year what seven or eight of us wasn't it?
At St Michael's?
The church.
Yeah.
That was last year or was that two years ago?
Er
There was something at St Michael's but I didn't know it was the one world week.
Yeah I have never been involved in a  one world week event at St Michael's.
I thought there was one there .
You certainly were there.
In the church
No I don't I don't think
Yeah.
Anyway I mean hopefully this this will be sort of you know if it's well publicized it it will be well attended because of the past.
I think we might as well get in a few things and anyway I want some envelope re-use labels .
I've run out completely.
There you are  so many packets already.
Well if you don't want Traidcraft's re-use labels I don't care!
Oh!
I didn't know you did them!
Well erm
Doesn't matter does it
"well apart from this leaflet on recycling facilities, what else shall we have?"
On the stall.
Well who's gonna do the leaflet?
I will.
I think we ought to sort that out
"Well that will be, I personally think that's the only thing we can do."
"And we should just sort of say what is necessary to find out and everybody gets a few telephone numbers or telephone calls  check out addresses  find out about new ones, get in contact with the district council erm what is in the pipeline."
Find out about Uttlesford possibly why there's is running and whether that is going to br breakdown.
"Erm and if we then find money for printing it I would approach Barclays Bank, banks, local banks  and would it do it very modestly the same local the same style er and only hand it out to  places where people are likely to pick it up."
"today, somewhere  never mind, no, you're not having any more biscuits you  Right I erm, I see it's ten past eleven, I want to get this ball washed, so, er, let them go in the wash"
Right I'm going to work in the workshop
"I'll tell you what, I get the erm, I get the battery of the, the other one, you can try it."
You want to try it don't you if you're going to have it?
"Well this is it, it might be knackered now those two"
"Has he been in the, in the loft in the workshop?"
Or
No.
"Well you, it's not corroded or anything is it?"
Let's turn that down
Can't turn it out.
Power isn't it?
"Yes, but you won't get the same connections will you?"
I don't know
Use your
Fantastic that
pause
"I'm looking for something somewhere   Yes, well it appears to be working, but whether it's working correctly I don't know oh  Ray, there is provision here for the headphones, you, you said are you supposed to use headphones with it, mind you  it sounds pretty audible anyway, I don't think you need headphones, I mean I'm not sure there's a"
No
See how she goes.
Erm
Thing is I've got to try by turning those volts down on some of them
"Yeah it's just that find out if there's any nails in the, in the wood."
Possibly have
stones
You're not likely to get stones em embedded in the
"Oh  I mean whether, whether that one is, is good enough for"
enough
"Mm, and it"
the nails in the wood that's all
"Oh yes it's, it's, how long ago was it when Robin bought that?"
Eleven or twelve wasn't he?
Alright.
I'll give you something to
"I'm going tomorrow morning there anyway cos Roy's just given me a call, they've got some problems with  screw support bearings locking up, but er I'll go over there some time"
Right.
.
Yeah .
Yeah.
.
So I'll  Sally .
"Okay, is that happiness?"
"Right, yeah okay."
Erm just the  one's me main concern.
I mean the others you know it's it's what we get and and  sort of thing.
With them it's it's yeah.
Mm.
Erm I'm not happy with them and I don't know how you get round it .
Knowing what's happening there.
Well er at the end of the day it may be one that we're gonna we're gonna lose but erm
Mm.
If it is
Love the ultimate four letter word and were about to use it all over your television screen.
"Where do you start with love, every body wants to love, every body wants to be loved, every one at some time or another is disappointed by love and while its difficult sometimes talking about it not talking about it can have some really serious consequences, so let's try to get to the heart of it tonight, one hundred women are prepared to share their wisdom if not their secrets, I'd like to start off by seeing if we can differentiate between loving and being in love."
"Have you ever been in love?, are you now?, button one for yes, button two for no  and in this hundred, woof ninety three people have been in love, what, what happened?,"
"I mean what, what how did you know you were in love?"
"How did you know that was, that, that was what it was?, yes"
Temporary madness
can
only temporary
"er, well it does wear off you can't, you can't, you can't"
sustain it indefinitely
"and what, what were the symptoms in your case?"
"If they're blue, so am I"
I wonder if that miniature rose is gonna come up
"the w the one in the tub, no."
"Oh yeah, the one in the tub looks ok, it's the other one."
"I like the other one best as well, it's the peach one."
When're you going to prune them?
"Well, when I plant that other one where you want it planted, that's"
I wonder when er  going to have the erm
wheel barrow ready
Yes.
"Oh, it said in yesterday's paper that someone had had a wheelbarrow valued at thirty pounds stolen from her back garden and it was somewhere at , where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible."
"So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds cos it didn't it didn't say a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything, it just said a wheelbarrow"
Well there was er four
So we'll have to get it
Those four tapes incidentally  Tchaikovsky.
I sold them for fifteen pounds.
What four tapes?
The four tapes  sold them for fifteen pounds in
That who sent you?
That Shirley and Gareth sent me for Christmas
Oh.
I wish you would think of something you would like for your birthday
"I've told you, I want a  you need binoculars to go to Rome with"
I can't see very well through binoculars
The Cistine Chapel.
Unless we take those big ones with us.
"Oh Jim, they're too heavy"
"It doesn't need an easier camera, it needs you"
"What happens with that camera, you've got to rewind it every time."
"There's better ones now, automatic rewind, that's what I need."
You have never sat down and read
It's the rewind that's the problem
Well after after the big box pile up I'm I'm free on the Green Party.
And then the elections and then get our act together.
I don't think we need to be too sorry at the reason we're not getting it written is we're far too busy lobbying MPs and making protests in the centre of town and things.
So it's probably good rather
On balance.
Right.
Any other business?
I've got a couple of things.
Do we have nominations for conference reps and local election candidates?
Because these will need to go in the selection ballot in the newsletter what I am going to write.
Oh er you mean from people here?
Well
Yes?
Or I mean the flood of phone calls that have no doubt saved the erm Green Party .
Oh I'd I'd like to be a a delegate at conference but I can't be a candidate this year cos I'm captain of my and I think I'll be a bit busy anyway to be honest doing press work.
It would be nice to have a break from doing it.
Right.
Anybody wish to be put forward as conference attender?
The number is unlimited is it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have three voting certificates but you can pass them around
It's a shared job.
Yeah.
Oh might as well then.
You just have to be approved by the  that's all.
Yeah I'll do that thing.
Right so that's got three so far and
I mean I think if you're not sure whether you want whether you'll be able to go  I mean you can still you can still be a  delegate then if you do go then you're able to vote so.
So you'd like to be put down on the ballot to be approved do you?
Doesn't mean you have to go.
Just means that if you do go you
My brother-in-law said he read in the paper that erm  over a year sort of  the amount of oil tipped on our land and down drains which shouldn't be there is almost like equivalent to the disaster at Exxon Valdez.
I heard that.
"Th erm  the amount of oil that people just tip on the ground, or down the drains or whatever"
Mm.
over a year is equivalent to the disaster of the Exxon Valdez.
So really people ought to be trained to take their engine oil out
"There's this, there's this er out of sight out of mind principal"
You are fined you are heavily fined in Germany and for  decades already.
"You were not allowed to wash your car on a normal street  because oil would automatically be flushed into into the guttering, into the"
They must be going absolutely mad about East Germany mustn't they?
Well it's just so incredible that this oil has never been  I mean nobody focused on it did they?
No.
People just don't think.
They just tip it oh tip it down the drain.
Same with petrol stations I mean  the way they  spill the petrol.
I know!
There used to be safety catch mechanism
Yeah.
but there isn't now is there it just comes splashing out.
Well really I mean with quite a few you really have to watch out which is
they had a row at erm petrol station when that happened to her.
And they said it was our car.
"and, and it went, cos it was quite a bit more worth petrol that went all over the place."
And she refused to pay.
And they  me up about it.
"I, I sort of denied all knowledge ."
I didn't know it had happened!
I think they were being most unreasonable.
We at the time the attendant said it was alright.
She didn't have to pay for it.
it could easily  I mean  will be shorter I think.
Sorry?
but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that
Oh easily
concrete and that's got to be one mix each time isn't it?
Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water
And water
"erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole"
Yes
so if you just put the
well
the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere
Yeah
"I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work isn't it?"
Where's little tiddly gone?
Where is he by the way?
Erm I said to you he's on the settee
"Hello, hello, hello"
if he's on there just shout at him will you because
oh he's in here
he's by the radiator aren't you beaut?
"He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal aren't you?"
"Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is  it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it."
I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes
"one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document"
Yeah
"to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along"
Personally I would of
Well of course that's what vitamin C is isn't it?
Well acetic acid is you know the chemical
"you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see"
Oh
which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that
"oh my god, well that's the stripper then really isn't it?"
If he's coming he might like to be
to be
There's a good chance of filling most rooms most nights I would have thought.
Well shall I ring Joyce back and say providing it's close erm we'll have it and take it from there.
Okay.
Oh I haven't written .
Shall I alert Dick to its existence then?
Yes I think that would be that would be a nice thing to do.
Cos that would be a nice definite.
Okay.
I'll make a decision when I'm in a position to .
Well this is why it would be a good idea to so people will have to decide in advance and just see how we go for
Do you have to send off a deposit or anything?
I'll find out when I ring and she'll .
If I do I'll be ringing round frantically  find out what to do .
I would suggest that given the decision we prepared to make now even if you have to send a deposit get the local party to stump up the deposit and collect the money as soon as convenient from the people who are committed to going.
Is that agreed with all of you here.
Sure mm.
Since the local party's going to cover the shortfall anyway if there one.
Okay.
she'll be subletting rooms to people.
Slum land for the Green Party   .
.
Right is that erm.
Okay presumably I should put something again in the newsletter about conference and this accommodation thing.
Yeah.
Yeah it it means that you can point out that it makes it a lot simpler for someone to just pop over for a night and crash out on the floor.
Are you coming to conference at all.
No I won't be er my family situation can change so.
Oh.
Don't have to do things like erm .
We can always run a little creche actually for  nanny from Scarborough got a baby as well.
"Sir, is Miss  not in?"
No.
Could you take your coats off please and come into the blue room.
Well who's taking Miss  's class?
question?
What?
the answer.
Can you come through please.
Right folks  Donald is here making typical  of English in use  from schools at the moment.
So if you would er ignore the presence of the microphone that would be helpful.
I intend to give you a demonstration today based on work that  Kevin has done.
He's  his plate with hard wax as many of you now have done.
"He has  varnished the back with, can you remember what sort of special old varnish it was?"
Straw hat.
Correct.
Well done.
Straw hat varnish.
Now it's safe from acid attack on the back and on the front except for where he has lightly drawn through the thin wax coating using the etching .
Drawn this little character and what I intend to do is put this into acid  and etch it.
The actual etching process where the acid bites through the liner into the metal and makes a rule.
When that's happened I'll take it out of the acid  clean it and show you how to take a print from the plate.
"I would like you all to try to  remember  the stages of the process because you're going to have to do, as I said to you last lesson, a small write up on this in order to get your unit of accreditation  for this work."
That is to say your special certificates .
Right erm  would you normally be  room?
Would you normally be in this room?
Is it likely that there are other pupils who may turn up in that room in a few minutes?
Or do you think that you may be the only ones?
Are they all on the English trip?
Okay.
In that case could you just take your coats off and put them somewhere  erm out of the way.
Please.
On the deep
Oh on the deep
two or three gorges
Oh you want to fetch it down to a board technic
"That's so I can get two out of the one you know for the sides, erm, sides and"
"Oh you want them to deep, deep, deep"
"I don't think I'm gonna get that much joy myself, cos their reluctant aren't they to do anything that's not new."
"I thought there might be somewhere where they'd have an old circular saw you know, probably got a bit more chance with help, but they do a bit of rough cutting do you know what I mean?"
"Yeah, but you won't get two out of it will you?"
But
"Well they're only for sides, you know, I'm, I'm doing them like er"
I
the sides are coming out er like this you see
"those, those are already you know like that their fortunate with those"
"I, I like them"
"but, but I haven't got enough you see"
Yeah
but er
you won't get two that size will you?
"You reckon not, not with the cut, it's, well not that I know it's, it's got two"
it is a good er about one and five eighths
"Oh I say, yeah, you, well, you'll get one, you'll get a second one there, full one there"
"Get a full one, get it doesn't matter really and I get one that width out of"
"Yeah, yeah"
here you see and it'll all be joined up.
"It's, it's a band saw really that you want to put down"
"Mm, they're not really safe"
"Yeah,"
a band saw are you now are you?
"I got the old metal detected on, but, of course it could always be a bit of grit in it couldn't it"
Yeah
or something like that.
"the main point that I made to him was that after such a superb beginning where, where they actually state how much rubbish we produce, there's absolutely no mention  even though there's space at the bottom  there's no mention of recycling at all."
"And he said well it's a different, you know different department."
Mm.
I know yes
"And this was, this, that, that wouldn't have entered into  that brief but my argument was that, you know everybody would be much happier if there was less rubbish to put in the landfill sites  in the first place."
"Now that was about two weeks ago and I've been sitting on it meaning to, to write to the press and say how disgusting it was."
Which I have just done today.
"Aft , no"
"Yes, half way through I spoke to to the environ environment officer"
Mm
who was much more  switched on.
"He's a new environment officer, he's only been there for a month or something."
And he says that  erm.
He sort of agreed with me that it was a waste of an opportunity.
Erm but he did say that he's actually writing a leaflet which they can run to seven or eight pages.
A detailed one about recycling.
anybody will read so  eight pages.
Well I don't know.
I just don't know.
But I mean he was very interested and when I said that we'd actually done a recycling directory and that I was thinking
redoing it.
Erm.
He was very interested and he would like to meet us and I said that if he's actually doing a directory
all this all this about.
I thought Rob is doing a sort of recycling what do you call it composium
Rob has just done a green audit for the district council.
Yes.
Yes.
But we haven't had the opportunity to read it.
I mean he knows that we have a recycling d .
I was in touch with them.
I sent them the recycling.
The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree.
Other forms were near.
His sole had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead.
"He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.’"
"The beauty of these words cannot entirely hide a sense of suggested differentness, of an essential something so far held back but pushing now to get out."
"It is this sense which seems to be given the clearest possible confirmation in those moments of the portrait of the artist, where the brooding Stephen, Stephen Daedalus , suddenly emerges from his vigilance in a lightening display of strength."
"Here, from the portrait, are two of them."
"‘It's a curious thing, do you know’ Cranley said dispassionately, ‘how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelief."
Did you believe it when you were at school?
I bet you did.’
"‘I did’, Stephen answered."
‘And were you happier then?’
Cranley asked softly.
"‘Happier than you are now, for instance?’"
‘Often happy’ Stephen said ‘and often unhappy.’
‘I was someone else then.’
It's a lot of money.
most of it was fresh produce.
Really?
"They, it's not gonna last, like, they're still b buying more and more of it."
"It wasn't like all your basic items, or anything."
"Mike doesn't eat meat, so like, it's only like, slice of chicken, slice ham and stuff for Maryanne."
Most of it is fresh fruit and veg.
Really?
"There was some booze on there as well, but not much, so erm,"
"Right, a lot of money though, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Fifty pounds for two people.
Mind you if he sees .
"Did you, what did you want on this, did you want some jam, is that alright?"
Strawberry jam?
Have you got any butter
"where, where I found more so were"
that's the oldest part isn't it?
That's the oldest part
That's right on the knife
and the er
"whether the grain was straighter, maybe that was the answer"
and the awkward thing was to hack a wood in the centre
"Yeah that's right, yeah, yeah"
An American oak is not too bad
But the English you can end up doing a lot of scrapping for your finish
Mm
"and it's just only because of the climate, there's er"
"Cold weather, the, oh, is that what it was?"
"That's right, yeah, he's, he's"
"Mm, mm, funny there was a lad here"
"this chap was here last week he bought this pine table up, got his key, and he'd been working for three years in Norway"
Oh yeah
as a joiner
Yeah
"and he was saying, told me some of the different names, you know, other than pine, I suppose their name for whatever these pines were, the timber there was beautiful"
Yeah
the er
all the
"knots, very few knots, just lovely yellow pine and er and they make all their furniture out of these pieces, so, he said that's what set me off on making furniture he said"
"say that the cost of living there tremendous, tremendous"
"ten years ago now they took out these tremendous mortgages because their wages had trebled, it, it about a ten year period, you know when the boom was on"
Yeah
"a few years ago, and he said er there was a lot of repossessions there."
It's happening everywhere you see.
"You could buy a house very cheaply then, but er"
"we, we didn't know what was going to happen"
"that's not all you can do now is blame the Labour Party, it's incredible now."
It was the Daily Herald wasn't it?
When it came out first.
Ooh.
Senator Ted Kennedy revealed yesterday that he is to wed lawyer Victoria   who's father is to stand trial over an alleged  fraud.
Kennedy sixty started dating the thirty eight year old divorced mother of two last June.
I love her and her children very much  he said.
"Victoria's father retired   oh he's   father's  Victoria's father, retired judge Edmund  denies fraud ."
The Kennedy's are in  trouble every corner aren't they?
It's nothing to do with him.
"No, but er I mean he's even marrying into trouble."
The whole of his family.
His father and all.
Remand prisoners at a top security jail used a thin mobile phone to make threatening calls to court witnesses it was revealed yesterday.
An astonished guard alerted Durham Jail chiefs when he heard a phone ringing in a cell.
A search revealed the battery operated handset hidden under a mattress.
Calls made from it were traced by police to the homes of witnesses due to give evidence in trials on Tyneside.
At least one case is understood to be involved in a murder charge.
A top level enquiry is underway into the racket.
Dubbed by prison wives the cellnet scandal after the cabinet mobile phones system.
"Visitors are thoroughly searched before they are allowed in to the jail which houses two hundred remand prisoners, killers, I R A terrorists and rapists, and the investigation will examine whether a prison officer may have brought in the phone."
"One senior officer said  it would be extremely difficult to smuggle one in, security is so tight here on visits ."
"Oh well, there's always a lapse isn't there?"
What time does this budget start today I wonder?
Not that we've
What budget?
heard it all before.
What budget?
"This er, the labour giving their  oh dear"
Is Barnado's advertising?
Back again.
Oh there.
Make a credit card donation.
And so how can the Communist Party
But I mean
"just say right, we're gonna do this, this"
Just because they don't know what it  socialism
"theoretical concept or something, they might have known that they wanted"
Yes but it's the basic underlying concept
capitalism and becomes rich as the we western world then th they'll be all for that
"No, I just find that  really difficult  because they didn't have the means at that time to achieve it."
"I mean we've already established the fact they didn't have, they didn't have the personnel to"
.
Yes they did.
They were in power.
They were in power but I mean who's to say that the pe there's not gonna be a civil war and they'll be thrown out of power.
So why did they think that they had the er  means to do it in nineteen forty seven?
"You know when they said, when they went for a very radical policy"
Well perhaps because they were more idealist and that now they're becoming more realist but they're still  erm I mean they're learning from their past mistakes and they've seen that right so we have to have a moderate policy which is gonna take us a little bit further towards socialism.
They're not totally contradicting their ideals.
Oh yeah
It confirms our suspicions
at the last gasp we were right.
It's all this absolute power corrupts actually isn't it?
Mm.
"Erm the, the people who  did Mao ?"
Or ?
"Well I mean  there, there, there's no question about nineteen forty nine absolutely non no documents  could have come out unless they had Mao's approval."
Mm.
Er
Did he shoot the other people involved by any chance?
that's behind this
Right.
erm
I E it's the same person who comes up with
I didn't say what the license is.
we only insure for the intrinsic value of
And is there any situation
the item.
That's all.
Right.
But you guarantee them delivery.
Yep.
On the piece of paper.
I know but you've lost the .
We give them their money back.
"I mean, well it'll probably arrive, it'll turn up somewhere won't it really?"
But se
Could do.
"I mean send another one is what we're saying, have your money back."
If you haven't got the  you should be okay.
Or
"if it arrived, if you paid for a before"
One customer should expect it to arrive then
noon  and it er
"I mean, same ta super mail, we wouldn't give them their money back."
I think that's a bit more than that now.
"But if you ordered a ten thirty delivery and it arrived before noon, we would just give you the money difference the before twe , ten thirty and the before noon price, not the complete price."
Unless you wanted to argue about it.
"But we feel that, okay, you know, it may have been a half an hour late but you got there."
"And therefore, we have incurred cost and therefore, but okay, it wasn't the guaranteed service."
"But you could argue with us, you know."
"And again, a commercial decision is made locally based on the strength of the account."
"But we don't, you've gotta be careful as you probably know Phil, the abuse can of the ca , you know, carrier, you know, can be a nice little earner if you're not careful."
"And, you know, erm people can  intend to fail in order to claim money, revenue back, and so on."
D'ya know
"Or damaged goods can, you know, put the foot through it to get the insurance cover on what we pay and we're liable."
I mean
Okay.
let them live their lives in peace without the harassment of chasing them with dogs and  supporters and what have you!
Okay.
"Any others  that, yes?"
"I don't think animals should be ta , used to be tested for cosmetics"
Mhm.
perfumes or  detergents
Mhm.
different things like that.
What about medical research?
"Well, there again, yes, with reservations  because if it comes to the fact that if it's going to save human lives, yes."
"Yes, and you get all the animals who are experimented on and you sa there's not a week that comes out and you don't an a report saying, oh well this this, this causes cancer in rats or  and you, imagine the amount, the huge amounts of  the sub , whatever substance it is that had been given to rats to cause the cancer, and there's no  knowing that the amount that's gonna be given to rats  causing cancer, will give cancer to humans!"
"I mean,i it's just absolutely ridiculous!"
I'm a trustee for the beauty without cruelty charity
Aha.
"and we would like to see an end to all experiments on animals, for cosmetics, toiletry, household product  purposes."
Hasn't that campaign been going for
"Oh many, many years!"
a long time?
Yes!
And we're making progress now.
How?
There are already many alternatives to the research carried out on animals which has been going on for a long time.
"Erm  for example, you can grow human skin in a, in a cell culture and use that as a, as a testing er, medium"
Mhm.
instead of a live animal.
"We can  it can use erm  a si similar substance for eye tests  erm, to test  to replace the Jeyes eye test"
Mhm.
which again has been used for a long time on animals.
These tests are very misleading.
"They don't protect bu su er, er the public, they protect the people who are actually manufacturing the products."
The pace okay.
The speed at which we speak okay.
yeah
Power and pace and pitch and pause.
Yes okay.
let's just go back to the pace then.
How does the pace want to be compared with normal con one to one conversation perhaps?
slightly slower
"Slightly slower just so that the words come over a bit clearer yes, so so people can actually take in what you say okay."
"Now the pause, how about the pause?"
To get attention
You do don't you
it gives emphasis it attracts people's attention
sorry
Pregnant pause
Pregnant pau that's right a pregnant pause isn't it?
I mean
But it's perhaps one of the most difficult things when you start out doing presentations isn't it.
Because you get that silence in the room and mmm you want to fill it  so but you're right the use of the pause effective and particularly with a variation in pitch that gives that emphasis the two combined together can be very very effective.
Okay so the power the pace the pitch and the pause all to do with voice and slight variations on those compared with normal one to one conversation  Okay.
So that's about the voice itself now under paralinguistics also comes that the concept of words.
Words are are I mean what are words?
A simple thing to say but what are words?
Expression
Yes er but what do they express then
Sorry
Feelings
could express feelings yes.
Facts
thoughts
Facts feelings yes thoughts absolutely there there there a code aren't they?
"I mean if you speak three different languages you could use three different words to put the same sort of thought of a picture dog, chien, hound there's probably an Italian and a  and that but if you speak the languages then different words different codes if you like are for the same idea."
Yes.
"But Hughie is saying as far the works office is concerned, he wants to regularize the system with this procedure."
And as I understood you
Yeah.
"again, you wanted the, the, to regularize the system with within the B E S office."
"We well I do, unless that doesn't make sense."
"Now I can't see why it doesn't make sense, but if Jim came to me and said, look Hugh, that's bloody silly."
"I mean our objective is to give the, the client a good efficient cost-effective service, that doesn't meet those"
objectives.
"But D Dave, Dave, Dave could not handle, in B E S, what he handles on the civil side."
In what respect?
H he is not staffed up to do what
could quite easily ask you to do all the erm
Running around
"the actual measure the site measurements, but the agreeing, the valuations, and the processing of the invoices, he does himself."
And that is w well within what this procedure says.
I mean he does the invoices now doesn't he?
Well I understood so.
"Or the, the certification to the client."
Yes he does he does the certificate.
Yeah.
"So really all it, all the, this would"
involve them
"doing would be to say, would you project engineers er or, or engineers collect the in information on site, provide it to the quantity surveyors so they can check it against the spirit of the contract, and make sure that er what's proposed to be certified they're happy with."
Well it doesn't say that though.
Yes.
It
Sorry.
It's
Let's
"What I'm, what I'm saying is if, if you want to really stir people up, bring in a procedure within telling them what you're doing, and then imple implement it at a later date and people will say, this is not quality."
Hey Jim
whereas animals don't!
They have no
Mhm.
"choice, they have no say."
Mhm.
"There, yes?"
How do you know that erm  animals don't reason?
"Like, how do you know what goes on, like with, dolphins, with whales, with all sorts of species of animals, like we don't know, well we're so dense we can only see things like this!"
"We don't know what goes on there, we've got no right to interfere with their lives!"
Yes?
"I think, I think we're overlooking one erm"
Mhm.
"great power that the individual has, instead of being ing , indignant  about erm, our views on animals in research, we could quite simply exercise our power, not to buy the products, to ask questions of our"
Mm mm.
of our doctors what kind of drug it is?
What research goes behind it?
"Do to exercise our individual intelligence to examine the facts on no , on the basis of our own conscience, individually to make a decision, and we can all do that!"
We can buy a different type of product.
And there are many
Mhm.
"companies now  erm which quite obviously assert that fact, on the doorways of chemists for instance, they do not test on animals."
So you're saying the consumer pressure could could change things?
Mhm.
It it it's every effective measure
Mm.
"of stopping erm, a certain product  it simply will go out of production."
"I would disagree that er, humans aren't used in experiments because I think that we're all being used at various"
"points in our lives, for experiments, medical or otherwise."
Mhm.
"And erm  a , a lot of the medicines that are passed  er have been passed to a certain degree and then th th the  we become the the animal."
"Are you speaking as a, as an experienced guinea pig yourself?"
Well I'm a diabetic  erm
And what's the better deal?
Let's find out.
"And let's start with a basic question, here in this nation of animal lovers, do you think animals deserve a better deal?"
Some animals?
All animals?
Any animals?
Do they deserve a better deal?
"Button one for yes, and button two for no."
This is a descriptive vote because this hundred er  women are not a representative cross section of the whole of Scotland  they're invited to come from various places  and ninety six of them think that animals deserve a better deal.
When you said yes to that which animals did you mean?
And what were you talking about?
Yes?
"I think, a lot of people  see the stray dogs problem as a big problem, certainly if people have decided to  partake of pets, they have a responsibility to look after them and not throw them out on the streets."
Okay so
And I think problems like that  are due to human irresponsibility!
So those animals do have a raw deal!
"Okay, that's one area."
"Who else said yes, and why?"
"Up, yes?"
"I think animals that are used for human entertainment definitely deserve a better deal, for example, large wi wild animals that are used in circuses, we haven't got the right, as people, to say that they're here for our entertainment."
What would that better deal be in that case?
"The better deal would be, not being transported up and down the country, and not being made to perform tricks that are  un unnatural to their own  behaviour patterns."
Aha.
Aha.
Any other views?
Yes?
"I think that er  concern should also spread to animals that are hunted pleasure as well, i.e. the stags, deer, foxes, hares, I mean, there's there's quite a considerable list that's all done for entertainment."
Mhm.
Now the better deal there presumably would involve
Not chasing them at all!
not hunting them at all?
No!
Yes.
Can you undertake that that will apply?
Yes.
And you aware of the restrictions on drink for young people?
Yeah.
And the sort of concern about that?
Yes.
And we're going  to grant this protection order which is temporary permission to keep the premises open  and I must tell you that there will be a lot more investigation before the order is granted   that the transfer is specialist.
"And we're ordering that the other person, if possible, attends at that ."
If she's not in the district then it'll be difficult.
"And if it is possible, if she is in the district we order that she attends the transfer sessions  the outgoing licensee."
Fifty eight.
Have you got the license er  Miss ?
No it's  .
"Well, but it will not be effective until er, you have produced that license to this court."
"Erm, I assume it  that this er, if the licensee has left those premises  wi she's physically left has she there?"
Yeah.
"Er, when did she go?"
About a month ago now  .
She left the company then did
Mm.
she?
"I see, well I would of expected those premises not to be selling intoxicating liquor sir, they've obviously not had a license for a month!"
That will also be er  considered by the licensing committee at the next hearing!
"You must produce that license otherwise it's not effective er, Miss !"
"See, as licensee you have responsibilities!"
"It's all very well the company telling you as employee what to do  it's yo , you're the one who's going to be in difficulties if you don't comply with the licensing laws!"
Your whole application's not been very satisfactory Miss !
And the fact that the license is not in  puts you in in in difficulty!
We are aware now that you're operating without a license and it's up to you to get that license here as quickly as possible!
Right  .
Okay.
"So it was pragmatic but it could also fit into their ideology in that how, that if they'd gone straight for socialism"
"Now come on, this, this is disgraceful."
There's no  this is a disgraceful
No but if they'd gone straight for
document for a communist party to base land reform on.
There's no ideology  at all.
"Absolutely, absolutely none."
I think it's only pragmatic in that  it's maintaining production levels.
Or helping production but
"So is this what, they certainly ?"
"Yeah, this is it."
This is
That's
"No, no"
No but I mean the basis of it was presumably landlord out and China was based around this
Yeah.
Well it was for the next  two years.
They didn't
"No, no."
Oh right.
"I mean this, these, these, these"
Well that's alright then.
"No, I mean we would, no"
So I mean this is just another basic erm
Yeah.
"Well in fact it, it it has in fact gone full circle because through the nineteen fifties you went through to co-ops to collectives to communes which lasted through to nineteen seventy eight, the communes were then disbanded and you're back, now, after reform which took very much system."
"But, you know, if, if, if I'd have put, when we, when we started to talk at the beginning of this term we had at the beginning a general discussion about what are we gonna put in land reform, if I'd have come along to s to you and I'd said well I think we should do this"
We'd of laughed.
Right.
"And I, I, I, I, I, I would not have endeavoured to persuade you that this was going to be  the land reform document that was, that  this is it."
It doesn't surprise me that they did it.
But this isn't this is it?
Mm
"just wouldn't go in would it, unless it's being stood right down"
Mm
"cut turn half way, the first cut, then turn it over with, you've got to have all the, just got a bit of the bare blade on the bench you see"
Yeah without a guard on it
without a guard and they won't
"mm, mm"
allow that on this stand
No I can understand that I suppose
"but there again it's only hand feed, you've, you got to have a, a machine that can feed on to take this tubing"
"Something to grip it, mm"
We would have to like pull the wood through you see
"what about that erm, what about that other place that er timber place on the way to Kilkern erm we went there, you, oh you went in to ask about some walnut, do you remember when er"
"Well er that's the same, that would be worth thinking this you know"
don't think you'd be very happy you know
"I mean you wouldn't wanna pay  no be only worth a fiver to cut it, to them it's not worth"
"Damaging them, saw, mm"
Well at least we've had a look at the whether we
"right OK, so we've eliminated all that have we?"
Well I mean
What are you gonna do?
I don't know
It's impossible to do by hand
No not impossible
with a good saw
Yeah
and about ten irish navvies
One down below and one above huh
mm
"Try to get some er old door casings rip down from me you know, now, I was thinking of going to North Wales but I know what they'd say cos it, the ones that I got from our Rob's you know the  they're quite clean but of course they've had nails in the, you know, the head like  I made the cab some cabinets you know."
I want them split down that road
Which way?
Near that
Say this er I think
mm
"Have you actually got a plan drawn up with measurements, devised to the top and the base as well or are you going to do that when you"
"I got the height of the base, you've seen that"
"yes, yes"
Use that for the base obviously
"Muffin be quiet, what the devil's wrong with him?"
"it's that much bigger so, you know just see how the top one goes and then I can copy that to the bottom"
"Yeah, well you're going to do the base of it bigger aren't you?"
Yes
Erm
"er the only, I'm not quite sure yet how the sides are going to"
"and the door , the glass door he wanted it erm like the lead glass, oh similar to these"
Yes I know he wants it erm
you know
glazing bars
Mm
"there's no way we could use it either of those, panels that were the glass panels that we've got in the garage, no, separate them, I mean it,"
"they're not, they're not solid glass, they're two panes, which could be separated whether of ingenuity and"
What re-cut you mean?
"Well no not, not, well we could get them, I never thought of that"
Cut them they wouldn't be the exact size
"yes, ah that's a point now, I could take them down to erm, what's his name  down the road and ask him, he's very obliging, ask him to cut them"
I don't know it depends er
"I was just thinking rather than having plain which you'd have to pay for anyway a plain piece of glass and, and er putting lead on it yourself  I think that's a brilliant idea that."
"Well the idea is, is it's not so much the lead"
it suppose to be the
"bars, I don't know what they look like without"
"old, old er"
"it's a diamond , it's a diamond pattern isn't it for"
Yeah
"Maimie cried , falling on her knees , for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread , but still quite complete ."
"But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself , and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Fairies never say , ` We feel happy ' : what they say is , ` We feel dancey ' -RSB- Maimie stamped her foot naughtily , and was putting her fingers to her eyes , when she heard a kind voice say , ` Do n't cry , pretty human , do n't cry , ' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully ."
She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Little House ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Peter 's Goat ' -RSB- VI PETER 'S GOAT Maimie felt quite shy , but Peter knew not what shy was . '"
"I hope you have had a good night , ' he said earnestly ."
"` Thank you , ' she replied , ' I was so cosy and warm ."
But you ' -- and she looked at his nakedness awkwardly -- ` do n't you feel the least bit cold ? '
"Now cold was another word Peter had forgotten , so he answered , ' I think not , but I may be wrong : you see I am rather ignorant ."
I am not exactly a boy ; Solomon says I am a Betwixt-and-Between . '
"` So that is what it is called , ' said Maimie thoughtfully ."
"` That 's not my name , ' he explained , ` my name is Peter Pan . '"
"` Yes , of course , ' she said , ' I know , everybody knows . '"
You ca n't think how pleased Peter was to learn that all the people outside the gates knew about him .
"He begged Maimie to tell him what they knew and what they said , and she did so ."
"They were sitting by this time on a fallen tree ; Peter had cleared off the snow for Maimie , but he sat on a snowy bit himself ."
"` Squeeze closer , ' Maimie said ."
` What is that ? '
"he asked , and she showed him , and then he did it ."
"They talked together and he found that people knew a great deal about him , but not everything , not that he had gone back to his mother and been barred out , for instance , and he said nothing of this to Maimie , for it still humiliated him ."
` Do they know that I play games exactly like real boys ? '
he asked very proudly . '
"O Maimie , please tell them ! '"
"But when he revealed how he played , by sailing his hoop on the Round Pond , and so on , she was simply horrified ."
"` All your ways of playing , ' she said with her big eyes on him , ` are quite , quite wrong , and not in the least like how boys play . '"
"Poor Peter uttered a little moan at this , and he cried for the first time for I know not how long ."
"Maimie was extremely sorry for him , and lent him her handkerchief , but he did n't know in the least what to do with it , so she showed him , that is to say , she wiped her eyes , and then gave it back to him , saying , ` Now you do it , ' but instead of wiping his own eyes he wiped hers , and she thought it best to pretend that this was what she had meant ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Looking very undancey indeed -RSB- She said out of pity for him , ' I shall give you a kiss if you like , ' but though he once knew , he had long forgotten what kisses are , and he replied , ` Thank you , ' and held out his hand , thinking she had offered to put something into it ."
"This was a great shock to her , but she felt she could not explain without shaming him , so with charming delicacy she gave Peter a thimble which happened to be in her pocket , and pretended that it was a kiss ."
Poor little boy !
"he quite believed her , and to this day he wears it on his finger , though there can be scarcely any one who needs a thimble so little ."
"You see , though still a tiny child , it was really years and years since he had seen his mother , and I dare say the baby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers ."
"`` There is no Black Dog here , '' said the doctor , `` except what you have on your own back ."
"You have been drinking rum ; you have had a stroke , precisely as I told you ; and I have just , very much against my own will , dragged you headforemost out of the grave ."
"Now , Mr. Bones -- '' `` That 's not my name , '' he interrupted ."
"`` Much I care , '' returned the doctor ."
"`` It 's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance ; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness , and what I have to say to you is this ; one glass of rum wo n't kill you , but if you take one you 'll take another and another , and I stake my wig if you do n't break off short , you 'll die -- do you understand that ?"
"-- die , and go to your own place , like the man in the Bible ."
"Come , now , make an effort ."
I 'll help you to your bed for once . ''
"Between us , with much trouble , we managed to hoist him upstairs , and laid him on his bed , where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting ."
"`` Now , mind you , '' said the doctor , `` I clear my conscience -- the name of rum for you is death . ''"
"And with that he went off to see my father , taking me with him by the arm ."
"`` This is nothing , '' he said as soon as he had closed the door ."
`` I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile ; he should lie for a week where he is -- that is the best thing for him and you ; but another stroke would settle him . ''
3 The Black Spot ABOUT noon I stopped at the captain 's door with some cooling drinks and medicines .
"He was lying very much as we had left him , only a little higher , and he seemed both weak and excited ."
"`` Jim , '' he said , `` you 're the only one here that 's worth anything , and you know I 've been always good to you ."
Never a month but I 've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself .
"And now you see , mate , I 'm pretty low , and deserted by all ; and Jim , you 'll bring me one noggin of rum , now , wo n't you , matey ? ''"
`` The doctor -- '' I began .
"But he broke in cursing the doctor , in a feeble voice but heartily ."
"`` Doctors is all swabs , '' he said ; `` and that doctor there , why , what do he know about seafaring men ?"
"I been in places hot as pitch , and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack , and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes -- what to the doctor know of lands like that ?"
"-- and I lived on rum , I tell you ."
"It 's been meat and drink , and man and wife , to me ; and if I 'm not to have my rum now I 'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore , my blood 'll be on you , Jim , and that doctor swab '' ; and he ran on again for a while with curses ."
"`` Look , Jim , how my fingers fidges , '' he continued in the pleading tone ."
"`` I ca n't keep 'em still , not I. I have n't had a drop this blessed day ."
"That doctor 's a fool , I tell you ."
"If I do n't have a drain o ' rum , Jim , I 'll have the horrors ; I seen some on 'em already ."
"I seen old Flint in the corner there , behind you ; as plain as print , I seen him ; and if I get the horrors , I 'm a man that has lived rough , and I 'll raise Cain ."
Your doctor hisself said one glass would n't hurt me .
"I 'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin , Jim . ''"
"He was growing more and more excited , and this alarmed me for my father , who was very low that day and needed quiet ; besides , I was reassured by the doctor 's words , now quoted to me , and rather offended by the offer of a bribe ."
"Do ye gang easier so , Davie ? ''"
"`` Ay , '' said I , `` I can be doing this way ; '' and I pressed his arm with my hand ."
Again he came near sobbing .
"`` Davie , '' said he , `` I 'm no a right man at all ; I have neither sense nor kindness ; I could nae remember ye were just a bairn , I couldnae see ye were dying on your feet ; Davie , ye 'll have to try and forgive me . ''"
"`` O man , let 's say no more about it ! ''"
said I. `` We 're neither one of us to mend the other -- that 's the truth !
"We must just bear and forbear , man Alan ."
"O , but my stitch is sore !"
Is there nae house ? ''
"`` I 'll find a house to ye , David , '' he said , stoutly ."
"`` We 'll follow down the burn , where there 's bound to be houses ."
"My poor man , will ye no be better on my back ? ''"
"`` O , Alan , '' says I , `` and me a good twelve inches taller ? ''"
"`` Ye 're no such a thing , '' cried Alan , with a start ."
"`` There may be a trifling matter of an inch or two ; I 'm no saying I 'm just exactly what ye would call a tall man , whatever ; and I dare say , '' he added , his voice tailing off in a laughable manner , `` now when I come to think of it , I dare say ye 'll be just about right ."
"Ay , it 'll be a foot , or near hand ; or may be even mair ! ''"
It was sweet and laughable to hear Alan eat his words up in the fear of some fresh quarrel .
"I could have laughed , had not my stitch caught me so hard ; but if I had laughed , I think I must have wept too ."
"`` Alan , '' cried I , `` what makes ye so good to me ?"
What makes ye care for such a thankless fellow ? '' ''
"` Deed , and I do n't know '' said Alan ."
"`` For just precisely what I thought I liked about ye , was that ye never quarrelled : -- and now I like ye better ! ''"
"CHAPTER XXV IN BALQUHIDDER At the door of the first house we came to , Alan knocked , which was of no very safe enterprise in such a part of the Highlands as the Braes of Balquhidder ."
"No great clan held rule there ; it was filled and disputed by small septs , and broken remnants , and what they call `` chiefless folk , '' driven into the wild country about the springs of Forth and Teith by the advance of the Campbells ."
"Here were Stewarts and Maclarens , which came to the same thing , for the Maclarens followed Alan 's chief in war , and made but one clan with Appin ."
"Here , too , were many of that old , proscribed , nameless , red-handed clan of the Macgregors ."
"They had always been ill-considered , and now worse than ever , having credit with no side or party in the whole country of Scotland ."
"Their chief , Macgregor of Macgregor , was in exile ; the more immediate leader of that part of them about Balquhidder , James More , Rob Roy 's eldest son , lay waiting his trial in Edinburgh Castle ; they were in ill-blood with Highlander and Lowlander , with the Grahames , the Maclarens , and the Stewarts ; and Alan , who took up the quarrel of any friend , however distant , was extremely wishful to avoid them ."
"Chance served us very well ; for it was a household of Maclarens that we found , where Alan was not only welcome for his name 's sake but known by reputation ."
"Here then I was got to bed without delay , and a doctor fetched , who found me in a sorry plight ."
"But whether because he was a very good doctor , or I a very young , strong man , I lay bedridden for no more than a week , and before a month I was able to take the road again with a good heart ."
"All this time Alan would not leave me though I often pressed him , and indeed his foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with the two or three friends that were let into the secret ."
"There 's hills and heather enough between here and the two seas , David ; and I will own I 'm no very keen to stay where I 'm no wanted . ''"
"This pierced me like a sword , and seemed to lay bare my private disloyalty ."
`` Alan Breck ! ''
I cried ; and then : `` Do you think I am one to turn my back on you in your chief need ?
You durs n't say it to my face .
My whole conduct 's there to give the lie to it .
"It 's true , I fell asleep upon the muir ; but that was from weariness , and you do wrong to cast it up to me -- '' `` Which is what I never did , '' said Alan ."
"`` But aside from that , '' I continued , `` what have I done that you should even me to dogs by such a supposition ?"
"I never yet failed a friend , and it 's not likely I 'll begin with you ."
"There are things between us that I can never forget , even if you can . ''"
"`` I will only say this to ye , David , '' said Alan , very quietly , `` that I have long been owing ye my life , and now I owe ye money ."
Ye should try to make that burden light for me . ''
"This ought to have touched me , and in a manner it did , but the wrong manner ."
"I felt I was behaving badly ; and was now not only angry with Alan , but angry with myself in the bargain ; and it made me the more cruel ."
"`` You asked me to speak , '' said I. `` Well , then , I will ."
"You own yourself that you have done me a disservice ; I have had to swallow an affront : I have never reproached you , I never named the thing till you did ."
"And now you blame me , '' cried I , `` because I cannae laugh and sing as if I was glad to be affronted ."
The next thing will be that I 'm to go down upon my knees and thank you for it !
"Ye should think more of others , Alan Breck ."
"If ye thought more of others , ye would perhaps speak less about yourself ; and when a friend that likes you very well has passed over an offence without a word , you would be blithe to let it lie , instead of making it a stick to break his back with ."
"By your own way of it , it was you that was to blame ; then it shouldnae be you to seek the quarrel . ''"
"`` Aweel , '' said Alan , `` say nae mair . ''"
"And we fell back into our former silence ; and came to our journey 's end , and supped , and lay down to sleep , without another word ."
"The gillie put us across Loch Rannoch in the dusk of the next day , and gave us his opinion as to our best route ."
"This was to get us up at once into the tops of the mountains : to go round by a circuit , turning the heads of Glen Lyon , Glen Lochay , and Glen Dochart , and come down upon the lowlands by Kippen and the upper waters of the Forth ."
"Alan was little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his blood-foes , the Glenorchy Campbells ."
"He objected that by turning to the east , we should come almost at once among the Athole Stewarts , a race of his own name and lineage , although following a different chief , and come besides by a far easier and swifter way to the place whither we were bound ."
"But the gillie , who was indeed the chief man of Cluny 's scouts , had good reasons to give him on all hands , naming the force of troops in every district , and alleging finally -LRB- as well as I could understand -RRB- that we should nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the Campbells ."
"Alan gave way at last , but with only half a heart ."
"`` It 's one of the dowiest countries in Scotland , '' said he ."
"`` There 's naething there that I ken , but heath , and crows , and Campbells ."
But I see that ye 're a man of some penetration ; and be it as ye please ! ''
The pace was deadly : my heart seemed bursting against my ribs ; and I had neither time to think nor breath to speak with .
"Only I remember seeing with wonder , that Alan every now and then would straighten himself to his full height and look back ; and every time he did so , there came a great far-away cheering and crying of the soldiers ."
"Quarter of an hour later , Alan stopped , clapped down flat in the heather , and turned to me ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` it 's earnest ."
"Do as I do , for your life . ''"
"And at the same speed , but now with infinitely more precaution , we traced back again across the mountain-side by the same way that we had come , only perhaps higher ; till at last Alan threw himself down in the upper wood of Lettermore , where I had found him at the first , and lay , with his face in the bracken , panting like a dog ."
"My own sides so ached , my head so swam , my tongue so hung out of my mouth with heat and dryness , that I lay beside him like one dead ."
CHAPTER XVIII I TALK WITH ALAN IN THE WOOD OF LETTERMORE Alan was the first to come round .
"He rose , went to the border of the wood , peered out a little , and then returned and sat down ."
"`` Well , '' said he , `` yon was a hot burst , David . ''"
"I said nothing , nor so much as lifted my face ."
"I had seen murder done , and a great , ruddy , jovial gentleman struck out of life in a moment ; the pity of that sight was still sore within me , and yet that was but a part of my concern ."
"Here was murder done upon the man Alan hated ; here was Alan skulking in the trees and running from the troops ; and whether his was the hand that fired or only the head that ordered , signified but little ."
"By my way of it , my only friend in that wild country was blood-guilty in the first degree ; I held him in horror ; I could not look upon his face ; I would have rather lain alone in the rain on my cold isle , than in that warm wood beside a murderer ."
`` Are ye still wearied ? ''
he asked again .
"`` No , '' said I , still with my face in the bracken ; `` no , I am not wearied now , and I can speak ."
"You and me must twine , '' * I said ."
"`` I liked you very well , Alan , but your ways are not mine , and they 're not God 's : and the short and the long of it is just that we must twine . ''"
* Part .
"`` I will hardly twine from ye , David , without some kind of reason for the same , '' said Alan , mighty gravely ."
"`` If ye ken anything against my reputation , it 's the least thing that ye should do , for old acquaintance ' sake , to let me hear the name of it ; and if ye have only taken a distaste to my society , it will be proper for me to judge if I 'm insulted . ''"
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` what is the sense of this ?"
Ye ken very well yon Campbell-man lies in his blood upon the road . ''
"He was silent for a little ; then says he , `` Did ever ye hear tell of the story of the Man and the Good People ? ''"
-- by which he meant the fairies .
"`` No , '' said I , `` nor do I want to hear it . ''"
"`` With your permission , Mr. Balfour , I will tell it you , whatever , '' says Alan ."
"`` The man , ye should ken , was cast upon a rock in the sea , where it appears the Good People were in use to come and rest as they went through to Ireland ."
"The name of this rock is called the Skerryvore , and it 's not far from where we suffered ship-wreck ."
"Well , it seems the man cried so sore , if he could just see his little bairn before he died !"
"that at last the king of the Good People took peety upon him , and sent one flying that brought back the bairn in a poke * and laid it down beside the man where he lay sleeping ."
"she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world , but she was not to laugh much more that day ."
"Well , they went up the Baby Walk and back , and when they returned to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for closing-time ."
"But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies , and so did not see -LRB- as Maimie and Tony saw at once -RRB- that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night ."
"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back , and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts ."
You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball .
"Never , Tony felt , could he hope for a better chance ."
"-LSB- Illustration : One day they were overheard by a fairy -RSB- He had to feel this , for Maimie so plainly felt it for him ."
"Her eager eyes asked the question , ` Is it to-day ? '"
and he gasped and then nodded .
"Maimie slipped her hand into Tony 's , and hers was hot , but his was cold ."
She did a very kind thing ; she took off her scarf and gave it to him .
"` In case you should feel cold , ' she whispered ."
"Her face was aglow , but Tony 's was very gloomy ."
"As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her , ` I 'm afraid nurse would see me , so I sha n't be able to do it . '"
"Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah , when there were so many unknown terrors to fear , and she said aloud , ` Tony , I shall race you to the gate , ' and in a whisper , ` Then you can hide , ' and off they ran ."
"Tony could always outdistance her easily , but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now , and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide ."
"` Brave , brave ! '"
"her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock ; instead of hiding , her hero had run out at the gate !"
"At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly , as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled , and then for very disdain she could not sob ; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid in Tony 's stead ."
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out .
"Twilight crept over the Gardens , and hundreds of people passed out , including the last one , who always has to run for it , but Maimie saw them not ."
She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears .
When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart .
It was the stillness of the Gardens .
"Then she heard clang , then from another part clang , then clang , clang far away ."
It was the Closing of the Gates .
"Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice say , ` So that 's all right . '"
"It had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above , and she looked up in time to see an elm-tree stretching out its arms and yawning ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The little people weave their summer curtains from skeleton leaves -RSB- She was about to say , ' I never knew you could speak ! '"
"when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm , ' I suppose it is a bit coldish up there ? '"
"and the elm replied , ` Not particularly , but you do get numb standing so long on one leg , ' and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off ."
"Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing , and she stole away to the Baby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her ."
"One , tailing out behind the rest , was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey 's ; the rest were revenue officers , whom he had met by the way , and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once ."
"Some news of the lugger in Kitt 's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction , and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death ."
"Pew was dead , stone dead ."
"As for my mother , when we had carried her up to the hamlet , a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again , and she was none the worse for her terror , though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money ."
"In the meantime the supervisor rode on , as fast as he could , to Kitt 's Hole ; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle , leading , and sometimes supporting , their horses , and in continual fear of ambushes ; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way , though still close in ."
He hailed her .
"A voice replied , telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him , and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm ."
"Soon after , the lugger doubled the point and disappeared ."
"Mr. Dance stood there , as he said , `` like a fish out of water , '' and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B -- to warn the cutter ."
"`` And that , '' said he , `` is just about as good as nothing ."
"They 've got off clean , and there 's an end ."
"Only , '' he added , `` I 'm glad I trod on Master Pew 's corns , '' for by this time he had heard my story ."
"I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow , and you can not imagine a house in such a state of smash ; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself ; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain 's money-bag and a little silver from the till , I could see at once that we were ruined ."
Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene .
"`` They got the money , you say ?"
"Well , then , Hawkins , what in fortune were they after ?"
"More money , I suppose ? ''"
"`` No , sir ; not money , I think , '' replied I. `` In fact , sir , I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket ; and to tell you the truth , I should like to get it put in safety . ''"
"`` To be sure , boy ; quite right , '' said he ."
"`` I 'll take it , if you like . ''"
`` I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey -- '' I began .
"`` Perfectly right , '' he interrupted very cheerily , `` perfectly right -- a gentleman and a magistrate ."
"And , now I come to think of it , I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire ."
"Master Pew 's dead , when all 's done ; not that I regret it , but he 's dead , you see , and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty 's revenue , if make it out they can ."
"Now , I 'll tell you , Hawkins , if you like , I 'll take you along . ''"
"I thanked him heartily for the offer , and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were ."
By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle .
"`` Dogger , '' said Mr. Dance , `` you have a good horse ; take up this lad behind you . ''"
"As soon as I was mounted , holding on to Dogger 's belt , the supervisor gave the word , and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey 's house ."
6 The Captain 's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey 's door .
The house was all dark to the front .
"Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock , and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by ."
"Then I was afraid Jerry would go and make a fuss , and Bob would run off , or do something desperate , being worried , and I said I 'd pay it for him , if I could ."
"So he went home pretty jolly , and I scratched ` round for the money ."
"Got it , too , and was n't I glad ? ''"
"Jack paused to rub his hands , and Frank said , with more than usual respect , `` Could n't you get hold of Jerry in any other place , and out of school time ?"
"That did the mischief , thanks to Joe ."
"I thrashed him , Jill -- did I mention it ? ''"
"`` I could n't get all my money till Friday morning , and I knew Jerry was off at night ."
"I looked for him before school , and at noon , but could n't find him , so afternoon recess was my last chance ."
"I was bound to do it and I did n't mean to break the rule , but Jerry was just going into the shop , so I pelted after him , and as it was private business we went to the billiard-room ."
"I declare I never was so relieved as when I handed over that money , and made him say it was all right , and he would n't go near Bob ."
"He 's off , so my mind is easy , and Bob will be so grateful I can keep him steady , perhaps ."
"That will be worth two seventy-five , I think , '' said Jack heartily ."
"`` You should have come to me , '' began Frank ."
"`` And got laughed at -- no , thank you , '' interrupted Jack , recollecting several philanthropic little enterprises which were nipped in the bud for want of co-operation ."
"`` To me , then , '' said his mother ."
`` It would have saved so much trouble . ''
"`` I thought of it , but Bob did n't want the big fellows to know for fear they 'd be down on him , so I thought he might not like me to tell grown people ."
"I do n't mind the fuss now , and Bob is as kind as he can be ."
"Wanted to give me his big knife , but I would n't take it ."
"I 'd rather have this , '' and Jack put the letter in his pocket with a slap outside , as if it warmed the cockles of his heart to have it there ."
"`` Well , it seems rather like a tempest in a teapot , now it is all over , but I do admire your pluck , little boy , in holding out so well when every one was scolding at you , and you in the right all the time , '' said Frank , glad to praise , now that he honestly could , after his wholesale condemnation ."
"`` That is what pulled me through , I suppose ."
"I used to think if I had done anything wrong , that I could n't stand the snubbing a day ."
"I should have told right off , and had it over ."
"Now , I guess I 'll have a good report if you do tell Mr. Acton , '' said Jack , looking at his mother so wistfully , that she resolved to slip away that very evening , and make sure that the thing was done ."
"`` That will make you happier than anything else , wo n't it ? ''"
"asked Jill , eager to have him rewarded after his trials ."
"`` There 's one thing I like better , though I 'd be very sorry to lose my report ."
"It 's the fun of telling Ed I tried to do as he wanted us to , and seeing how pleased he 'll be , '' added Jack , rather bashfully , for the boys laughed at him sometimes for his love of this friend ."
"`` I know he wo n't be any happier about it than someone else , who stood by you all through , and set her bright wits to work till the trouble was all cleared away , '' said Mrs. Minot , looking at Jill 's contented face , as she lay smiling on them all ."
"Jack understood , and , hopping across the room , gave both the thin hands a hearty shake ; then , not finding any words quite cordial enough in which to thank this faithful little sister , he stooped down and kissed her gratefully ."
Chapter XV .
"He went in a hurry in the end , because he had dreamt that his mother was crying , and he knew what was the great thing she cried for , and that a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile ."
Oh !
"he felt sure of it , and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window , which was always to be open for him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit -RSB- But the window was closed , and there were iron bars on it , and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy ."
"Peter called , ` Mother !"
mother ! '
but she heard him not ; in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars .
"He had to fly back , sobbing , to the Gardens , and he never saw his dear again ."
What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her !
"Ah , Peter !"
"we who have made the great mistake , how differently we should all act at the second chance ."
"But Solomon was right -- there is no second chance , not for most of us ."
When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time .
The iron bars are up for life .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` Lock-out Time ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` The Little House ' -RSB- V THE LITTLE HOUSE Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens , which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans ."
"But no one has really seen it , except just three or four , and they have not only seen it but slept in it , and unless you sleep in it you never see it ."
"This is because it is not there when you lie down , but it is there when you wake up and step outside ."
"In a kind of way every one may see it , but what you see is not really it , but only the light in the windows ."
You see the light after Lock-out Time .
"David , for instance , saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime , and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple , which is the name of his father 's office ."
"Angela Clare , who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop , saw more than one light , she saw hundreds of them all together ; and this must have been the fairies building the house , for they build it every night , and always in a different part of the Gardens ."
"She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others , though she was not quite sure , for they jumped about so , and it might have been another one that was bigger ."
"But if it was the same one , it was Peter Pan 's light ."
"Heaps of children have seen the light , so that is nothing ."
But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built .
"Maimie was always rather a strange girl , and it was at night that she was strange ."
"She was four years of age , and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind ."
"She was pleased when her brother Tony , who was a magnificent fellow of six , took notice of her , and she looked up to him in the right way , and tried in vain to imitate him , and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about ."
"Also , when she was batting , she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes ."
She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime .
"-LSB- Illustration : Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra -RSB- But as the shades of night fell , Tony , the swaggerer , lost his contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully ; and no wonder , for with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look ."
It was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony 's uneasy glances .
"`` The Russians are doing splendidly , however , and they have saved Italy ."
But even when the daily news of their sweeping advance comes we do n't feel like running up the flag as we used to do .
"As Gertrude says , Verdun has slain all exultation ."
We would all feel more like rejoicing if the victories were on the western front .
` When will the British strike ? '
Gertrude sighed this morning .
` We have waited so long -- so long . '
`` Our greatest local event in recent weeks was the route march the county battalion made through the county before it left for overseas .
"They marched from Charlottetown to Lowbridge , then round the Harbour Head and through the Upper Glen and so down to the St. Mary station ."
"Everybody turned out to see them , except old Aunt Fannie Clow , who is bedridden and Mr. Pryor , who had n't been seen out even in church since the night of the Union Prayer Meeting the previous week ."
`` It was wonderful and heartbreaking to see that battalion marching past .
There were young men and middle-aged men in it .
"There was Laurie McAllister from over-harbour who is only sixteen but swore he was eighteen , so that he could enlist ; and there was Angus Mackenzie , from the Upper Glen who is fifty-five if he is a day and swore he was forty-four ."
"There were two South African veterans from Lowbridge , and the three eighteen-year-old Baxter triplets from Harbour Head ."
"Everybody cheered as they went by , and they cheered Foster Booth , who is forty , walking side by side with his son Charley who is twenty ."
"Charley 's mother died when he was born , and when Charley enlisted Foster said he 'd never yet let Charley go anywhere he dare n't go himself , and he did n't mean to begin with the Flanders trenches ."
At the station Dog Monday nearly went out of his head .
He tore about and sent messages to Jem by them all .
Mr. Meredith read an address and Reta Crawford recited ` The Piper . '
"The soldiers cheered her like mad and cried ` We 'll follow -- we 'll follow -- we wo n't break faith , ' and I felt so proud to think that it was my dear brother who had written such a wonderful , heart-stirring thing ."
And then I looked at the khaki ranks and wondered if those tall fellows in uniform could be the boys I 've laughed with and played with and danced with and teased all my life .
Something seems to have touched them and set them apart .
They have heard the Piper 's call .
"`` Fred Arnold was in the battalion and I felt dreadfully about him , for I realized that it was because of me that he was going away with such a sorrowful expression ."
I could n't help it but I felt as badly as if I could .
"`` The last evening of his leave Fred came up to Ingleside and told me he loved me and asked me if I would promise to marry him some day , if he ever came back ."
He was desperately in earnest and I felt more wretched than I ever did in my life .
"I could n't promise him that -- why , even if there was no question of Ken , I do n't care for Fred that way and never could -- but it seemed so cruel and heartless to send him away to the front without any hope of comfort ."
"I cried like a baby ; and yet -- oh , I am afraid that there must be something incurably frivolous about me , because , right in the middle of it all , with me crying and Fred looking so wild and tragic , the thought popped into my head that it would be an unendurable thing to see that nose across from me at the breakfast table every morning of my life ."
"There , that is one of the entries I would n't want my descendants to read in this journal ."
But it is the humiliating truth ; and perhaps it 's just as well that thought did come or I might have been tricked by pity and remorse into giving him some rash assurance .
If Fred 's nose were as handsome as his eyes and mouth some such thing might have happened .
Perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator .
"It was under a lime-tree , near the entrance to the Fairy Queen 's Winter Palace -LRB- which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts -RRB- , and Peter approached it warily , for the birds had never mentioned such things to him ."
"Lest it was alive , he addressed it politely ; and then , as it gave no answer , he went nearer and felt it cautiously ."
"He gave it a little push , and it ran from him , which made him think it must be alive after all ; but , as it had run from him , he was not afraid ."
"So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him , but this time it ran at him , and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat ."
"You must not think , however , that he was a coward , for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other , but the perambulator had gone , and he never saw any other one ."
I have promised to tell you also about his paddle .
"It was a child 's spade which he had found near St. Govor 's Well , and he thought it was a paddle ."
Do you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes ?
"If so , I think it rather silly of you ."
"What I mean is that , of course , one must pity him now and then , but to pity him all the time would be impertinence ."
"He thought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens , and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it ."
"He played without ceasing , while you often waste time by being mad-dog or Mary-Annish ."
"He could be neither of these things , for he had never heard of them , but do you think he is to be pitied for that ?"
"Oh , he was merry !"
"He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your father ."
"Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment ."
Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?
That is how Peter leaps them .
-LSB- Illustration : Fairies are all more or less in hiding until dusk -RSB- And think of the music of his pipe .
"Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens , but it is really Peter 's pipe they hear ."
"Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?"
"You can be sorry for him for that , but do n't be too sorry , for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her ."
It was the fairies who gave him the chance .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Thrush 's Nest ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Lock-out Time ' -RSB- IV LOCK-OUT TIME It is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies , and almost the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children ."
"Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens , and at that time there was not a fairy in the place ; then the children were admitted , and the fairies came trooping in that very evening ."
"They ca n't resist following the children , but you seldom see them , partly because they live in the daytime behind the railings , where you are not allowed to go , and also partly because they are so cunning ."
"They are not a bit cunning after Lock-out , but until Lock-out , my word !"
"-LSB- Illustration : They are so cunning -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : When they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- When you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well , and you remember a good deal about them in your babyhood , which it is a great pity you ca n't write down , for gradually you forget , and I have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy ."
"Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens , they were standing looking at a fairy all the time ."
The reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else .
This is one of their best tricks .
"`` I did so , sir , for my sins , '' said I ; `` for it was by his means and the procurement of my uncle , that I was kidnapped within sight of this town , carried to sea , suffered shipwreck and a hundred other hardships , and stand before you to-day in this poor accoutrement . ''"
"`` You say you were shipwrecked , '' said Rankeillor ; `` where was that ? ''"
"`` Off the south end of the Isle of Mull , '' said I. `` The name of the isle on which I was cast up is the Island Earraid . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
"says he , smiling , `` you are deeper than me in the geography ."
"But so far , I may tell you , this agrees pretty exactly with other informations that I hold ."
But you say you were kidnapped ; in what sense ? ''
"`` In the plain meaning of the word , sir , '' said I. `` I was on my way to your house , when I was trepanned on board the brig , cruelly struck down , thrown below , and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea ."
"I was destined for the plantations ; a fate that , in God 's providence , I have escaped . ''"
"`` The brig was lost on June the 27th , '' says he , looking in his book , `` and we are now at August the 24th ."
"Here is a considerable hiatus , Mr. Balfour , of near upon two months ."
It has already caused a vast amount of trouble to your friends ; and I own I shall not be very well contented until it is set right . ''
"`` Indeed , sir , '' said I , `` these months are very easily filled up ; but yet before I told my story , I would be glad to know that I was talking to a friend . ''"
"`` This is to argue in a circle , '' said the lawyer ."
`` I can not be convinced till I have heard you .
I can not be your friend till I am properly informed .
"If you were more trustful , it would better befit your time of life ."
"And you know , Mr. Balfour , we have a proverb in the country that evil-doers are aye evil-dreaders . ''"
"`` You are not to forget , sir , '' said I , `` that I have already suffered by my trustfulness ; and was shipped off to be a slave by the very man that -LRB- if I rightly understand -RRB- is your employer ? ''"
"All this while I had been gaining ground with Mr. Rankeillor , and in proportion as I gained ground , gaining confidence ."
"But at this sally , which I made with something of a smile myself , he fairly laughed aloud ."
"`` No , no , '' said he , `` it is not so bad as that ."
"Fui , non sum ."
"I was indeed your uncle 's man of business ; but while you -LRB- imberbis juvenis custode remoto -RRB- were gallivanting in the west , a good deal of water has run under the bridges ; and if your ears did not sing , it was not for lack of being talked about ."
"On the very day of your sea disaster , Mr. Campbell stalked into my office , demanding you from all the winds ."
I had never heard of your existence ; but I had known your father ; and from matters in my competence -LRB- to be touched upon hereafter -RRB- I was disposed to fear the worst .
"Mr. Ebenezer admitted having seen you ; declared -LRB- what seemed improbable -RRB- that he had given you considerable sums ; and that you had started for the continent of Europe , intending to fulfil your education , which was probable and praiseworthy ."
"Interrogated how you had come to send no word to Mr. Campbell , he deponed that you had expressed a great desire to break with your past life ."
"Further interrogated where you now were , protested ignorance , but believed you were in Leyden ."
That is a close sum of his replies .
"I am not exactly sure that any one believed him , '' continued Mr. Rankeillor with a smile ; `` and in particular he so much disrelished me expressions of mine that -LRB- in a word -RRB- he showed me to the door ."
"We were then at a full stand ; for whatever shrewd suspicions we might entertain , we had no shadow of probation ."
"If she said ` Peter ' again , he meant to cry ` Mother ' and run to her ."
"But she spoke no more , she made little moans only , and when he next peeped at her she was once more asleep , with tears on her face ."
"It made Peter very miserable , and what do you think was the first thing he did ?"
"Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed , he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe ."
"He had made it up himself out of the way she said ` Peter , ' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy ."
"He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say , ' O Peter , how exquisitely you play ! '"
"However , as she now seemed comfortable , he again cast looks at the window ."
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back .
"He had quite decided to be his mother 's boy , but hesitated about beginning to-night ."
It was the second wish which troubled him .
"He no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird , but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful , and , of course , he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies ."
"Also , if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad ."
He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon . '
"I should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more , ' he said wistfully to his sleeping mother ."
He quite argued with her as if she could hear him .
"` It would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure , ' he said coaxingly . '"
"I promise to come back , ' he said solemnly , and meant it , too ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Butter is got from the roots of old trees -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- And in the end , you know , he flew away ."
"Twice he came back from the window , wanting to kiss his mother , but he feared the delight of it might waken her , so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe , and then he flew back to the Gardens ."
"Many nights , and even months , passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish ; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long ."
"One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say , not only to his particular friends , but to a hundred favourite spots ."
"Then he had his last sail , and his very last sail , and his last sail of all , and so on ."
"Again , a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour ; and another comfortable reason was that , after all , there was no hurry , for his mother would never weary of waiting for him ."
"This last reason displeased old Solomon , for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate ."
"Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work , such as ` Never put off laying to-day because you can lay to-morrow , ' and ` In this world there are no second chances , ' and yet here was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it ."
"The birds pointed this out to each other , and fell into lazy habits ."
"But , mind you , though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother , he was quite decided to go back ."
The best proof of this was his caution with the fairies .
"They were most anxious that he should remain in the Gardens to play to them , and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as ' I wish the grass was not so wet , ' and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry , ' I do wish you would keep time ! '"
Then they would have said that this was his second wish .
"But he smoked their design , and though on occasions he began , ' I wish -- ' he always stopped in time ."
"So when at last he said to them bravely , ' I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always , ' they had to tickle his shoulders and let him go ."
"CHAPTER I PETER BREAKS THROUGH All children , except one , grow up ."
"They soon know that they will grow up , and the way Wendy knew was this ."
"One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden , and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother ."
"I suppose she must have looked rather delightful , for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried , ` Oh , why ca n't you remain like this for ever ! '"
"This was all that passed between them on the subject , but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up ."
You always know after you are two .
Two is the beginning of the end .
"Of course they lived at 14 , and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one ."
"She was a lovely lady , with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth ."
"Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes , one within the other , that come from the puzzling East , however many you discover there is always one more ; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get , though there it was , perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner ."
"The way Mr. Darling won her was this : the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her , and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling , who took a cab and nipped in first , and so he got her ."
"He got all of her , except the innermost box and the kiss ."
"He never knew about the box , and in time he gave up trying for the kiss ."
"Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it , but I can picture him trying , and then going off in a passion , slamming the door ."
Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him .
He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares .
"Of course no one really knows , but he quite seemed to know , and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him ."
"Mrs. Darling was married in white , and at first she kept the books perfectly , almost gleefully , as if it were a game , not so much as a brussels sprout was missing ; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out , and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces ."
She drew them when she should have been totting up .
They were Mrs. Darling 's guesses .
"Wendy came first , then John , then Michael ."
"For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her , as she was another mouth to feed ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her , but he was very honourable , and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling 's bed , holding her hand and calculating expenses , while she looked at him imploringly ."
"She wanted to risk it , come what might , but that was not his way ; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper , and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again ."
"` Now do n't interrupt , ' he would beg of her . '"
"I have one pound seventeen here , and two and six at the office ; I can cut off my coffee at the office , say ten shillings , making two nine and six , with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven , with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven , -- who is that moving ?"
"-- eight nine seven , dot and carry seven -- do n't speak , my own -- and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door -- quiet , child -- dot and carry child -- there , you 've done it !"
-- did I say nine nine seven ?
"yes , I said nine nine seven ; the question is , can we try it for a year on nine nine seven ? '"
"` Of course we can , George , ' she cried ."
"But she was prejudiced in Wendy 's favour , and he was really the grander character of the two ."
"` Remember mumps , ' he warned her almost threateningly , and off he went again ."
"For the next two hours the girls wrote busily , forgetting all about the rainy day , and enjoying their epistolary labours to the full ."
It was dusk when all the letters were finished .
"`` Why , has n't the afternoon gone quickly after all ! ''"
exclaimed Carol .
`` I just let my pen run on and jotted down any good working idea that came into my head .
"Cyrilla Blair , that big fat letter is never for Miss Marshall !"
What on earth did you find to write her ? ''
"`` It was n't so hard when I got fairly started , '' said Cyrilla , smiling ."
"`` Now , let 's hunt up Nora Jane and send the letters around so that everybody can read his or hers before tea-time ."
We should have a choice assortment of smiles at the table instead of all those frowns and sighs we had at dinner . ''
"Miss Emily Marshall was at that moment sitting in her little back room , all alone in the dusk , with the rain splashing drearily against the windowpanes outside ."
Miss Marshall was feeling as lonely and dreary as she looked -- and as she had often felt in her life of sixty years .
She told herself bitterly that she had n't a friend in the world -- not even one who cared enough for her to come and see her or write her a letter now and then .
"She thought her boarding-house acquaintances disliked her and she resented their dislike , without admitting to herself that her ungracious ways were responsible for it ."
She smiled sourly when little ripples of laughter came faintly down the hall from the front room where The Trio were writing their letters and laughing over the fun they were putting into them .
"`` If they were old and lonesome and friendless they would n't see much in life to laugh at , I guess , '' said Miss Marshall bitterly , drawing her shawl closer about her sharp shoulders ."
`` They never think of anything but themselves and if a day passes that they do n't have ` some fun ' they think it 's a fearful thing to put up with .
I 'm sick and tired of their giggling and whispering . ''
In the midst of these amiable reflections Miss Marshall heard a knock at her door .
"When she opened it there stood Nora Jane , her broad red face beaming with smiles ."
"`` Please , Miss , here 's a letter for you , '' she said ."
`` A letter for me ! ''
Miss Marshall shut her door and stared at the fat envelope in amazement .
Who could have written it ?
The postman came only in the morning .
"Was it some joke , perhaps ?"
Those giggling girls ?
Miss Marshall 's face grew harder as she lighted her lamp and opened the letter suspiciously .
"`` Dear Miss Marshall , '' it ran in Cyrilla 's pretty girlish writing , `` we girls are so lonesome and dull that we have decided to write rainy-day letters to everybody in the house just to cheer ourselves up ."
So I 'm going to write to you just a letter of friendly nonsense . ''
"Pages of `` nonsense '' followed , and very delightful nonsense it was , for Cyrilla possessed the happy gift of bright and easy letter-writing ."
"She commented wittily on all the amusing episodes of the boarding-house life for the past month ; she described a cat-fight she had witnessed from her window that morning and illustrated it by a pen-and-ink sketch of the belligerent felines ; she described a lovely new dress her mother had sent her from home and told all about the class party to which she had worn it ; she gave an account of her vacation camping trip to the mountains and pasted on one page a number of small snapshots taken during the outing ; she copied a joke she had read in the paper that morning and discussed the serial story in the boarding-house magazine which all the boarders were reading ; she wrote out the directions for a new crocheted tidy her sister had made -- Miss Marshall had a mania for crocheting ; and she finally wound up with `` all the good will and good wishes that Nora Jane will consent to carry from your friend , Cyrilla Blair . ''"
said the eyes of one to the eyes of the other .
Meanwhile the swallows had spoken again .
` That was indeed good fortune ! '
cried they .
` And when the children are grown up they can return to their father and set their mother free . '
"` It will not be so easy as you think , ' answered the city swallow , shaking her head ; ` for they will have to prove that they are the king 's children , and also that their mother never went mad at all ."
"In fact , it is so difficult that there is only one way of proving it to the king . '"
` And what is that ? '
cried all the swallows at once .
` And how do you know it ? ' '
"I know it , ' answered the city swallow , ` because , one day , when I was passing through the palace garden , I met a cuckoo , who , as I need not tell you , always pretends to be able to see into the future ."
"We began to talk about certain things which were happening in the palace , and of the events of past years ."
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` the only person who can expose the wickedness of the ministers and show the king how wrong he has been , is the Bird of Truth , who can speak the language of men . '' '"
`` And where can this bird be found ? ''
I asked . '
"`` It is shut up in a castle guarded by a fierce giant , who only sleeps one quarter of an hour out of the whole twenty-four , '' replied the cuckoo ."
` And where is this castle ? '
"inquired the country swallow , who , like all the rest , and the children most of all , had been listening with deep attention ."
"` That is just what I do n't know , ' answered her friend ."
"` All I can tell you is that not far from here is a tower , where dwells an old witch , and it is she who knows the way , and she will only teach it to the person who promises to bring her the water from the fountain of many colours , which she uses for her enchantments ."
"But never will she betray the place where the Bird of Truth is hidden , for she hates him , and would kill him if she could ; knowing well , however , that this bird can not die , as he is immortal , she keeps him closely shut up , and guarded night and day by the Birds of Bad Faith , who seek to gag him so that his voice should not be heard . '"
"` And is there no one else who can tell the poor boy where to find the bird , if he should ever manage to reach the tower ? '"
asked the country swallow .
"` No one , ' replied the city swallow , ` except an owl , who lives a hermit 's life in that desert , and he knows only one word of man 's speech , and that is `` cross . ''"
"So that even if the prince did succeed in getting there , he could never understand what the owl said ."
"But , look , the sun is sinking to his nest in the depths of the sea , and I must go to mine ."
"Good-night , friends , good-night ! '"
"Then the swallow flew away , and the children , who had forgotten both hunger and weariness in the joy of this strange news , rose up and followed in the direction of her flight ."
"After two hours ' walking , they arrived at a large city , which they felt sure must be the capital of their father 's kingdom ."
"Seeing a good-natured looking woman standing at the door of a house , they asked her if she would give them a night 's lodging , and she was so pleased with their pretty faces and nice manners that she welcomed them warmly ."
"It was scarcely light the next morning before the girl was sweeping out the rooms , and the boy watering the garden , so that by the time the good woman came downstairs there was nothing left for her to do ."
"This so delighted her that she begged the children to stay with her altogether , and the boy answered that he would leave his sisters with her gladly , but that he himself had serious business on hand and must not linger in pursuit of it ."
"I know that Jem and Jerry are in the trenches -- that Ken and Walter will be soon -- that if one of them does not come back my heart will break -- yet I go on and work and plan -- yes , and even enjoy life by times ."
"There are moments when we have real fun because , just for the moment , we do n't think about things and then -- we remember -- and the remembering is worse than thinking of it all the time would have been ."
"`` Today was dark and cloudy and tonight is wild enough , as Gertrude says , to please any novelist in search of suitable matter for a murder or elopement ."
"The raindrops streaming over the panes look like tears running down a face , and the wind is shrieking through the maple grove ."
`` This has n't been a nice Christmas Day in any way .
"Nan had toothache and Susan had red eyes , and assumed a weird and gruesome flippancy of manner to deceive us into thinking she had n't ; and Jims had a bad cold all day and I 'm afraid of croup ."
He has had croup twice since October .
"The first time I was nearly frightened to death , for father and mother were both away -- father always is away , it seems to me , when any of this household gets sick ."
"But Susan was cool as a fish and knew just what to do , and by morning Jims was all right ."
That child is a cross between a duck and an imp .
"He 's a year and four months old , trots about everywhere , and says quite a few words ."
He has the cutest little way of calling me `` Willa-will . ''
"It always brings back that dreadful , ridiculous , delightful night when Ken came to say good-bye , and I was so furious and happy ."
Jims is pink and white and big-eyed and curly-haired and every now and then I discover a new dimple in him .
"I can never quite believe he is really the same creature as that scrawny , yellow , ugly little changeling I brought home in the soup tureen ."
Nobody has ever heard a word from Jim Anderson .
If he never comes back I shall keep Jims always .
Everybody here worships and spoils him -- or would spoil him if Morgan and I did n't stand remorselessly in the way .
Susan says Jims is the cleverest child she ever saw and can recognize Old Nick when he sees him -- this because Jims threw poor Doc out of an upstairs window one day .
"Doc turned into Mr. Hyde on his way down and landed in a currant bush , spitting and swearing ."
"I tried to console his inner cat with a saucer of milk but he would have none of it , and remained Mr. Hyde the rest of the day ."
Jims 's latest exploit was to paint the cushion of the big arm-chair in the sun parlour with molasses ; and before anybody found it out Mrs. Fred Clow came in on Red Cross business and sat down on it .
Her new silk dress was ruined and nobody could blame her for being vexed .
"But she went into one of her tempers and said nasty things and gave me such slams about ` spoiling ' Jims that I nearly boiled over , too ."
But I kept the lid on till she had waddled away and then I exploded . ''
"` The fat , clumsy , horrid old thing , ' I said -- and oh , what a satisfaction it was to say it . ''"
"` She has three sons at the front , ' mother said rebukingly . '' '"
"I suppose that covers all her shortcomings in manners , ' I retorted ."
But I was ashamed -- for it is true that all her boys have gone and she was very plucky and loyal about it too ; and she is a perfect tower of strength in the Red Cross .
It 's a little hard to remember all the heroines .
"Just the same , it was her second new silk dress in one year and that when everybody is -- or should be -- trying to ` save and serve . '"
`` I had to bring out my green velvet hat again lately and begin wearing it .
I 'm all right .
"Do n't squeeze the breath out of me , please , '' expostulated Jack , looking so startled and innocent , as he struggled feebly , that they all laughed , and this plaintive protest caused him to be released ."
"But the next proceeding did not enlighten him much , for Frank kept waving a very inky paper before him and ordering him to read it , while Mamma made a charge at Jill , as if it was absolutely necessary to hug somebody ."
`` Hullo ! ''
"said Jack , when he got the letter into his own hand and read it ."
`` Now who put Bob up to this ?
"Nobody had any business to interfere -- but it 's mighty good of him , anyway , '' he added , as the anxious lines in his round face smoothed themselves away , while a smile of relief told how hard it had been for him to keep his word ."
`` I did ! ''
"cried Jill , clapping her hands , and looking so happy that he could not have scolded her if he had wanted to ."
`` Who told you he was in the scrape ? ''
"demanded Jack , in a hurry to know all about it now the seal was taken off his own lips ."
"`` You did ; '' and Jill 's face twinkled with naughty satisfaction , for this was the best fun of all ."
`` I did n't !
When ?
Where ?
It 's a joke ! ''
"`` You did , '' cried Jill , pointing to the rug ."
"`` You went to sleep there after the long walk , and talked in your sleep about ` Bob ' and ` All right , old boy , ' and ever so much gibberish ."
"I did n't think about it then , but when I heard that Bob was up there I thought may be he knew something about it , and last night I wrote and asked him , and that 's the answer , and now it is all right , and you are the best boy that ever was , and I 'm so glad ! ''"
"Here Jill paused , all out of breath , and Frank said , with an approving pat on the head , -- `` It wo n't do to have such a sharp young person round if we are going to have secrets ."
"You 'd make a good detective , miss . ''"
`` Catch me taking naps before people again ; '' and Jack looked rather crestfallen that his own words had set `` Fine Ear '' on the track .
"`` Never mind , I did n't mean to tell , though I just ached to do it all the time , so I have n't broken my word ."
"I 'm glad you all know , but you need n't let it get out , for Bob is a good fellow , and it might make trouble for him , '' added Jack , anxious lest his gain should be the other 's loss ."
"`` I shall tell Mr. Acton myself , and the Captain , also , for I 'm not going to have my son suspected of wrong-doing when he has only tried to help a friend , and borne enough for his sake , '' said Mamma , much excited by this discovery of generous fidelity in her boy ; though when one came to look at it calmly , one saw that it might have been done in a wiser way ."
"`` Now , please , do n't make a fuss about it ; that would be most as bad as having every one down on me ."
"I can stand your praising me , but I wo n't be patted on the head by anybody else ; '' and Jack assumed a manly air , though his face was full of genuine boyish pleasure at being set right in the eyes of those he loved ."
"`` I 'll be discreet , dear , but you owe it to yourself , as well as Bob , to have the truth known ."
"Both have behaved well , and no harm will come to him , I am sure ."
"I 'll see to that myself , '' said Mrs. Minot , in a tone that set Jack 's mind at rest on that point ."
"`` Now do tell all about it , '' cried Jill , who was pining to know the whole story , and felt as if she had earned the right to hear it ."
"`` Oh , it was n't much ."
"`` We 'll try , '' promised Cyrilla with dancing eyes ."
When the door closed behind Mrs. Plunkett the three girls looked at each other .
"`` Cyrilla , that idea of yours was a really truly inspiration , '' said Carol solemnly ."
"`` I believe it was , '' said Cyrilla , thinking of Miss Marshall ."
Dorinda 's Desperate Deed Dorinda had been home for a whole wonderful week and the little Pages were beginning to feel acquainted with her .
"When a girl goes away when she is ten and does n't come back until she is fifteen , it is only to be expected that her family should regard her as somewhat of a stranger , especially when she is really a Page , and they are really all Carters except for the name ."
"Dorinda had been only ten when her Aunt Mary -- on the Carter side -- had written to Mrs. Page , asking her to let Dorinda come to her for the winter ."
"Mrs. Page , albeit she was poor -- nobody but herself knew how poor -- and a widow with five children besides Dorinda , hesitated at first ."
"She was afraid , with good reason , that the winter might stretch into other seasons ; but Mary had lost her own only little girl in the summer , and Mrs. Page shuddered at the thought of what her loneliness must be ."
"So , to comfort her , Mrs. Page had let Dorinda go , stipulating that she must come home in the spring ."
"In the spring , when Dorinda 's bed of violets was growing purple under the lilac bush , Aunt Mary wrote again ."
"Dorinda was contented and happy , she said ."
Would not Emily let her stay for the summer ?
Mrs. Page cried bitterly over that letter and took sad counsel with herself .
"To let Dorinda stay with her aunt for the summer really meant , she knew , to let her stay altogether ."
Mrs. Page was finding it harder and harder to get along ; there was so little and the children needed so much ; Dorinda would have a good home with her Aunt Mary if she could only prevail on her rebellious mother heart to give her up .
In the end she agreed to let Dorinda stay for the summer -- and Dorinda had never been home since .
"But now Dorinda had come back to the little white house on the hill at Willowdale , set back from the road in a smother of apple trees and vines ."
"Aunt Mary had died very suddenly and her only son , Dorinda 's cousin , had gone to Japan ."
"There was nothing for Dorinda to do save to come home , to enter again into her old unfilled place in her mother 's heart , and win a new place in the hearts of the brothers and sisters who barely remembered her at all ."
Leicester had been nine and Jean seven when Dorinda went away ; now they were respectively fourteen and twelve .
"At first they were a little shy with this big , practically brand-new sister , but this soon wore off ."
Nobody could be shy long with Dorinda ; nobody could help liking her .
"She was so brisk and jolly and sympathetic -- a real Page , so everybody said -- while the brothers and sisters were Carter to their marrow ; Carters with fair hair and blue eyes , and small , fine , wistful features ; but Dorinda had merry black eyes , plump , dusky-red cheeks , and a long braid of glossy dark hair , which was perpetually being twitched from one shoulder to another as Dorinda whisked about the house on domestic duties intent ."
"In a week Dorinda felt herself one of the family again , with all the cares and responsibilities thereof resting on her strong young shoulders ."
"Dorinda and her mother talked matters out fully one afternoon over their sewing , in the sunny south room where the winds got lost among the vines halfway through the open window ."
Mrs. Page sighed and said she really did not know what to do .
"Dorinda did not sigh ; she did not know just what to do either , but there must be something that could be done -- there is always something that can be done , if one can only find it ."
Dorinda sewed hard and pursed up her red lips determinedly .
"`` Do n't you worry , Mother Page , '' she said briskly ."
`` We 'll be like that glorious old Roman who found a way or made it .
I like overcoming difficulties .
"That day the cows wandered father than ever they had done before , and never stopped till they had reached a moor where the heather was burning ."
"The fire was fierce , but the cows took no heed , and walked steadily through it , Covan the Brown-haired following them ."
"Next they plunged into a foaming river , and Covan plunged in after them , though the water came high above his waist ."
"On the other side of the river lay a wide plain , and here the cows lay down , while Covan looked about him ."
"Near him was a house built of yellow stone , and from it came sweet songs , and Covan listened , and his heart grew light within him ."
"While he was thus waiting there ran up to him a youth , scarcely able to speak so swiftly had he sped ; and he cried aloud : ` Hasten , hasten , Covan the Brown-haired , for your cows are in the corn , and you must drive them out ! '"
"` Nay , ' said Covan smiling , ` it had been easier for you to have driven them out than to come here to tell me . '"
And he went on listening to the music .
"Very soon the same youth returned and cried with panting breath : ` Out upon you , Covan son of Gorla , that you stand there agape ."
"For our dogs are chasing your cows , and you must drive them off ! '"
"` Nay , then , ' answered Covan as before , ` it had been easier for you to call off your dogs than to come here to tell me . '"
And he stayed where he was till the music ceased .
"Then he turned to look for the cows , and found them all lying in the place where he had left them ; but when they saw Covan they rose up and walked homewards , taking a different path to that they had trod in the morning ."
"This time they passed over a plain so bare that a pin could not have lain there unnoticed , yet Covan beheld with surprise a foal and its mother feeding there , both as fat as if they had pastured on the richest grass ."
"Further on they crossed another plain , where the grass was thick and green , but on it were feeding a foal and its mother , so lean that you could have counted their ribs ."
"And further again the path led them by the shores of a lake whereon were floating two boats ; one full of gay and happy youths , journeying to the land of the Sun , and another with grim shapes clothed in black , travelling to the land of Night ."
` What can these things mean ? '
"said Covan to himself , as he followed his cows ."
"Darkness now fell , the wind howled , and torrents of rain poured upon them ."
"Covan knew not how far they might yet have to go , or indeed if they were on the right road ."
"He could not even see his cows , and his heart sank lest , after all , he should have failed to bring them safely back ."
What was he to do ?
"He waited thus , for he could go neither forwards nor backwards , till he felt a great friendly paw laid on his shoulder ."
"` My cave is just here , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor , of whom Covan son of Gorla had heard much ."
"` Spend the night here , and you shall be fed on the flesh of lamb , and shall lay aside three-thirds of thy weariness . '"
"And Covan entered , and supped , and slept , and in the morning rose up a new man ."
"` Farewell , Covan , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"` May success go with you , for you took what I had to give and did not mock me ."
"So , when danger is your companion , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '"
"At these words the Dog of Maol-mor disappeared into the forest , and Covan went to seek his cows , which were standing in the hollow where the darkness had come upon them ."
"At the sight of Covan the Brown-haired they walked onwards , Covan following ever behind them , and looking neither to the right nor to the left ."
"All that day they walked , and when night fell they were in a barren plain , with only rocks for shelter ."
"When that is done , come to us and we will give you further directions . ' '"
"I will obey you in everything , dear brothers , ' answered Lyman ; and so she did ."
"It had happened that on this very evening the Stalos had driven in some of the reindeer from the pasture , and had tied them up to the wall of the house so that they might be handy to kill for next day 's dinner ."
"The two Sodnos had seen what they were doing , and where the beasts were secured ; so , at midnight , when all was still , they crept down from their tree and seized the reindeer by the horns which were locked together ."
"The animals were frightened , and began to neigh and kick , as if they were fighting together , and the noise became so great that even the eldest Stalo was awakened by it , and that was a thing which had never occurred before ."
"Raising himself in his bed , he called to his youngest brother to go out and separate the reindeer or they would certainly kill themselves ."
"The young Stalo did as he was bid , and left the house ; but no sooner was he out of the door than he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Sodnos , and fell without a groan ."
"Then they went back to worry the reindeer , and the noise became as great as ever , and a second time the Stalo awoke ."
"` The boy does not seem to be able to part the beasts , ' he cried to his second brother ; ` go and help him , or I shall never get to sleep . '"
"So the brother went , and in an instant was struck dead as he left the house by the sword of the eldest Sodno ."
"The Stalo waited in bed a little longer for things to get quiet , but as the clatter of the reindeer 's horns was as bad as ever , he rose angrily from his bed muttering to himself : ` It is extraordinary that they can not unlock themselves ; but as no one else seems able to help them I suppose I must go and do it . '"
"Rubbing his eyes , he stood up on the floor and stretched his great arms and gave a yawn which shook the walls ."
"The Sodnos heard it below , and posted themselves , one at the big door and one at the little door at the back , for they did not know what their enemy would come out at ."
"The Stalo put out his hand to take his iron mantle from the bed , where it always lay , but the mantle was no there ."
"He wondered where it could be , and who could have moved it , and after searching through all the rooms , he found it hanging over the kitchen fire ."
"But the first touch burnt him so badly that he let it alone , and went with nothing , except a stick in his hand , through the back door ."
"The young Sodno was standing ready for him , and as the Stalo passed the threshold struck him such a blow on the head that he rolled over with a crash and never stirred again ."
"The two Sodnos did not trouble about him , but quickly stripped the younger Stalos of their clothes , in which they dressed themselves ."
Then they sat still till the dawn should break and they could find out from the Stalos ' mother where the treasure was hidden .
With the first rays of the sun the young Sodno went upstairs and entered the old woman 's room .
"She was already up and dressed , and sitting by the window knitting , and the young man crept in softly and crouched down on the floor , laying his head on her lap ."
"For a while he kept silence , then he whispered gently : ` Tell me , dear mother , where did my eldest brother conceal his riches ? '"
` What a strange question !
"Surely you must know , ' answered she ."
"` No , I have forgotten ; my memory is so bad . '"
"` He dug a hole under the doorstep and placed it there , ' said she ."
And there was another pause .
By-and-by the Sodno asked again : ` And where may my second brother 's money be ? '
` Do n't you know that either ? '
cried the mother in surprise .
"` Oh , yes ; I did once ."
But since I fell upon my head I can remember nothing . '
"` No , I did not , ' she answered ; ` the girl went off with your dinner ."
"She must have lost her way , but will no doubt come back to-morrow . '"
"But at daybreak the woodcutter started off into the wood , and this time asked his second daughter to bring his food . '"
"I will take a bag of lentils , ' said he ; ` they are larger than millet , and the girl will see them better and be sure to find her way . '"
"At midday the maiden took the food , but the lentils had all gone ; as on the previous day , the wood birds had eaten them all ."
"The maiden wandered about the wood till nightfall , when she came in the same way to the old man 's house , and asked for food and a night 's lodging ."
"The man with the white hair again asked the beasts : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"The beasts answered , ` Duks , ' and everything happened as on the former day ."
"The girl cooked a good meal , ate and drank with the old man , and did not trouble herself about the animals ."
"And when she asked for a bed , they replied : You have eaten with him You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Now sleep as you ought !"
"And when she was asleep , the old man shook his head over her , and let her fall into the cellar ."
"On the third morning the woodcutter said to his wife , ` Send our youngest child to-day with my dinner ."
"She is always good and obedient , and will keep to the right path , and not wander away like her sisters , idle drones ! '"
"But the mother said , ` Must I lose my dearest child too ? '"
"` Do not fear , ' he answered ; ` she is too clever and intelligent to lose her way ."
"I will take plenty of peas with me and strew them along ; they are even larger than lentils , and will show her the way . '"
"But when the maiden started off with the basket on her arm , the wood pigeons had eaten up the peas , and she did not know which way to go ."
"She was much distressed , and thought constantly of her poor hungry father and her anxious mother ."
"At last , when it grew dark , she saw the little light , and came to the house in the wood ."
"She asked prettily if she might stay there for the night , and the man with the white beard asked his beasts again : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"` Duks , ' they said ."
"Then the maiden stepped up to the stove where the animals were lying , and stroked the cock and the hen , and scratched the brindled cow between its horns ."
"And when at the bidding of the old man she had prepared a good supper , and the dishes were standing on the table , she said , ` Shall I have plenty while the good beasts have nothing ?"
There is food to spare outside ; I will attend to them first . '
"Then she went out and fetched barley and strewed it before the cock and hen , and brought the cow an armful of sweet-smelling hay ."
"` Eat that , dear beasts , ' she said , ' and when you are thirsty you shall have a good drink . '"
"Then she fetched a bowl of water , and the cock and hen flew on to the edge , put their beaks in , and then held up their heads as birds do when they drink , and the brindled cow also drank her fill ."
"When the beasts were satisfied , the maiden sat down beside the old man at the table and ate what was left for her ."
"Soon the cock and hen began to tuck their heads under their wings , and the brindled cow blinked its eyes , so the maiden said , ` Shall we not go to rest now ? '"
"Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"The animals said , ` Duks : You have eaten with us , You have drunk with us , You have tended us right , So we wish you good night . '"
"The maiden therefore went upstairs , made the bed and put on clean sheets and fell asleep ."
"`` We all want to wear the nice things , so let us draw lots ."
Would n't that be the fairest way ? ''
"asked Merry , looking like a rosy little bride , under a great piece of illusion , which had done duty in many plays ."
"`` The Prince is light , so the Princess must be darkish ."
"We ought to choose the girl who will look best , as it is a picture ."
"I heard Miss Delano say so , when the ladies got up the tableaux , last winter , and every one wanted to be Cleopatra , '' said Jill decidedly ."
"`` You choose , and then if we ca n't agree we will draw lots , '' proposed Susy , who , being plain , knew there was little hope of her getting a chance in any other way ."
"So all stood in a row , and Jill , from her sofa , surveyed them critically , feeling that the one Jack would really prefer was not among the number ."
"`` I choose that one , for Juliet wants to be Queen , Molly would make faces , and the others are too big or too light , '' pronounced Jill , pointing to Merry , who looked pleased , while Mabel 's face darkened , and Susy gave a disdainful sniff ."
"`` You 'd better draw lots , and then there will be no fuss ."
"Ju and I are out of the fight , but you three can try , and let this settle the matter , '' said Molly , handing Jill a long strip of paper ."
"All agreed to let it be so , and when the bits were ready drew in turn ."
"This time fate was evidently on Merry 's side , and no one grumbled when she showed the longest paper ."
"`` Go and dress , then come back , and we 'll plan how we are to be placed before we call up the boys , '' commanded Jill , who was manager , since she could be nothing else ."
"The girls retired to the bedroom and began to `` rig up , '' as they called it ; but discontent still lurked among them , and showed itself in sharp words , envious looks , and disobliging acts ."
`` Am I to have the white silk and the feather ? ''
"asked Merry , delighted with the silvery shimmer of the one and the graceful droop of the other , though both were rather shabby ."
`` You can use your own dress .
"I do n't see why you should have everything , '' answered Susy , who was at the mirror , putting a wreath of scarlet flowers on her red head , bound to be gay since she could not be pretty ."
"`` I think I 'd better keep the plume , as I have n't anything else that is nice , and I 'm afraid Emma would n't like me to lend it , '' added Annette , who was disappointed that Mabel was not to be the Beauty . ''"
I do n't intend to act at all ! ''
"declared Mabel , beginning to braid up her hair with a jerk , out of humor with the whole affair . ''"
"I think you are a set of cross , selfish girls to back out and keep your nice things just because you ca n't all have the best part ."
I 'm ashamed of you ! ''
"scolded Molly , standing by Merry , who was sadly surveying her mother 's old purple silk , which looked like brown in the evening ."
"`` I 'm going to have Miss Delano 's red brocade for the Queen , and I shall ask her for the yellow-satin dress for Merry when I go to get mine , and tell her how mean you are , '' said Juliet , frowning under her gilt-paper crown as she swept about in a red table-cloth for train till the brocade arrived ."
"`` Perhaps you 'd like to have Mabel cut her hair off , so Merry can have that , too ? ''"
"cried Susy , with whom hair was a tender point ."
"`` Light hair is n't wanted , so Ju will have to give hers , or you 'd better borrow Miss Bat 's frisette , '' added Mabel , with a scornful laugh ."
`` I just wish Miss Bat was here to give you girls a good shaking .
"Do let someone else have a chance at the glass , you peacock ! ''"
"exclaimed Molly Loo , pushing Susy aside to arrange her own blue turban , out of which she plucked the pink pompon to give Merry ."
`` Now we must fly round and fill up .
"Come , boys , sort out the green and hand us the flowers as we want them ."
"Then we must direct them , and , by the time that is done , you can go and leave them , '' said Jill , setting all to work ."
`` Ed must choose his baskets first .
"These are ours ; but any of those you can have ; '' and Molly pointed to a detachment of gay baskets , set apart from those already partly filled ."
"Ed chose a blue one , and Merry filled it with the rosiest may-flowers , knowing that it was to hang on Mabel 's door-handle ."
"The others did the same , and the pretty work went on , with much fun , till all were filled , and ready for the names or notes ."
"`` Let us have poetry , as we ca n't get wild flowers ."
"That will be rather fine , '' proposed Jill , who liked jingles ."
"All had had some practice at the game parties , and pencils went briskly for a few minutes , while silence reigned , as the poets racked their brains for rhymes , and stared at the blooming array before them for inspiration ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"I ca n't find a word to rhyme to ` geranium , ' '' sighed Molly , pulling her braid , as if to pump the well of her fancy dry ."
"`` Cranium , '' said Frank , who was getting on bravely with `` Annette '' and `` violet . ''"
`` That is elegant ! ''
"and Molly scribbled away in great glee , for her poems were always funny ones ."
"`` How do you spell anemoly -- the wild flower , I mean ? ''"
"asked Jill , who was trying to compose a very appropriate piece for her best basket , and found it easier to feel love and gratitude than to put them into verse ."
"`` Anemone ; do spell it properly , or you 'll get laughed at , '' answered Gus , wildly struggling to make his lines express great ardor , without being `` too spoony , '' as he expressed it ."
"`` No , I should n't ."
"This person never laughs at other persons ' mistakes , as some persons do , '' replied Jill , with dignity ."
"Jack was desperately chewing his pencil , for he could not get on at all ; but Ed had evidently prepared his poem , for his paper was half full already , and Merry was smiling as she wrote a friendly line or two for Ralph 's basket , as she feared he would be forgotten , and knew he loved kindness even more than he did beauty ."
"`` Now let 's read them , '' proposed Molly , who loved to laugh even at herself ."
"The boys politely declined , and scrambled their notes into the chosen baskets in great haste ; but the girls were less bashful ."
"Jill was invited to begin , and gave her little piece , with the pink hyacinth basket before her , to illustrate her poem ."
"`` TO MY LADY `` There are no flowers in the fields , No green leaves on the tree , No columbines , no violets , No sweet anemone ."
"So I have gathered from my pots All that I have to fill The basket that I hang to-night , With heaps of love from Jill . ''"
`` That 's perfectly sweet !
"Mine is n't ; but I meant it to be funny , '' said Molly , as if there could be any doubt about the following ditty : -- `` Dear Grif , Here is a whiff Of beautiful spring flowers ; The big red rose Is for your nose , As toward the sky it towers ."
"`` Oh , do not frown Upon this crown Of green pinks and blue geranium But think of me When this you see , And put it on your cranium . ''"
"`` O Molly , you will never hear the last of that if Grif gets it , '' said Jill , as the applause subsided , for the boys pronounced it `` tip-top . ''"
"`` Do n't care , he gets the worst of it any way , for there is a pin in that rose , and if he goes to smell the mayflowers underneath he will find a thorn to pay for the tack he put in my rubber boot ."
"I know he will play me some joke to-night , and I mean to be first if I can , '' answered Molly , settling the artificial wreath round the orange-colored canoe which held her effusion ."
"By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his fame reached the king 's ears , and his majesty was filled with curiosity to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody ."
So he commanded his guards to capture the young man and bring him before him .
"And when the young man stood before the king , the king spoke to him and said , ` By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other people , you have , in the eye of the law , forfeited your life ."
"But on one condition I will spare you , and that is , if you will bring me the flying horse that belongs to the great dragon ."
"Fail in this , and you shall be hewn in a thousand pieces . '"
"` If that is all , ' said the youth , ` you shall soon have it . '"
So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying horse was tethered .
"He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the bridle , when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could ."
"Now the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable , and at the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse , ` What is the matter , my treasure ?"
is anything hurting you ? '
"After waiting a little while the young man tried again to loose the horse , but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise ."
"But when the same thing happened the third time , the dragon lost his temper , and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating ."
"This offended the horse and made him angry , and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head , he made no further fuss , but suffered himself to be led quietly away ."
"Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off , calling over his shoulder , ` Hi !"
dragon !
dragon !
"if anyone asks you what has become of your horse , you can say that I have got him ! '"
"But the king said , ` The flying horse is all very well , but I want something more ."
"You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lies on the bed of the dragon , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '"
` Is that all ? '
answered the youth .
` That is easily done . '
And when night came he went away to the dragon 's house and climbed up on to the roof .
"Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung , and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up ."
"But the little bells all began to ring , and the dragon woke and said to his wife , ` Wife , you have pulled off all the bed-clothes ! '"
"and drew the covering towards him , pulling , as he did so , the young man into the room ."
"Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot , ` To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him , and when I get back we will eat him together . '"
So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him .
"But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him , the prisoner caught her by the legs , threw her to the ground , seized her and speedily cut her throat , just as she had been about to do for him , and put her body in the oven ."
Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the king .
The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow .
"` That is not enough , ' said his majesty ; ` you must bring me the dragon himself , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '"
You had better go there and look for it ; I have no more time to waste . '
And he went his way .
"So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft , which was at the top of the storehouse , and there he found the wooden chest , so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces ."
` What use is this old thing to me ? '
he said to himself .
"` Oh , well , it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself ; so things might be worse after all . '"
"Placing the chest on his back , the man , whose name was Jose , set out for his inn , and , borrowing a hatchet , began to chop up the box ."
"In doing so he discovered a secret drawer , and in it lay a paper ."
"He opened the paper , not knowing what it might contain , and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father ."
"Putting the precious writing in his pocket , he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside , and he ran out at once in search of him ."
"The debtor proved to be an old miser , who lived at the other end of the village ."
"He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed , and , indeed , when he saw it , was very unwilling to pay what he owed ."
"However , the stranger threatened to drag him before the king , and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one ."
"The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket , and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man ."
"A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town , when he met a poor woman crying bitterly ."
"He stopped and asked her what was the matter , and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying , and , to make matters worse , a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison ."
"` Comfort yourself , ' said the stranger kindly ; ` they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods ."
"I will not only pay his debts but , if he dies , the cost of his burial also ."
"And now go home , and nurse him as well as you can . '"
"And so she did ; but , in spite of her care , the husband died , and was buried by the stranger ."
"But everything cost more than he expected , and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left ."
` What am I to do now ? '
said he to himself . '
"I think I had better go to court , and enter into the service of the king . '"
"At first he was only a servant , who carried the king the water for his bath , and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion ."
"But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him , and in a short time he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber ."
"Now , when this happened the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited , and did not know how to make any for himself ."
"He then bethought him of the king 's favourite , and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother , whom he had so ill-used , would give him his protection , and find him a place ."
"The elder , who was always ready to help everyone spoke to the king on his behalf , and the next day the young man took up is work at court ."
"Unfortunately , the new-comer was by nature spiteful and envious , and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself ."
"By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors , he learned that the king , old and ugly though he was , had fallen in love with the Princess Bella-Flor , who would have nothing to say to him , and had hidden herself in some mountain castle , no one knew where ."
"` That will do nicely , ' thought the scoundrel , rubbing his hands ."
"`` Turn her into something that does not mind the cold , '' seemed a good suggestion of the doctor 's , but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake ."
"`` And it might melt , '' the Queen pointed out , so that idea had to be given up ."
"A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot , but though there were so many of them she was too heavy ."
"By this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs , but presently the Cupids had a lovely idea ."
"`` Build a house round her , '' they cried , and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do ; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches , architects were running round Maimie , measuring her ; a bricklayer 's yard sprang up at her feet , seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation stone and the Queen laid it , overseers were appointed to keep the boys off , scaffoldings were run up , the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning lathes , and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows ."
The house was exactly the size of Maimie and perfectly lovely .
"One of her arms was extended and this had bothered them for a second , but they built a verandah round it , leading to the front door ."
"The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller , but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof ."
"The fairies , as is their custom , clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness , and they were all so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it ."
"So they gave it ever so many little extra touches , and even then they added more extra touches ."
"For instance , two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney ."
"`` Now we fear it is quite finished , '' they sighed ."
"But no , for another two ran up the ladder , and tied some smoke to the chimney ."
"`` That certainly finishes it , '' they cried reluctantly ."
"`` Not at all , '' cried a glow-worm , `` if she were to wake without seeing a night-light she might be frightened , so I shall be her night-light . ''"
"`` Wait one moment , '' said a china merchant , `` and I shall make you a saucer . ''"
"Now alas , it was absolutely finished ."
"Oh , dear no !"
"`` Gracious me , '' cried a brass manufacturer , `` there 's no handle on the door , '' and he put one on ."
An ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a door-mat .
"Carpenters arrived with a water-butt , and the painters insisted on painting it ."
Finished at last !
`` Finished !
"how can it be finished , '' the plumber demanded scornfully , `` before hot and cold are put in ? ''"
and he put in hot and cold .
"Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses , and soon they had a flower garden to the right of the verandah and a vegetable garden to the left , and roses and clematis on the walls of the house , and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom ."
"Oh , how beautiful the little house was now !"
"But it was at last finished true as true , and they had to leave it and return to the dance ."
"They all kissed their hands to it as they went away , and the last to go was Brownie ."
She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney .
"All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs taking care of Maimie , and she never knew ."
"She slept until the dream was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg , and then she almost fell asleep again , and then she called out , `` Tony , '' for she thought she was at home in the nursery ."
"cried he , as soon as he could speak ."
` Is the prince dead ? '
"faltered Muffette , growing white and cold ."
"` No , no ; but -- oh , how can I tell you ! '"
And he sank down on a pile of cushions while his wife and daughter knelt beside him .
"At length he was able to tell his tale , and a terrible one it was !"
"There had just arrived at court a huge giant , as ambassador from the dragon by whose help the king had rescued the queen and Muffette from the crystal palace ."
"The dragon had been very busy for many years past , and had quite forgotten the princess till the news of her betrothal reached his ears ."
Then he remembered the bargain he had made with her father ; and the more he heard of Muffette the more he felt sure she would make a delicious dish .
So he had ordered the giant who was his servant to fetch her at once .
No words would paint the horror of both the queen and the princess as they listened to this dreadful doom .
"They rushed instantly to the hall , where the giant was awaiting them , and flinging themselves at his feet implored him to take the kingdom if he would , but to have pity on the princess ."
"The giant looked at them kindly , for he was not at all hard-hearted , but said that he had no power to do anything , and that if the princess did not go with him quietly the dragon would come himself ."
"Several days went by , and the king and queen hardly ceased from entreating the aid of the giant , who by this time was getting weary of waiting ."
"` There is only one way of helping you , ' he said at last , ` and that is to marry the princess to my nephew , who , besides being young and handsome , has been trained in magic , and will know how to keep her safe from the dragon . '"
"` Oh , thank you , thank you ! '"
"cried the parents , clasping his great hands to their breasts ."
` You have indeed lifted a load from us .
She shall have half the kingdom for her dowry . '
But Muffette stood up and thrust them aside . '
"I will not buy my life with faithlessness , ' she said proudly ; ` and I will go with you this moment to the dragon 's abode . '"
And all her father 's and mother 's tears and prayers availed nothing to move her .
"The next morning Muffette was put into a litter , and , guarded by the giant and followed by the king and queen and the weeping maids of honour , they started for the foot of the mountain where the dragon had his castle ."
"The way , though rough and stony , seemed all too short , and when they reached the spot appointed by the dragon the giant ordered the men who bore the litter to stand still ."
"` It is time for you to bid farewell to your daughter , ' said he ; ` for I see the dragon coming to us . '"
"It was true ; a cloud appeared to pass over the sun , for between them and it they could all discern dimly a huge body half a mile long approaching nearer and nearer ."
"At first the king could not believe that this was the small beast who had seemed so friendly on the shore of the lake of quicksilver but then he knew very little of necromancy , and had never studied the art of expanding and contracting his body ."
"But it was the dragon and nothing else , whose six wings were carrying him forward as fast as might be , considering his great weight and the length of his tail , which had fifty twists and a half ."
"He came quickly , yes ; but the frog , mounted on a greyhound , and wearing her cap on her head , went quicker still ."
"Entering a room where the prince was sitting gazing at the portrait of his betrothed , she cried to him : ` What are you doing lingering here , when the life of the princess is nearing its last moment ?"
"In the courtyard you will find a green horse with three heads and twelve feet , and by its side a sword eighteen yards long ."
"Hasten , lest you should be too late ! '"
"Dan felt they did not quite trust him , and never showed them his best side , but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwarting their hopes as far as he dared ."
"Mr. Bhaer did not approve of fighting , and did not think it a proof of either manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another for the amusement of the rest ."
"All sorts of hardy games and exercises were encouraged , and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles without whining ; but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of it were forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play ."
"Dan laughed at this rule , and told such exciting tales of his own valor , and the many frays that he had been in , that some of the lads were fired with a desire to have a regular good `` mill . ''"
"`` Do n't tell , and I 'll show you how , '' said Dan ; and , getting half a dozen of the lads together behind the barn , he gave them a lesson in boxing , which quite satisfied the ardor of most of them ."
"Emil , however , could not submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself , for Emil was past fourteen and a plucky fellow , so he challenged Dan to a fight ."
"Dan accepted at once , and the others looked on with intense interest ."
"What little bird carried the news to head-quarters no one ever knew , but , in the very hottest of the fray , when Dan and Emil were fighting like a pair of young bulldogs , and the others with fierce , excited faces were cheering them on , Mr. Bhaer walked into the ring , plucked the combatants apart with a strong hand , and said , in the voice they seldom heard , `` I ca n't allow this , boys !"
Stop it at once ; and never let me see it again .
"I keep a school for boys , not for wild beasts ."
Look at each other and be ashamed of yourselves . ''
"`` You let me go , and I 'll knock him down again , '' shouted Dan , sparring away in spite of the grip on his collar ."
"`` Come on , come on , I ai n't thrashed yet ! ''"
"cried Emil , who had been down five times , but did not know when he was beaten ."
"`` They are playing be gladdy what-you-call - 'em s , like the Romans , Uncle Fritz , '' called out Demi , whose eyes were bigger than ever with the excitement of this new pastime ."
"`` They were a fine set of brutes ; but we have learned something since then , I hope , and I can not have you make my barn a Colosseum ."
Who proposed this ? ''
asked Mr. Bhaer .
"`` Dan , '' answered several voices ."
`` Do n't you know that it is forbidden ? ''
"`` Yes , '' growled Dan , sullenly ."
`` Then why break the rule ? ''
"`` They 'll all be molly-coddles , if they do n't know how to fight . ''"
`` Have you found Emil a molly-coddle ?
"He does n't look much like one , '' and Mr. Bhaer brought the two face to face ."
"Dan had a black eye , and his jacket was torn to rags , but Emil 's face was covered with blood from a cut lip and a bruised nose , while a bump on his forehead was already as purple as a plum ."
"In spite of his wounds however , he still glared upon his foe , and evidently panted to renew the fight ."
"`` He 'd make a first-rater if he was taught , '' said Dan , unable to withhold the praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best ."
"`` He 'll be taught to fence and box by and by , and till then I think he will do very well without any lessons in mauling ."
"Go and wash your faces ; and remember , Dan , if you break any more of the rules again , you will be sent away ."
That was the bargain ; do your part and we will do ours . ''
"The lads went off , and after a few more words to the spectators , Mr. Bhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators ."
"Ned fell out of a tree , and split his jacket down the back , but suffered no other fracture ."
"Emil and Jack established rival claims to a certain thick patch , and while they were squabbling about it , Stuffy quickly and quietly stripped the bushes and fled to the protection of Dan , who was enjoying himself immensely ."
"The crutch was no longer necessary , and he was delighted to see how strong his foot felt as he roamed about the great pasture , full of interesting rocks and stumps , with familiar little creatures in the grass , and well-known insects dancing in the air ."
"But of all the adventures that happened on this afternoon that which befell Nan and Rob was the most exciting , and it long remained one of the favorite histories of the household ."
"Having explored the country pretty generally , torn three rents in her frock , and scratched her face in a barberry-bush , Nan began to pick the berries that shone like big , black beads on the low , green bushes ."
"Her nimble fingers flew , but still her basket did not fill up as rapidly as she desired , so she kept wandering here and there to search for better places , instead of picking contentedly and steadily as Daisy did ."
"Rob followed Nan , for her energy suited him better than his cousin 's patience , and he too was anxious to have the biggest and best berries for Marmar ."
"`` I keep putting 'em in , but it do n't fill up , and I 'm so tired , '' said Rob , pausing a moment to rest his short legs , and beginning to think huckleberrying was not all his fancy painted it ; for the sun blazed , Nan skipped hither and thither like a grasshopper , and the berries fell out of his pail almost as fast as he put them in , because , in his struggles with the bushes , it was often upside-down ."
`` Last time we came they were ever so much thicker over that wall great bouncers ; and there is a cave there where the boys made a fire .
"Let 's go and fill our things quick , and then hide in the cave and let the others find us , '' proposed Nan , thirsting for adventures ."
"Rob consented , and away they went , scrambling over the wall and running down the sloping fields on the other side , till they were hidden among the rocks and underbrush ."
"The berries were thick , and at last the pails were actually full ."
"It was shady and cool down there , and a little spring gave the thirsty children a refreshing drink out of its mossy cup ."
"`` Now we will go and rest in the cave , and eat our lunch , '' said Nan , well satisfied with her success so far ."
`` Do you know the way ? ''
asked Rob . ''
"` Course I do ; I 've been once , and I always remember ."
Did n't I go and get my box all right ? ''
"That convinced Rob , and he followed blindly as Nan led him over stock and stone , and brought him , after much meandering , to a small recess in the rock , where the blackened stones showed that fires had been made ."
"`` Now , is n't it nice ? ''"
"asked Nan , as she took out a bit of bread-and-butter , rather damaged by being mixed up with nails , fishhooks , stones and other foreign substances , in the young lady 's pocket ."
`` Yes ; do you think they will find us soon ? ''
"asked Rob , who found the shadowy glen rather dull , and began to long for more society ."
"`` No , I do n't ; because if I hear them , I shall hide , and have fun making them find me . ''"
`` P'raps they wo n't come . ''
`` Do n't care ; I can get home myself . ''
`` Is it a great way ? ''
"asked Rob , looking at his little stubby boots , scratched and wet with his long wandering ."
"`` It 's six miles , I guess . ''"
"Nan 's ideas of distance were vague , and her faith in her own powers great ."
"`` I think we better go now , '' suggested Rob , presently ."
`` I sha n't till I have picked over my berries ; '' and Nan began what seemed to Rob an endless task .
"cried Jack , ready to follow where his beloved friend led , and the others nodded , unwilling to be outdone by the youngest member ."
`` Good !
"With all of us to lend a hand , we can do a great deal ; and I tell you , boys , it is time , if we want to keep poor Bob straight ."
"We all turn our backs on him , so he loafs round the tavern , and goes with fellows we do n't care to know ."
"But he is n't bad yet , and we can keep him up , I 'm sure , if we just try ."
"I hope to get him into the Lodge , and that will be half the battle , wo n't it , Frank ? ''"
"added Ed , sure that this suggestion would have weight with the honorable Chairman ."
`` Bring him along ; I 'm with you ! ''
"answered Frank , making up his mind at once , for he had joined the Temperance Lodge four years ago , and already six boys had followed his example ."
"`` He is learning to smoke , but we 'll make him drop it before it leads to worse ."
"You can help him there , Admiral , if you only will , '' added Ed , giving a grateful look at one friend , and turning to the other ."
"`` I 'm your man ; '' and Gus looked as if he knew what he promised , for he had given up smoking to oblige his father , and kept his word like a hero ."
"`` You other fellows can do a good deal by just being kind and not twitting him with old scrapes , and I 'll do anything I can for you all to pay for this ; '' and Ed sat down with a beaming smile , feeling that his cause was won ."
"The vote was taken , and all hands went up , for even surly Joe gave in ; so Bob and Tom were duly elected , and proved their gratitude for the honor done them by becoming worthy members of the club ."
"It was only boys ' play now , but the kind heart and pure instincts of one lad showed the others how to lend a helping hand to a comrade in danger , and win him away from temptation to the safer pastimes of their more guarded lives ."
"Well pleased with themselves -- for every genuine act or word , no matter how trifling it seems , leaves a sweet and strengthening influence behind -- the members settled down to the debate , which was never very long , and often only an excuse for fun of all sorts ."
"`` Ralph , Gus , and Ed are for , and Brickbat , Grif , and Chick against , I suppose ? ''"
"said Frank , surveying his company like a general preparing for battle ."
"`` No , sir !"
I believe in co-everything ! ''
"cried Chick , a mild youth , who loyally escorted a chosen damsel home from school every day ."
"A laugh greeted this bold declaration , and Chick sat down , red but firm ."
"`` I 'll speak for two since the Chairman ca n't , and Jack wo n't go against those who pet him most to death , '' said Joe , who , not being a favorite with the girls , considered them a nuisance and lost no opportunity of telling them so ."
"`` Fire away , then , since you are up ; '' commanded Frank ."
"`` Well , '' began Joe , feeling too late how much he had undertaken , `` I do n't know a great deal about it , and I do n't care , but I do not believe in having girls at college ."
"They do n't belong there , nobody wants 'em , and they 'd better be at home darning their stockings . ''"
"`` Yours , too , '' put in Ralph , who had heard that argument so often he was tired of it ."
`` Of course ; that 's what girls are for .
"I do n't mind 'em at school , but I 'd just as soon they had a room to themselves ."
We should get on better . '' ''
"You would if Mabel was n't in your class and always ahead of you , '' observed Ed , whose friend was a fine scholar , and he very proud of the fact ."
"`` Look here , if you fellows keep interrupting , I wo n't sit down for half an hour , '' said Joe , well knowing that eloquence was not his gift , but bound to have his say out ."
"That is all we are , lookers-on ."
Nobody really wants us .
"So let us watch and say jaggy things , in the hope that some of them will hurt ."
The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there .
"When the children flew away , Mr. Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up , and that from first to last she had been wiser than he ."
"Of course , as we have seen , he was quite a simple man ; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off ; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion 's courage to do what seemed right to him ; and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children , he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel ."
"To all Mrs. Darling 's dear invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly : `` No , my own one , this is the place for me . ''"
In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel until his children came back .
"Of course this was a pity ; but whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess , otherwise he soon gave up doing it ."
"And there never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling , as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and all their pretty ways ."
Very touching was his deference to Nana .
"He would not let her come into the kennel , but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly ."
"Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab , which conveyed him to his office , and he returned home in the same way at six ."
Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours : this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention .
"Inwardly he must have suffered torture ; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home , and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside ."
"It may have been Quixotic , but it was magnificent ."
"Soon the inward meaning of it leaked out , and the great heart of the public was touched ."
"Crowds followed the cab , cheering it lustily ; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph ; interviews appeared in the better class of papers , and society invited him to dinner and added , `` Do come in the kennel . ''"
"On that eventful Thursday week , Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting George 's return home ; a very sad-eyed woman ."
"Now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days , all gone now just because she has lost her babes , I find I wo n't be able to say nasty things about her after all ."
"If she was too fond of her rubbishy children , she could n't help it ."
"Look at her in her chair , where she has fallen asleep ."
"The corner of her mouth , where one looks first , is almost withered up ."
Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there .
"Some like Peter best , and some like Wendy best , but I like her best ."
"Suppose , to make her happy , we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back ."
"They are really within two miles of the window now , and flying strong , but all we need whisper is that they are on the way ."
Let 's .
"It is a pity we did it , for she has started up , calling their names ; and there is no one in the room but Nana ."
"`` O Nana , I dreamt my dear ones had come back . ''"
"Nana had filmy eyes , but all she could do was put her paw gently on her mistress 's lap ; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back ."
"As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife , we see that his face is more worn than of yore , but has a softer expression ."
"What was good enough for his father was good enough for him , he used to say ."
"I hope it is not unfilial to say that I think he was wrong in that point of view , but I am not sure I go so far as to approve of aeroplanes , though they may be a military necessity ."
If the Almighty had meant us to fly he would have provided us with wings .
Since He did not it is plain He meant us to stick to the solid earth .
"At any rate , you will never see me , Mrs. Dr. dear , cavorting through the sky in an aeroplane . ''"
"`` But you wo n't refuse to cavort a bit in father 's new automobile when it comes , will you , Susan ? ''"
teased Rilla .
"`` I do not expect to trust my old bones in automobiles , either , '' retorted Susan ."
`` But I do not look upon them as some narrow-minded people do .
Whiskers-on-the-moon says the Government should be turned out of office for permitting them to run on the Island at all .
"He foams at the mouth , they tell me , when he sees one ."
"The other day he saw one coming along that narrow side-road by his wheatfield , and Whiskers bounded over the fence and stood right in the middle of the road , with his pitchfork ."
"The man in the machine was an agent of some kind , and Whiskers hates agents as much as he hates automobiles ."
"He made the car come to a halt , because there was not room to pass him on either side , and the agent could not actually run over him ."
"Then he raised his pitchfork and shouted , ` Get out of this with your devil-machine or I will run this pitchfork clean through you . '"
"And Mrs. Dr. dear , if you will believe me , that poor agent had to back his car clean out to the Lowbridge road , nearly a mile , Whiskers following him every step , shaking his pitchfork and bellowing insults ."
I 'll mind that when we come to clear accounts . ''
"And I believe he not only meant what he said , but would have done it ; so high a place did the Covenant hold in his affections ."
"But this is matter only for conjecture , things having gone otherwise than he forecast ."
"`` Keep her away a point , '' sings out Mr. Riach ."
`` Reef to windward ! ''
"And just at the same time the tide caught the brig , and threw the wind out of her sails ."
"She came round into the wind like a top , and the next moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the deck , and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast ."
I was on my feet in a minute .
"The reef on which we had struck was close in under the southwest end of Mull , off a little isle they call Earraid , which lay low and black upon the larboard ."
"Sometimes the swell broke clean over us ; sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef , so that we could hear her beat herself to pieces ; and what with the great noise of the sails , and the singing of the wind , and the flying of the spray in the moonlight , and the sense of danger , I think my head must have been partly turned , for I could scarcely understand the things I saw ."
"Presently I observed Mr. Riach and the seamen busy round the skiff , and , still in the same blank , ran over to assist them ; and as soon as I set my hand to work , my mind came clear again ."
"It was no very easy task , for the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper , and the breaking of the heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on ; but we all wrought like horses while we could ."
Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the fore-scuttle and began to help ; while the rest that lay helpless in their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved .
The captain took no part .
It seemed he was struck stupid .
"He stood holding by the shrouds , talking to himself and groaning out aloud whenever the ship hammered on the rock ."
"We had a dreary morning 's work before us , for there was no sign of any wind , and the boats had to be got out and manned , and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island ."
"I volunteered for one of the boats , where I had , of course , no business ."
"The heat was sweltering , and the men grumbled fiercely over their work ."
"Anderson was in command of my boat , and instead of keeping the crew in order , he grumbled as loud as the worst ."
"`` Well , '' he said with an oath , `` it 's not forever . ''"
"I thought this was a very bad sign , for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business ; but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline ."
"All the way in , Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship ."
"He knew the passage like the palm of his hand , and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart , John never hesitated once ."
"`` There 's a strong scour with the ebb , '' he said , `` and this here passage has been dug out , in a manner of speaking , with a spade . ''"
"We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart , about a third of a mile from each shore , the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other ."
The bottom was clean sand .
"The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods , but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent ."
"The place was entirely land-locked , buried in woods , the trees coming right down to high-water mark , the shores mostly flat , and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre , one here , one there ."
"Two little rivers , or rather two swamps , emptied out into this pond , as you might call it ; and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness ."
"From the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade , for they were quite buried among trees ; and if it had not been for the chart on the companion , we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas ."
"There was not a breath of air moving , nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside ."
A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage -- a smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks .
"I observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing , like someone tasting a bad egg ."
"`` I do n't know about treasure , '' he said , `` but I 'll stake my wig there 's fever here . ''"
"If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat , it became truly threatening when they had come aboard ."
They lay about the deck growling together in talk .
The slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed .
"Even the honest hands must have caught the infection , for there was not one man aboard to mend another ."
"Mutiny , it was plain , hung over us like a thunder-cloud ."
And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger .
"Long John was hard at work going from group to group , spending himself in good advice , and as for example no man could have shown a better ."
He fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility ; he was all smiles to everyone .
"If an order were given , John would be on his crutch in an instant , with the cheeriest `` Aye , aye , sir ! ''"
"in the world ; and when there was nothing else to do , he kept up one song after another , as if to conceal the discontent of the rest ."
"Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon , this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst ."
We held a council in the cabin .
"`` Sir , '' said the captain , `` if I risk another order , the whole ship 'll come about our ears by the run ."
"With a cry John seized the branch of a tree , whipped the crutch out of his armpit , and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air ."
"It struck poor Tom , point foremost , and with stunning violence , right between the shoulders in the middle of his back ."
"His hands flew up , he gave a sort of gasp , and fell ."
"Whether he were injured much or little , none could ever tell ."
"Like enough , to judge from the sound , his back was broken on the spot ."
But he had no time given him to recover .
"Silver , agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch , was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body ."
"From my place of ambush , I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows ."
"I do not know what it rightly is to faint , but I do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist ; Silver and the birds , and the tall Spy-glass hilltop , going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes , and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear ."
"When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together , his crutch under his arm , his hat upon his head ."
"Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward ; but the murderer minded him not a whit , cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass ."
"Everything else was unchanged , the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain , and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes ."
"But now John put his hand into his pocket , brought out a whistle , and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air ."
"I could not tell , of course , the meaning of the signal , but it instantly awoke my fears ."
More men would be coming .
I might be discovered .
"They had already slain two of the honest people ; after Tom and Alan , might not I come next ?"
"Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again , with what speed and silence I could manage , to the more open portion of the wood ."
"As I did so , I could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades , and this sound of danger lent me wings ."
"As soon as I was clear of the thicket , I ran as I never ran before , scarce minding the direction of my flight , so long as it led me from the murderers ; and as I ran , fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy ."
"Indeed , could anyone be more entirely lost than I ?"
"When the gun fired , how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends , still smoking from their crime ?"
Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe 's ?
"Would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm , and therefore of my fatal knowledge ?"
"It was all over , I thought ."
"Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA ; good-bye to the squire , the doctor , and the captain !"
There was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers .
"All this while , as I say , I was still running , and without taking any notice , I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions ."
"Mingled with these were a few scattered pines , some fifty , some nearer seventy , feet high ."
The air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh .
And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart .
"15 The Man of the Island FROM the side of the hill , which was here steep and stony , a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees ."
"`` You 're pretty stubborn , I reckon , '' was Mr. Harrison 's way of putting it ."
"`` Well , well , we 'll see ."
Someday when you get riled up ... and people with hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled ... you 'll forget all your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling .
You 're too young to be teaching anyhow ... far too young and childish . ''
"Altogether , Anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood ."
She slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning that Marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of scorching ginger tea .
"Anne sipped it patiently , although she could not imagine what good ginger tea would do ."
"Had it been some magic brew , potent to confer age and experience , Anne would have swallowed a quart of it without flinching ."
"`` Marilla , what if I fail ! ''"
"`` You 'll hardly fail completely in one day and there 's plenty more days coming , '' said Marilla ."
"`` The trouble with you , Anne , is that you 'll expect to teach those children everything and reform all their faults right off , and if you ca n't you 'll think you 've failed . ''"
V A Full-fledged Schoolma'am When Anne reached the school that morning ... for the first time in her life she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its beauties ... all was quiet and still .
"The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival , and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of `` shining morning faces '' and bright , inquisitive eyes ."
"She hung up her hat and faced her pupils , hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling ."
She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school .
"She had revised and improved it painstakingly , and then she had learned it off by heart ."
"It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it , especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge ."
The only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it .
"After what seemed to her a year ... about ten seconds in reality ... she said faintly , `` Take your Testaments , please , '' and sank breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that followed ."
While the children read their verses Anne marshalled her shaky wits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the Grownup Land .
"Most of them were , of course , quite well known to her ."
"Her own classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all gone to school with her , excepting the primer class and ten newcomers to Avonlea ."
Anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those whose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her .
"To be sure , they might be just as commonplace as the rest ; but on the other hand there MIGHT be a genius among them ."
It was a thrilling idea .
Sitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye .
"He had a dark , sullen little face , and was staring at Anne with a hostile expression in his black eyes ."
Anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that boy 's affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly .
"In the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty Sloane ... a jolly looking little chap , with a snub nose , freckled face , and big , light blue eyes , fringed with whitish lashes ... probably the DonNELL boy ; and if resemblance went for anything , his sister was sitting across the aisle with Mary Bell ."
"Anne wondered what sort of mother the child had , to send her to school dressed as she was ."
"She wore a faded pink silk dress , trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace , soiled white kid slippers , and silk stockings ."
"Her sandy hair was tortured into innumerable kinky and unnatural curls , surmounted by a flamboyant bow of pink ribbon bigger than her head ."
"He came nigh-hand fainting , doctor , when he heard the cry ."
Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us . ''
"I told my plan to the captain , and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment ."
"We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle , with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection ."
"Hunter brought the boat round under the stern-port , and Joyce and I set to work loading her with powder tins , muskets , bags of biscuits , kegs of pork , a cask of cognac , and my invaluable medicine chest ."
"In the meantime , the squire and the captain stayed on deck , and the latter hailed the coxswain , who was the principal man aboard ."
"`` Mr. Hands , '' he said , `` here are two of us with a brace of pistols each ."
"If any one of you six make a signal of any description , that man 's dead . ''"
"They were a good deal taken aback , and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion , thinking no doubt to take us on the rear ."
"But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley , they went about ship at once , and a head popped out again on deck ."
"`` Down , dog ! ''"
cries the captain .
"And the head popped back again ; and we heard no more , for the time , of these six very faint-hearted seamen ."
"By this time , tumbling things in as they came , we had the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared ."
"Joyce and I got out through the stern-port , and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us ."
This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore .
"`` Lillibullero '' was dropped again ; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point , one of them whipped ashore and disappeared ."
"I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats , but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand , and all might very well be lost by trying for too much ."
We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house .
"All three made the first journey , heavily laden , and tossed our stores over the palisade ."
"Then , leaving Joyce to guard them -- one man , to be sure , but with half a dozen muskets -- Hunter and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more ."
"So we proceeded without pausing to take breath , till the whole cargo was bestowed , when the two servants took up their position in the block house , and I , with all my power , sculled back to the HISPANIOLA ."
That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was .
"They had the advantage of numbers , of course , but we had the advantage of arms ."
"Not one of the men ashore had a musket , and before they could get within range for pistol shooting , we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least ."
"The squire was waiting for me at the stern window , all his faintness gone from him ."
"He caught the painter and made it fast , and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives ."
"Pork , powder , and biscuit was the cargo , with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain ."
"The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water , so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun , on the clean , sandy bottom ."
"By this time the tide was beginning to ebb , and the ship was swinging round to her anchor ."
"Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs ; and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter , who were well to the eastward , it warned our party to be off ."
"Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat , which we then brought round to the ship 's counter , to be handier for Captain Smollett ."
They paused in shelter of the garden wall to consult on their best course .
The danger was extreme .
"If one of Sir Daniel 's men caught sight of them and raised the view-hallo , they would be run down and butchered instantly ."
"And not only was the town of Shoreby a mere net of peril for their lives , but to make for the open country was to run the risk of the patrols ."
"A little way off , upon some open ground , they spied a windmill standing ; and hard by that , a very large granary with open doors ."
`` How if we lay there until the night fall ? ''
Dick proposed .
"And Lawless having no better suggestion to offer , they made a straight push for the granary at a run , and concealed themselves behind the door among some straw ."
The daylight rapidly departed ; and presently the moon was silvering the frozen snow .
Now or never was their opportunity to gain the Goat and Bagpipes unobserved and change their tell-tale garments .
"Yet even then it was advisable to go round by the outskirts , and not run the gauntlet of the market-place , where , in the concourse of people , they stood the more imminent peril to be recognised and slain ."
This course was a long one .
"It took them not far from the house by the beach , now lying dark and silent , and brought them forth at last by the margin of the harbour ."
"Many of the ships , as they could see by the clear moonshine , had weighed anchor , and , profiting by the calm sky , proceeded for more distant parts ; answerably to this , the rude alehouses along the beach -LRB- although in defiance of the curfew law , they still shone with fire and candle -RRB- were no longer thronged with customers , and no longer echoed to the chorus of sea-songs ."
"Hastily , half-running , with their monkish raiment kilted to the knee , they plunged through the deep snow and threaded the labyrinth of marine lumber ; and they were already more than half way round the harbour when , as they were passing close before an alehouse , the door suddenly opened and let out a gush of light upon their fleeting figures ."
"Instantly they stopped , and made believe to be engaged in earnest conversation ."
"Three men , one after another , came out of the ale-house , and the last closed the door behind him ."
"All three were unsteady upon their feet , as if they had passed the day in deep potations , and they now stood wavering in the moonlight , like men who knew not what they would be after ."
"The tallest of the three was talking in a loud , lamentable voice ."
"`` Seven pieces of as good Gascony as ever a tapster broached , '' he was saying , `` the best ship out o ' the port o ' Dartmouth , a Virgin Mary parcel-gilt , thirteen pounds of good gold money -- '' `` I have bad losses , too , '' interrupted one of the others ."
"`` I have had losses of mine own , gossip Arblaster ."
I was robbed at Martinmas of five shillings and a leather wallet well worth ninepence farthing . ''
Dick 's heart smote him at what he heard .
"Until that moment he had not perhaps thought twice of the poor skipper who had been ruined by the loss of the Good Hope ; so careless , in those days , were men who wore arms of the goods and interests of their inferiors ."
"But this sudden encounter reminded him sharply of the high-handed manner and ill-ending of his enterprise ; and both he and Lawless turned their heads the other way , to avoid the chance of recognition ."
"The ship 's dog had , however , made his escape from the wreck and found his way back again to Shoreby ."
"He was now at Arblaster 's heels , and suddenly sniffing and pricking his ears , he darted forward and began to bark furiously at the two sham friars ."
His master unsteadily followed him .
"`` Hey , shipmates ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Have ye ever a penny pie for a poor old shipman , clean destroyed by pirates ?"
"I am a man that would have paid for you both o ' Thursday morning ; and now here I be , o ' Saturday night , begging for a flagon of ale !"
Down there by the lake was a primitive wilderness where man was as naught and man-made doctrines had no place .
There one might walk hand in hand with nature and so come very close to God .
"Many of Alan 's best sermons were written after he had come home , rapt-eyed , from some long shore tramp where the wilderness had opened its heart to him and the pines had called to him in their soft , sibilant speech ."
"With a half guilty glance at the futile sermon , he took his hat and went out ."
"The sun of the cool spring evening was swinging low over the lake as he turned into the unfrequented , deep-rutted road leading to the shore ."
"It was two miles to the lake , but half way there Alan came to where another road branched off and struck down through the pines in a northeasterly direction ."
He had sometimes wondered where it led but he had never explored it .
Now he had a sudden whim to do so and turned into it .
"It was even rougher and lonelier than the other ; between the ruts the grasses grew long and thickly ; sometimes the pine boughs met overhead ; again , the trees broke away to reveal wonderful glimpses of gleaming water , purple islets , dark feathery coasts ."
"Still , the road seemed to lead nowhere and Alan was half repenting the impulse which had led him to choose it when he suddenly came out from the shadow of the pines and found himself gazing on a sight which amazed him ."
Before him was a small peninsula running out into the lake and terminating in a long sandy point .
Beyond it was a glorious sweep of sunset water .
"The peninsula itself seemed barren and sandy , covered for the most part with scrub firs and spruces , through which the narrow road wound on to what was the astonishing ; feature in the landscape -- a grey and weather-beaten house built almost at the extremity of the point and shadowed from the western light by a thick plantation of tall pines behind it ."
It was the house which puzzled Alan .
"He had never known there was any house near the lake shore -- had never heard mention made of any ; yet here was one , and one which was evidently occupied , for a slender spiral of smoke was curling upward from it on the chilly spring air ."
"It could not be a fisherman 's dwelling , for it was large and built after a quaint tasteful design ."
The longer Alan looked at it the more his wonder grew .
The people living here were in the bounds of his congregation .
How then was it that he had never seen or heard of them ?
He sauntered slowly down the road until he saw that it led directly to the house and ended in the yard .
Then he turned off in a narrow path to the shore .
He was not far from the house now and he scanned it observantly as he went past .
"The barrens swept almost up to its door in front but at the side , sheltered from the lake winds by the pines , was a garden where there was a fine show of gay tulips and golden daffodils ."
"No living creature was visible and , in spite of the blossoming geraniums and muslin curtains at the windows and the homely spiral of smoke , the place had a lonely , almost untenanted , look ."
When Alan reached the shore he found that it was of a much more open and less rocky nature than the part which he had been used to frequent .
The beach was of sand and the scrub barrens dwindled down to it almost insensibly .
"To right and left fir-fringed points ran out into the lake , shaping a little cove with the house in its curve ."
"Alan walked slowly towards the left headland , intending to follow the shore around to the other road ."
As he passed the point he stopped short in astonishment .
The second surprise and mystery of the evening confronted him .
A little distance away a girl was standing -- a girl who turned a startled face at his unexpected appearance .
"Alan Douglas had thought he knew all the girls in Rexton , but this lithe , glorious creature was a stranger to him ."
"But presently the little troop began again to move forward , and came next to a very open , heathy portion of the way , where but a single tongue of forest ran down to join the road ."
"They were but just abreast of this , when an arrow shone flying ."
"One of the men threw up his arms , his horse reared , and both fell and struggled together in a mass ."
"Even from where the boys lay they could hear the rumour of the men 's voices crying out ; they could see the startled horses prancing , and , presently , as the troop began to recover from their first surprise , one fellow beginning to dismount ."
A second arrow from somewhat farther off glanced in a wide arch ; a second rider bit the dust .
"The man who was dismounting lost hold upon the rein , and his horse fled galloping , and dragged him by the foot along the road , bumping from stone to stone , and battered by the fleeing hoofs ."
"The four who still kept the saddle instantly broke and scattered ; one wheeled and rode , shrieking , towards the ferry ; the other three , with loose rein and flying raiment , came galloping up the road from Tunstall ."
From every clump they passed an arrow sped .
"Soon a horse fell , but the rider found his feet and continued to pursue his comrades till a second shot despatched him ."
"Another man fell ; then another horse ; out of the whole troop there was but one fellow left , and he on foot ; only , in different directions , the noise of the galloping of three riderless horses was dying fast into the distance ."
All this time not one of the assailants had for a moment shown himself .
"Here and there along the path , horse or man rolled , undespatched , in his agony ; but no merciful enemy broke cover to put them from their pain ."
The solitary survivor stood bewildered in the road beside his fallen charger .
"He had come the length of that broad glade , with the island of timber , pointed out by Dick ."
"He was not , perhaps , five hundred yards from where the boys lay hidden ; and they could see him plainly , looking to and fro in deadly expectation ."
"But nothing came ; and the man began to pluck up his courage , and suddenly unslung and bent his bow ."
"At the same time , by something in his action , Dick recognised Selden ."
"At this offer of resistance , from all about him in the covert of the woods there went up the sound of laughter ."
"A score of men , at least , for this was the very thickest of the ambush , joined in this cruel and untimely mirth ."
Then an arrow glanced over Selden 's shoulder ; and he leaped and ran a little back .
Another dart struck quivering at his heel .
He made for the cover .
"A third shaft leaped out right in his face , and fell short in front of him ."
"And then the laughter was repeated loudly , rising and reechoing from different thickets ."
"It was plain that his assailants were but baiting him , as men , in those days , baited the poor bull , or as the cat still trifles with the mouse ."
"The skirmish was well over ; farther down the road , a fellow in green was already calmly gathering the arrows ; and now , in the evil pleasure of their hearts , they gave themselves the spectacle of their poor fellow-sinner in his torture ."
"Selden began to understand ; he uttered a roar of anger , shouldered his cross-bow , and sent a quarrel at a venture into the wood ."
"Chance favoured him , for a slight cry responded ."
"Then , throwing down his weapon , Selden began to run before him up the glade , and almost in a straight line for Dick and Matcham ."
The companions of the Black Arrow now began to shoot in earnest .
"But they were properly served ; their chance had past ; most of them had now to shoot against the sun ; and Selden , as he ran , bounded from side to side to baffle and deceive their aim ."
"Best of all , by turning up the glade he had defeated their preparations ; there were no marksmen posted higher up than the one whom he had just killed or wounded ; and the confusion of the foresters ' counsels soon became apparent ."
"He had a good mind to try it. There was nobody to watch him, and he crept up the trunk of a fallen tree which leaned over against its neighbors. It was a foolish thing to do, and he knew it, but young Rabbits are too full of mischief to always be wise."
"""I will hold my hind legs very still,"" he thought, ""and flap my forelegs for wings."" With that he jumped off and came crashing down upon the dry leaves. He felt weak and dizzy, and as he picked himself up and looked around he hoped that nobody had seen him. ""It may be a great deal of fun to fly,"" he said, ""but it is no fun alighting from your flight unless you have real feather wings. It is too bumpy when you fly with your legs."""
"At this minute he heard an old Gobbler call out, and saw the flock of Turkeys coming toward him. ""Wake up! Wake up!"" he cried to the Ground Hog. But the Ground Hog never moved."
"Still the Turkeys came nearer. The Rabbit could see that the fat old ones were getting ahead of the others, and that here and there a young or weak Turkey had to drop into the river and swim, because his wings were tired. They got so near that he could see the queer little tufts of wiry feathers which the Gobblers wear hanging from their breast, and could see the swaying scarlet wattles under their beaks. He called again to the Ground Hog, and getting no answer, poked him three times with his head."
"The Ground Hog turned over, stretched, yawned, moved his jaws a few times as though he dreamed of eating fresh spring grass, and then fell asleep once more. After that the Rabbit left him alone."
"The first to alight were the Gobblers, and they began at once to strut and chatter. Next came the mother Turkeys and their young, and last of all came the weak ones who swam across. It was a fine sight to see them come in. The swimmers spread their tails, folded their wings tightly, stretched their necks, and struck out swiftly and strongly with their feet."
"The young Rabbit could hear a group of mothers talking together. ""The Gobblers are growing quite fond of the children,"" said one."
"""Yes,"" said another; ""my husband told me yesterday that he was very proud of our little ones."""
"""Well, it is the season for them to begin to walk together,"" said the first speaker; ""but I never in my life had such a time as I had this spring. I thought my husband would break every egg I laid."""
"""I had a hard time too,"" said the other. ""None of my eggs were broken, but after my chicks were hatched I had to hurry them out of their father's sight a dozen times a day."""
"""It is very trying,"" said a third mother Turkey with a sigh; ""but that is always the way with the Gobblers. I suppose the dear fellows can't help it;"" and she looked lovingly over at her husband as he strutted around with his friends. You would not have believed if you had seen her fond looks, and heard her husband's tender ""Gobble,"" that they had hardly spoken to each other all summer. To be sure, it was not now as it had been in the springtime. Then he would have beaten any other Gobbler who came near her, he loved her so; still, the Rabbit could see as he watched them that when he found some very large and fine acorns, this Gobbler would not eat them all, but called his wife to come and share with him; and he knew that they were happy together in their own Turkey way of being happy."
At this minute the Ground Hog opened his eyes and staggered to his feet.
"The loud talking had awakened him. He did not look very dignified just now. His fur was rumpled, and he blinked often from sleepiness. There was a dry leaf caught on one of his ears, too, that made him look very odd. The Rabbit wanted to laugh, but he did not dare to do so. The Ground Hog walked toward the Gobblers, and raised himself on his haunches."
"""Good-evening, good-evening,"" said he (it was really morning, you know). ""We are very glad to welcome you to the forest. Make yourselves perfectly at home. The grass is not so tender as it was a while ago, yet I think that you will find good feeding,"" and he waved his paws politely."
"""Thank-you, thank-you!"" answered the Gobblers, while the mothers and young Turkeys came crowding up to look at the Ground Hog. ""We came for the acorns and nuts. We shall certainly enjoy ourselves."""
"""That is right,"" said the Ground Hog heartily. ""We have a very fine forest here. You will pardon me for remarking it. The Pond People have a saying that is very true: 'It's a mighty poor Frog that won't croak for his own puddle.' And my grandfather used to say that if a Ground Hog didn't love his own home he was a very poor Hog indeed. Good-night, my friends, good-night."" And he trotted happily away, followed by the Rabbit."
"When he was gone, the Turkeys said: ""How very kind of him!"" and ""What fine manners!"" And the young Rabbit thought to himself: ""It is queer. He was sleepy and his fur was rumpled, and that leaf bobbed around his ear when he talked. He said 'evening' instead of 'morning,' and spoke as though Turkeys came here to eat grass. And yet they all liked him, and were pleased by what he said."""
You see the young Rabbit had not yet learned that the power of fine manners is more than that of looks; and that people could not think of the Ground Hog's mistakes in speaking because they knew his kindness of heart.
THE TRAVELLERS GO SOUTH
"One night a maple tree, the very one under which Mr. Red Squirrel sat when he first came to the forest, dreamed of her winter resting-time, and when she awakened early in the morning she found that her leaves were turning yellow. They were not all brightly colored, but on each was an edging, or a tip, or a splash of gold. You may be sure that the Forest People noticed it at once."
"""I told you so,"" chirruped a Robin to her mate. ""The Orioles went long ago, and the Bobolinks start to-day. We must think about our trip to the South."" When she said this, she hopped restlessly from twig to twig with an air of being exceedingly busy."
"Her husband did not answer, but began to arrange his new coat of feathers. Perhaps he was used to her fussy ways and thought it just as well to keep still. He knew that none of the Robins would start South until the weather became much colder, and he did not think it necessary to talk about it yet. Perhaps, too, Mr. Robin was a trifle contrary and was all the more slow and quiet because his wife was uneasy. In that case one could hardly blame her for talking over the family plans with the neighbors."
"Later in the day, a Bobolink came up from the marsh to say good-by. He had on his travelling suit of striped brown, and you would never have known him for the same gay fellow who during the spring and early summer wore black and buff and sang so heartily and sweetly. Now he did not sing at all, and slipped silently from bush to bush, only speaking when he had to. He was a good fellow and everyone disliked to have him go."
"Mrs. Cowbird came up while they were talking. Now that she did not care to lay any more eggs, the other birds were quite friendly with her. They began to talk over the summer that was past, and said how finely the young birds were coming on. ""By the way,"" said she, in the most careless manner possible, ""I ought to have a few children round here somewhere."
"Can anybody tell me where they are?"""
"Mrs. Goldfinch looked at her husband and he looked at the sky. The Warblers and the Vireos, who had known about the strange egg in the Goldfinches' nest, had already left for the winter, and there seemed to be no use in telling their secret now or quarrelling over what was past."
"Some of the other birds might have told Mrs. Cowbird a few things, but they also kept still."
"""It is a shame,"" she said. ""I never laid a finer lot of eggs in my life, and I was very careful where I put them. I wish I knew how many there were, but I forgot to count. I have been watching and watching for my little birds to join our flock; I was sure I should know them if I saw them. Mothers have such fine feelings, you know, in regard to their children."" (As though she had any right to say that!)"
"The Mourning Doves were there with their young son and daughter, and you could see by looking at them that they were an affectionate family. ""We shall be the last to go South,"" they cooed. ""We always mean to come North in the very early spring and stay as late as possible. This year we came much later than usual, but it could not be helped."" They had spoken so before, and rather sadly. It was said that they could tell a sorrowful story if they would; but they did not wish to sadden others by it, and bore their troubles together bravely and lovingly."
"""How do the new feathers work?"" asked a Crow, flying up at this minute and looking blacker than ever in his fall coat. Then all the birds began to talk about dress. As soon as their broods were raised, you know, their feathers had begun to drop out, and they had kept on moulting until all of the old ones were gone and the new ones on. When birds are moulting they never feel well, and when it is over they are both happy and proud."
"""I changed later than usual this year,"" said the Crow, ""and I feel that I have the very latest fashions."" This was a joke which he must have picked up among the Barnyard People, and nobody knows where they got it. Fashions never change in the Forest."
"But Nurse said: ""Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen the last of that Dragon yet."""
"Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off the Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all."
"Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said: ""We might as well be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and everything!"""
"And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time afterward."
"Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book."
"""After all,"" they said, ""soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is wise to discourage it."""
"Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place where they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard and tough."
"All the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient time, for most of the Members would be free to attend, to consider the Dragon. But unfortunately the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up because it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament, and afterwards there were not any Members left, so they tried to make a new Parliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as unpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so they had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around everyone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that day and only ate an Orphanage."
"Lionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his disobedience that had brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the Soccer Players, and he felt that it was his duty to try and do something. The question was, what?"
"The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in the Palace rose garden, and the Butterfly was very tame, and would perch on his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that all the creatures in The Book of Beasts could not be wicked, like the Dragon, and he thought: ""Suppose I could get another beast out who would fight the Dragon?"""
"So he took The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden and opened the page next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see what the name was. He could only see ""cora,"" but he felt the middle of the page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come out, and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it suddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it shut. Then he fastened the clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the Chancellor, who had been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten with the rest of the Parliament, and he said: ""What animal ends in 'cora'?"""
"The Chancellor answered: ""The Manticora, of course."""
"""What is he like?"" asked the King."
"""He is the sworn foe of Dragons,"" said the Chancellor. ""He drinks their blood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of years ago worse luck!"""
"Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had ""cora"" on it, and there was the picture Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture was written, ""Manticora."""
"In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a push and said, ""Go along and fight the Dragon, do,"" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it ate the cans as well."
"And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth, which was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset, the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged off when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took refuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying to conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard all over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad silence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting fire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments of the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However popular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do something on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty."
"The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except during the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he would have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very hot to begin with."
"At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal nursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King cried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to stop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: ""Nurse, wipe my face, please. I am not going to cry any more."""
"Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King."
"""Crying,"" said she, ""never did anyone any good yet."""
"""I don't know,"" said the little King, ""I seem to see better, and to hear better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I must try to see if I can't save the people."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said Nurse, ""but don't tear your clothes or get your feet wet."""
So off he went.
"The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more brightly, as Lionel once more carried The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden, and opened it very quickly, so that he might not be afraid and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and there was written at the bottom of the page, ""Hippogriff,"" and before Lionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of great wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly neighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great wings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and he stood there among the roses."
"The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the little King's shoulder, and the little King thought: ""But for the wings you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse."" And the Blue Bird's song was very loud and sweet."
"Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling, sprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he must do. He caught up The Book of Beasts and jumped on the back of the gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the sharp, white ear: ""Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the Pebbly Waste."""
"And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise."
"When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff and the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began to think what they would wear for Court mourning."
"But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger than the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the white-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon pursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste."
"Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there is no sand all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass there and no tree within a hundred miles of it."
"Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped The Book of Beasts and laid it open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste to get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for a tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining like a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a hundred miles."
"And to her husband she said, ""My dear, why do you go on worrying about it? Our daughter is not a boy, it is true but she may marry a clever man who could rule your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as ever you cared to teach him."""
Then the King found his tongue.
"""If she does marry,"" he said, slowly, ""her husband will have to be a very clever man oh, yes, very clever indeed! And he will have to know a very great deal more magic than I shall ever care to teach him."""
The Queen knew at once by the King's tone that he was going to be disagreeable.
"""Ah,"" she said, ""don't punish the child because she loves her mother."""
"""I'm not going to punish her for that,"" said he. ""I'm only going to teach her to respect her father."""
"And without another word he went off to his laboratory and worked all night, boiling different-colored things in crucibles, and copying charms in curious twisted letters from old brown books with mold stains on their yellowy pages."
"The next day his plan was all arranged. He took the poor Princess to the Lone Tower, which stands on an island in the sea, a thousand miles from everywhere. He gave her a dowry, and settled a handsome income on her."
"He engaged a competent dragon to look after her, and also a respectable griffin whose birth and upbringing he knew all about. And he said: ""Here you shall stay, my dear, respectful daughter, till the clever man comes to marry you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through the Nine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to kill the dragon and the griffin. Till he comes you'll never get any older or any wiser. No doubt he will soon come. You can employ yourself in embroidering your wedding gown. I wish you joy, my dutiful child."""
"And his carriage, drawn by live thunderbolts (thunder travels very fast), rose in the air and disappeared, and the poor Princess was left, with the dragon and the griffin, on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools."
"The Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and then she remembered the witch and called to her. And the witch came, and the Queen told her all."
"""For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave me,"" said the witch, ""I will help you. But it is the last thing I can do, and it is not much. Your daughter is under a spell, and I can take you to her."
"But, if I do, you will have to be turned to stone, and to stay so till the spell is taken off the child."""
"""I would be a stone for a thousand years,"" said the poor Queen, ""if at the end of them I could see my dear again."""
"So the witch took the Queen in a carriage drawn by live sunbeams (which travel more quickly than anything else in the world, and much quicker than thunder), and so away and away to the Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools. And there was the Princess sitting on the floor in the best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if her heart would break, and the dragon and the griffin were sitting primly on each side of her."
"""Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother,"" she cried, and hung around the Queen's neck as if she would never let go."
"""Now,"" said the witch, when they had all cried as much as was good for them, ""I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not make the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer comes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the tower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if ever we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a happy old woman."""
"Then the three kissed one another again and again, and the witch said the spell, and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. One of them had a stone crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand; but the other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin and the dragon could not read, though they had both had a very good education."
"And now all days seemed like one day to the Princess, and the next day always seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and kiss her again. And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and some one else took his kingdom, and many things were changed in the world; but the island did not change, nor the Nine Whirlpools, nor the griffin, nor the dragon, nor the two stone ladies. And all the time, from the very first, the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming, creeping nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming except the Princess, and she only in dreams. And the years went by in tens and in hundreds, and still the Nine Whirlpools spun around, roaring in triumph the story of many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl, bearing with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess and her dowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories of the Princes who had come from very far, and had seen the whirlpools, and had shaken their wise young heads and said: ""'Bout ship!"" and gone discreetly home to their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms."
But no one told the story of the deliverer who was to come. And the years went by.
"Now, after more scores of years than you would like to add up on your slate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the high seas with his uncle, who was a skilled skipper. And the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and keep the ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a boy as you would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy to be a Prince."
"Now there is Something which is wiser than all the world and it knows when people are worthy to be Princes. And this Something came from the farther side of the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear."
"And the boy heard, though he did not know he heard, and he looked out over the black sea with the white foam-horses galloping over it, and far away he saw a light. And he said to the skipper, his uncle: ""What light is that?"""
"Then the skipper said: ""All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing near that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked in the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me, and his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my father's father was young he heard from the very old man, his great-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess, fairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance, so never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real."""
"So, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing else. And as he sailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time the light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine Whirlpools. And one night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper asleep in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered alone over the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go very near till daylight should show him what, indeed, were the whirlpools he had to dread."
"But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the pink and primrose of the East, and about its base the sullen swirl of black water, and he heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and on, all that day and for six days besides. And when he had watched seven days he knew something. For you are certain to know something if you give for seven days your whole thought to it, even though it be only the first declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the Norman Kings."
"What he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the 1,440 minutes that make up a day the whirlpools slipped into silence, while the tide went down and left the yellow sand bare. And every day this happened, but every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day before. He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he had thoughtfully brought with him."
See page 88.]
"So on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel got ready. And when the whirlpools suddenly stopped whirling and the tide sank, like water in a basin that has a hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put his back into his stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow sand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to wait."
"By five minutes and one second past noon, the whirlpools were black and busy again, and Nigel peeped out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge overhanging the sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with golden hair and a green gown and he went out to meet her."
"""I've come to save you,"" he said. ""How darling and beautiful you are!"""
"""Perhaps,"" was the answer. ""But until you do feel it you can never understand it, for it is not like any other feeling that there is."""
"Then they all started for a low clump of bushes to find shelter from the storm. Once they were frightened by seeing a great creature come tramping through the woods towards them. ""A man!"" said Mr. Grouse."
"""Hide!"" said Mrs. Grouse, and each little Grouse hid under the leaves so quickly that nobody could see how it was done. One might almost think that a strong wind had blown them away. The mother pretended that she had a broken wing, and hopped away, making such pitiful sounds that the man followed to pick her up. When she had led him far from her children, she, too, made a quick run and hid herself; and although the man hunted everywhere, he could not find a single bird."
"You know that is always the way in Grouse families, and even if the man's foot had stirred the leaves under which a little one was hiding, the Grouse would not have moved or made a sound. The children are brought up to mind without asking any questions. When their mother says, ""Hide!"" they do it, and never once ask ""Why?"" or answer, ""As soon as I have swallowed this berry."" It is no wonder that the older ones are proud of their children. Any mother would be made happy by having one child obey like that, and think of having twelve!"
"At last, the whole family reached the bushes where they were to stay, and then they began to feed near by. ""Eat all you can,"" said Mr. Grouse, ""before the snow gets deep. You may not have another such good chance for many days."" So they ate until their little stomachs would not hold one more seed or evergreen bud."
"All this time the snowflakes were falling, but the Grouse children were no longer afraid of them. Sometimes they even chased and snapped at them as they would at a fly in summer-time. It was then, too, that they learned to use snow-shoes. The oldest child had made a great fuss when he found a fringe of hard points growing around his toes in the fall, and had run peeping to his mother to ask her what was the matter. She had shown him her own feet, and had told him how all the Ruffed Grouse have snow-shoes of that kind grow on their feet every winter."
"""We do not have to bother about them at all,"" she said. ""They put themselves on when the weather gets cold in the fall, and they take themselves off when spring comes. We each have a new pair every year, and when they are grown we can walk easily over the soft snow. Without them we should sink through and flounder."""
"When night came they all huddled under the bushes, lying close together to keep each other warm. The next day they burrowed into a snow-drift and made a snug place there which was even better than the one they left; the soft white coverlet kept the wind out so well. It was hard for the little ones to keep quiet long, and to amuse them Mr. Grouse told how he first met their mother in the spring."
"""It was a fine, sunshiny day,"" he said, ""and everybody was happy. I had for some time been learning to drum, and now I felt that I was as good a drummer as there was in the forest. So I found a log (every Ruffed Grouse has to have his own place, you know) and I jumped up on it and strutted back and forth with my head high in the air. It was a dusky part of the forest and I could not see far, yet I knew that a beautiful young Grouse was somewhere near, and I hoped that if I drummed very well she might come to me."""
"""I know!"" interrupted one of the little Grouse. ""It was our mother."""
"""Well, it wasn't your mother then, my chick,"" said Mr. Grouse, ""for that was long, long before you were hatched."""
"""She was our mother afterwards, anyway,"" cried the young Grouse. ""I just know she was!"""
"Mr. Grouse's eyes twinkled, but he went gravely on. ""At last I flapped my wing's hard and fast, and the soft drumming sound could be heard far and near. 'Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump; thump-thump-rup-rup-rup-rup-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r.' I waited, but nobody came. Then I drummed again, and after that I was sure that I heard a rustling in the leaves. I drummed a third time, and then, children, there came the beautiful young Grouse, breaking her way through the thicket and trying to look as though she didn't know that I was there."""
"""Did she know?"" cried the little Grouse."
"""You must ask your mother that,"" he answered, ""for it was she who came."
"Ah, what happy days we had together all spring! We wandered all through this great Forest and even made some journeys into the edge of the Meadow. Still, there was no place we loved as we did the dusky hollow by the old log where we first met. One day your mother told me that she must begin housekeeping and that I must keep out of the way while she was busy. So I had to go off with a crowd of other Ruffed Grouse while she fixed her nest, laid her eggs, and hatched out you youngsters. It was rather hard to be driven off in that way, but you know it is the custom among Grouse. We poor fellows had to amuse ourselves and each other until our wives called us home to help take care of the children."
"We've been at that work ever since."""
"""Oh!"" said one of the young Grouse. ""Oh, I am so glad that you drummed, and that she came when she heard you. Who would we have had to take care of us if it hadn't happened just so?"""
"That made them all feel very solemn and Mr. Grouse couldn't answer, and Mrs. Grouse couldn't answer, and none of the little Grouse could answer because, you see, it is one of the questions that hasn't any answer."
"Still, they were all there and happy, so they didn't bother their crested heads about it very long."
A MILD DAY IN WINTER
"It had been a cold and windy winter. Day after day the storm-clouds had piled up in the northwest and spread slowly over the sky, dropping great ragged flakes of snow down to the shivering earth. Then the forest trees were clothed in fleecy white garments, and the branches of the evergreens drooped under their heavy cloak."
"Then there had been other days, when a strong wind stripped the trees of their covering, and brought with it thousands of small, hard flakes."
"These flakes were drier than the ragged ones had been, and did not cling so lovingly to everything they touched. They would rather frolic on the ground, rising again and again from their resting-places to dance around with the wind, and help make great drifts and overhanging ledges of snow in the edge of the Forest, where there was more open ground."
"It is true that not all the winter had been cold and stormy. There were times when the drifts melted slowly into the earth, and the grass, which last summer had been so tender and green, showed brown and matted on the ground. Still the Great Horned Owl and his wife could not find enough to eat. ""We do not mean to complain,"" said he with dignity, as he scratched one ear with his feathered right foot, ""but neither of us has had a meal hearty enough for a healthy Robin, since the first heavy snow came."""
"This was when he was talking to his cousin, the Screech Owl. ""Hearty enough for a Robin!"" exclaimed Mrs. Great Horned Owl. ""I should say we hadn't. I don't think I have had enough for a Goldfinch, and that is pretty hard for a bird of my size. I am so thin that my feathers feel loose."""
"""Have you been so hungry that you dreamed about food?"" asked the Screech Owl."
"""N-no, I can't say that I have,"" said the Great Horned Owl, while his wife shook her head solemnly."
"""Ah, that is dreadful,"" said the Screech Owl. ""I have done that several times. Only yesterday, while I lay in my nest-hollow, I dreamed that I was hunting. There was food everywhere, but just as I flew down to eat, it turned into pieces of ice. When I awakened I was almost starved and so cold that my beak chattered."""
"It was only a few days after the Screech Owl's call upon his cousins that he awakened one night to find the weather milder, and the ground covered with only a thin coating of soft snow. The beautiful round moon was shining down upon him, and in the western sky the clouds were still red from the rays of the setting sun."
"Somewhere, far beyond the fields and forests of this part of the world, day-birds were beginning to stir, and thousands of downy heads were drawn from under sheltering wings, while in the barnyards the Cocks were calling their welcome to the sun. But the Screech Owl did not think of this. He aroused his wife and they went hunting. When they came back they did not dream about food. They had eaten all that they could, and the Great Horned Owl and his wife had made a meal hearty enough for a dozen Robins, and a whole flock of Goldfinches. It was a good thing for the day-birds that this was so, for it is said that sometimes, when food is very scarce, Owls have been known to hunt by daylight."
"When the feast was over, the bridegroom and bride were conducted to their apartment, with music, and torches, and a great procession. As soon as the door was shut, the Lindworm turned to her and said, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift!"" The shepherd's daughter answered him, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin!"" ""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before!"" said he. ""But I command you to do it now!"" said she."
"Then he began to moan and wriggle: and in a few minutes a long snake-skin lay upon the floor beside him. The girl drew off her first shift, and spread it on top of the skin."
"The Lindworm said again to her, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift."""
"The shepherd's daughter answered him, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin."""
"""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,"" said he. ""But I command you to do it now,"" said she. Then with groans and moans he cast off the second skin: and she covered it with her second shift."
"The Lindworm said for the third time, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift."""
"The shepherd's daughter answered him again, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin."" ""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,"" said he, and his little eyes rolled furiously. But the girl was not afraid, and once more she commanded him to do as she bade."
"And so this went on until nine Lindworm skins were lying on the floor, each of them covered with a snow-white shift. And there was nothing left of the Lindworm but a huge thick mass, most horrible to see. Then the girl seized the whips, dipped them in the lye, and whipped him as hard as ever she could. Next, she bathed him all over in the fresh milk. Lastly, she dragged him on to the bed and put her arms round him. And she fell fast asleep that very moment."
"Next morning very early, the King and the courtiers came and peeped in through the keyhole. They wanted to know what had become of the girl, but none of them dared enter the room. However, in the end, growing bolder, they opened the door a tiny bit. And there they saw the girl, all fresh and rosy, and beside her lay no Lindworm, but the handsomest prince that any one could wish to see."
"The King ran out and fetched the Queen: and after that, there were such rejoicings in the castle as never were known before or since. The wedding took place all over again, much finer than the first, with festivals and banquets and merrymakings for days and weeks. No bride was ever so beloved by a King and Queen as this peasant maid from the shepherd's cottage. There was no end to their love and their kindness towards her: because, by her sense and her calmness and her courage, she had saved their son, Prince Lindworm."
THE LASSIE AND HER GODMOTHER
"Once on a time a poor couple lived far, far away in a great wood. The wife was brought to bed, and had a pretty girl, but they were so poor they did not know how to get the babe christened, for they had no money to pay the parson's fees. So one day the father went out to see if he could find any one who was willing to stand for the child and pay the fees; but though he walked about the whole day from one house to another, and though all said they were willing enough to stand, no one thought himself bound to pay the fees. Now, when he was going home again, a lovely lady met him, dressed so fine, and she looked so thoroughly good and kind; she offered to get the babe christened, but after that, she said, she must keep it for her own. The husband answered, he must first ask his wife what she wished to do; but when he got home and told his story, the wife said, right out, ""No!"""
"Next day the man went out again, but no one would stand if they had to pay the fees; and though he begged and prayed, he could get no help."
"And again as he went home, towards evening the same lovely lady met him, who looked so sweet and good, and she made him the same offer. So he told his wife again how he had fared, and this time she said, if he couldn't get any one to stand for his babe next day, they must just let the lady have her way, since she seemed so kind and good."
"The third day, the man went about, but he couldn't get any one to stand; and so when, towards evening, he met the kind lady again, he gave his word she should have the babe if she would only get it christened at the font. So next morning she came to the place where the man lived, followed by two men to stand godfathers, took the babe and carried it to church, and there it was christened. After that she took it to her own house, and there the little girl lived with her several years, and her Foster-mother was always kind and friendly to her."
"Now, when the Lassie had grown to be big enough to know right and wrong, her Foster-mother got ready to go on a journey."
"""You have my leave,"" she said, ""to go all over the house, except those rooms which I shew you;"" and when she had said that, away she went."
"But the Lassie could not forbear just to open one of the doors a little bit, when POP! out flew a Star."
"When her Foster-mother came back, she was very vexed to find that the star had flown out, and she got very angry with her Foster-daughter, and threatened to send her away; but the child cried and begged so hard that she got leave to stay."
"Now, after a while, the Foster-mother had to go on another journey; and, before she went, she forbade the Lassie to go into those two rooms into which she had never been. She promised to beware; but when she was left alone, she began to think and to wonder what there could be in the second room, and at last she could not help setting the door a little ajar, just to peep in, when POP! out flew the Moon."
"When her Foster-mother came home and found the moon let out, she was very downcast, and said to the Lassie she must go away, she could not stay with her any longer. But the Lassie wept so bitterly, and prayed so heartily for forgiveness, that this time, too, she got leave to stay."
"Some time after, the Foster-mother had to go away again, and she charged the Lassie, who by this time was half grown up, most earnestly that she mustn't try to go into, or to peep into, the third room. But when her Foster-mother had been gone some time, and the Lassie was weary of walking about alone, all at once she thought, ""Dear me, what fun it would be just to peep a little into that third room."" Then she thought she mustn't do it for her Foster-mother's sake; but when the bad thought came the second time she could hold out no longer; come what might, she must and would look into the room; so she just opened the door a tiny bit, when POP! out flew the Sun."
"But when her Foster-mother came back and saw that the sun had flown away, she was cut to the heart, and said, ""Now, there was no help for it, the Lassie must and should go away; she couldn't hear of her staying any longer."" Now the Lassie cried her eyes out, and begged and prayed so prettily; but it was all no good."
"""Nay! but I must punish you!"" said her Foster-mother; ""but you may have your choice, either to be the loveliest woman in the world, and not to be able to speak, or to keep your speech, and to be the ugliest of all women; but away from me you must go."""
"And the Lassie said, ""I would sooner be lovely."" So she became all at once wondrous fair; but from that day forth she was dumb."
"So, when she went away from her Foster-mother, she walked and wandered through a great, great wood; but the farther she went, the farther off the end seemed to be. So, when the evening came on, she clomb up into a tall tree, which grew over a spring, and there she made herself up to sleep that night. Close by lay a castle, and from that castle came early every morning a maid to draw water to make the Prince's tea, from the spring over which the Lassie was sitting. So the maid looked down into the spring, saw the lovely face in the water, and thought it was her own; then she flung away the pitcher, and ran home; and, when she got there, she tossed up her head and said, ""If I'm so pretty, I'm far too good to go and fetch water."""
"So another maid had to go for the water, but the same thing happened to her; she went back and said she was far too pretty and too good to fetch water from the spring for the Prince. Then the Prince went himself, for he had a mind to see what all this could mean. So, when he reached the spring, he too saw the image in the water; but he looked up at once, and became aware of the lovely Lassie who sate there up in the tree. Then he coaxed her down and took her home; and at last made up his mind to have her for his queen, because she was so lovely; but his mother, who was still alive, was against it."
"""She can't speak,"" she said, ""and maybe she's a wicked witch."""
"But the Prince could not be content till he got her. So after they had lived together a while, the Lassie was to have a child, and when the child came to be born, the Prince set a strong watch about her; but at the birth one and all fell into a deep sleep, and her Foster-mother came, cut the babe on its little finger, and smeared the queen's mouth with the blood; and said:"
"And the Snow Buntings and Juncos, who are bright and honest, nodded their dainty little heads and said, ""Nobody in our own dear north country ever spoke a truer word than that."" So they became firm friends of the Ground Hog, even if he were not so large as the rock."
THE END.
True Stories of Wonderful Deeds
The Royal Oak
"There is in Shropshire a fine oak-tree which the country people there call the ""Royal Oak"". They say it is the great-grandson, or perhaps the great-great-grandson of another fine old oak, which more than two hundred years ago stood on the same spot, and served once as a shelter to an English king. This king was Charles II, the son of the unlucky Charles I who had his head cut off by his subjects because he was a weak and selfish ruler."
"On the very day on which that unhappy king lost his head, the Parliament passed a law forbidding anyone to make his son, Prince Charles of Wales, or any other person, king of England. But the Scottish people did not obey this law. They persuaded the young prince to sign a paper, solemnly promising to rule the country as they wished; then they crowned him king. As soon as the Parliament heard of this they sent Cromwell and his Ironsides against the newly-crowned king and his followers, and after several battles the Scottish army was at last broken up and scattered at Worcester."
"Charles fled and hid in a wood, where some poor wood-cutters took care of him and helped him. He put on some of their clothes, cut his hair short, and stained his face and hands brown so that he might appear to be a sunburnt workman like them. But it was some time before he could escape from the wood, for Cromwell's soldiers were searching it in the hope of finding some of the king's men. One day, Charles and two of his friends had to climb into the tall oak to avoid being caught. They had with them some food, which proved very useful, for they were obliged to stay in their strange hiding-place for a whole day. The top of the oak-tree had been cut off some few years before this time, and this had made the lower branches grow thick and bushy, so that people walking below could not easily see through them. It was a fortunate thing for Charles, for while he was in the tree, he heard the soldiers beating the boughs and bushes in the wood as they searched here and there, and even caught glimpses of them through the leaves as they rode about below."
"When they had gone, without even glancing up into the tall oak-tree, he came down, and rode away from the wood on an old mill-horse, with his friends the wood-cutters walking beside him to take care of him as best they could. The saddle was a poor one, and the horse's pace jolted Charles so much, that at last he cried out that he had never seen so bad a steed. At this the owner of the horse jestingly told him that he should not find fault with the poor animal, which had never before carried the weight of three kingdoms upon its back. He meant, of course, that Charles was king of the three kingdoms of England, and Scotland, and Ireland."
"Carried by the old horse, and helped by the poor wood-cutters, Charles at last reached the house of a friend. Here he hid for a time, and then went on to try and escape from the country. This time, so that he might not be discovered, he was dressed as a servant, and rode on horseback, with a lady sitting on a cushion behind him, as was then the fashion."
After several more dangers he managed to get on board a ship and sailed away to France.
Bonnie Prince Charlie
"Prince Charlie was the grandson of King James II, who was driven away from the throne of England because he was a selfish man and a bad ruler."
"The young prince tried to win the crown back again. He came over to Scotland from France, with only seven followers; but soon a great many of the Scots joined him, for he was so gay, and handsome, and friendly, that all who saw him loved him. They called him ""Bonnie Prince Charlie""."
"But though the prince and his followers were very brave, they had no chance against the well-trained soldiers of King George of England. They won a few victories; then they were thoroughly beaten in the battle of Culloden. Thousands of brave Scots were slain, and the prince had to fly for his life."
"After this, for many weeks, he hid among the moors and mountains from the English soldiers who were trying to find him. He lived in small huts, or in caves, and many times had nothing but the wild berries from the woods to eat. Once he stayed for three weeks with a band of robbers, who were very kind to him; and though the king offered a large sum of money to anyone who would give him up, not one of his poor friends was false to him."
"At last, a young and beautiful Scottish lady, named Flora MacDonald, helped him to escape. She gave him woman's clothes, and pretended that he was her servant, called Betty Burke. Then she took him with her away from the place where the soldiers were searching, and after a time he reached the sea, and got safely away to France."
Nelson and Hardy
"Lord Nelson was one of the greatest seamen that ever lived. He commanded the British fleet at the battle of Trafalgar, when the navies of France and Spain were beaten, and England was saved from a great danger. He did not look like a famous admiral on board his ship, the Victory, that day. He was a small man, and his clothes were shabby. He had lost one arm and one eye in battle; but with the eye which remained he could see more than most men with two, and his brain was busy planning the course of the coming fight. Just before it began, he went over his ship, giving orders to the crew, and cheering them with kind words, which touched the hearts of the rough men, who loved their leader and were proud of him."
"""England expects every man to do his duty"" was the last message he sent them. Every man did his duty nobly that day, though the battle was fierce and long; but it was the last fight of the brave commander. He was shot in the back as he walked the deck with his friend Captain Hardy, and was carried below."
"He lay dying for several hours, but, in spite of his great pain, his one thought was of the battle. ""How goes the day with us?"" he asked of Hardy; and when told that many of the enemies' ships were taken, he cried eagerly, ""I am glad. Whip them, Hardy, as they have never been whipped before."" Later, when his friend came to tell him that the victory was won, Nelson pressed his hand. ""Good-bye, Hardy!"" said he, ""I have done my duty, and I thank God for it."" These were the last words of one of England's bravest sons."
Watt and the Kettle
"There was once a little Scotch boy named James Watt. He was not a strong child, and could not always run and play with other boys, but had often to amuse himself at home. One holiday afternoon little James amused himself in this way. He held a saucer over the stream of steam which came from the spout of a boiling kettle, and as he watched he saw little drops of water forming on the saucer. He thought this was very strange, and wondered why it happened, for he did not know that steam is just water changed in form by the heat, and that as soon as it touches something cold it turns again into water. He asked his aunt to explain it, but she only told him not to waste his time. If she could have foreseen the work which her nephew would do when he became a man, she would not have thought he was wasting his time."
"When James Watt grew up, he was as much interested in steam and its wonderful power, as he had been as a boy. He was sure it could be made of great service to men. It was already used for driving engines, but the engines were not good, and it cost much money to work them. Watt thought they could be improved, but it was long before he found out the way to do this. Often, he sat by the fire watching the lid of the kettle as it was made to dance by the steam, and thinking of many plans; and at last a happy thought came to him. His plan enabled great improvements to be made in the working of engines, and now steam drives our trains and ships, our mills and factories, and is one of our most useful servants."
Queen Victoria and her Soldiers
"Queen Victoria was always proud of her brave soldiers. In time of war, she gave orders that news of them was to be sent to her every day, and when the generals returned home, they were commanded to visit her, and to tell her of the bravery of the troops."
"During the long war with the Russians in the Crimea, the British soldiers suffered greatly from the freezing winds, and rain, and snow, of that cold land. When Queen Victoria heard of this, she and her children worked with their own hands to make warm clothing for them. A great many of the wounded and sick men were sent home in ships, to be nursed in the English hospitals, and the Queen paid several visits to the poor fellows as they lay there. Moving from one bed to another, she cheered them with hopeful words, and listened gladly to their stories of the battles in which they had fought. When she saw that the hospitals were crowded, and not very comfortable, she told Parliament that better ones ought to be provided, and after a time this was done, and the fine hospital of Netley was built, of which the Queen laid the first stone."
"""Hurry up,"" he said. ""Come down and lie still, can't you?"""
"So the rock with the round piece of earth fell into the sea, and the point of the rock went into a hole that just fitted it in the stony sea bottom, and there it spun around the wrong way seven times and then lay still. And that round piece of land became, after millions of years, the Kingdom of Rotundia."
"This is the end of the geography lesson. And now for just a little natural history, so that we may not feel that we are quite wasting our time. Of course, the consequence of the island having spun around the wrong way was that when the animals began to grow on the island they all grew the wrong sizes. The guinea pig, as you know, was as big as our elephants, and the elephant dear little pet was the size of the silly, tiny, black-and-tan dogs that ladies carry sometimes in their muffs. The rabbits were about the size of our rhinoceroses, and all about the wild parts of the island they had made their burrows as big as railway tunnels. The dormouse, of course, was the biggest of all the creatures."
"I can't tell you how big he was. Even if you think of elephants it will not help you at all. Luckily there was only one of him, and he was always asleep. Otherwise I don't think the Rotundians could have borne with him. As it was, they made him a house, and it saved the expense of a brass band, because no band could possibly have been heard when the dormouse was talking in his sleep."
"The men and women and children in this wonderful island were quite the right size, because their ancestors had come over with the Conqueror long after the island had settled down and the animals grown on it."
"Now the natural history lesson is over, and if you have been attending, you know more about Rotundia than anyone there did, except three people:"
"the Lord Chief Schoolmaster, the Princess's uncle who was a magician, and knew everything without learning it and Tom, the gardener's son."
"Tom had learned more at school than anyone else, because he wished to take a prize. The prize offered by the Lord Chief Schoolmaster was a History of Rotundia, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the back. But after that day when the Princess said she meant to marry Tom, the gardener's boy thought it over, and he decided that the best prize in the world would be the Princess, and this was the prize Tom meant to take; and when you are a gardener's son and have decided to marry a Princess, you will find that the more you learn at school the better."
"The Princess always played with Tom on the days when the little dukes and marquises did not come to tea and when he told her he was almost sure of the first prize, she clapped her hands and said: ""Dear Tom, dear good, clever Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet elephant and you can keep him till we're married."""
"The pet elephant was called Fido, and the gardener's son took him away in his coat pocket. He was the dearest little elephant you ever saw about six inches long. But he was very, very wise he could not have been wiser if he had been a mile high. He lay down comfortably in Tom's pocket, and when Tom put in his hand, Fido curled his little trunk around Tom's fingers with an affectionate confidence that made the boy's heart warm to his new little pet. What with the elephant, and the Princess's affection, and the knowledge that the very next day he would receive the History of Rotundia, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the cover, Tom could hardly sleep a wink. And, besides, the dog did bark so terribly. There was only one dog in Rotundia the kingdom could not afford to keep more than one: He was a Mexican lapdog of the kind that in most parts of the world only measures seven inches from the end of his dear nose to the tip of his darling tail but in Rotundia he was bigger than I can possibly expect you to believe. And when he barked, his bark was so large that it filled up all the night and left no room for sleep or dreams or polite conversation, or anything else at all. He never barked at things that went on in the island he was too large-minded for that; but when ships went blundering by in the dark, tumbling over the rocks at the end of the island, he would bark once or twice, just to let the ships know that they couldn't come playing about there just as they liked."
"But on this particular night he barked and barked and barked and the Princess said, ""Oh dear, oh dear, I wish he wouldn't, I am so sleepy."""
"And Tom said to himself, ""I wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as it's light I'll go and see."""
"So when it began to be pretty pink-and-yellow daylight, Tom got up and went out. And all the time the Mexican lapdog barked so that the houses shook, and the tiles on the roof of the palace rattled like milk cans in a cart whose horse is frisky."
"""I'll go to the pillar,"" thought Tom, as he went through the town. The pillar, of course, was the top of the piece of rock that had stuck itself through Rotundia millions of years before, and made it spin around the wrong way. It was quite in the middle of the island, and stuck up ever so far, and when you were at the top you could see a great deal farther than when you were not."
"As Tom went out from the town and across the downs, he thought what a pretty sight it was to see the rabbits in the bright, dewy morning, frisking with their young ones by the mouths of their burrows. He did not go very near the rabbits, of course, because when a rabbit of that size is at play it does not always look where it is going, and it might easily have crushed Tom with its foot, and then it would have been very sorry afterward. And Tom was a kind boy, and would not have liked to make even a rabbit unhappy. Earwigs in our country often get out of the way when they think you are going to walk on them. They too have kind hearts, and they would not like you to be sorry afterward."
"So Tom went on, looking at the rabbits and watching the morning grow more and more red and golden. And the Mexican lapdog barked all the time, till the church bells tinkled, and the chimney of the apple factory rocked again."
"But when Tom got to the pillar, he saw that he would not need to climb to the top to find out what the dog was barking at."
"For there, by the pillar, lay a very large purple dragon. His wings were like old purple umbrellas that have been very much rained on, and his head was large and bald, like the top of a purple toadstool, and his tail, which was purple too, was very, very, very long and thin and tight, like the lash of a carriage whip."
"It was licking one of its purple umbrella-y wings, and every now and then it moaned and leaned its head back against the rocky pillar as though it felt faint. Tom saw at once what had happened. A flight of purple dragons must have crossed the island in the night, and this poor one must have knocked its wing and broken it against the pillar."
"Everyone is kind to everyone in Rotundia, and Tom was not afraid of the dragon, although he had never spoken to one before. He had often watched them flying across the sea, but he had never expected to get to know one personally."
"So now he said: ""I am afraid you don't feel quite well."""
"The dragon shook his large purple head. He could not speak, but like all other animals, he could understand well enough when he liked."
"""Can I get you anything?"" asked Tom, politely."
The dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring smile.
"""A bun or two, now,"" said Tom, coaxingly. ""There's a beautiful bun tree quite close."""
"The dragon opened a great purple mouth and licked his purple lips, so Tom ran and shook the bun tree, and soon came back with an armful of fresh currant buns, and as he came he picked a few of the Bath kind, which grow on the low bushes near the pillar."
"Because, of course, another consequence of the island's having spun the wrong way is that all the things we have to make buns and cakes and shortbread grow on trees and bushes, but in Rotundia they have to make their cauliflowers and cabbages and carrots and apples and onions, just as our cooks make puddings and turnovers."
"Tom gave all the buns to the dragon, saying: ""Here, try to eat a little."
"You'll soon feel better then."""
"The dragon ate up the buns, nodded rather ungraciously, and began to lick his wing again. So Tom left him and went back to the town with the news, and everyone was so excited at a real live dragon's being on the island a thing that had never happened before that they all went out to look at it, instead of going to the prize-giving, and the Lord Chief Schoolmaster went with the rest. Now, he had Tom's prize, the History of Rotundia, in his pocket the one bound in calf, with the Royal arms on the cover and it happened to drop out, and the dragon ate it, so Tom never got the prize after all. But the dragon, when he had gotten it, did not like it."
"""Perhaps it's all for the best,"" said Tom. ""I might not have liked that prize either, if I had gotten it."""
"It happened to be a Wednesday, so when the Princess's friends were asked what they would like to do, all the little dukes and marquises and earls said, ""Let's go and see the dragon."" But the little duchesses and marchionesses and countesses said they were afraid."
"""Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let out the star;"" and with these words she carried off the babe."
"But when those who were on the watch woke, they thought the queen had eaten her own child, and the old queen was all for burning her alive, but the Prince was so fond of her that at last he begged her off, but he had hard work to set her free."
"So the next time the young queen was to have a child, twice as strong a watch was set as the first time, but the same thing happened over again, only this time her Foster-mother said:"
"""Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let the moon out."""
"And the queen begged and prayed, and wept; for when her Foster-mother was there, she could speak but it was all no good."
"And now the old queen said she must be burnt, but the Prince found means to beg her off. But when the third child was to be born, a watch was set three times as strong as the first, but just the same thing happened. Her Foster-mother came while the watch slept, took the babe, and cut its little finger, and smeared the queen's mouth with the blood, telling her now she should be as grieved as she had been when the Lassie let out the sun."
"And now the Prince could not save her any longer. She must and should be burnt. But just as they were leading her to the stake, all at once they saw her Foster-mother, who came with all three children two she led by the hand, and the third she had on her arm; and so she went up to the young queen and said:"
"""Here are your children; now you shall have them again. I am the Virgin Mary, and so grieved as you have been, so grieved was I when you let out sun, and moon, and star. Now you have been punished for what you did, and henceforth you shall have your speech."""
"How glad the Queen and Prince now were, all may easily think, but no one can tell. After that they were always happy; and from that day even the Prince's mother was very fond of the young queen."
THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSE
"Once on a time there was a man, so surly and cross, he never thought his Wife did anything right in the house. So, one evening, in haymaking time, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth and making a dust."
"""Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man,"" said his goody; ""to-morrow let's change our work. I'll go out with the mowers and mow, and you shall mind the house at home."""
"Yes! the Husband thought that would do very well. He was quite willing, he said."
"So, early next morning, his goody took a scythe over her neck, and went out into the hayfield with the mowers, and began to mow; but the man was to mind the house, and do the work at home."
"First of all, he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned a while, he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of ale. So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tap into the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen. Then off he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as he could, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but when he got up, and saw the pig had already knocked the churn over, and stood there, routing and grunting amongst the cream which was running all over the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig as hard as he could. He caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick, that piggy lay for dead on the spot. Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in his hand; but when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run out of the cask."
"Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill the churn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have at dinner. When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milking cow was still shut up in the byre, and hadn't had a bit to eat or a drop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high. Then all at once he thought 'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'd just get her up on the house top for the house, you must know, was thatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there. Now the house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if he laid a plank across to the thatch at the back he'd easily get the cow up."
"But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his little babe crawling about on the floor, and ""if I leave it,"" he thought, ""the child is safe to upset it."" So he took the churn on his back, and went out with it; but then he thought he'd better first water the cow before he turned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water out of the well; but, as he stooped down at the well's brink, all the cream ran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well."
"Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn't even got the butter yet; so he thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water and hung it over the fire. When he had done that, he thought the cow might perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck. So he got up on the house to tie her up. One end of the rope he made fast to the cow's neck and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied round his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now began to boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal."
"So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell the cow off the house-top after all, and as she fell, she dragged the man up the chimney by the rope. There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, she hung half-way down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for she could neither get down nor up."
"And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her Husband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call they had. At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and went home. But when she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, she ran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe. But, as she did this, down came her Husband out of the chimney; and so, when his old dame came inside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in the porridge pot."
THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND
"Once on a time there was an old widow who had one son; and as she was poorly and weak, her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was just going down the steps, there came the North Wind puffing and blowing, caught up the meal, and so away with it through the air. Then the Lad went back into the safe for more; but when he came out again on the steps, if the North Wind didn't come again and carry off the meal with a puff:"
"and, more than that, he did so the third time. At this the Lad got very angry; and as he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so, he thought he'd just look him up, and ask him to give up his meal."
"So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked and walked; but at last he came to the North Wind's house."
"""Good day!"" said the Lad, ""and thank you for coming to see us yesterday."""
"""GOOD DAY!"" answered the North Wind, for his voice was loud and gruff, ""AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT?"""
"""Oh!"" answered the Lad, ""I only wished to ask you to be so good as to let me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for we haven't much to live on; and if you're to go on snapping up the morsel we have, there'll be nothing for it but to starve."""
"""I haven't got your meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but if you are in such need, I'll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want, if you only say, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes!'"""
"With this the Lad was well content. But, as the way was so long he couldn't get home in one day, so he turned into an inn on the way; and when they were going to sit down to supper he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
"He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all who stood by thought it a fine thing, but most of all the landlady. So, when all were fast asleep at dead of night, she took the Lad's cloth, and put another in its stead, just like the one he had got from the North Wind, but which couldn't so much as serve up a bit of dry bread."
Perhaps a word of apology is due the Indians after all. Possibly they got their ideas from Cockburn.
"The battle of Lundy's Lane had been arranged for July 25, 1814, and so the Americans crossed Niagara under General Brown to invade Canada."
"General Winfield Scott led the advance, and gained a brilliant victory, July 5, at Chippewa. The second engagement was at Lundy's Lane, within the sound of the mighty cataract. Old man Lundy, whose lane was used for the purpose, said that it was one of the bloodiest fights, by a good many gallons, that he ever attended. The battle was, however, barren of results, the historian says, though really an American victory from the stand-point of the tactician and professional gore-spiller."
"In September, Sir George Prevost took twelve thousand veteran troops who had served under Wellington, and started for Plattsburg. The ships of the British at the same time opened fire on the nine-dollar American navy, and were almost annihilated. The troops under Prevost started in to fight, but, learning of the destruction of the British fleet on Lake Champlain, Prevost fled like a frightened fawn, leaving his sick and wounded and large stores of lime-juice, porridge, and plum-pudding. The Americans, who had been living on chopped horse-feed and ginseng-root, took a week off and gave themselves up to the false joys of lime-juice and general good feeling."
"Along the coast the British destroyed everything they could lay their hands on; but perhaps the rudest thing they did was to enter Washington and burn the Capitol, the Congressional library, and the smoke-house in which President Madison kept his hams. Even now, when the writer is a guest of some great English dignitary, and perhaps at table picking the ""merry-thought"" of a canvas-back duck, the memory of this thing comes over him, and, burying his face in the costly napery, he gives himself up to grief until kind words and a celery-glass-full of turpentine, or something, bring back his buoyancy and rainbow smile. The hospitality and generous treatment of our English brother to Americans now is something beautiful, unaffected, and well worth a voyage across the qualmy sea to see, but when Cockburn burned down the Capitol and took the President's sugar-cured hams he did a rude act."
CHAPTER XXI.
THE ADVANCE OF THE REPUBLIC.
"The administration now began to suffer at the hands of the people, many of whom criticised the conduct of the war and that of the President also. People met at Hartford and spoke so harshly that the Hartford Federalist obtained a reputation which clung to him for many years."
"There being no cable in those days, the peace by Treaty of Ghent was not heard of in time to prevent the battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815, there having been two weeks of peace as a matter of fact when this hot and fatal battle was fought."
"General Pakenham, with a force of twelve thousand men by sea and land, attacked the city. The land forces found General Jackson intrenched several miles below the city. He had used cotton for fortifications at first, but a hot shot had set a big bunch of it on fire and rolled it over towards the powder-supplies, so that he did not use cotton any more."
"General Pakenham was met by the solid phalanx of Tennessee and Kentucky riflemen, who reserved their fire, as usual, until the loud uniform of the English could be distinctly heard, when they poured into their ranks a galling fire, as it was so tersely designated at the time. General Pakenham fell mortally wounded, and his troops were repulsed, but again rallied, only to be again repulsed. This went on until night, when General Lambert, who succeeded General Pakenham, withdrew, hopelessly beaten, and with a loss of over two thousand men."
"The United States now found that an honorable peace had been obtained, and with a debt of $127,000,000 started in to pay it up by instalments, which was done inside of twenty years from the ordinary revenue."
"In the six years following, one State per year was added to the Union, and all kinds of manufactures were built up to supply the goods that had been cut off by the blockade during the war. Even the deluge of cheap goods from abroad after the war did not succeed in breaking these down."
"James Monroe was almost unanimously elected. He was generally beloved, and his administration was, in fact, known as the original ""era of good feeling,"" since so successfully reproduced especially by the Governors of North and South Carolina. (See Appendix.)"
"Through the efforts of Henry Clay, Missouri was admitted as a slave State in 1821, under the compromise that slavery should not be admitted into any of the Territories west of the Mississippi and north of parallel 36° 30' N."
"Clay was one of the greatest men of his time, and was especially eminent as an eloquent and magnetic speaker in the days when the record for eloquence was disputed by the giants of American oratory, and before the Senate of the United States had become a wealthy club of men whose speeches are rarely printed except at so much per column, paid in advance."
Clay was the original patentee of the slogan for campaign use.
"Lafayette revisited this country in 1819, and was greeted with the greatest hospitality. He visited the grave of Washington, and tenderly spoke of the grandeur of character shown by his chief."
"He was given the use of the Brandywine, a government ship, for his return. As he stood on the deck of the vessel at Pier 1, North River, his mind again recurred to Washington, and to those on shore he said that ""to show Washington's love of truth, even as a child, he could tell an interesting incident of him relating to a little new hatchet given him at the time by his father."" As he reached this point in his remarks, Lafayette noted with surprise that some one had slipped his cable from shore and his ship was gently shoved off by people on the pier, while his voice was drowned in the notes of the New York Oompah Oompah Band as it struck up ""Johnny, git yer Gun."""
"Florida was ceded to the United States in the same year by Spain, and was sprinkled over with a light coating of sand for the waves to monkey with. The Everglades of Florida are not yet under cultivation."
"Mr. Monroe became the author of what is now called the ""Monroe doctrine,"" viz., that the effort of any foreign country to obtain dominion in America would thereafter and forever afterwards be regarded as an unfriendly act. Rather than be regarded as unfriendly, foreign countries now refrain from doing their dominion or dynasty work here."
"The Whigs now appeared, and the old Republican party became known as the Democratic party. John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay were Whigs, and John C. Calhoun and Andrew Jackson were Democrats. The Whigs favored a high protective tariff and internal improvement. The Democrats did not favor anything especially, but bitterly opposed the Whig measures, whatever they were."
"In 1825, John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams, was elected President, and served one term. He was a bald-headed man, and the country was given four years of unexampled prosperity. Yet this experience has not been regarded by the people as it should have been. Other kinds of men have repeatedly been elected to that office, only to bring sorrow, war, debt, and bank-failures upon us. Sometimes it would seem to the thinking mind that, as a people, we need a few car-loads of sense in each school-district, where it can be used at a moment's notice."
"Adams was not re-elected, on account of his tariff ideas, which were not popular at the South. He was called ""The old man eloquent,"" and it is said that during his more impassioned passages his head, which was round and extremely smooth, became flushed, so that, from resembling the cue-ball on the start, as he rose to more lofty heights his dome of thought looked more like the spot ball on a billiard-table. No one else in Congress at that time had succeeded in doing this."
"John Quincy Adams was succeeded in 1829 by Andrew Jackson, the hero of New Orleans. Jackson was the first to introduce what he called ""rotation in office."" During the forty years previous there had been but seventy-four removals; Jackson made seven hundred. This custom has been pretty generally adopted since, giving immense satisfaction to those who thrive upon the excitement of offensive partisanship and their wives'"
"relations, while those who have legitimate employment and pay taxes support and educate a new official kindergarten with every change of administration."
"The prophet sees in the distance an eight-year term for the President, and employment thereafter as ""charge-d'affaires"" of the United States, with permission to go beyond the seas. Thus the vast sums of money and rivers of rum used in the intervening campaigns at present will be used for the relief of the widow and orphan. The ex-President then, with the portfolio of International Press Agent for the United States, could go abroad and be fêted by foreign governments, leaving dyspepsia everywhere in his wake and crowned heads with large damp towels on them."
"Every ex-President should have some place where he could go and hide his shame. A trip around the world would require a year, and by that time the voters would be so disgusted with the new President that the old one would come like a healing balm, and he would be permitted to die without publishing a bulletin of his temperature and showing his tongue to the press for each edition of the paper."
"South Carolina in 1832 passed a nullification act declaring the tariff act ""null and void"" and announcing that the State would secede from the Union if force were used to collect any revenue at Charleston. South Carolina has always been rather ""advanced"" regarding the matter of seceding from the American Union."
"President Jackson, however, ordered General Scott and a number of troops to go and see that the laws were enforced; but no trouble resulted, and soon more satisfactory measures were enacted, through the large influence of Mr. Clay."
"In the streets, the lamps were lighted, but daylight was not quite gone."
"He walked unsteadily, toward Piccadilly.  A girl of the town passed and"
"looked up at him.  Staring hard, he hooked his arm in hers without a"
"word; it steadied him, and they walked on thus together.  Suddenly he"
said:
"""Well, girl, are you happy?""  The girl stopped and tried to disengage her"
arm; a rather frightened look had come into her dark-eyed powdered face.
"Fiorsen laughed, and held it firm.  ""When the unhappy meet, they walk"
together.  Come on!  You are just a little like my wife.  Will you have a
"drink?"""
"The girl shook her head, and, with a sudden movement, slipped her arm out"
of this madman's and dived away like a swallow through the pavement
traffic.  Fiorsen stood still and laughed with his head thrown back.  The
second time to-day.  SHE had slipped from his grasp.  Passers looked at
"him, amazed.  The ugly devils!  And with a grimace, he turned out of"
"Piccadilly, past St. James's Church, making for Bury Street.  They"
"wouldn't let him in, of course--not they!  But he would look at the"
"windows; they had flower-boxes--flower-boxes!  And, suddenly, he groaned"
aloud--he had thought of Gyp's figure busy among the flowers at home.
"Missing the right turning, he came in at the bottom of the street.  A"
fiddler in the gutter was scraping away on an old violin.  Fiorsen
"stopped to listen.  Poor devil!  ""Pagliacci!""  Going up to the man--dark,"
"lame, very shabby, he took out some silver, and put his other hand on the"
man's shoulder.
"""Brother,"" he said, ""lend me your fiddle.  Here's money for you. Come;"
"lend it to me.  I am a great violinist."""
"""Vraiment, monsieur!"""
cranks as ever handled timber.  So the clerk said.  And one had a
hankerin' for teak and another for hoak (with odd leanin's now and
"agin for Hafrican and Portugee and French hoak), and another he said"
"'Cuban Sabicu,' and another's word was 'Hackmatack' and 'chestnut'"
hevery time.  So they shoved in bits here and bits there till she was
a reg'lar junk-shop o' samples.  And that's the reason she's a
"foreign talking argument ship.  And a mighty good reason too."""
The crowd listened in silence.
"""If you knew as much about arguin' as you know (_seemin'ly_) about"
"timbers as no man ever heerd of, your argument might stand,"" said"
"Mackenzie, a withered old foc'sle man.  ""But it ain't to reason as"
the natur' of the woods in a ship should make us talk this way or
"that.  If so be a ship was built o' teak, d'ye think we'd talk the"
"'jildy jow,' you black 'son of a gun' lingo?"""
Hart shook his head.
"""No ship ain't never built all of teak as I ever heerd of, and so"
"your eye's out, Mac.  But a man with 'arf an eye could see the"
knowledge of her bein' so built might lead right hup to talk about
"the stren'ths of the countries as well of the vally of their timbers."""
"""So they might,"" said the almost convinced crowd.  ""Now Jack Hart 'as"
"the gift, so to speak, of seein' through things."""
"""And once started, who'd stop it?"" asked Jack triumphantly.  ""I"
"knowed a ship as 'ad fresh crowd after fresh crowd in her, but she"
for ever 'ad a black cat aboard.  And they talked 'cat' to make you
sick.  And I knowed another as 'ad from launch to her hultimate
pilin' up in the Bermudas the fashion of calling the skipper the
dismay. For some reason she could not understand she had offended Mart.
And Pola had snubbed her. It had indeed been a cruel fate that had
brought Pola out on the wharf at that precise moment!
"She spent a lonely afternoon in Top Notch, too miserable to even pour"
"out her heart to ""Dorothea."" Then she helped Aunt Achsa prepare supper"
"and after supper, which was lonely, too, for neither Lavender nor Mr."
"Dugald were there, she insisted upon clearing up the dishes while Aunt"
Achsa went down to Tillie Higgins'.
Swishing her hands in the soapy water Sidney pondered sadly the things
she had longed to learn of Pola. Her name--why she hadn't even found
out her name! What had her teacher said of that theme she had written
on her visit to the Romley house? Where did Pola live? Of course she
might see her again--Pola had said that they'd be in Provincetown for a
"few days, but she did not _want_ to see her; she did not want Pola to"
see Sunset Lane and the little gray cottage and Aunt Achsa and
Lavender. Pola would laugh at them and she would hate her!
At that moment footsteps crunched the gravel of the path and a shadow
fell across the kitchen door. Sidney turned from the table. There stood
Mr. Dugald and with him--Pola.
"""I've brought my cousin, Sidney. She blew out to the Cape with that"
ill-wind we felt this morning. If you know what we can do with her I'll
"be your slave for life."""
Playfully pushing Dugald Allan aside Pola walked into the kitchen.
"""Isn't he horrid? You wouldn't dream that he's really crazy about me,"
"would you? I told him how we'd met, even before this morning. He'd"
written home that Miss Green's cousin was here but I never dreamed it
But when in her mirror she saw him standing behind her--he had crept into
the bedroom like a cat--fierceness came into her.  She could see the
"blood rush up in her own white face, and, turning round she said:"
"""No, Gustav, go out to the music-room if you want a companion."""
"He recoiled against the foot of the bed and stared at her haggardly, and"
"Gyp, turning back to her mirror, went on quietly taking the pins out of"
"her hair.  For fully a minute she could see him leaning there, moving his"
"head and hands as though in pain. Then, to her surprise, he went.  And a"
vague feeling of compunction mingled with her sense of deliverance.  She
"lay awake a long time, watching the fire-glow brighten and darken on the"
"ceiling, tunes from ""The Tales of Hoffmann"" running in her head; thoughts"
"and fancies crisscrossing in her excited brain.  Falling asleep at last,"
"she dreamed she was feeding doves out of her hand, and one of them was"
"Daphne Wing.  She woke with a start.  The fire still burned, and by its"
"light she saw him crouching at the foot of the bed, just as he had on"
"their wedding-night--the same hungry yearning in his face, and an arm"
"outstretched.  Before she could speak, he began:"
"""Oh, Gyp, you don't understand!  All that is nothing--it is only you I"
want--always.  I am a fool who cannot control himself. Think!  It's a
"long time since you went away from me."""
"Gyp said, in a hard voice:"
"""I didn't want to have a child."""
He said quickly:
"""No; but now you have it you are glad.  Don't be unmerciful, my Gyp!  It"
is like you to be merciful.  That girl--it is all over--I swear--I
Three months--and in this state of misery!
"""I think I shall do something desperate.  Now that I can't dance, and"
"THEY know, it's too awful!  If I could see him, I wouldn't mind anything."
"But I know--I know he'll never want me again.  Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I"
"was dead!  I do!"""
"A heavy sigh escaped Gyp, and, bending suddenly, she kissed the girl's"
"forehead.  Still that scent of orange blossom about her skin or hair, as"
"when she asked whether she ought to love or not; as when she came,"
"moth-like, from the tree-shade into the moonlight, spun, and fluttered,"
"with her shadow spinning and fluttering before her.  Gyp turned away,"
"feeling that she must relieve the strain and pointing to the bowl, said:"
"""YOU put that there, I'm sure.  It's beautiful."""
"The girl answered, with piteous eagerness:"
"""Oh, would you like it?  Do take it.  Count Rosek gave it me.""  She"
"started away from the door.  ""Oh, that's papa.  He'll be coming in!"""
"Gyp heard a man clear his throat, and the rattle of an umbrella falling"
into a stand; the sight of the girl wilting and shrinking against the
"sideboard steadied her.  Then the door opened, and Mr. Wagge entered."
"Short and thick, in black frock coat and trousers, and a greyish beard,"
"he stared from one to the other.  He looked what he was, an Englishman"
"and a chapelgoer, nourished on sherry and mutton, who could and did make"
"his own way in the world.  His features, coloured, as from a deep"
"liverishness, were thick, like his body, and not ill-natured, except for"
"a sort of anger in his small, rather piggy grey eyes.  He said in a voice"
"permanently gruff, but impregnated with a species of professional"
ingratiation:
"smooth, the delicate tracery of veins could be distinctly seen, and each"
"muscle stood out hard and taut; there was no superfluous flesh, but a"
firmness and excellence of condition that brought a smile of
"satisfaction to Grey’s face.  He turned with a smile to Dick, who stood"
by beaming.
"""Not much fear of him to-day, eh, Dicon?"""
"""He would jump the moon, master, if you asked it of him,"" was the proud"
and confident answer.
"""How do the others look?  Have you seen them?"""
"""Pretty bits of horseflesh every one; and there is a black stallion of"
Mr. Artheret’s that will take some beating.  But he’s too heavy for some
of the jumps. He don’t take off fast enough.  And he’s a nasty temper
"too.  There’s a gray Arab with pace; but he falls away behind, as they"
all do.  I don’t think Don Carlos will be troubled long by him.  None of
"the others will take much beating.  Pretty to look at, but not trained"
"for what they’ve got to do.  Lord Sandford was here yesterday early,"
"looking at the jumps, and he had several of them made stiffer; but"
"there’s nothing Don Carlos cannot sail over like a bird!"""
"""Let us go and see,"" said Grey.  ""I will take a canter on the turf to"
"warm myself to the saddle. Soh, boy, soh!"" as he lightly vaulted to his"
"seat, and the horse curveted beneath him.  ""We will take a look at these"
"obstructions.  The stiffer they are, the better you and I will be"
"pleased—eh, my beauty?"""
"Dick mounted his nag, and rode beside his master to the course, where"
the horses were to be matched against each other when Lord Sandford and
"his friends should have finished their merry meal, and be ready to"
of the people settled down to a lively _conversazione_. It is much
"nicest, on the whole, to travel third class on the railway. There is"
"space, there is air, and it is like being in a lively inn, everybody in"
good spirits.
At our end was plenty of room. Just across the gangway was an elderly
"couple, like two children, coming home very happily. He was fat, fat all"
"over, with a white moustache and a little not-unamiable frown. She was a"
"tall lean, brown woman, in a brown full-skirted dress and black apron,"
"with huge pocket. She wore no head covering, and her iron grey hair was"
parted smoothly. They were rather pleased and excited being in the
"train. She took all her money out of her big pocket, and counted it and"
"gave it to him: all the ten Lira notes, and the five Lira and the two"
"and the one, peering at the dirty scraps of pink-backed one-lira notes"
to see if they were good. Then she gave him her half-pennies. And he
"stowed them away in the trouser pocket, standing up to push them down"
"his fat leg. And then one saw, to one's amazement, that the whole of his"
"shirt-tail was left out behind, like a sort of apron worn backwards."
"Why--a mystery. He was one of those fat, good-natured, unheeding men"
"with a little masterful frown, such as usually have tall, lean,"
"hard-faced, obedient wives."
They were very happy. With amazement he watched us taking hot tea from
the Thermos flask. I think he too had suspected it might be a bomb. He
had blue eyes and standing-up white eyebrows.
"""Beautiful hot--!"" he said, seeing the tea steam. It is the inevitable"
"exclamation. ""Does it do you good?"""
"""Yes,"" said the q-b. ""Much good."" And they both nodded complacently."
They were going home.
"The sun is already setting. Far up the mountainside are the cattle, but"
they are moving homeward now; I can hear by their bells that they are
"moving. Tinkling bells and deep-mouthed bells, sometimes sounding together"
"as though there were a meaning in it, a pattern of tones, a rapture."
"And rapture, too, to see all the blades of grass and the tiny flowers and"
"plants. Beside me where I lie is a small pod plant, wonderfully meek, with"
"tiny seeds pushing out of the pod--God bless it, it's becoming a mother!"
It has got caught in a dry twig and I liberate it. Life quivers within it;
"the sun has warmed it today and called it to its destiny. A tiny, gigantic"
miracle.
"Now it is sunset, and the woods bend under a rustling that passes"
through them sweet and heavy; it is the evening.
"I lie for another hour or two; the birds have long since gone to rest, and"
"darkness falls thick and soft.... As I walk homeward, my feet feel their"
"way and I hold my hands before me till I reach the field, where it is a"
little lighter. I walk on the hay that has been left outdoors; it is tough
"and black, and I slip on it because it is already rotting. As I approach"
"the houses, bats fly noiselessly past me, as though on wings of foam. A"
slight shudder convulses me whenever they pass.
Suddenly I stop.
A man is walking here. I can see him against the wall of the new house. He
"has on a coat that looks like the actor's raincoat, but it is not the"
"little comedian himself. There he goes, into the house, right into the"
house. It is Solem.
"""Why, that's where she sleeps!"" I think. ""Ah, well. Alone in the building,"
"in the south wing, Miss Torsen alone--yes, quite alone. And Solem has just"
which I have never experienced in association with German-Austrians
"and with Prussians. I do not wish to speak evil of our Allies, the"
"Prussians, but to one of my blood they are the most detestable people"
whom God ever had the ill-judgment to create.

"I was born in Trieste, and lived there with my parents until I was"
eight years old. In our private life we always spoke Italian or
"French, German was our official language. I know that language well,"
"of course, but it is not my mother tongue. Italian or French, and"
afterwards English--I speak and write all three equally well; which of
the three I shall use when I come to die and one reverts to the speech
"of the nursery and schoolroom, I cannot say; it will depend upon whom"
those are that stand about my deathbed.
"When I was eight years old, my father, Captain ---- (no, I will not"
tell you my name; it is not Trehayne though somewhat similar in
"sound), was appointed Austrian Consul at Plymouth, and we all moved to"
that great Devonshire seaport. I was young enough to absorb the rich
"English atmosphere, nowhere so rich as in that county which is the"
"home and breeding-ground of your most splendid Navy. I was born again,"
a young Elizabethan Englishman. My story to you of my origin was true
in one particular--I really was educated at Blundell's School at
Tiverton. Whenever--and it has happened more than once--I have met as
Trehayne old schoolfellows of Blundell's they have accepted without
"comment or inquiry my tale that I had become an Englishman, and had"
"anglicised my name. Among the peoples which exist on earth to-day, you"
English are the most nobly generous and unsuspicious. The Prussians
"laugh at you; I, an Austrian-Italian, love and respect you."

"""Immortal Jehoshaphat!"" said Captain Prowse; ""here's a go!  What, we"
"with passengers?  Oh, get out!"""
"""You've got to take 'em,"" said the agent philosophically; ""maybe"
"they'll teach you something, and it'll be a good advertisement."""
"""Gah'n!"" said Prowse; ""carryin' scientific jossers won't bring better"
freight next season.  I wish you'd get me chock up with cattle.  I
can't stand scientists; my sister married one that was an 'erbalist
in the Old Kent Road--and since he went to chokey I've lost conceit
"with science.  However, if it must be--why, send 'em along!"""
Captain Prowse was not a popular skipper with sailors.  They said
"that he was a ""hard nut"" and a ""sailor-robber,"" and that his American"
experience had made him nearly as deadly as any American captain with
a belaying-pin.  But sailors' experience only works backward: they
"are good at reminiscence only, and the _Nemagosenda_ got a crew in"
spite of the captain's reputation.  It is possible they would not
have shipped if they had known that men of European light and leading
were to come with them.  Those who follow the sea have a great
"respect for knowledge, but they despise men in soft hats and"
spectacles.  And it cannot be denied that scientific men are as a
rule too simple and gentle to look as if they could take care of
"themselves.  According to Jack, that is the first duty of man, though"

"that word ""moderation,"" he took out a stylographic pen, scratched on a"
"leaf of his note-book, shook Gyp's hand, smiled whimsically, buttoned his"
"upper waistcoat, and departed."
Gyp went back to her seat by the bed.  Irony!  She whose only desire was
"to be let go free, was mainly responsible for his breakdown!  But for"
"her, there would be nothing on his mind, for he would not be married!"
"Brooding morbidly, she asked herself--his drinking, debts, even the"
"girl--had she caused them, too?  And when she tried to free him and"
herself--this was the result!  Was there something fatal about her that
must destroy the men she had to do with?  She had made her father
"unhappy, Monsieur Harmost--Rosek, and her husband!  Even before she"
"married, how many had tried for her love, and gone away unhappy!  And,"
"getting up, she went to a mirror and looked at herself long and sadly."

"Three days after her abortive attempt to break away, Gyp, with much"
"heart-searching, wrote to Daphne Wing, telling her of Fiorsen's illness,"
"and mentioning a cottage near Mildenham, where--if she liked to go--she"
"would be quite comfortable and safe from all curiosity, and finally"
begging to be allowed to make good the losses from any broken

"I stand there waiting to be at hand, to rush in to the rescue, for after"
"all I am a human being, not a brute. Several minutes pass. He has not even"
"bothered to be very quiet, for I hear him clicking the key in the lock."
"Surely I ought to hear a cry now? I hear nothing, nothing; a chair"
"scraping across the floor, that is all."
"""But good heavens, he may do her some harm! He may injure her; he may"
overpower her with rape! Ought I not to tap on the window? I--what for?
"But at the very first cry, I shall be on the spot, take my word for it."""
Not a single cry.
The hours pass; I have settled down to wait. Of course I cannot go my way
and desert a helpless woman. But the hours wear on. A very thorough
"business in there, nothing niggardly about this; it is almost dawn. It"
"occurs to me that he may be killing her, perhaps has killed her already; I"
am alarmed and about to get up--when the key clicks in the lock again and
"Solem emerges. He does not run, but walks back the way he came, down to"
the veranda of my own house. There he hangs the actor's raincoat where it
"hung before, and emerges again. But this time he is naked. He has been"
naked under the coat all this time. Is it possible? Why not? No
"inhibitions, no restraint, no covering; Solem has thought it all out. Now,"
"stark naked, he stalks to his room."
What a man!
I sit thinking and collecting myself and regaining my wits. What has
"happened? The south wing is still wrapped in silence, but the lady is not"
"dead; I can see that from Solem's fearless manner as he goes to his room,"
"lights the lamp, and goes to bed."
"closed their lids. He sat with his head sunk on his breast, till the"
tumult died away. No one rose. The Speaker looked round once and again.
Could it be that no one----? Slowly he began to rise. The movement
"caught Sir Robert's attention: he signed to Puttock, who sprang heavily"
"to his feet. Puttock was no favourite as a speaker, and generally his"
rising was a signal for the House to thin. He began his speech with his
stolid deliberation. Not a man stirred. They waited for something still.
"""And now,"" whispered Medland to the Treasurer, who sat by him, ""let's"
"see what it was in that infernal paper."""
The Treasurer handed him what he asked.
"""You ought to see it,"" he whispered back."
"Mr. Puttock's voice droned on, and his sheaf of notes rustled in his"
hand. No one looked at him or listened to him. Their eyes were still on
"Medland. The Premier read--it seemed so slowly--put the paper down, and"
"gazed first up at the ceiling; then he glanced round, and found all the"
"attentive eyes on him: he smiled--it was just a visible smile, no"
"more--and his head fell again on his breast, while his hand idly twisted"
a button on his coat.
"The show was over, or had never come, and the deferred rush to the doors"
began. They almost tumbled over one another now in their haste to reach
"where their tongues could play freely. Kilshaw and Perry, the Treasurer"
"and the waverers, all slipped out, and Norburn, knowing nothing but"
"simply wearied of Puttock, followed them. Scarce twenty were left in the"
"House, and the galleries had poured half their contents into the great"
room which served for a lobby outside. There the talk ran swift and
"eager. The very name of ""Benyon"" was enough for many, who remembered"
that it had always been said to be the maiden name of Medland's wife.
and the framed photographs on the walls and the array of grease paints
on the dressing-table. John walked up and down the narrow space in great
perplexity of mind. Herold was right. He could not introduce Unity Blake
"into lodgings, saying that he had adopted her. Landladies would not"
"stand it. Even if they would, what in the world could he do with her?"
Could he move into a house or a flat and persuade a registry-office
to provide him with a paragon of a housekeeper? That would be more
"practicable. But, even then, what did he know of the training, moral and"
"spiritual, necessary for a girl of fifteen? He was not going to employ"
her as a servant. On that he was decided. What sort of a position she
"should have he did not know; but her floor-scrubbing, dish-scraping days"
were over. She should have ease of life and loving care--his own phrase
stuck in his head--especially loving care; and he was the only person in
the world who could see that she got it. She must live under his roof.
That was indisputable. But how? In lodgings or a flat? He went angrily
round and round the vicious circle.
"When Herold returned, he dragged him round and round, too, until Perkins"
appeared to help him to change for the third act. Then John had to stop.
He clapped on his hat. He must go and work.
“And you have n't a single suggestion to make?” he asked.
"“I have one,” said Herold, fastening his shirt-studs while Perkins was"
buttoning his boots. “But it's so commonplace and unromantic that you 'd
wreck the dressing-room if I made it.”
"“Well, what is it?” He stood, his hand on the door-knob."
"“You 've got a maiden aunt somewhere, have n't you?”"
"“Oh, don't talk rot!” said John. “I'm dead serious.”"
Once again I am at an age when I walk in the moonlight. Thirty years ago I
"walked in the moonlight, too, walked on crackling, snowy roads, on bare,"
"frozen ground, round unlocked barns, on the hunt for love. How well I"
remember it! But it is no longer the same moonlight. I could even read by
it the letter she gave me. But there are no such letters any more.
"Everything is changed. The tale is told, and tonight I walk abroad on an"
"errand of the head, not of the heart: I shall go across to the trading"
center and dispatch a knapsack by the steamer; after that I shall wander
"on. And that requires nothing but a little ordinary training in walking,"
"and the light of the moon to see by. But in those old days, those young"
"days, we studied the almanac in the autumn to find out if there would be a"
"moon on Twelfth Night, for we could use it then."
Everything is changed; I am changed. The tale lies within the teller.
They say that old age has other pleasures which youth has not: deeper
"pleasures, more lasting pleasures. That is a lie. Yes, you have read"
"right: that is a lie. Only old age itself says this, in a self-interest"
that flaunts its very rags. The old man has forgotten when he stood on the
"summit, forgotten his own self, his own _alias_, red and white,"
"blowing a golden horn. Now he stands no longer--no, he sits--it is less of"
"a strain to sit. But now there comes to him, slow and halting, fat and"
"stupid, the honor of old age. What can a sitting man do with honor? A man"
on his feet can use it; to a sitting man it is only a possession. But
"honor is meant to be used, not to be sat with."
Let sitting men wear warm stockings.

"some sand-bags, trembling all over and feeling as though I was going to"
"choke. I waited for a long time, but nothing happened, so I got up and"
looked round. Lucky escape for us! There's a terrific hole by the Red
Cross and another one behind the bath-house. The third's in the next
field. Only two men hit. O'Neil's got it in the elbow--he's all right
for Blighty. Poor old Hartog's badly hurt--a frightful gash in the thigh
with the piece still in it. I hope he won't have to lose his leg.
"Christ, I'm glad it's all over--I wouldn't like to go through that"
"again."""
"There was silence for a while, but soon the silence was broken by the"
distant muttering of anti-aircraft fire.
"""Jesus Christ Almighty--'e's comin' again--O God, why can't 'e leave us"

We stood outside the marquee and anxiously watched the horizon. We heard
"a faint humming noise. It grew louder and louder until it became a deep,"
droning buzz that rose and fell in regular pulsation. Then
boom--boom--boom--three times the sullen roar of distant explosions
"sounded. Then there came the familiar rushing, whistling noise of a"
descending bomb. We flung ourselves down in the wet grass. I felt every
muscle in my body contract as though I were trying to make myself as
small as a pin point in expectation of the terrible moment. There was a
dull thud close by and I felt the earth vibrate. The bomb had fallen a
"few yards away, but had merely buried itself in the earth without"
exploding.
"There was no anti-aircraft fire, but the droning noise continued loudly,"
"rising and falling. Private Trotter, who was lying beside me, was"
drawing his breath in sharply between his lips. Our fear of impending
disaster was prolonged intolerably. The droning propeller seemed to be
Johnson was strangely silent. He was wondering how his coming there
to-night had really come about. But he could find no solution to the
problem unless it was in response to that perverse instinct which
prompts us all at times to do the very thing which in our hearts we know
"to be wrong. The Girl, meanwhile, after a final creasing of the"
"neatly-folded cover, started for the cupboard, stopping on the way to"
pick up various articles which the wind had strewn about the room.
Flinging them quickly into the cupboard she now went over to the window
"and once more attempted to peer out into the night. But as before, it"
was of no avail. With a shrug she straightened the curtains at the
windows and started for the door. Her action seemed to quicken his
"decision, for, presently, with a gesture of resignation, he threw down"
his hat and coat on the table and said as if speaking to himself:
"""Well, it is Fate--my Fate that has always made the thing I shouldn't do"
"so easy."" And then, turning to the Girl, he added: ""Come, Girl, as you"
"say, if I can't go, I can't. But I know as I stand here that I'll never"
"give you up."""
The Girl looked puzzled.
"""Why, what do you mean?"""
"""I mean,"" began Johnson, pacing the floor slowly. Now he stopped by a"
"chair and pointed as though to the falling snow. ""Suppose we say that's"
an omen--that the old trail is blotted out and there is a fresh road.
"Would you take it with me a stranger, who says: From this day I mean to"
be all you'd have me. Would you take it with me far away from here and
"forever?"""
It did not take the Girl long to frame an answer. Taking Johnson's hand
she said with great feeling:
"to which, thanks to the Captain's co-operation, he had fallen."
"""Now, then, my friend!"" said the Captain, glancing critically at the"
"restored client, ""we have a coat and jacket.  When I had respectable"
trousers I lived in town like a respectable man.  But when the trousers
"wore out, I too fell off in the opinion of my fellow-men and had to"
"come down here from the town.  Men, my fine mannikin, judge everything"
"by the outward appearance, while, owing to their foolishness, the"
actual reality of things is incomprehensible to them.  Make a note of
"this on your nose, and pay me at least half your debt.  Go in peace;"
"seek, and you may find."""
"""How much do I owe you, Aristid Fomich?"" asks the client, in confusion."
"""One rouble and 70 kopecks....  Now, give me only one rouble, or, if"
"you like, 70 kopecks, and as for the rest, I shall wait until you have"
"earned more than you have now by stealing or by hard work, it does not"
"matter to me."""
"""I thank you humbly for your kindness!"" says the client, touched to the"
"heart.  ""Truly you are a kind man....; Life has persecuted you in"
"vain....  What an eagle you would have been in your own place!"""
The Captain could not live without eloquent speeches.
"""What does 'in my own place' mean?  No one really knows his own place"
"in life, and every one of us crawls into his harness.  The place of the"
"merchant Judas Petunikoff ought to be in penal servitude, but he still"
"walks through the streets in daylight, and even intends to build a"
factory. The place of our teacher ought to be beside a wife and
"half-a-dozen children, but he is loitering in the public-house of"
"Vaviloff.  And then, there is yourself.  You are going to seek a"
was you. I'm so sorry I didn't have a chance to introduce you to mother
this morning. But mother wants me to take you back to the hotel. You
can have a room right next to mine and we'll have scads of fun--You'll
"come, won't you?"" For Sidney's face was unyielding."
"Like one cornered, Sidney stood straight against the table, her hands,"
"red from the hot dish water, clasped tightly behind her back. Though"
she knew that Pola was trying to make amends for her rudeness of the
"morning, something within her heart turned hard. The dusty idol was"
crumbling to bits of clay.
"""She's only inviting me because Mr. Dugald has told her to,"" she"
reasoned inwardly. And aloud she answered in a steady voice:
"""I'm sorry, but I simply can't leave Aunt Achsa. You must come here and"
"we'll find lots of jolly things to do--"""
"""Here?"" laughed Pola, glancing around the old kitchen."
"""Why not here?"" roared Mr. Dugald. ""As long as you've broken into our"
Secret Garden we'll introduce you to some things you've never done
before in your life. Only Sid will have to find some suitable clothes
"for you, and you'd better leave your complexion on the dressing table."""
"Pola accepted his banter good-naturedly. ""I shall be deeply grateful,"
"old dear, if you _will_ introduce me to any sensations I have not"
"experienced before. There, now, will that hold you for awhile?"" She"
"turned to Sidney. ""We quarrel like this all the time, but it's fun and"
I always have the last word. I make him so mad he can't think of
anything withering enough to say and I seize that strategic moment to
"cease firing. You see, I practice on Dug. I _will_ come tomorrow if I"
"may. Now, Duggie dear, lead me out of this funny lane or else I'll"
"caring for her little ones, fearful to leave them alone, till at last"
"the gray light came down, down from the sky to the branches, and from"
"the branches to the ground, and she could see her way. Then, with her"
new-born babe in her arms and the elder little fellow trotting by her
"side, she went out to search for her husband. Soon enough she found him,"
"not far off, stiff and cold beside his half-cut bundle of firewood. A"
"snake had bitten him on the ankle, and he was dead."
"So Ma Pa Da was alone in the great forest, but a girl still, with two"
little children to care for.
"But she was brave, despite her trouble, and she determined to go on and"
gain some village. She took her baby in her arms and the little one by
"the hand, and started on her journey."
"And for a time all went well, till at last she came to a stream. It was"
"not very deep, but it was too deep for the little boy to wade, for it"
"came up to his neck, and his mother was not strong enough to carry both"
"at once. So, after considering for a time, she told the elder boy to"
"wait. She would cross and put the baby on the far side, and return for"
him.
"'Be good,' she said; 'be good, and stay here quietly till I come back;'"
and the boy promised.
The stream was deeper and swifter than she thought; but she went with
"great care and gained the far side, and put the baby under a tree a"
"little distance from the bank, to lie there while she went for the other"
"boy. Then, after a few minutes' rest, she went back."
"She had got to the centre of the stream, and her little boy had come"
"down to the margin to be ready for her, when she heard a rush and a cry"
"should not reach the men around; ""these, when they get there, will think"
of nothing but plunder. As if rags and diamonds and gold were worth
"venturing one's life for. But I desire death--death--death, do you hear?"
"To see the Italian woman and her paramour pleading for their lives, one"
"wailing over against the other, on their knees. Oh, I know them and the"
brat they call the little Queen! To-night they shall lie dead under my
"hands--with this--with this!"""
And the girl flashed a razor-keen blade out of her red waistband. She
thrust the hilt forward into the Sergeant's hands as if in token of
fealty.
"""See,"" she said, touching the edge lovingly, ""is it not sharp? Will it"
"not kill surely and swiftly? For months I have sharpened it--ah, and"
"to-night it will give me my desire!"""
"It was the Sergeant's belief that the girl was mad, nevertheless he"
"watched her with his usual quiet scrutiny, the power of which she"
evidently felt. For she avoided his eyes and hastened on with her story
before he had time to cross-question her.
"""Why do I hate them? I see the question on your lips. Because the"
Italian woman hath taken away my father and slain my mother--slain her
as truly and with far sharper agony than she herself shall know when I
"set this knife to her throat. I am the daughter of Muñoz, and I swore"
revenge on the man and on the woman both when I closed my mother's eyes.
"My mother's heart was broken. Ah, you see, she was weak--not like me! It"
would take a hundred like the Neapolitan to break my heart; and as for
"the man, though he were thrice my father, he should beg his life in"
"vain."""
"She snatched her knife jealously out of his hand, tried its edge on the"
"was a curious hush--a new thing in their struggle, and one that seemed"
surcharged with calamity. After a moment Colonel Carmichael looked up.
"He was many years the senior of his companions, but just then there"
"seemed no difference in years between them. They were three wan,"
"haggard men, weakened with hunger, exhausted with sleepless watching."
That week had killed the youth in two of them.
"""Geoffries has just given me this,"" Carmichael said. ""It is a list of"
"our provisions. We have enough food, but there is no fresh water. The"
enemy has cut off the supply. We could not expect them to do
"otherwise."" He waited, and then, as neither spoke, he went on: ""I have"
"spoken with the others. You know, gentlemen, we can not go on another"
"twenty-four hours without water. We have made a good fight for it, but"
"this is the end. We must look the fact in the face."""
"""Surely they must know at headquarters what a state we are in--"""
Saunders began.
The Colonel shrugged his shoulders.
"""No doubt they know, but they can not help in time. This is not a"
petty frontier business. It is something worse--a rising with a leader.
"A rising with a leader is a lengthy business to tackle, and it"
"requires its victims. In this case we are the victims."" He smiled"
"grimly. ""We have only one thing left to do--make a dash for it while we"
have the strength. You must know as well as I do that there is
"scarcely anything worth calling a hope, but it's a more agreeable way"
of dying than being starved out like rats and then butchered like
"sheep. I know these devils."" He glanced around the shadowy room with a"
"curious light in his eyes. ""My best friend was murdered in this room,"""
"he added. ""Personally, I prefer a fair fight in the open."""
Steve put it into words after his fashion. 'It must be a big place we
"are going to,' he said, about noon of the second day, 'or who is to"
"eat all this? And do you mark, Master Martin? We meet no one coming"
back. All go south. This place Nuremberg that they talk of must be
worth seeing.'
"'It should be,' I said."
And after that the excitement of the march began to take hold of me. I
"began to think and wonder, and look forward, with an eagerness I did"
"not understand, to the issues of this."
"We lay a night at Bamberg, where the crowd and confusion and the"
stress of people were so great that Steve would have it we had come to
"Nuremberg. And certainly I had never known such a hurly-burly, nor"
heard of it except at the great fair at Dantzic. The night after we
"lay at Erlangen, which we found fortified, trenched, and guarded, with"
"troops lying in the square, and the streets turned into stables. From"
that place to Nuremberg was a matter of ten miles only; but the press
was so great on the road that it took us a good part of the day to
ride from one to the other. In the open country on either side of the
way strong bodies of horse and foot were disposed. It seemed to me
that here was already an army and a camp.
"But when late in the afternoon we entered Nuremberg itself, and viewed"
"the traffic in the streets, and the endless lines of gabled houses,"
"the splendid mansions and bridges, the climbing roofs and turrets and"
"spires of this, the greatest city in Germany, then we thought little"
of all we had seen before. Here thousands upon thousands rubbed
shoulders in the streets; here continuous boats turned the river into
solid land. Here we were told were baked every day a hundred thousand
"“Fine man,” commented the younger man aloud. “Hope I do run into him"
"again. Meanwhile, however, the rear isn’t coming along half quick"
"enough, and I haven’t seen a darn thing all afternoon of the wangan. I"
hope nothing’s happened to it and the grub. That would be one awful
blow!”
It was one that was spared him. Within half an hour the clumsy scow hove
"in sight. It tied up to the bank a little later, and before dark"
preparations for supper were going on merrily.
Bob did not get in till later. Assured that all was well with the cook
"and his staff, he went on downstream to see how Peters and his gang were"
progressing. On his return he discovered a stranger warming himself by
"the drying fire. He looked like an old-time woodsman, and the instant"
"Bainbridge appeared he was on his feet, extracting an envelope from the"
interior of his hat.
"“From Mr. Tweedy, sir.”"
The young lumberman ripped it open without a premonition of the blow in
store for him. It was natural for Tweedy to write. He would be reporting
"his success in the matter of credit, of course, and probably gloating"
over the amount of manufactured lumber he had sold in so short a time.
Bainbridge noted that it had been written in the Bangor office the night
"before. Then, settling himself by the fire, he proceeded to read:"
"Dear Bobby: It’s all up with us, boy. We’re done, and we may as well"
admit it first as last and make what terms we can with the gang. I
can’t get credit anywhere. Crane’s been ahead of me and spilled the
"beans each time. What’s more, Gastich absolutely refuses to renew that"
"note. Says he must have the cash for some stocks he’s carrying, and"
"all that; but you know what it means. It’s due in less than a week,"
opportunity of trying those boots. Meanwhile he used to talk about
"them at meals, and he would polish them up every night before he went"
to bed.  When the great day came for the first trial of them to be
"made, he took a patronising farewell of his wife and family, ignored"
"the many eager noses pressed against the upper windows of the Palace,"
"and sailed off.  The motion, as perhaps you know, is a little"
"disquieting at first, but one soon gets used to it.  After that it is"
fascinating. He had gone some two thousand miles before he realised
that there might be a difficulty about finding his way back.  The
difficulty proved at least as great as he had anticipated. For the
rest of that day he toured backwards and forwards across the country;
and it was by the merest accident that a very angry King shot in
through an open pantry window in the early hours of the morning.  He
removed his boots and went softly to bed. . . .
"It was, of course, a lesson to him.  He decided that in the future he"
"must proceed by a recognised route, sailing lightly from landmark to"
landmark.  Such a route his Geographers prepared for him--an early
"morning constitutional, of three hundred miles or so, to be taken ten"
times before breakfast.  He gave himself a week in which to recover
his nerve and then started out on the first of them.
"[Illustration: _""Most extraordinary,"" said the King_]"
"Now the Kingdom of Euralia adjoined that of Barodia, but whereas"
"Barodia was a flat country, Euralia was a land of hills.  It was"
"natural then that the Court Geographers, in search of landmarks,"
"should have looked towards Euralia; and over Euralia accordingly,"
"about the time when cottage and castle alike were breakfasting, the"
King of Barodia soared and dipped and soared and dipped again.

"Whereupon, though the connection of idea is not obvious, Rollo"
remembered the moment when he had faced the black muzzles of Cabrera's
"muskets in the chill of the morning, and the bitter regret which had"
"then arisen to his mind. Out there in the dark of the palace-garden,"
death fronted him as really though not perhaps so immediately. He
"resolved quickly that he should not have the same regret again, if the"
worst came to the worst. There was no one in the alcove where Concha had
"found him. The Queen-Regent had disappeared to her suite of rooms, and"
thither after a time Señor Muñoz had followed her. The rest were at that
moment being placed in their various posts by the Sergeant according to
Rollo's directions.
So he stooped quickly and kissed Concha upon the mouth.
It was strange. The girl's inevitable instinct on such matters seemed to
have deserted her. In a somewhat wide experience Concha could always
"tell to a second when an attempt of this kind was due. Most women can,"
"and if they are kissed it is because they want to be. (In which, sayeth"
"the Wise Man, is great wisdom!) A fire-alarm rings in their brain with"
"absolute certainty, giving them time to evite the conflagration by a"
healthy douche of cold water. But Rollo the Firebrand again proved
himself the Masterly Incalculable. Or else--but who could suspect
Concha?
"It is, again sayeth the Wise Man, the same with kicking a dog. The brute"
sees the kick coming before a muscle is in motion. He watches the eye of
his opponent and is forearmed. He vanisheth into space. But when Rollo
"interviewed an animal in this fashion, he kicked first and thought"
"afterwards. Hence no sign of his intention appeared in his eye, and the"
dog's yelp arrived almost as a surprise to himself.
"The cooks served out the greasy stew as quickly as they could, but we"
were so tired and ill-tempered that we shouted abuse at them without
"reason and without being provoked, and banged our plates and tins. The"
"war, the advance, the slaughter were forgotten. We were conscious of"
"nothing but weariness, stiffness, and petty irritation."
The following day we marched to a ration dump. The wooden cases of
"rations were piled up in gigantic cubes, so that the entire dump looked"
"like a town of windowless, wooden buildings. We formed one long file"
"that circled slowly past the stacks, each man taking one case on to his"
shoulder or back and carrying it to the train. And so we circled round
and round throughout the monotonous day.
"In the evening I did not wait in the dinner queue, but went to the St."
Martin. It was kept by an old woman and her two daughters. They were
tortured by anxiety:
"""Les Allemands vont venir ici--de Shermans come heer?"" they asked. But I"
"knew no more than they did. I told them, against my own conviction, that"
"the German advance would be held up, but they remained anxious. The"
uproar of the cannonade was louder than ever. All the windows of the
"building shook and rattled. The old woman muttered: ""'Tis niet goet,"
"'tis niet goet,"" and the elder daughter echoed: ""Oh, 'tiss no bon, 'tiss"
"no bon."""
Two British officers entered. They looked round and saw that private
soldiers were sitting at the tables. But the St. Martin was the biggest
"estaminet in the village and provided the best wines and coffees, so"
"they stood in the doorway, undecided what to do. They asked one of the"
girls if there was a restaurant for officers in the neighbourhood. She
"answered: ""No--no restaurant for officeerss--you come heer--privates,"
"zey no hurt you--privates, officeerss, all same."""
"dead within him. If a man has lived a wicked life, he dies a wicked man,"
and no wicked man can obtain the perfect rest of the sinless dead.
Heaven is shut to him. But if heaven is shut it is not shut for ever; if
"hell may perhaps open to him it is only for a time, only till he is"
purified and washed from the stain of his sins; and then he can begin
"again, and have another chance to win heaven. If there is no immediate"
"heaven there is no eternal hell, and in due time all will reach heaven;"
"all will have learnt, through suffering, the wisdom the Buddha has shown"
"to us, that only by a just life can men reach the Great Peace even as he"
did.
So that if Buddhism has none of the consolation for the dying man that
"Christianity holds out, in the hope of heaven, so it has none of the"
threats and terrors of our faith. There is no fear of an angry Judge--of
a Judge who is angry.
"And yet when I came to think over the matter, it seemed to me that"
surely there must be something to calm him in the face of death. If
"Buddhism does not furnish this consolation, he must go elsewhere for it."
"And I was not satisfied, because I could find nothing in the sacred"
"books about a man's death, that therefore the creed of the people had"
"ignored it. A living creed must, I was sure, provide for this somehow."
"So I went to a friend of mine, a Burman magistrate, and I asked him:"
"'When a man is dying, what does he try to think of? What do you say to"
"comfort him that his last moments may be peace? The monks do not come, I"
know.'
"'The monks!' he said, shaking his head; 'what could they do?'"
I did not know.
thought; and he sent his light craft spinning rapidly up the stream as
the questions formed themselves.
It was an exquisite summer morning.  The bells in the many towers and
steeples of the city had chimed the hour of five.  The sun had long been
"up, yet the glamour and glory of the new-born day still lay upon the"
sleeping city and the dewy meadows of the opposite shore.  Grey rowed on
"rapidly, yet drinking in the beauty of all he saw.  He knew not how far"
he had rowed; he had lost count of his surroundings; he was absorbed in
"a deep reverie, when he was suddenly brought up breathless and wondering"
by the sound of a voice singing—a voice so clear and sweet and true that
"he asked himself whether it could be any creature of earth that sang, or"
whether it might be some nymph or mermaid such as sailors spoke of in
their wondrous tales.
"He gazed about him.  He saw that he was passing a garden, and that a"
group of weeping willows overhung the water at this spot.  The singing
"seemed to come from thence.  Burning curiosity possessed him, and he"
"very slowly and softly rowed himself onwards, till the prow of his boat"
met the drooping boughs with a soft rustle.  The song ceased suddenly.
"Grey turned in his seat, and drew himself within the sheltering shade;"
"as he did so, a quick exclamation broke from him.  He dropped his oars"
"as he exclaimed,—"
"""The Lady Geraldine!"""
*      *      *      *      *
How had it come about?  Grey never could have said.  But now it was all
told—the story of his chequered life.  She had been silent at the
"first—not exactly resentful of his intrusion, not unwilling to let him"
"have speech of her again, but quiet, with a maidenly reserve and dignity"
"aseptics, for, ""after that he had heated his Ax red hot in the Fire,"
cauteriz'd the Wound but not with so much Art as he perform'd the other
Part for he so burnt the Flesh distant from the Place of Amputation that
"it had like to have mortify'd."" Taylor was tried and condemned to death at"
"Boston on May 12th, 1714, but for some reason not explained was reprieved."
"TEACH, CAPTAIN EDWARD, or THATCH, or THACH, _alias_ DRUMMOND, _alias_"
BLACKBEARD. Arch-pirate.
"A Bristol man who settled in Jamaica, sailing in privateers, but not in"
the capacity of an officer.
"In 1716, Teach took to piracy, being put in command of a sloop by the"
"pirate Benjamin Hornigold. In 1717, Hornigold and Teach sailed together"
"from Providence towards the American coast, taking a billop from Havana"
and several other prizes. After careening their vessels on the coast of
"Virginia, the pirates took a fine French Guineaman bound to Martinico;"
"this ship they armed with forty guns, named her the _Queen Ann's Revenge_,"
and Blackbeard went aboard as captain. Teach now had a ship that allowed
"him to go for larger prizes, and he began by taking a big ship called the"
"_Great Allen_, which he plundered and then set fire to. A few days later,"
"Teach was attacked by H.M.S. _Scarborough_, of thirty guns, but after a"
"sharp engagement lasting some hours, the pirate was able to drive off the"
King's ship.
The next ship he met with was the sloop of that amateur pirate and
"landsman, Major Stede Bonnet. Teach and Bonnet became friends and sailed"
"together for a few days, when Teach, finding that Bonnet was quite"
"ignorant of maritime matters, ordered the Major, in the most high-handed"
"way, to come aboard his ship, while he put another officer in command of"
"Bonnet's vessel. Teach now took ship after ship, one of which, with the"
"If the transients were entranced by the fascinating Aileen, the"
regulars were her adorers. There was much rivalry among many of the
steady customers. Aileen could have had an engagement every evening. At
least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance. One
stout gentleman whom she and Tildy had privately christened “The Hog”
"presented her with a turquoise ring. Another one known as “Freshy,” who"
"rode on the Traction Company’s repair wagon, was going to give her a"
poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the Ninth.
And the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a
stock broker asked her to go to “Parsifal” with him.
"“I don’t know where this place is,” said Aileen while talking it over"
"with Tildy, “but the wedding-ring’s got to be on before I put a stitch"
"into a travelling dress—ain’t that right? Well, I guess!”"
"But, Tildy!"
"In steaming, chattering, cabbage-scented Bogle’s there was almost a"
"heart tragedy. Tildy with the blunt nose, the hay-coloured hair, the"
"freckled skin, the bag-o’-meal figure, had never had an admirer. Not a"
man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the
restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast-hunger for
food. None of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of
"wit. None of them loudly “jollied” her of mornings as they did Aileen,"
"accusing her, when the eggs were slow in coming, of late hours in the"
company of envied swains. No one had ever given her a turquoise ring or
"invited her upon a voyage to mysterious, distant “Parsifal.”"
"Tildy was a good waitress, and the men tolerated her. They who sat at"
her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare;
and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise-flavoured
the Kalè Valley. There the buffaloes are turned out into the jungle for
"eight months in the year, and are only caught for ploughing and carting."
"Naturally they are quite wild; in fact, many of them are the offspring"
of wild bulls.
"The Burmans, too, are very fond of dogs. Their villages are full of"
"dogs; but, as far as I know, they never use them for anything, and they"
are never trained to do anything. They are supposed to be useful as
"watch-dogs, but I do not think they are very good even at that. I have"
"surrounded a village before dawn, and never a dog barked, and I have"
heard them bark all night at nothing.
But when a Burman sees a fox-terrier or any English dog his delight is
"unfeigned. When we first took Upper Burma, and such sights were rare,"
half a village would turn out to see the little 'tail-less' dog trotting
"along after its master. And if the terrier would 'beg,' then he would"
"win all hearts. I am not only referring to children, but to grown men"
and women; and then there is always something peculiarly childlike and
frank in these children of the great river.
"Only to-day, as I was walking up the bank of the river in the early"
"dawn, I heard some Burman boatmen discussing my fox-terrier. They were"
"about fifteen yards from the shore, poling their boat up against the"
"current, which is arduous work; and as I passed them my little dog ran"
"down the bank and looked at them across the water, and they saw her."
"'See now,' said one man to another, pausing for a moment with his pole"
"in his hand--'see the little white dog with the brown face, how wise she"
looks!'
"'And how pretty!' said a man steering in the stern. 'Come!' he cried,"
holding out his hand to it.
a translation of an account of the payments for kaloma making.
ACCOUNT OF THE KALOMA MAKING
Supposing some man from inland lives in Kiriwina or in Luba
or in one of the villages nearby; he wants a katudababile. He
would request an expert fisherman who knows how to dive for
"kaloma. This man agrees; he dives, he dives ... till it is"
"sufficient; his vataga (large folding basket) is already full,"
"this man (the inlander) hears the rumour; he, the master of the"
"kaloma (that is, the man for whom the necklace will be made) says:"
"""Good! I shall just have a look!"" He would come, he would see,"
he would not give any vakapula payment. He (here the Sinaketan
"diver is meant) would say: ""Go, tomorrow, I shall break the shell,"
"come here, give me vakapula."" Next day, he (the inlander) would"
"cook food, he would bring, he would give vakapula; he (the diver)"
"would break the shell. Next day, the same. He (the inlander) would"
"give the vakapula, he (the diver) would break the shell. Supposing"
"the breaking is already finished, he (the diver) would say:"
"""Good! already the breaking is finished, I shall polish."" Next"
"day, he (the inlander) would cook food, would bring bananas,"
"coco-nut, betel-nut, sugar cane, would give it as vakapula;"
"this man (the diver) polishes. The polishing already finished,"
"he would speak: ""Good! To-morrow I shall drill."" This man (the"
"inlander) would bring food, bananas, coco-nuts, sugar cane,"
"he would give it as vakapula: it would be abundant, for soon"
"already the necklace will be finished. The same, he would give a"
"big vakapula on the occasion of the rounding up of the cylinder,"
"for soon everything will be finished. When finished, we thread it"
"on a string, we wash it. (Note the change from the third singular"
"into the first plural). We give it to our wife, we blow the conch"
"directed to the political aspect of the situation, he acknowledged the"
gravity of the disclosure. But honestly he could not pretend to think it
a thing which should alter or lessen the esteem or love in which
Medland's friends held him. And even if the original act were seriously
"worthy of blame, the lapse of years made present severity as"
"unreasonable as it would be unkind. In vain Medland reminded him that,"
"let the act be as old and long past as it would, the consequences"
remained.
"""What!"" Norburn cried, ""would any one think the worse of Daisy? The more"
"fools they!"" and he laughed cheerfully, adding, ""I only wish she'd let"
"me show her I think none the worse of her. Why, it's preposterous, sir!"""
"""Preposterous or not,"" answered Medland, ""half the people in the place"
will let her know the difference. I may agree with you--God knows how I
"should like to be able to!--but there's no blinking the fact. Well, I"
"must tell her."""
"He recollected telling the same story to the other woman he loved, and"
"he shrank in sudden dread, lest his daughter should say what Alicia had"
"said, ""To me it is--horrible!"" The words echoed in his brain. ""Ah, I"
"can't speak of it,"" she had cried, and the gesture of her hand as she"
repelled him lived before his eyes again. Surely Daisy would not do that
to him!
"""I should be like Lear--without a grievance,"" he said to himself, with"
"a wry smile. ""The very height of tragedy!"""
It was near midnight before he put away his work. Norburn had left him
"alone two hours before, and he rose now, laid down his pipe, and went to"
look for his daughter in her little sitting-room. His heart was very
heavy; he must make her understand now why a man who made love to her
to the exclusion of all other duties. This telegram informs me that a
"parcel has been handed in at Carlisle and the bearer arrested."""
"""Excellent!"" I cried. ""My time is at your disposal, Dawson. We shall"
"now get full light."""
He sat down and scribbled a reply wire directing the parcel and its
"bearer to be brought to him with all speed. ""They should arrive in two"
"or three hours,"" said he, ""and in the meantime we will tackle the"
draughtsman who made that plan of the battleship. Good-bye Mrs.
"Copplestone, and thank you very much for your hospitality. Your"
"husband goes with me."" My wife shook hands with Dawson, and politely"
saw him off the premises. She has said little to me since about his
"visit, but I do not think that she wishes ever to meet with him again."
"Little Jane, who kissed him once more at parting, is still attached to"
the memory of her colonel.
*       *       *       *       *
"Dawson led me to the private office at the Central Police Station,"
"which was his temporary headquarters, and sent for the dossier of the"
"locked up draughtsman. ""I have here full particulars of him,"" said he,"
"""and a verbatim note of my examination."" I examined the photograph"
"attached, which represented a bearded citizen of harmless aspect; over"
"his features had spread a scared, puzzled look, with a suggestion in"
it of pathetic appeal. He looked like a human rabbit caught in an
unexpected and uncomprehended trap. It was a police photograph. Then I
"began to read the dossier, but got no farther than the first"
"paragraph. In it was set out the man's name, those of his wife and"
"children, his employment, record of service, and so on. What arrested"
"my researches was the maiden name of the wife, which, in accordance"
"with the northern custom, had been entered as a part of her legal"
clinging to hope.
"But when another quarter had gone by, doubt became conviction. I had"
been fooled! Either some one who had seen me loitering at Krapp's in
"the morning and heard my tale had gone straight off, and played me"
this trick; or--Gott im Himmel!--or I had been lured here that I might
be out of the way at home.
"That thought, which should have entered my thick head an hour before,"
"sped me from the street, as if it had been a very catapult. Before I"
reached the corner I was running; and I ran through street after
"street, sweating with fear. But quickly as I went, my thoughts"
outpaced me. My lady was alone save for her women. The men were
"drilling, the Waldgrave was in the camp. The crowded state of the"
"streets at sunset, and the number of strangers who thronged the city"
"favoured certain kinds of crime; in a great crowd, as in a great"
"solitude, everything is possible."
"I had this in my mind. Judge, then, of my horror, when, as I"
"approached the Ritter Strasse, I became aware of a dull, roaring"
"sound; and hastening to turn the corner, saw a large mob gathered in"
"front of our house, and filling the street from wall to wall. The"
"glare of torches shone on a thousand upturned faces, and flamed from a"
"hundred casements. At the windows, on the roofs, peering over"
"balconies and coping-stones and gables, and looking out of doorways"
"were more faces, all red in the torchlight. And all the time as the"
"smoking light rose and fell, the yelling, as it seemed to me, rose and"
"fell with it--now swelling into a stern roar of exultation, now"
"sinking into an ugly, snarling noise, above which a man might hear his"
neighbour speak.
"I seized the first I came to--a man standing on the skirts of the mob,"
Tervueren road they met numbers of peasant refugees in carts and on
"foot, driving cattle, geese or pigs towards the capital; urging on"
the tugging dogs with small carts and barrows loaded with personal
"effects, trade-goods, farm produce, or crying children. All of them"
"had a distraught, haggard appearance and were constantly looking"
"behind them. From the east, indeed, came the distant sounds of"
explosions and intermittent rifle firing. Mrs. Warren was blanched
"with fear, her cheeks a dull peach colour. She questioned the people"
"in French and Flemish, but they only answered vaguely in raucous"
"voices: ""Les Allemands!"" ""De Duitscher."""
"One old woman, however, had flung herself down by the roadside,"
while her patient dog lay between the shafts of the little cart till
she should be pleased to go on. She was more communicative and told
"Mrs. Warren a tale too horrible to be believed, about husband, son,"
"son-in-law all killed, daughter violated and killed too, cottage in"
"flames, livestock driven off. Recovering from her exhaustion she"
"rose and shook herself. ""I've no business to be here. I should be"
with _them_. I was just packing this cart for the market when it
happened. Why did I go away? Oh for shame! I'll go back--to
"_them_..."" And forthwith she turned the dog round and trudged the"
same way they were going.
At last they came opposite the courtyard of the Villa and saw the
lawn and gravel sweep full of helmeted soldiers in green-grey
"uniform, their bodies hung with equipment--bags, great-coats,"
"rolled-up blankets, trench spades, cartridge bandoliers. Vivie"
"jumped down quickly, said to her mother in a low firm voice: ""Leave"
"everything to me. Say as little as possible."" Then to the farmer:"

"chez vous, je n'en doute. Nous réglerons notre compte tout-à"
"l'heure.... Pour le moment, adieu."" She clutched the handbags of"
have been not a whit more perplexed at the prospect. As for John he had
the sensation of living in a fantastic dream. A child of six would have
"been a more practical ally. In the course of befogged conversation,"
"however, it was arranged that Miss Lindon should transfer to the new"
"house her worldly belongings, of which she was to give him an inventory,"
"including Dandy and Dickie and her maid Phoebe, a most respectable"
"girl of Baptist upbringing, who had been cruelly jilted by a prosperous"
"undertaker in the neighborhood, whom, if you had seen him conducting a"
"funeral, you would have thought as serious and God-fearing a man as the"
"clergyman himself; which showed how hypocritical men could be, and how"
"you ought never to trust to appearances. It was also settled that, as"
soon as Unity could be rescued from the guardianship of the orphanage
authorities and comfortably installed in a convalescent home by the
"seaside, Miss Lindon would journey thither in order to make her ward's"
acquaintance. In the meanwhile John would go house-hunting.
"“Walter Herold will help me,” said John."
"“That's your friend who acts, is n't it?” said Miss Lindon. “I have n't"
"any objection to theatres myself. In fact, I often used to go to see"
Irving when I was young. You meet quite a nice class of people in the
dress-circle. But I don't think ladies ought to go on the stage. I hope
Mr. Herold won't put such an idea into Unity's head.”
"“I don't think he will,” said John."
“Young girls are sometimes so flighty. My old friend Mrs. Willcox had
"a daughter who went on the stage, and she married an actor, and now has"
"twelve children, and lives in Cheshire. I was hearing about her only the"
other day. I suppose Unity will have to be taught music and drawing and
French like any other young lady.”

The train was running over the malarial-looking sea-plain--past the
"down-at-heel palm trees, past the mosque-looking buildings. At a level"
crossing the woman crossing-keeper darted out vigorously with her red
flag. And we rambled into the first village. It was built of sun-dried
"brick-adobe houses, thick adobe garden-walls, with tile ridges to keep"
off the rain. In the enclosures were dark orange trees. But the
"clay-coloured villages, clay-dry, looked foreign: the next thing to mere"
"earth they seem, like fox-holes or coyote colonies."
"Looking back, one sees Cagliari bluff on her rock, rather fine, with the"
thin edge of the sea's blade curving round. It is rather hard to believe
"in the real sea, on this sort of clay-pale plain."

But soon we begin to climb to the hills. And soon the cultivation begins
"to be intermittent. Extraordinary how the heathy, moor-like hills come"
near the sea: extraordinary how scrubby and uninhabited the great spaces
"of Sardinia are. It is wild, with heath and arbutus scrub and a sort of"
"myrtle, breast-high. Sometimes one sees a few head of cattle. And then"
"again come the greyish arable-patches, where the corn is grown. It is"
"like Cornwall, like the Land's End region. Here and there, in the"
"distance, are peasants working on the lonely landscape. Sometimes it is"
"one man alone in the distance, showing so vividly in his black-and-white"
"costume, small and far-off like a solitary magpie, and curiously"
distinct. All the strange magic of Sardinia is in this sight. Among the
"low, moor-like hills, away in a hollow of the wide landscape one"
"solitary figure, small but vivid black-and-white, working alone, as if"
"eternally. There are patches and hollows of grey arable land, good for"
corn. Sardinia was once a great granary.
"exactly how much--or, rather, how little money Slyne had had in his"
"pockets when he went ashore. And, if Slyne had already, within four and"
"twenty hours, been able to turn that over at a profit sufficient to"
"provide himself with a fur coat and diamonds, it might perhaps pay"
"Captain Dove to hear what he had to propose. Slyne, reading all the old"
"man's thoughts, could see that he had decided to temporise."

you'll take it from me again that I'd rather have your room than your

"And at that, Slyne made his next considered move."
"""All right,"" he said in a tone of the most utter contempt. ""That's"

He had evidently lost his own temper at last. And Captain Dove was
visibly pleased with that result of his tactics; as a rule he was better
"able to cope with Slyne on a basis of mutual abuse, heated on both"
sides; Slyne cool and collected had him at a disadvantage.

"hesitate, and approached the loud-voiced old man, holding out their palms"
"and clamoring: ""Money!"" But that did not suit the old man, who entered the"
"car forthwith, urging his companions to hurry. The driver, no doubt"
"thinking of his own tips, felt he would serve his passengers best by"
"driving off with them at once. So off he went. A toot of the horn, and a"

more serious matters on their minds. Olaus for the first time understood
"what he had read in the paper so many times, that the Norwegian elementary"
school is a worthless institution because it does not teach English to the
"children of the lower orders. Here were his boys, losing a handsome tip"
merely because they could not swear back intelligibly at the gentleman
with the northern lights. The boys themselves had also something to think
"about: ""That driver, that scoundrel, that southerner! But just wait!"" They"
had heard that bits of broken bottle were very good for tires....

"I return to her knapsack and her clothes, and the reason why I do so is"
that Eilert is so little to be trusted. I want to count her clothes to

It may seem as though I kept returning to these clothes and thinking about
them; but why should I do that? At any rate it is now evident that I was

"The chief assistant stared, opened a drawer, and pulled forth a slim"

"assistant snatched it from my hand, flashed it back into its place,"
and jumped to attention as Dawson entered. He surveyed us with those

"That evening for the first time in his life, as he pressed through the"
"swing door and descended the three broad steps to the pavement, old Mr."
"Neave felt he was too old for the spring. Spring—warm, eager,"
"restless—was there, waiting for him in the golden light, ready in front"
"of everybody to run up, to blow in his white beard, to drag sweetly on"
"his arm. And he couldn’t meet her, no; he couldn’t square up once more"
"and stride off, jaunty as a young man. He was tired and, although the"
"late sun was still shining, curiously cold, with a numbed feeling all"
"over. Quite suddenly he hadn’t the energy, he hadn’t the heart to stand"
this gaiety and bright movement any longer; it confused him. He wanted
"to stand still, to wave it away with his stick, to say, “Be off with"
you!” Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usual—tipping his
"wide-awake with his stick—all the people whom he knew, the friends,"
"acquaintances, shopkeepers, postmen, drivers. But the gay glance that"
"went with the gesture, the kindly twinkle that seemed to say, “I’m a"
match and more for any of you”—that old Mr. Neave could not manage at
"all. He stumped along, lifting his knees high as if he were walking"
through air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like water. And the
"homeward-looking crowd hurried by, the trams clanked, the light carts"
"clattered, the big swinging cabs bowled along with that reckless,"
defiant indifference that one knows only in dreams....
It had been a day like other days at the office. Nothing special had
happened. Harold hadn’t come back from lunch until close on four. Where
had he been? What had he been up to? He wasn’t going to let his father
"know. Old Mr. Neave had happened to be in the vestibule, saying"
in his repertory.
"""Oh, come, old chap, I bet he didn't,"" observed Captain Heseltine."
"""We've seen him, you know."""
Duncombe laughed good-humouredly.
"""At any rate he made Kilshaw look a little green, and some of the people"
behind called out 'Shame!' and got themselves sat upon. Then they had
Medland up again and twisted him a bit about his acquaintance with
"Gaspard; but the coroner didn't seem to think there was anything in it,"
"and they found murder against Gaspard, and rang down the curtain. And"
when we got outside there was a bit of a rumpus. They hooted Kilshaw and
"cheered Medland, and yelled like mad when a dashed pretty girl drove up"
"in a pony-cart and carried him off. Altogether it wasn't half bad."""
"""Glad you enjoyed yourself,"" observed Captain Heseltine. ""If it amuses"
strangers to see our leading celebrities mixed up in a murder and other
"distressing affairs, it's the least we can do to see that they get it."""
The Captain's facetiousness fell on unappreciative ears. Most of Mr.
Duncombe's audience were too alive to the serious side of the matter to
enjoy it. To them it was another and a very striking scene in the fight
"which had long gone on between Medland and Kilshaw, and had taken a"
fresh and fiercer impetus from the well-remembered day when Medland had
spoken his words about Kilshaw and his race-horses. Nobody doubted that
"Kilshaw had kept this man Benyon, or Benham, as a secret weapon, and"
that the murder had only made the disclosure come earlier. Kilshaw's
"reputation suffered somewhat in the minds of the scrupulous, but his"
"partisans would hear of no condemnation. They said, as he had said, that"
in dealing with a man like Medland it would have been folly not to use
"the weapons fate, or the foe himself by his own misdeeds, offered. As"
"grown to piracy, the northern League gave its main strength to trade by"
sea.
Its special interest for us to-day lies in the fact that it was
"ultra-racial, beginning in 1241 in a pact between the free cities of"
"Lübeck and Hamburg,[715] and finally including Wendish, German, Dutch,"
"French, and even Spanish cities, in fluctuating numbers. The motive to"
"union, as it had need be, was one of mercantile gain. Beginning,"
"apparently, by having each its separate authorised _hansa_ or"
"trading-group in foreign cities, the earlier trading-towns of the group,"
perhaps from the measure of co-operation and fraternity thus forced on
"them abroad,[716] saw their advantage in a special league for the common"
good as a monopoly maintained against outsiders; and this being
"extended, the whole League came to bear the generic name."
See Kohlrausch for the theory that contact in foreign cities is the
"probable cause of the policy of union (_History of Germany_, Eng."
"tr., p. 260; cp. Ashley, _Introd. to Economic History_, i, 104,"
"110). As to the origin of the word, see Stubbs, i, 447, _note_. The"
_hans_ or _hansa_ first appears historically in England as a name
"apparently identical with _gild_; and, starting with a _hansa_ or"
"hanse-house of their own, English cities in some cases are found"
"trading through subordinate _hansas_ in other cities, not only of"
Normandy but of England itself. Thus arose the Flemish Hansa or
"""Hansa of London,"" ignored in so many notices of the better-known"
Hanseatic League. Early in the thirteenth century it included a
number of the towns of Flanders engaged in the English wool-trade;
"and later it numbered at one time seventeen towns, including"
"Chalons, Rheims, St. Quentin, Cambray, and Amiens (Ashley, _Introd."

"Handelspolitik_, 1889, i, 6, citing Varenbergh, _Hist. des"

I did not like to say before my lady what I thought--that the
"Waldgrave was not quite himself, nor to be depended upon; and instead"
I proposed to go forward on foot and learn if anything was amiss. The
"road ran straight down the hill, and the party could scarcely pass me,"
"even in the gloom. If I found all well, I would whistle, and they"
could come on.
"My lady agreed, and, leaving them halted, I started cautiously down"
the hill. The darkness was not extreme; the cloud drift was broken
"here and there, and showed light patches of sky between; I could make"
"out the shapes of things, and more than once took a clump of bushes"
"for a lurking ambush. But halfway down, a line of poplars began to"
"shadow the road on our side, and from that point I might have walked"
"into a regiment and never seen a man. This, the being suddenly alone,"
"and the constant rustling of the leaves overhead, which moved with the"
"slightest air, shook my nerves, and I went very warily, with my heart"
in my mouth and a cry trembling on my lips.
Still I had reached the hillfoot before anything happened. Then I
"stopped abruptly, hearing quite distinctly in front of me the sound of"
footsteps. It was impossible that this could be the sound that the
"Waldgrave had heard, for only one man seemed to be stirring, and he"
"moved stealthily; but I crouched down and listened, and in a moment I"
was rewarded. A dark figure came out of the densest of the shadow and
"stood in the middle of the road. I sank lower, noiselessly. The man"
seemed to be listening.
It flashed into my head that he was a sentry; and I thought how
fortunate it was that I had come on alone.
"Presently he moved again. He stole along the track towards me,"
We were shown everything that we desired to see except the
transmission room and the upper conning tower--the twin holy of holies
"in a commissioned ship--and slipped away, escaping the Captain by a"
"bare two minutes. Which was lucky, as he would probably have had us"
"thrown into the ""ditch."""
"The end of the day was as weariful as the beginning, and we were all"
"glad--especially, I expect, Mrs. Cary--to go early to bed. That"
"ill-used lady, to whom we could disclose nothing of our anxieties,"
must have found us wretched company.
We had finished breakfast the next morning--the Saturday of Dawson's
gamble--and were sitting on Cary's big fireguard talking of every
"subject, except the one which had kept us awake at night, when a"
servant entered and announced that a soldier was at the door with a
"message from Mr. Dawson. ""Show him in,"" almost shouted Cary, and I"
"jumped to my feet, stirred for once into a visible display of"
eagerness.
"A Marine came in, dressed in the smart blue sea kit that I love; upon"
his head the low flat cap of his Corps. He gave us a full swinging
"salute, and jumped to attention with a click of his heels. He looked"
"about thirty-five, and wore a neatly trimmed dark moustache. His hair,"
"also very dark, was cropped close to his head. Standing there with his"
"hands upon the red seams of his trousers, his chest well filled out,"
"and his face weather tanned, he looked a proper figure of a sea-going"
"soldier. ""Mr. Cary, sir,"" he said, in a flat, monotonous orderly's"
"voice, ""Major Boyle's compliments, and could you and your friend come"
down to the Police Station to meet him and Chief Inspector Dawson. I
"have a taxi-cab at the door, sir."""
"""Certainly,"" cried Cary; ""in two minutes we shall be ready."""
"RACKAM, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ CALICO JACK."
Served as quartermaster in Captain Vane's company. On one occasion Vane
"refused to fight a big French ship, and in consequence was dismissed his"
"ship and marooned on an uninhabited island off the coast of America, while"
the crew elected Rackam to be their captain in his place. This was on
"November 24th, 1718, and on the very first day of his command he had the"
good fortune to take and plunder several small vessels.
"Off the Island of Jamaica they took a Madeira ship, and found an old"
"friend on board as a passenger--a Mr. Hosea Tisdell, who kept a tavern in"
"the island, and they treated him with great respect."
"Christmas Day coming, the pirates landed on a small island to celebrate"
"this festival in a thorough manner, carousing and drinking as long as the"
"liquor lasted, when they sailed away to seek more. Their next prize was a"
"strange one. On coming alongside a ship, she surrendered, and the pirates"
"boarding her to examine her cargo, found it to consist of thieves from"
"Newgate on their way to the plantations. Taking two more vessels, Rackam"
"sailed to the Bahama Islands, but the Governor, Captain Woodes Rogers,"
"sent a sloop, which took away their prizes."
"Rackam now sailed his ship to a snug little cove he knew of in Cuba, where"
he had more than one lady acquaintance. Here the pirates were very happy
until all their provisions and money was spent. Just as they were about to
"sail, in comes a Spanish Guarda del Costa with a small English sloop which"
"they had recently taken. Rackam was now in a very awkward position, being"
"unable to get past the Spaniard, and all he could do was to hide behind a"
"small island. Night came on, and when it was dark Rackam put all his crew"
"into a boat, rowed quietly up to the sloop, clambered aboard, threatening"
"terms I don't think they could have agreed for ten minutes. As it was,"
"they had serious differences at times, which, however, I believe were"
all ultimately and happily adjusted.'
"The visits to his uncle's home, and the attractive young lady whom he"
"there met, must have largely contributed to Ferrier's happiness in"
these years of mental fermentation. Such times come in many men's lives
"when youth is turning into manhood, and powers are wakening up within"
that seem as though they would lead us we know not whither. And so it
may have been with Ferrier. But he was endowed with considerable
"calmness and self-command, combined with a confidence in his powers"
sufficient to carry him through many difficulties that might otherwise
"have got the better of him. Wilson's home, Elleray, near the Lake of"
"Windermere, was the centre of a circle of brilliant stars. Ferrier"
"recollected, while still a lad of seventeen years of age, meeting there"
"at one time, in the summer of 1825, Scott, Wordsworth, Lockhart, and"
"Canning, a conjunction difficult to beat.[4] Once more, we are told,"
"and on a sadder occasion, he came into association with the greatest"
Scottish novelist. 'It was on that gloomy voyage when the suffering man
"was conveyed to Leith from London, on his return from his ill-fated"
"foreign journey. Mr. Ferrier was also a passenger, and scarcely dared"
to look on the almost unconscious form of one whose genius he so warmly
admired.' The end was then very near.
"[4] This meeting occurred after the Irish tour of Scott,"
"Miss Anne Scott, and Lockhart, when they visited Wilson at"
"Elleray. Canning was staying at Storre, in the"
neighbourhood.
"Professor Ferrier's daughter tells us that long after, in the summer of"
"1856, the family went to visit the English Lakes, the centre of"
"attraction being Elleray, Mr. Ferrier's old home and birthplace. 'The"
him and played square. For that reason he would be equally square and
"aboveboard, and let this dirty work alone."
"That was what he _had_ decided, but now----"
"He gritted his teeth, glared fiercely around, and came to an abrupt"
stop. Every instinct of the riverman was aroused. On his left the river
dropped over short falls into a narrow gorge. It was a spot where things
"were likely to happen at any time, and where a man or two should have"
"been stationed continually. Curly knew, in fact, that there had been men"
"here all morning. They had been called away for some purpose, leaving"
the little falls unguarded. And as he stood there his practiced eyes
told him that he was beholding the very start of a jam.
"A log, plunging over the falls, upended. Another was thrust under it. A"
"third and fourth, coming down together, caught on the obstruction, all"
being held by some stones rising midstream. Before the current could
tear them loose several more timbers were forced against the mass which
"was piling up so swiftly, bridging to the opposite shore."
"To carry out that angry resolve of a minute or two ago, Curly should"
"have rolled himself another cigarette, and watched the growing damage"
with a sardonic smile. He did nothing of the sort. For a flash he had
"forgotten his grievance, and was a “river hog,” pure and simple. The"
stoppage must be broken before it reached the proportions of a real jam.
"There was no one else to do it, and so he leaped to the task without a"
second’s pause for thought.
"Upstream he ran a few feet, his eyes fixed on the surface of the river"
"above the falls. Then he saw what he wanted. An instant later, using his"
"peavey much as a pole vaulter does his pole, he leaped straight out over"
"the water, landed squarely on a big log, and was carried down to the"
where a girl is weaving ceaselessly. All these sounds come into the
"house as if there were no walls at all, but they are unheeded from long"
custom.
The man lies on a low bed with a fine mat spread under him for bedding.
"His wife, his grown-up children, his sister, his brother are about him,"
"for the time is short, and death comes very quickly in the East. They"
"talk to him kindly and lovingly, but they read to him no sacred books;"
they give him no messages from the world to which he is bound; they
whisper to him no hopes of heaven. He is tortured with no fears of
"everlasting hell. Yet life is sweet and death is bitter, and it is hard"
to go; and as he tosses to and fro in his fever there comes in to him an
"old friend, the headman of the village perhaps, with a white muslin"
"fillet bound about his kind old head, and he sits beside the dying man"
and speaks to him.
"'Remember,' he says slowly and clearly, 'all those things that you have"
done well. Think of your good deeds.'
"And as the sick man turns wearily, trying to move his thoughts as he is"
"bidden, trying to direct the wheels of memory, the old man helps him to"
remember.
"'Think,' he says, 'of your good deeds, of how you have given charity to"
"the monks, of how you have fed the poor. Remember how you worked and"
saved to build the little rest-house in the forest where the traveller
"stays and finds water for his thirst. All these are pleasant things, and"
"men will always be grateful to you. Remember your brother, how you"
"helped him in his need, how you fed him and went security for him till"
"he was able again to secure his own living. You did well to him, surely"
that is a pleasant thing.'
[Sidenote: The Footprints of Christ in Stone.]
"About two miles northeast of the Three Fountains, and the same distance"
"from the city, on the Appian Way, stands the Church of St. Sebastian."
"Over an altar on the right, as you enter, the attendant priest, drawing"
"aside a curtain, shows you a slab of dark red stone with two enormous"
"footprints on it. These, we are told, were made by the feet of Christ"
"during an interview with Peter which took place near here, on the site"
of the small Church of Domine Quo Vadis. The story is as follows: After
"the burning of Rome, Nero charged the Christians with having fired"
"the city. Straightway the first persecution broke forth, and many of"
the Christians were put to death with dreadful torture. The survivors
"besought Peter not to expose his life. As he fled along the Appian Way,"
Christ appeared to him travelling towards the city. The fleeing apostle
"exclaimed in amazement, ""_Domine, quo vadis?_"" (Lord, whither goest"
"thou?), to which, with a look of mild sadness, the Saviour replied,"
"""_Venio iterum crucifigi_"" (I come to be crucified a second time), then"
"vanished, whereupon the apostle, ashamed of his weakness, returned to"
"Rome, and shortly afterwards was crucified there himself."
[Sidenote: The Chains of St. Peter.]
Another relic of great interest connected with the same apostle is
"shown in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, and indeed gives"
the church its name. The church is not without interest for other
"reasons. For instance, it possesses portions of the crosses of St."
"Peter and St. Andrew, and we are told that the high altar covers the"
remains of the seven Maccabean brothers. But the basilica is specially
famous for the possession of the greatest masterpiece of sculpture
"since the time of the Greeks--the majestic ""Moses"" of Michelangelo,"
which draws thousands of sightseers who might otherwise never set foot
And then he had gone his way to those who needed him more.
Mrs. Berry knelt by the bedside. Her hands were folded. She had been
"praying, but exhaustion had overcome her, and her quiet, peaceful"
breathing contrasted strangely with the other sounds that filled the
"bungalow. Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice sat huddled close together,"
listening. They could do nothing--not even help the wounded men who
"lay so close to them. Everything was in pitch darkness, and no lights"
"were allowed. They could not go out and help in the stern, relentless"
struggle that was going on about them. They bore the woman's harder
"lot of waiting, inactive, powerless, fighting the harder battle"
against uncertainty and all the horrors of the imagination.
"""I am sorry the regiment has come,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""There"
is no doubt they will be massacred with the rest of us. What are a few
"hundreds against thousands? It is a pity. They are such fine fellows."""
"Her rough, tired voice had a ring of unconquerable pride in it. She"
was thinking of the gallant charge her husband's men had made only two
"weeks before; how they had broken through the wall of the enemy, and,"
"cheering, had rushed to meet the besieged garrison. That had been a"
"moment of rejoicing, transitory and deceptive. Then the wall closed in"
"about them again, and they knew that they were trapped."
"""Perhaps we can hold out till help comes,"" Beatrice said."
She tried not to be indifferent. For the sake of her companions she
"would gladly have felt some desire for life, but in truth it had no"
value for her. She could think of nothing but the evil she had done
and of the atonement that had been denied her. It was to no purpose
that she worked unceasingly for the wounded. The sense of
"responsibility never left her. Each moan, each death-sigh brought the"
leaning right over his patient. I had been conscious of a powerful
"impulse to duck down, but I grasped the table and gave way to the"
impulse so far as to lean slightly forward. This compromise saved me
from any violent expression of fear. The Sister was the only one of us
who showed no sign of fear at all.
The surgeon went on with his work and extracted several fragments of
bone from the injured limb. A few seconds passed and suddenly the
electric light went out in accordance with the orders that decreed that
all lights should be extinguished on the approach of hostile aeroplanes.
The surgeon cursed loudly and the Sister fetched an electric torch which
"she held over the knee. The operation continued, but it was not long"
before anti-aircraft fire broke out once more. Then there was a weird
"bustling, rushing sound, followed by a roar that again shook the theatre"
and rattled the windows. Six explosions followed in rapid succession.
"This time the orderly controlled himself, for he knew the Sister was"
"watching. Nevertheless, his knees trembled violently. The Sister held"
the torch steadily and the surgeon paused for a moment and went on with
the operation as soon as all was quiet.
In a few minutes it was finished. The wound was dressed and bandaged and
the patient carried away.
I stepped out into the clear night. The sky was thronged with glittering
"stars. Everything seemed strangely peaceful. I walked round the station,"
"trying to find out where the bombs had fallen, but nobody knew. I went"
"to the marquee and found Private Trotter sitting there, breathless and"
white. The neighbouring C.C.S. a few hundred yards away had been hit. A
Sister and an orderly had been killed and several patients wounded.
"""It didn't 'alf put me wind up,"" said Trotter, excitedly. ""When the"
first'n drops I lays down flat on the duckboards and one bursts just
remembered then that before going out to look for rooms she had
transferred half the notes from their hiding-place to an inner
pocket. They were still there. But what about her luggage and her
"mother's, and the remainder of the money? In her distress she wrote"
to Gräfin von Stachelberg. Minna came over from her hospital at half
past six in the evening. By that time the doctor had given the
"necessary certificate of the cause of death, and an undertaker had"
come on the scene to make his preparations.
Minna went over to the Hotel Impérial with Vivie. Appearing in her
"Red Cross uniform, she was admitted, announced herself as the Gräfin"
"von Stachelberg, and demanded to know what justification the manager"
could offer for his extraordinary brutality towards these English
"ladies, the result of which had been the death of the elder lady."
The manager replied that inasmuch as the All Highest himself was to
"arrive that very evening to take up his abode at the Hotel Impérial,"
"the hotel premises had been requisitioned, etc., etc. He still"
refused absolutely to allow Vivie to proceed to her room and look
for her money. She might perhaps be allowed to do so when the
Emperor was gone. As to her luggage he would have it sent over to
"the tea-shop. (The money, it might be noted, she never recovered."
There were many things also missing from her mother's trunks and no
satisfaction was ever obtained.)
"So there was Vivie, one dismal, rainy November evening in 1915;"
"homeless, her mother lying dead in a room of this tea-shop, and in"
her own pocket only a matter of thirty thousand francs to provide
for her till the War was over. A thousand pounds in fluctuating
value was all that was left of a nominal twenty thousand of the year
before.
But the financial aspect of the case for the time being did not
"Superior sell her help. Keep the money, lads. If I am not a fool you"
will need it more than the sisterhood of the Holy Innocents before you
"come to your journey's end."""
"And with that she blew them each a dainty kiss, distinguishing no one"
"above the other, dropped a curtsey to the general, whose eyes followed"
"her with more than usual interest, leaped on her white mare and rode"
"off, attended by La Giralda riding astride like a man, in the same"
fashion in which she had arrived.
"So little Concha was gone from his sight, and duty loomed up suddenly"
gaunt and void of interest before Rollo. To risk his life was nothing.
"When he got nearer to the goal, his blood would rise, that he knew. To"
"capture a queen and a regent at one coup, to upset a government, to"
bring a desolating war to an end--these were all in the day's work. But
"why, in the name of all that was sanest and most practical, did his"
heart feel like lead within him and his new dignity turn to Dead Sea
ashes in his mouth?
"It was not long before Cabrera dropped back, that he might talk over"
ways and means with the young colonel. It was clear that the _guerrilla_
chieftain did not believe greatly in the project.
"""I do not understand all this,"" he said; ""it is not my way. What have we"
"to do with taking women and children prisoners? Let us have no truck,"
"barter, or exchange with the government at Madrid except at the point of"
"the bayonet. That is my way of it, and if my advice had been taken"
"before, my master would at this moment have been in the royal palace of"
his ancestors. But these secret embassies in the hands of

Rollo explained such things as the Abbot of Montblanch had made clear to
"perverse, sportsmen's brains tingled and thrilled; they had successfully"
"eluded all the resorts on the way, and arrived here without being caught."
"There was the Blue Peak, like a mast against the sky! They hurried up so"
fast that Solem was hardly able to keep pace with them. They would have
felt for ever disgraced if they had neglected to stand on this admirable
"site of a disaster, this most excellent abyss. Some said it would be a"
lifelong source of regret to them if they did not climb the Blue Peak
"forthwith; others had no desire but to gloat over the lawyer's death fall,"
"and to shout down the abyss, gaping at the echo, and advancing so far out"
on the ledge that they stood with their toes on death.
"But it's an ill wind that blows good to none, and the resort earned a"
"great deal of money. Paul began to revive again, and the furrows in his"
face were smoothed out. A man of worth grows strong and active with good
fortune; in adversity he is defiant. One who is not defiant in adversity
is worth nothing; let him be destroyed! Paul stopped drinking; he even
"began to take an interest in the harvesting, and worked in the field in"
Solem's place. If only he had begun when the weather was still slow and
patient!
But at least Paul began to tackle things in the right spirit again; he
only regretted that he had set aside for the cotters those outlying fields
from which they were used to getting half the hay; this year he would have
"liked to keep it himself. But he had given his word, and there was nothing"
to be done about it.
"Besides, it was raining now. Haymaking had to stop; they could not even"
"stack what had already been gathered. Outside, three cartloads of fodder"
were going to waste.

clearing up of the problem in detection. But he took the whole thing
"to himself, and gloated like a child over his own cleverness. I"
neither obtained from him thanks for my assistance nor apologies for
"his suspicions. It was Dawson, Dawson, all the time. Yet I found his"
egotism and unrelieved vanity extraordinarily interesting. As we sat
together in his room waiting for the Carlisle train to come in he
"discoursed freely to me of his triumphs in detection, his wide-spread"
"system of spying upon spies, his long delayed ""sport"" with some, and"
his ruthless rapid trapping of others. Men are never so interesting as
"when they talk shop, and as a talker of shop Dawson was sublime."

much-wanted friend has himself handed in the parcel at Carlisle--he

"David, the largest interior town of Panama, is the central point of the"
"cattle industry. All around it are woods, or jungles, plentifully"
"interspersed with broad prairies, or llanos, covered with grass, and on"
which no trees grow save here and there a wild fig or a ceibo. Cattle
"graze on the llanos, sleek reddish beasts with spreading horns like our"
Texas cattle. There are no huge herds as on our western ranges. Droves
of from ten to twenty are about the average among the small owners who
rely on the public range for subsistence. The grass is not sufficiently
"nutritious to bring the cattle up to market form, so the small owners"
"sell to the owners of big ranches who maintain potreros, or fattening"
ground sown with better grasses. A range fed steer will fetch $15 to
"$18, and after six or eight months on the potrero it will bring $30 to"
$35 from the cattle shipper at David. Since the cost of feeding a beeve
"for that period is only about one dollar, and as the demand is fairly"
steady the profit of the ranchman is a good one. But like all other
"industries in Panama, this one is pursued in only a retail way. The"
market is great enough to enrich ranchmen who would go into the business
"on a large scale, but for some reason none do."
[Illustration: BOLIVAR PARK AT BOCAS DEL TORO]
Passing from llano to llano the road cuts through the forest which
"towers dense and impenetrable on either side, broken only here and"
there by small clearings made by some native with the indispensable
machete. These in the main are less than four acres. The average
"“She does n't want anything at all,” said the matron, and the girl's"
eyelids fluttered. “She's being spoiled too much as it is already.”
"John bent his heavy brows on the woman. She spoke not shrewishly, not"
"unkindly, merely with lack of love and understanding. He repressed the"
bitter retort that rose to his lips. But at the same time a picture rose
"before him of another sick-room, a dainty sea-chamber open to sun"
"and sky, where pillows of down were not forbidden, where flowers and"
"exquisite colours and shapes gladdened the eye, where Love, great and"
"warm and fulfilling, hovered over the bed. No gulls with round, yellow"
eyes came to the windows of this whitewashed prison with messages
"from the world of air and sea; no Exquisite Auntship, no Great High"
"Favourite, no Lord High Constable, executed their high appointed"
functions; no clock with chimes like a bell swung in a sea-cave told
the hours to this orphan child of misery. He realized in an odd way
"that Stellamaris, too, was an orphan. And he remembered, from the awful"
"evidence, that this child was just over fifteen--Stella's age."
Again rose the picture of the cherished one in her daintily ribboned
"dressing-jacket, as filmy and unsubstantial as if made of sea-foam,"
"with her pure, happy face, her mysterious, brown pools of eyes, her"
hair lovingly brushed to caressing softness; and he looked down on Unity
"Blake. Man though he was, the bit of clean sail-cloth that did duty as a"
nightgown moved his compassion.
He did his best to talk with her awhile; but it was a one-sided
"conversation, as the child could reply only in monosyllables. The matron"
"fidgeted impatiently, and he said good-bye. Her wistful glance followed"
him to the door. Outside he turned.
“There is just one thing I want to say to her.”
He dismounted and left his steed on the bridge. The postern beckoned
"to him. He went in like a man nerved for peril, with sword drawn and"
"shield in readiness. Again he blew his horn. No living being answered,"
no voice broke the silence.
"The refectory was open, the door standing half ajar. Francesco thrust"
it full open with the point of his sword and looked in. A gray light
filtered through the narrow windows. The nuns lay huddled on benches
"and on the floor. Some lay fallen across the settles, others sat with"
their heads fallen forward upon the table; a few had crawled towards
the door and had died in the attempt to escape. The shadow of death
was over the whole.
Francesco's face was as gray as the faces of the dead. There was
"something here, a horror, a mystery, that hurled back the warm courage"
of the heart.
"With frantic despair he rushed from one body to the other, turning the"
"dead faces to the light, fearing every one must be that of his own"
"Ilaria. But Ilaria was not among them; the mystery grew deeper, grew"
"more unfathomable. For a moment, Francesco stood among the dead nuns"
"as if every nerve in his body had been suddenly paralyzed, when his"
"eyes fell upon a crystal chalice, half overturned on the floor. It"
contained the remnants of a clear fluid. He picked it up and held it
to his nostrils. It fell from his nerveless fingers upon the stone and
"broke into a thousand fragments, a thin stream creeping over the"
granite towards the fallen dead. It was a preparation of hemlock and
"bitter almonds. He stared aghast, afraid to move, afraid to call. The"
nuns had poisoned themselves.
"Like a madman he rushed out into the adjoining corridor, hither and"
"thither, in the frantic endeavor to find a trace of Ilaria. Yet not a"
the signal.
But in the increasing noise of the battle his voice already sounded less
"powerfully than before. A letter to Cardinal Albert of Mayence, 19"
"October 1519, of about the same content as that of Frederick of Saxony"
"written in the preceding spring, was at once circulated by Luther's"
"friends; and by the advocates of conservatism, in spite of the usual"
"protestation, 'I do not know Luther', it was made to serve against"
Erasmus.
It became more and more clear that the mediating and conciliatory
position which Erasmus wished to take up would soon be altogether
"untenable. The inquisitor Jacob Hoogstraten had come from Cologne, where"
"he was a member of the University, to Louvain, to work against Luther"
"there, as he had worked against Reuchlin. On 7 November 1519 the Louvain"
"faculty, following the example of that of Cologne, proceeded to take the"
decisive step: the solemn condemnation of a number of Luther's opinions.
"In future no place could be less suitable to Erasmus than Louvain, the"
citadel of action against reformers. It is surprising that he remained
there another two years.
The expectation that he would be able to speak the conciliating word was
paling. For the rest he failed to see the true proportions. During the
first months of 1520 his attention was almost entirely taken up by his
"own polemics with Lee, a paltry incident in the great revolution. The"
desire to keep aloof got more and more the upper hand of him. In June he
writes to Melanchthon: 'I see that matters begin to look like sedition.
"It is perhaps necessary that scandals occur, but I should prefer not to"
"be the author.' He has, he thinks, by his influence with Wolsey,"
"prevented the burning of Luther's writings in England, which had been"
"ordered. But he was mistaken. The burning had taken place in London, as"
early as 12 May.
"all the debate was important, and the hour of the division drew near;"
"and when the question was put and the bell rang, nearly half the House"
"trooped out with virtuous air to join the other half, persistently"
"gossiping in the lobby, and, with them, decide the fateful question."
One more strange thing was to happen at that sitting.
"It was not strange that the Government were beaten by three votes, that"
"only one of those wavering men voted with his old party at last, but it"
"was strange that when this result was announced, and Medland's followers"
settled sturdily in their seats to endure the celebration of the
"triumph, the celebration did not come. There was hardly a cheer, and"
"Medland himself, whom the result seemed hardly to have roused, woke with"
a start to the unwonted silence. It struck to his heart: it seemed like
a tribute of respect to a dead enemy. But he rose and briefly said that
on the next day an announcement of the Government's intentions would be
made by himself--he paused here a moment--or one of his colleagues. He
"sat down again. The sitting was at an end, and the House adjourned."
"Members began to go out, but, as the Premier rose, they drew back and"
"left a path for him down the middle of the House. As he went, one or two"
"thrust out their hands to him, and one honest fellow shouted in his"
"rough voice--he was a labouring-man member--""You're not done yet,"
"Jimmy!"""
"The shout touched him, he lifted his head, looked round with a smile,"
"and, just raising again the hat he had put on as he neared the door,"
took Norburn's arm and passed out of the House.
"When Sir Robert followed, he found the Chief Justice waiting for him,"
"and they walked off together. For a long while neither spoke, but at"
"last Sir Robert said peevishly,"
"goats, hastily deposited the babe within, and upon the white linen the"
"red earth fell first like thin rain, and afterwards, when the sheet was"
"covered, in lumps and mattock-clods. For La Giralda desired to be gone,"
suddenly becoming mindful of the precepts of the Sergeant.
"""No priest has blessed the grave,"" she said; ""I can say no prayers over"
her! Who is La Giralda that she should mutter the simplest prayer? But
"when the Master of Life awakes the little one, and when He sees the look"
"she will cast on her poor puppet of wood, He will take her to His bosom"
"even as La Giralda, the mother of many, would have taken her! God, the"
"Good One, cannot be more cruel than a woman of the heathen!"""
"And so with the broken pottery for a monument, and the clasp of infant"
"hands about the wooden doll for a prayer to God, the dead babe was left"
"alone, unblessed and unconfessed--but safe."
*       *       *       *       *
Meanwhile we must go over the hill with Sergeant Cardono. Whatever his
"thoughts may have been as he trudged up the barren glens, seamed and"
"torn with the winter rains, no sign of them appeared upon his sunburnt"
"weather-beaten face. Steadily and swiftly, yet without haste, he held"
"his way, his eyes fixed on the ground, as though perfectly sure of his"
"road, like a man on a well-beaten track which he has trod a thousand"
times.
"For more than an hour he went on, up and ever up, till his feet crisped"
"upon the first snows of Peñalara, and the hill ramparts closed in. But"
"when he had reached the narrows of a certain gorge, he looked keenly to"
"either side, marking the entrance. A pile of stones roughly heaped one"
upon the other fixed his attention. He went up to them and attentively
"perused their structure and arrangement, though they appeared to have"
and small fishes miraculously multiplied to feed the five thousand;
the linen cloth with which he dried the feet of his apostles; also
"Aaron's rod, the rod with which Moses smote the Red Sea,"" etc., etc."
"(_Cook's Southern Italy_, p. 114.) We did not see these, but in the"
cloister behind this church we were shown a marble slab on pillars
"which was once an altar, ""at which the officiating priest doubted of"
"the Real Presence, when the wafer fell from his hand through the stone,"
"leaving a round hole, which still remains."" Here, too, we were shown"
"a larger slab resting on pillars, more than six feet from the ground,"
"which marks the height of our Saviour; also a porphyry slab, upon which"
the soldiers cast lots for his seamless robe; and some columns from
"Pilate's house in Jerusalem, which were rent by the earthquake of the"
crucifixion.
"[Illustration: THE SCALA SANTA, ROME.]"
[Sidenote: The Holy Stairs from Pilate's Palace.]
"But the great relic of Pilate's House, and one of the most interesting"
"of all the relics in Rome, is across the street from St. John Lateran,"
"viz., the world-renowned _Scala Santa_, or Holy Stairway, a flight of"
"twenty-eight marble steps, once ascended by our Saviour in the palace"
"of Pilate, and brought from Jerusalem to Rome in 326 by the Empress"
"Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. They are covered with a wooden"
"casing, but holes have been left through which the marble steps can be"
seen. Two of them are stained with the Saviour's blood. These spots
"are covered with glass. The light was rather dim, and as we entered a"
gentleman struck a match and held it over one of these glass-covered
"stains to show it to his little girl, so that, passing just at that"
"moment, we also had a good view."

"Provincial Service, and they obtained fairly good men. It would not be"
right for a great Government to grant a minimum pay to Indian Professors
"and an extravagantly high pay to their European colleagues, for doing"
the same kind of work.
"83,669. At the Presidency College the facilities for scientific work"
were now greater than in many institutions in England. India was now
"becoming a great country for Biological research. Again, the Physical"
and Chemical Laboratories at the Presidency College were finer than many
in England. If young men of science in England thought they obtained
better opportunities in pursuing their subjects in New Zealand and
"Toronto than in India, the India office ought to remove that impression"
at once.
"83,670. (Lord Ronaldshay). When an Indian graduate under the witnesses'"
scheme was appointed direct to the higher service in India he would not
compel him to go to England for a period of training. The person who
would be appointed in India directly from the Indian Universities would
have to have previously served with distinction in subordinate
positions; a visit to Europe would be an advantage but not absolutely
necessary.
"83,671. (Mr. Biss). The cost of living in Calcutta to an Indian"
Professor or Lecturer would all depend as the style in which he lived.
In each service there is always a standard of living to which every
member is expected to conform. An Indian Professor had to go to Europe
from time to time to keep himself in touch with the developments of his
subject. An Indian officer had to support a large number of relations.
The question of a man's private expenses should not be raised in fixing
his pay. One might as well inquire whether the candidate for admission
"to the service was a bachelor or married, or as to how many children he"
"had. He had known Europeans who had led a simple life, and had been all"
The wind blustered outside. The cold draught whistled through the room.
"Joyce rose to his feet with a shiver, went to a corner for a couple of"
"sacks, which he threw over the sleeping man, and, after having wistfully"

CHAPTER XII--HISTOIRE DE REVENANT
Ostend is a magnificent white Kursaal on the Belgian coast. Certain
requisites are attached to it in the way of great hotels and villas
"along a tiled _digue_, and innumerable bathing-machines on the sands"
"below. There is an old town, it is true, somewhere behind it, with"
"quaint narrow streets, a Place d’Armes dotted round with cafés, and"
a thronged market-square; there is also a bustling port and a fishing
population. But the Ostend of practical life begins and ends at the
"Kursaal. Were it to perish during a night, the following day would see"
the exodus of twenty thousand visitors. The vast glass rotunda can hold
thousands. Within its precincts you can do anything in reason and out of
"reason. You can knit all day long like Penelope, or you can go among"
the Sirens with or without the precautions of Ulysses. You can consume
anything from a biscuit to a ten-course dinner. You can play dominoes at
centime points or roulette with a forty-franc minimum. You can listen to
"music, you can dance, you can go to sleep. You can write letters, send"
"telegrams, and open a savings-bank account. By moving to one side or the"
other of a glass screen you can sit in the warm sunshine or in the keen
sea wind. You can study the fashions of Europe from St. Petersburg to
"Dublin, and if you are a woman, you can wear the most sumptuous garments"
"Providence has deigned to bestow on you. And lastly, if you are looking"
"written against Luther. He will read him, he will soon take up something"
"to quiet the tumult. He succeeds in getting Aleander, who arrived at"
"Louvain in June, to prohibit preaching against him. The Pope still hopes"
"that Aleander will succeed in bringing back Erasmus, with whom he is"
"again on friendly terms, to the right track."
But Erasmus began to consider the only exit which was now left to him:
to leave Louvain and the Netherlands to regain his menaced independence.
The occasion to depart had long ago presented itself: the third edition
of his New Testament called him to Basle once more. It would not be a
"permanent departure, and he purposed to return to Louvain. On 28 October"
(his birthday) he left the town where he had spent four difficult years.
His chambers in the College of the Lily were reserved for him and he
left his books behind. On 15 November he reached Basle.
Soon the rumour spread that out of fear of Aleander he had saved himself
"by flight. But the idea, revived again in our days in spite of Erasmus's"
"own painstaking denial, that Aleander should have cunningly and"
"expressly driven him from the Netherlands, is inherently improbable. So"
"far as the Church was concerned, Erasmus would at almost any point be"
"more dangerous than at Louvain, in the headquarters of conservatism,"
"under immediate control of the strict Burgundian government, where, it"
"seemed, he could sooner or later be pressed into the service of the"
anti-Lutheran policy.
"It was this contingency, as Dr. Allen has correctly pointed out, which"
he feared and evaded. Not for his bodily safety did he emigrate; Erasmus
would not have been touched--he was far too valuable an asset for such
"measures. It was his mental independence, so dear to him above all else,"
"that he felt to be threatened; and, to safeguard that, he did not return"
to Louvain.
No foot is allowed to touch the _Scala Santa_; it must be ascended
on the knees. A number of people were going up in this way when
"we entered, pausing on each step to repeat a prayer, for which"
indulgences are granted by the Pope. There are stairways on each
"side, by which those who have thus crawled up may walk down. The"
"only man I know of that ever walked down the Holy Stairs themselves,"
"and the most illustrious man that ever crawled up them on his knees,"
"was Martin Luther. When he had mounted slowly half way up, step by"
"step on his knees, he seemed to hear a voice saying, ""The just shall"
"live by faith."" Martin Luther rose from his knees, walked down the"
"staircase, and left the place a free man so far as this superstition"
"was concerned, and shortly afterwards became the most formidable foe"
that ever assailed the falsehood and corruption of the Romish Church.
[Sidenote: The Miraculous Portrait and the Shoes of Christ.]
At the top of the Scala Santa we saw through a grating the beautiful
silver tabernacle containing the great relic which has given to this
"chapel the name of _Sancta Sanctorum_, viz.: the portrait of Christ,"
"held by the Romish Church to be authentic, having been drawn in outline"
"by St. Luke and finished by an angel, whence its name ""Acheiropoëton,"""
"_i. e._, the picture made without hands. The relic chamber here"
"contains fragments of the true cross, the sandals of Christ, and ""the"
iron bar of Hades which he brought away with him from that doleful
"region,""[10] but we did not see these."
"[Sidenote: The Inscription on the Cross, and the Finger of Thomas.]"
A short walk beyond the Scala Santa and the Lateran brings us to the
"Church of S. Croce in Gerusalemme, which is specially rich in relics."
Here our party was shown a piece of the true cross of Christ and the
"And, when they had read, they all looked at him again, not as they had"
"looked before, but, it seemed to him, with a curious wonder, half"
"mocking, half pitying, as one looks at a man who does not know the thing"
that touches him most nearly. He glanced up at the galleries: there too
was the ubiquitous sheet; the Chief Justice and the President of the
"Legislative Council were cheek by jowl over it, and it fell lightly from"
"Lady Eynesford's slim fingers, to be caught at eagerly by Eleanor"
Scaife.
"""What is it?"" he whispered impatiently to Norburn; but his absorbed"
"disciple only bewilderedly murmured ""What?"" and the Premier could not"
pause to tell him.
Now followed what Sir Robert maintained was the greatest feat of oratory
"he had ever witnessed. Gathering his wandering wits together, Medland"
"plunged again whole-heartedly into his speech, and slowly, gradually,"
"almost, it seemed, step by step and man by man, he won back the thoughts"
of his audience. He wrestled with that strange paper rival and overthrew
it. Man after man dropped it; its course was stayed; it fell underfoot
"or fluttered idly down the gangways. The nods ceased, the whispers were"
"hushed, the stir fell and rose no more. Once again he had them, and,"
"inspired by that knowledge, the surest spur of eloquence, there rang"
"from his lips the last burning words, the picture of the vision that"
"ruled his life, the hope for the days that he might not see."
"""Believe!"" he cried, in passionate entreaty, ""believe, and your sons"
"shall surely see!"""
"He sank in his seat, and the last echo of his resonant voice died away."
"First came silence, and then a thunder of applause. Men stood up and"
"waved what they had in their hands, hats or handkerchiefs or papers;"
"women sat with their eyes still on him, or, with a gasp, leant back and"
"Netherlands, drawing thither the unearned revenues of the Americas, and"
"still contrived to keep Spain subject to his rule, the latter country"
"would have been thrown back on her great natural resources, her"
"industry, and her commerce, which, as it was, developed markedly during"
"his reign,[765] despite the heavy burdens of his wars. And in that case"
Spain might conceivably have become the Protestant and rebellious
"territory, and the Netherlands on the contrary have remained Catholic"
"and grown commercially decrepit, having in reality the weaker potential"
economic basis.
"The theorem that the two races were vitally opposed in ""religious"
"sentiment,"" and that ""it was as certain that the Netherlanders"
would be fierce reformers as that the Spaniards would be
"uncompromising persecutors"" (Motley, p. 31), is part of the common"
"pre-scientific conception of national development, and proceeds"
upon flat disregard of the historical evidence. It is well
established that there was as much heresy of the more rational
"Protestant and Unitarian sort in Spain, to begin with, as in"
Holland. Under Ferdinand and Isabella the Inquisition seems to
"have struck mainly at Judaic and Moorish monotheistic heresy, which"
"was not uncommon among the upper classes, while the lower were for"
"the most part orthodox (Armstrong, _Introd._ to Major Hume's"
"_Spain_, pp. 14, 18). Thus there is good ground for the surmise"
that Ferdinand's object was primarily the confiscation of the
"wealth of Jews and other rich heretics. (See U.R. Burke, _History"
"of Spain_, 1895, ii, 101; Hume's ed. 1900, ii, 74.) In Aragon,"
"Valencia, and Catalonia there was general resistance to the"
Inquisition; in Cordova there was a riot against it; in Saragossa
"the Inquisitor was murdered before the altar (Armstrong, p. 18;"
"Llorente, _Hist. crit. de l'Inquisition d'Espagne_, éd. 1818, i,"
"185-213; M'Crie, _Reformation in Spain_, ed. 1856, pp. 52-53. Cp."

"Figure 207, a strong unconformity parts the schists and the"
Algonkian. The floor on which the Algonkian rests is remarkably
"even, and here again is proved an interval of incalculable length,"
during which an ancient land mass of Archean rocks was baseleveled
before it received the cover of the sediments of the later age.
THE LAKE SUPERIOR REGION. In eastern Canada an area of pre-
"Cambrian rocks, Archean and Algonkian, estimated at two million"
"square miles, stretches from the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence"
"River northward to the confines of the continent, inclosing Hudson"
"Bay in the arms of a gigantic U. This immense area, which we have"
"already studied as the Laurentian peneplain, extends southward"
"across the Canadian border into northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and"
Michigan. The rocks of this area are known to be pre-Cambrian; for
"the Cambrian strata, wherever found, lie unconformably upon them."
The general relations of the formations of that portion of the
area which lies about Lake Superior are shown in Figure 262. Great
"unconformities, UU' separate the Algonkian both from the Archean"
"and from the Cambrian, and divide it into three distinct systems,"
"--the LOWER HURONIAN, the UPPER HURONIAN, and the KEWEENAWAN. The"
Lower and the Upper Huronian consist in the main of old sea muds
"and sands and limy oozes now changed to gneisses, schists,"
"marbles, quartzites, slates, and other metamorphic rocks. The"
"Keweenawan is composed of immense piles of lava, such as those of"
"Iceland, overlain by bedded sandstones. What remains of these rock"
systems after the denudation of all later geologic ages is
"enormous. The Lower Huronian is more than a mile thick, the Upper"
"Huronian more than two miles thick, while the Keweenawan exceeds"
nine miles in thickness. The vast length of Algonkian time is
shown by the thickness of its marine deposits and by the cycles of
erosion which it includes. In Figure 262 the student may read an
"and kicked the world about like a football, and striven to dig up the"
roots of the Universe--the Why and the Wherefore and the Whence and the
Whither.”
Netherby sighed:
"“Ah, Noll, the old room is gone. I have to begin all over again. These"
stiff prude seats compel me to order--tell me harshly that I must not
"be dreaming overmuch, nor thinking--which is next door to dreaming--but"
"nag me to be up and doing, boiling pots or eggs or hitting something"
or pushing at things. I don’t seem to fit in anywhere. The medieval
rigours warn me to be done with visions and the reading of the visions
of others; and their hard oaken seats rise up and assault me where I
would sit upon them.... But that is nothing. They have left me not even
my books. I am bewildered--bewildered--wholly bewildered.”
"He sighed sadly, and went on:"
"“Ah, Noll, he only knows the whole delight of having possessed a"
child who has lost it.... Books are one’s most intimate friends--they
never change--never play us a shabby trick. How they eat into one’s
"friendship, each dressed in his individual habit! the very ugliness"
of some a reason for seeking to win their confidence; perhaps a
reason for an easy familiarity--we dog-ear them the more--mark them
"the more--love them the more. Put them in handsome ranks uniform, and"
their individuality is gone--like sisters that are primly arrayed to
the same pattern to simper through a tedious garden-party. We begin to
find faults where was once only affection; and their outward seeming
"being now alike, like critics we seek to taste not the delights"
"within, but carp because this has not Shakespeare’s wit nor that the"
"thunders and the music of Carlyle. These that were once our closest,"
"most garrulous, most intimate friends have gone to join the silent"
"she read very stiltedly, with a strange exotic accent for the love"
"passages or the death scenes. As Lady Victoria Freebooter said, she"
would have been _priceless_ at a music-hall matinée which was
"raising funds for war charities, if only she could have been induced"
to read passages from Miss Yonge in _that_ voice for a quarter of an
hour. Even the Queen would have had to laugh.
"But as that could not be brought off, it was decided that working"
parties at her house led to too much giddiness from suppressed
giggles or torpor from too much food. So she relapsed once more into
loneliness. Unfortunately air-raids were now becoming events of
"occasional fright and anxiety in London, and this deterred Cousin"
"Sophie from Darlington, Cousin Matty from Leeds, Joseph's wife from"
"Northallerton or old, married schoolfellows from other northern or"
"midland towns coming to partake of her fastuous hospitality. Also,"
"they all seemed to be busy, either over their absent husbands'"
"business, or their sons', or because they were plunged in war work"
"themselves. ""And really, in these times, I couldn't stand Linda for"
"more than five minutes,"" one of them said."
"As to the air-raids, she was not greatly alarmed at them. Of course"
"it was very uncomfortable having London so dark at night, but then"
"she only went out in the afternoon, and never in the evening. And"
the Germans seemed to be content and discriminating enough not to
"bomb what she called ""the resi_den_tial"" parts of London. The"
nearest to Portland Place of their attentions was Hampstead or
"Bloomsbury. ""We are protected, my dear, by the open spaces of"
"Regent's Park. They wouldn't like to waste their bombs on poor me!"""
However her maid didn't altogether like the off chance of the
Germans or our air-craft guns making a mistake and trespassing on
"the residential parts of London, so she persuaded her mistress to"
The time of our Dover journey was one of extreme depletion in the privy
purse. The king had borrowed from every person and every city within the
"realm who, by threats or cajolery, could be induced to part with money."
But now he had reached the end of his tether.
"When matters were thus in extremis, some one, probably Castlemain,"
"suggested the sale of England's possessions on the continent, chief of"
"which was the rich city of Dunkirk, situate on the French side of the"
"Straits of Dover. This fortified city, within a few leagues of Calais,"
"had cost the English nation heavily in blood and gold to gain, and still"
"more heavily to hold, but its value to England commercially and"
politically was beyond measure.
"Since Queen Mary had lost Calais, Dunkirk was the only important foothold"
England had on continental soil; therefore it was almost as dear to the
"English people as the city of London itself. Because of its importance,"
"it was greatly coveted by the French king, who shortly before the time"
of our journey to Dover had made overtures to buy it.
"Charles turned a deaf ear to King Louis's first proposal to buy Dunkirk,"
"not because he loved the city, or cared a farthing for its value to his"
"people, but because he feared the storm of indignation its sale would"
"raise. The Lord Chancellor objected to the sale of Dunkirk, and tried"
to show Charles the great folly of entertaining the offer. He was the
"only wise, honest man in the king's council, and, by reason of his"
"wonderful knowledge of mankind, was called ""the Chancellor of Human"
"Nature."" But the king needed money, so after a time he listened to"
"Berkeley, Crofts, Castlemain, and others of like character, whose"
"strongest argument consisted in accusing the king, most offensively,"
of being afraid of his people.
"""Are you not king?"" asked Castlemain. ""Does not Dunkirk belong to you,"
"concern her. The death of her mother had been a stunning shock, and"
"when she crossed over to the hotel--what irony, by the bye, to think"
"she had been born there thirty-nine years ago, in the old inn that"
had preceded the twice rebuilt hotel!--when she crossed the street
"with Minna, it had been with blazing, tearless eyes and the desire"
"to take the hotel manager and his minions by the coat collar, fling"
"_them_ into the street, and assert her right to go up to her room."
"But now her violence was spent and she was a broken, weeping woman"
"as she sat all night by the bedside of her dead mother, holding the"
"cold hand, imprinting kisses on the dead face which was now that of"
a saintly person with nothing of the reprobate in its lineaments.

The burial for various reasons had to take place in the Cemetery of
"St. Josse-ten-Noode, near the shuddery National Shooting Range where"
Edith Cavell and numerous Belgian patriots had recently been
"executed. Minna von Stachelberg left her hospital, with some one"
"else in charge, and insisted on accompanying Vivie to the interment."
"This might have been purely ""laïc""; not on account of any harsh"
dislike to the religious ceremony on Vivie's part; only due to the
fact that she knew no priest or pastor. But there appeared at the
grave-side to make a very suitable and touching discourse and to
"utter one or two heartfelt prayers, a Belgian Baptist minister, a"
relation of Mme. Trouessart.
Waterloo left many curious things behind it. Not only a tea-shop or
"two; but a Nonconformist nucleus, that intermarried, as Sergeant"
"Walker or Walcker had done, with Belgian women and left descendants"
"who in the third generation--and by inherent vigour, thrift,"
matrimony and conversion--had built up quite a numerous
"congregation, which even grew large enough and rich enough to"
"be of Orphic origin. They were buried with the dead, and for this"
reason were more outspoken in their references to the mystic doctrines
than was permissible in epitaphs exposed to the vulgar gaze. The most
"complete of these tablets is one which was found near Sybaris, and,"
"with the exception of the last sentence of all, the inscription is in"
"hexameter verse. Miss Harrison, to whose work I am wholly indebted for"
"this valuable evidence, translates as follows[1505]:"
"‘Out of the pure I come, Pure Queen of Them Below,"
Eukles and Eubouleus and the other Gods immortal.
"For I also avow me that I am of your blessed race,"
But Fate laid me low and the other Gods immortal
... starflung thunderbolt.
I have flown out of the sorrowful weary Wheel.
I have passed with eager feet to the Circle desired.
"I have sunk beneath the bosom of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld."
I have passed with eager feet from the Circle desired.
"Happy and Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal."
A kid I have fallen into milk.’
The gist of the document which the dead man takes with him is then
briefly this. He claims to have been pure originally and of the same
"race as his gods; but as a man he was mortal and exposed to death,"
and in this respect differed from his gods. He states however that he
has performed certain ritual acts which entitle him to be re-admitted
to the pure fellowship of the gods now that death is passed. And the
"answer comes, ‘Thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’"
Now here I wish to consider one only of these ritual acts--that one of
which the meaning is clearest--Δεσποίνας δ’ ὑπὸ κόλπον ἔδυν χθονίας
"βασιλείας, which means, if I may give my own rendering, ‘I was admitted"
"to the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the under-world.’ The phrase"
branches.
"For the first time we saw one another's faces, and how pale and"
"woe-begone, mudstained and draggled we were! The cold, grey light,"
"which so mercilessly unmasked our refuge, did not spare us. It helped"
even my lady to look her worst. Fraulein Anna sat a mere lifeless lump
in her saddle. The waiting-women cried softly; they had cried all
"night. The Waldgrave looked dazed, as if he barely understood where he"
was or why he was there.
"To think over-much in such a place was to weep. Instead, I hastened to"
"get them all off their horses, and with Steve's help and a great"
"bundle of osiers and branches which we cut, I made nests for them in"
"the lower boughs of the willows, well out of reach of the water. When"
"they had all taken their places, I served out food and a dram of"
"Dantzic waters, which some of us needed; for a white mist, drawn up"
"from the swamp by the rising sun, began to enshroud us, and, hanging"
"among the osiers for more than an hour, prolonged the misery of the"
night.
"Still, even that rolled away at last--about six o'clock--and let us"
see the sun shining overhead in a heaven of blue distance and golden
"clouds. Larks rose up and sang, and all the birds of the marsh began"
to twitter and tweet. In a trice our mud island was changed to a
bower--a place of warmth and life and refreshment--where light and
"shade lay on the dappled floor, and the sunshine fell through green"
leaves.
"Then I took the cloaks, and the saddles, and everything that was wet,"
and spread them out on branches to dry; and leaving the women to make
themselves comfortable in their own way and shift themselves as they
"pleased, we two, with the Waldgrave and the two servants, went away to"
"""It _has_ been a pleasant evening,"" she said, inanely."
"""I saw you for the first time to-night, Cherry. I think I have begun to"
"know you."""
"Again she felt her heart leap. Reaching out to say good-bye, his hand"
"slipped down over her arm, like a caress, until her palm lay in his."
"With trembling, gentle hands she pushed him from her; but even when the"
"sound of his footsteps had died away, she stood with eyes straining"
"into the gloom, in her breast a gladness so stifling that she raised"
her hands to still its tumult.
"Emerson, with the glow still upon him, felt a deep contentment which he"
did not trouble to analyze. It has been said that two opposite impulses
"may exist side by side in a man's mind, like two hostile armies which"
"have camped close together in the night, unrevealed to each other until"
the morning. To Emerson the dawn had not yet come. He had no thought of
"disloyalty to Mildred, but, after his fashion, took the feeling of the"
"moment unreflectively. His mood was averse to thought, and, moreover,"
the darkness forced him to give instant attention to his path. While
"the waters of the bay out to his right showed a ghostly gray, objects"
beneath the bluff where he walked were cloaked in impenetrable shadow.
"The air was damp with the breath of coming rain, and at rare intervals"
he caught a glimpse of the torn edges of clouds hurrying ahead of a
wind that was yet unfelt.
"When the black bulk of Marsh's cannery loomed ahead of him, he left the"
"gravel beach and turned up among the buildings, seeking to retrace his"
"former course. He noticed that once he had left the noisy shingle, his"
"feet made no sound in the soft moss. Thus it was that, as he turned the"
"corner of the first building, he nearly ran against a man who was"
"had not seen the half. The city, all roofs and spires and bridges,"
"girt with a wall of seventy towers, roared beneath us; and that I had"
expected. But outside the wall I now saw a second city of huts and
"tents, with a great earthwork about it, and bastions and demilunes and"
picquets posted.
This was the Swedish Lager. It lay principally to the south of the
"city proper, though on all sides it encircled it more or less. They"
told me that there lay in it about forty thousand soldiers and twenty
"thousand horses, and twenty thousand camp followers; but the number"
"was constantly increasing, death and disease notwithstanding, so that"
it presently stood as high as sixty thousand fighting men and half as
"many followers, to say nothing of the garrison that lay in the city,"
"or the troops posted to guard the approaches. It seemed to me, gazing"
"over that mighty multitude from the top of the hill, that nothing"
could resist such a force; and I looked abroad with curiosity for the
enemy.
I expected to view his army cheek by jowl with us; and I was
"disappointed when I saw beyond our camp to southward, where I was told"
"he lay, only a clear plain with the little river Rednitz flowing"
"through it. This plain was a league and more in width, and it was"
"empty of men. Beyond it rose a black wooded ridge, very steep and"
hairy.
My lady explained that Wallenstein's army lay along this
"ridge--seventy thousand men, and forty thousand horses, and"
"Wallenstein himself. His camp we heard was eight miles round, the"
"front guarded by a line of cannon, and taking in whole villages and"
castles. And now I looked again I saw the smoke hang among the trees.
They whispered in Nuremberg that no man in that army took pay; that
all served for booty; and that the troopers that sacked Magdeburg and
"At all events, the Sergeant and La Giralda went off calmly enough in the"
"direction of the town of San Ildefonso, driving their donkey before"
"them. For a minute, as they gained the crest, their figures stood out"
black and clear against the coppery sunrise. The next they had
"disappeared down the slope, the flapping peak of Cardono's Montera cap"
being the last thing to be lost sight of.
"The long, dragging, idle day was before the party in the dry ravine."
"Etienne went to his saddle-bags, and drawing his breviary from the"
"leathern flap, began to peruse the lessons for the day with an attentive"
piety which was not lessened by the fact that he had forgotten most of
"the Latin he had learned at school. John Mortimer, on the other hand,"
"took out his pocket-book, and was soon absorbed by calculations in which"
wine and onions shared the page with schemes for importing into Spain
Manchester goods woven and dyed to suit the taste of the country
housewives.
El Sarria sat down with a long sigh to his never-failing resort of
"cleaning and ordering his rifle and pistols. He had a phial of oil, a"
"feather, and a fine linen rag which he carried about with him for the"
purpose. Afterwards he undertook the same office for the weapons of
Rollo. Those of the other members of the expedition might take care of
themselves. Ramon Garcia had small belief in their ability to make much
"use of them, at any rate--the sergeant being alone excepted."
"These three being accounted for, there remained only Rollo and Concha."
"Now there was a double shelf a little way from the horses, from which"
the chief of the expedition could keep an eye on the whole encampment.
"The pair slowly and, as it were, unconsciously gravitated thither, and"
"in a moment Rollo found himself telling ""the story of his life"" to a"
"Miss Lindon's heart sank. She had lived in suburbs all her life, and"
found Croydon--the Lord knows why--the most delectable of them all. She
had sat under Mr. Moneyfeather of Saint Michael's for many years--such
"a dear, good man who preached such eloquent sermons! You could always"
"understand him, too, which was a great comfort. And the church was just"
"round the corner. In London folks had to go to church by omnibus, a most"
"unpleasant and possibly irreverent prelude to divine worship. Besides,"
"when you did get to the sacred edifice, you found yourself in a"
"confusing land where all the clergy, even to the humblest deacon,"
"were austere and remote strangers, who looked at members of their"
congregation with glassy and unsympathetic eyes when they passed them
"in the street. Here, in Croydon, on the contrary, when she met Mr."
"Moneyfeather in public places, he held her hand and patted it and"
inquired affectionately after Dandy's health. With a London vicar she
could not conceive the possibility of such privileged terms of intimacy.
"London, where you did not know your next-door neighbor, and where you"
took no interest in the births of babies over the way; where no one
"ran in for a gossip in the mornings; where every street was a clashing,"
dashing High Street.
"But though her face pictured her dismay, she was too generous to"
translate it into words. John never guessed her sacrifice.
"“We 'll go somewhere quiet,” said he, after a while."
"“We 'll go wherever you like, dear,” replied Miss Lindon, meekly, and"
she rang the bell for tea.
"The main point decided, they proceeded to discuss the details of the"
"scheme, the minds of each suffused in a misty wonder. If John had told"
the simple lady that she could serve him by taking command of a cavalry
"regiment, she would have agreed in her unselfish fashion, but she would"
picked from among them to act as her nurse.
And if it did not occur to her to question either his power or his
"perfect right to dispose of her future also as he might see fit, had not"
"all her experience gone to prove that might is right everywhere, that"
law and justice are merely additional pretexts devised by the strong for
oppressing the weak? She had had to choose between remaining on board
"the _Olive Branch_, or paying Jasper Slyne his price for the chance of"
escape he had offered her in pursuance of his own aims.
She disliked and distrusted Slyne scarcely less than before. But she did
"not see how she could have chosen otherwise. And, in any case,--it was"
too late now to revoke the promise she had made him.
She was still afraid to place any faith in the promises he had made
her. She had no idea how he had come at his alleged discovery of her
real identity. But Mr. Jobling's obvious belief in that recurred to her
"mind, and she fell to wondering timidly what life would be like as Lady"
Josceline Justice.
"Her impressions on that point were very hazy, however, and she had still"
to puzzle out the problem added by Justin Carthew. But she finally gave
"up the attempt to solve that at the moment, contenting herself with the"
"tremulous hope that she might soon be on her way toward that dear,"
"unknown, dream-home for which her hungry heart had so often ached."
Of the exorbitant price so soon to be paid for the brief glimpse of
"happiness Slyne had agreed to allow her, she took no further thought at"
all. She had already made up her mind to meet that without complaint.
"An hour or more later, when Slyne looked in to tell her that it was time"
"to start, she was still seated at the window, gazing out over the"
"On seeing him, they would come forward from all corners of the"
"court-yard, drunk, or suffering from drunken headache, dishevelled,"
"tattered, miserable, and pitiable.  Then would come the barrel-like,"
"stout Aleksei Maksimovitch Simtsoff, formerly Inspector of Woods and"
"Forests, under the Department of Appendages, but now trading in"
"matches, ink, blacking, and lemons. He was an old man of sixty, in a"
"canvas overcoat and a wide-brimmed hat, the greasy borders of which hid"
"his stout fat red face.  He had a thick white beard, out of which a"
"small red nose turned gaily heavenwards.  He had thick, crimson lips"
"and watery, cynical eyes.  They called him ""Kubar,"" a name which well"
"described his round figure and buzzing speech.  After him, Kanets"
"appeared from some corner--a dark, sad-looking, silent drunkard: then"
"the former governor of the prison, Luka Antonovitch Martyanoff, a man"
"who existed on ""remeshok,"" ""trilistika,"" and ""bankovka,""* and many such"
"cunning games, not much appreciated by the police.  He would throw his"
"hard and oft-scourged body on the grass beside the teacher, and,"
"turning his eyes round and scratching his head, would ask in a hoarse,"
"bass voice, ""May I?"""
"*Note by translator.--Well-known games of chance, played by the lower"
"classes.  The police specially endeavour to stop them, but"
unsuccessfully.
"Then appeared Pavel Solntseff, a man of thirty years of age, suffering"
from consumption.  The ribs of his left side had been broken in a
"quarrel, and the sharp, yellow face, like that of a fox, always wore a"
"malicious smile.  The thin lips, when opened, exposed two rows of"
"decayed black teeth, and the rags on his shoulders swayed backwards and"
forwards as if they were hung on a clothes pole.  They called him
"""Abyedok.""  He hawked brushes and bath brooms of his own manufacture,"
good strong brushes made from a peculiar kind of grass.
you a thousand times you keep no watch? I have a great mind to stand
half a dozen of you up against that wall. Escaped with my entire command

Cabrera felt that he had wasted a great deal of time on a fine morning
"without shooting somebody, and it would certainly have gone ill with Don"
Luis or his brother if either of them had been compelled by the flames
to issue forth from the burning mill-house of Sarria.
But they were not there. The cur dogs of the village and a few
half-starved mongrels that followed the troops had great sport worrying
the rats which darted continually from the burning granaries. But of the
"more important human rats, no sign."
"All the inhabitants of the village were there likewise, held back from"
plundering by the bayonets of the Carlist troops. They stood recounting
"to each other, wistfully, the stores of clothes, the silk curtains, the"
"uncut pieces of broadcloth, the household linen, the great eight-day"
clocks in their gilt ormolu cases. Every woman had something to add to
the catalogue. Every householder felt keenly the injustice of
permitting so much wealth to be given to the crackling flames.
"""Yes, it was very well,"" they said; ""doubtless the Fernandez family were"
"vermin to be burned up--smoked out. But they possessed much good gear,"
the gathering of many years. These things have committed no treason
against either Don Carlos or the Regent Cristina. Why then are we not
permitted to enter and remove the valuables? It is monstrous. We will
"represent the matter to General Cabrera--to Don Carlos himself!"""
"But one glance at the former, as he sat his horse, nervously twisting"
"the reins and watching the destruction from under his black brows, made"
Spanish Governor has never been decided. After three weeks the buccaneers
"started back on their journey to San Lorenzo, with a troop of 200"
"pack-mules laden with gold, silver, and goods of all sorts, together with"
a large number of prisoners. The rearguard on the march was under the
"command of a kinsman of the Admiral, Colonel Bledry Morgan."
"On their arrival at Chagres the spoils were divided, amidst a great deal"
"of quarrelling, and in March, 1671, Morgan sailed off to Port Royal with a"
"few friends and the greater part of the plunder, leaving his faithful"
"followers behind without ships or provisions, and with but £10 apiece as"
their share of the spoils.
"On May 31st, 1671, the Council of Jamaica passed a vote of thanks to"
"Morgan for his successful expedition, and this in spite of the fact that"
"in July, a year before, a treaty had been concluded at Madrid between"
"Spain and England for ""restraining depredations and establishing peace"" in"
the New World.
"In April, 1672, Morgan was carried to England as a prisoner in the"
"_Welcome_ frigate. But he was too popular to be convicted, and after being"
"acquitted was appointed Deputy Governor of Jamaica, and in November, 1674,"
he was knighted and returned to the West Indies. In 1672 Major-General
"Banister, who was Commander-in-Chief of the troops in Jamaica, writing to"
"Lord Arlington about Morgan, said: ""He (Morgan) is a well deserving"
"person, and one of great courage and conduct, who may, with His Majesty's"
"pleasure, perform good public service at home, or be very advantageous to"
"this island if war should again break forth with the Spaniards."""
While Morgan was in England he brought an action for libel against William
"Crooke, the publisher of the ""History of the Bucaniers of America."" The"
result of this trial was that Crooke paid £200 damages to Morgan and
published a long and grovelling apology.
"Mediterranean. But coal, he had found, had risen to a ruinous price in"
consequence of a recent strike among the miners in England; and for even
"the most trifling repairs he would have to wait at least a week, because"
the dock-yard people were already working over-time to make way for a
man-of-war. Credit of any sort was not to be had. His portage-bill bade
fair to swamp his insufficient cash resources--even although three of
his now scanty crew had already deserted. And who could foretell what
might happen to him if they should get wagging their tongues too freely
"in some wine-shop ashore! While, as if for climax, the Customs'"
authorities had been displaying a most suspicious interest in him and
"his ship. Under such circumstances, even a saint might have been"
"pardoned, as he pointed out, for showing a temper something short of"
seraphic.
"""And you've been doing me good turns--by your way of it--for some time"
"past,"" he continued, in a stifled, vehement whisper lest his voice"
"should still reach the receding boat. ""Though--"" He waved a claw-like"
"hand about him, words again failing him to describe adequately his"
"sufferings in consequence, as who should say, ""See the result for"
"yourself."""
"Slyne sat down on the sofa opposite him, not even condescending to"
"glance, in response to that invitation, round the squalid,"
"poverty-stricken little cabin. ""Never mind about some time past,"" he"
"advised, more pacifically. ""You'll never get rich quick yesterday."
"To-day's when _I'm_ going to make my pile. And I meant to let you in--"""
"""To another hole,"" Captain Dove concluded sceptically. ""I only wish"
"you'd show me some sure way out of the one I'm in."""
"Slyne looked his annoyance at that further interruption, and made as if"
"to rise, but did no more than draw his gold cigarette-case from its"
We marched to an extensive R.E. park and saw-mill near a railway siding.
We had to dismantle the machinery and load everything of any value on to
a train. For several hours five of us dragged a huge cylinder and piston
along the ground. We toiled and perspired. We made a ramp of heavy
wooden beams in front of the train and then we slowly pushed the iron
"mass into a truck. We went back and, raising a big fly-wheel on its edge"
"and supporting it with a wooden beam under each axle, we rolled it"
"painfully along, swaying from side to side."
"Then there came the long-drawn familiar whine, and the black smoke arose"
behind some trees a hundred yards away and the thunder-clap followed. A
jagged piece of steel came whizzing by and lodged in a stack of timber
behind us.
We pushed the wheel up the ramp and returned to fetch heavy coils of
"wire, bundles of picks and shovels, sacks and barrels of nails. Our"
"backs and shoulders ached, our hands and finger-tips were sore."
Another shell came whining over. It burst by a little cottage. Its
thunder made our ears sing. The fragments of flying metal made us duck
or scatter behind the stacks.
We worked until we almost dropped with sheer fatigue. Iron rods and bars
"for reinforcing pill-boxes, bags of cement, boxes of tools, parts of"
"machinery, all went on to the train. Then we entered a big shed, where"
a number of tar-barrels stood in a row. We rolled them out and placed
them by the timber stacks. We laid a pick beside each barrel so that it
"could be broached, the tar set alight, and the entire park destroyed at"
a moment's notice.
It was dark when we stopped work. We reached camp after an hour's
wearisome marching. We waited in a long queue outside the cook-house.
and gone himself with their beautiful new motor--whatever _could_
"the chauffeur have thought?--to meet her at the prison gates,"
"_there_ he was, afterwards, worrying himself over the War: not"
"content as she was, as most of her friends were, as the newspapers"
"were, to leave it all to Lord Kitchener and Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward"
"Grey, and even Mr. Lloyd George--though the latter had made some"
"rather foolish and exaggerated speeches about Alcohol. Michael, if"
"he went on like this, would _never_ get his knighthood!"
"Then when Michael had at last, thanks to General Armstrong, found"
his right place and was accomplishing marvels--the papers said--as a
"""mender of the maimed""--here was she left alone in Portland Place"
"with hardly any one to speak to, and all her acquaintances--she now"
realized they were scarcely her friends--too much occupied with war
work to spend an afternoon in discussing nothing very important over
"a sumptuous tea, still served by a butler and footman."
"Presently, too, the butler left to join the Professor in France and"
"the footman enlisted, and the tea had to be served by a _distraite_"
"parlour-maid, with her eye on a munitions factory--so that she"
"might be ""in it""--and her heart in the keeping of the footman, who,"
"since he had gone into khaki, was irresistible."
"Mrs. Rossiter of course said, in 1914, that she would take up war"
work. She subscribed most handsomely to the Soldiers' and Sailors'
"Families' Association, to the Red Cross, to the Prince of Wales's"
Fund (one of the unsolved war-time mysteries ... what's become of
"it?), to the Cigarette Fund, the 1914 Christmas Plum Pudding Fund,"
"the Blue Cross, the Purple Cross, the Green Cross funds; to the"
outstandingly good work at St. Dunstan's and at Petersham--(I am
glad she gave a Hundred pounds each to _them_); and to the
"French, Belgian, Russian, Italian, Serbian, Portuguese and Japanese"
"says, ""we were not overstocked with powder."""
"It was in March, 1710, that Rogers brought his little fleet into the"
"harbour of Guam, one of the Ladrone Islands. Although at war with Spain,"
the captain soon became on his usual friendly terms with the Governor of
"this Spanish colony, and gave an entertainment on board his ship to him"
"and four other Spanish gentlemen, making them ""as welcome as time and"
"place would afford, with musick and our sailors dancing."" The Governor"
"gave a return party on shore, to which Rogers and all his brother officers"
"were invited, partaking of ""sixty dishes of various sorts."" After this"
"feast Rogers gave his host a present, consisting of ""two negro boys"
"dress'd in liveries."" One other instance of Woodes Rogers adaptability"
must suffice. In the year 1717 he was appointed Governor to the Bahama
"Islands, at New Providence, now called Nassau. His chief duty was to stamp"
out the West India pirates who had made this island their headquarters for
"many years, and were in complete power there, and numbered more than 2,000"
"desperadoes, including such famous men as Vane and Teach. Rogers's only"
"weapon, besides the man-of-war he arrived in, was a royal proclamation"
from King George offering free pardon to all pirates or buccaneers who
would surrender at once to the new Governor. At first the pirates were
"inclined to resist his landing, but in the end the tactful Rogers got his"
"own way, and not only landed, but was received by an armed guard of"
"honour, and passed between two lines of pirates who fired salutes with"
their muskets.
"Most of the pirates surrendered and received their pardons, but some, who"
reverted shortly afterwards to piracy and were captured and brought back
"to New Providence, were tried and actually hanged by Rogers's late"
buccaneer subjects.
Woodes Rogers eventually died in Nassau in the year 1729.
between the Governing Class and the People. Curiously enough the
respective responsive characteristics of the Anglo Saxon and the Indians
are paralleled by the two types of responses seen in all living matter.
In the one type the response is slow but proportionate to the stimulus
that excites it. The response grows with the strength of external force.
In the other it is quite different--here it is an all-or-none principle.
It either responds to the utmost or nothing at all. This is also
illustrated in the different racial characteristics. The Anglo Saxon has
"even by his rights by struggle, step by step. The insignificant little"
"has, by accumulation, became large, and which has been gained, has been"
gained for all time. But in the Indian the ideal and the emotional are
"the only effective stimulus. The ideal of his King is Rama, who"
renounced his kingdom and even his beloved for an idea. One day a king
and another day a bare-footed wanderer in the forest! Who cares? All or
nothing!
The concessions made by a modern form of Government safeguarded by
necessary limitations may appear almost as grudging gifts. The Indian
wants something which comes with unhesitating frankness and warmth and
strikes his ideality and imagination. But ancient and modern kingship
are sometimes at one in direct and spontaneous pronouncement of the
royal sympathy. Such was the Proclamation of Queen Victoria which
stirred to its depths the popular heart.
"""In the Prosperity of Our subjects will be our strength, in their"
"contentment Our security, in their Gratitude Our best Reward."""
That there are increasingly frequent reflexes in our Government to
popular needs and wishes is happily illustrated at a most opportune
moment from the statements in the recent _Gazette of India_ and cables
received from London. In the former we find that the Viceroy and his
council had recommended the abolition of the system of indentured
"found the Guaymies, the only primitive people living in large numbers"
"outside the Darien. There are about 5000 of them, living for the most"
"part in the valley of Mirando which lies high up in the Cordilleras, and"
in a region cut off from the plains. Here they have successfully
defended their independence against the assaults of both whites and
blacks. To remain in their country without consent of the Great Chief is
"practically impossible, for they are savage fighters and in earlier days"
it was rare to see a man whose body was not covered with scars. It is
apparent that in some ways progress has destroyed their industries and
"made the people less rather than more civilized, for they now buy cloth,"
"arms, tools, and utensils which they were once able to make. At one time"
"they were much under the influence of the Catholic missionaries, but of"
late mission work has languished in wild Panama and perhaps the chief
relic of that earlier religious influence is the fact that the women go
"clothed in a single garment. This simple raiment, not needed for warmth,"
"seems to be prized, for if caught in a rainstorm the women will quickly"
"strip off their clothing, wrap it in a large banana or palm leaf that it"
"may not get wet, and continue their work, or their play, in nature’s"
garb.
"It is said, too, that when strangers are not near clothes are never"
"thought of. The men follow a like custom, and invariably when pursuing a"
"quarry strip off their trousers, tying their shirts about their loins."
"Trousers seem to impede their movements, and if a lone traveler in"
Chiriqui comes on a row of blue cotton trousers tied to the bushes he
may be sure that a band of Guaymies is somewhere in the neighborhood
pursuing an ant bear or a deer.

Have the overhand: in me it is verified.
"Pray for me, good people, I beseech you heartily,"
That the Lord above on my poor soul have mercy.

"Farewell men of law, with the whole commonalty."

And desire God to pardon your iniquity.

"Prompted by a different motive, yet not far removed in actual effect"
"from the politico-religious class of play represented by _New Custom_,"
are the early Interludes of John Heywood. It is quite impossible to read
such a play as _The Pardoner and the Friar_ and believe that its author
wrote under any such earnest and sober inspiration as did the author of
"_New Custom_. His intention was frankly to amuse, and to paint life as"
he saw it without the intrusion of unreal personages of highly virtuous
but dull ideas. Yet he swung the lash of satire as cuttingly and as
merrily about the flanks of ecclesiastical superstition as ever did the
creator of Perverse Doctrine.[47]
"The simplest plot sufficed Heywood, and the minimum of characters. _The"
Pardoner and the Friar_ (possibly as early as 1520) demands only four
"persons, while the plot may be summed up in a few sentences, thus: A"
"Pardoner and a Friar, from closely adjoining platforms, are endeavouring"
"to address the same crowd, the one to sell relics, the other to beg"
money for his order. By a sort of stichomythic alternation each for a
"time is supposed to carry on his speech regardless of the other, so that"
to follow either connectedly the alternate lines must be read in
"sequence. But every now and then they break off for abuse, and finally"
they fight. A Parson and neighbour Prat interfere to convey them to jail
"""Certainly I will!""--and Villiers, accepting her card, on which was"
"inscribed her own private name and address, shook hands once more, and"
bowed her courteously out. No sooner had the door closed upon her than
"he sprang upstairs, three steps at a time, and broke impetuously in"
"upon Alwyn, who, seated at a table covered with papers, looked up with"
a surprised smile at the abrupt fashion of his entrance. In a few
minutes he had disburdened himself of the whole story of the
"""Tiger-Lily's"" visit, telling it in a whimsical way of his own, much to"
"the amusement of his friend, who listened, pen in hand, with a"
"half-laughing, half-perplexed light in his fine, poetic eyes."
"""Now did I express the proper opinion?"" he demanded in conclusion. ""Was"
"I not right in thinking you would never consent to be interviewed?"""
"""Right? Why of course you were!""--responded Alwyn quickly. ""Can you"
imagine me calmly stating the details of my personal life and history
"to a strange woman, and allowing her to turn it into a half-guinea"
"article for some society journal! But, Villiers, what an extraordinary"
"state of things we are coming to, if the Press can actually condescend"
"to employ a sort of spy, or literary detective, to inquire into the"
private experience of each man or woman who comes honorably to the
"front!"""
"""Honorably or DIShonorably,--it doesn't matter which,""--said Villiers,"
"""That is just the worst of it. One day it is an author who is"
"'interviewed,' the next it is a murderer,--now a statesman,--then a"
"ballet dancer,--the same honor is paid to all who have won any distinct"
"notoriety. And what is so absurd is, that the reading million don't"
seem able to distinguish between 'notoriety' and 'fame.' The two things
"are so widely, utterly apart! Byron's reputation, for instance, was"
much more notoriety during his life than fame--while Keats had actually

"A wild, wet September day was drawing to its close, amid pelting squalls"
"of cold rain, when a tall young man, gaunt and hollow-eyed, pushed his"
way into a small coffee-house in an obscure thoroughfare somewhere in
"the region of Drury Lane, and took a seat in a dark corner as near to"
"the stove as he could get, for he looked pinched with cold, and his"
plain and rather threadbare black suit was pretty well wet through.  As
"soon as he was seated, he drew from his breast a roll of paper, which he"
"regarded with solicitude.  That at least was dry, and he heaved a sigh"
that sounded like one of satisfaction.
"In this narrow street the daylight had completely faded, though it was"
not yet six o’clock.  The room was furthermore darkened by clouds of
tobacco smoke which the guests were puffing forth.  The smell of coffee
"mingled with the ranker fumes of the tobacco, and the clink of cup and"
"spoon made ceaseless accompaniment to the talk, which went on in a"
continuous stream.
"Grey (for it was he) leaned his head on his hand wearily, and fell into"
something like a doze as he sat in his shadowy corner.  He was exhausted
"in mind and in body.  He was faint with hunger, and yet half afraid to"
"order food; for his funds were dwindling almost to the vanishing point,"
and as yet he had found no means of replenishing his exchequer. But he
had not been able to resist the temptation to escape from the buffetings
"of the tempest, and when the boy in attendance upon the guests came to"
"ask his pleasure, he ordered some coffee and bread, and devoured it with"
a ravenous appetite when it was set before him.
"The pangs of hunger stayed, if not appeased, he began to look about him,"
And thus they speak till far on in the night or till they have
"quarrelled, the usual result of drink or of passions engendered by such"
discussions.
"The rain beats on the windows, and outside the cold wind is blowing."
"The eating-house is close with tobacco smoke, but it is warm, while the"
"street is cold and wet.  Now and then, the wind beats threateningly on"
"the windows of the eating-house, as if bidding these men to come out"
and be scattered like dust over the face of the earth.  Sometimes a
stifled and hopeless groan is heard in its howling which again is
"drowned by cold, cruel laughter.  This music fills one with dark, sad"
"thoughts of the approaching winter, with its accursed short, sunless"
"days and long nights, of the necessity of possessing warm garments and"
plenty to eat.  It is hard to sleep through the long winter nights on
"an empty stomach.  Winter is approaching.  Yes, it is approaching..."
How to live?
These gloomy forebodings created a strong thirst among the inhabitants
"of the main street, and the sighs of the ""creatures that once were men"""
"increased with the wrinkles on their brows, their voices became thick"
and their behaviour to each other more blunt.  And brutal crimes were
"committed among them, and the roughness of these poor unfortunate"
"outcasts was apt to increase at the approach of that inexorable enemy,"
who transformed all their lives into one cruel farce.  But this enemy
could not be captured because it was invisible.
"Then they began beating each other brutally, and drank till they had"
drunk everything which they could pawn to the indulgent Vaviloff.  And
"thus they passed the autumn days in open wickedness, in suffering which"
"was eating their hearts out, unable to rise out of this vicious life"
and in dread of the still crueller days of winter.
"It was vital to stop this lying but insidious propaganda, and the"
first step was to prevent German agents from entering India at all.
To do this the nomad tribes of the Sarhad must be brought back into
line with their old policy of friendship with Britain. Hence my
orders from General Kirkpatrick.
He instructed me to proceed without a moment's unnecessary delay to
"Quetta, where I was to receive more detailed instructions."
"On leaving him I hurried, with car and native chauffeur, to the"
"railway station, and asked for a truck on which to place the car"
for entrainment to Nushki. The station-master assured me I was
"asking for an impossibility. A great Maharajah, then travelling, had"
"commandeered every available truck for his suite, luggage and cars."
I told him that the Government business on which I had been sent was
"all important, and, by a little persuasion, soon had myself on the"
way to Pindi and the car on the way to Nushki.
Arrived at Pindi I found I had exactly one hour left in which to
"catch the train for Quetta. There was no time to pack, sort out kit,"
"or decide what should, or should not, be taken on a campaign which"
"might last only a few weeks or many months, and which might assume"
"a political aspect sooner than expected. My servant, Allah-dad, was"
therefore directed to take everything for sorting out when time could
"be spared, and I rushed off to try and ""do a deal"" with General Sir"
"Gerald Kitson, before starting."
I realised that a motor-car might play an important part in this
"prospective campaign, as it would be necessary to travel for long"
"distances in a land of no railways and no regular roads, the best"
road to be hoped for probably being a sandy track used by camel
caravans. I had already had some experience of difficult motoring
"the pearl was afterward sold in Paris for $12,000 it is quite evident"
"that the share of the middleman, of whom political economists just now"
"talk so much, was heavy. The Panama pearls are sometimes of beautiful"
"colors, green, pale blue and a delicate pink. On the Chiriqui coast a"
"year or two ago a pearl weighing about forty-two carats, about the size"
"and shape of a partridge egg, greenish black at the base and shading to"
"a steel gray at the tip, was found. It was sold in Paris for $5000."
"[Illustration: A DAY’S SHOOTING, GAME MOSTLY MONKEYS]"
It is a curious fact that the use of mussels from our western rivers is
one cause for the decadence of the Panama pearl industry. For years the
actual expense of maintaining these fisheries was met by the sale of the
shell for use in making buttons and mother-of-pearl ornaments. The
"pearls represented the profit of the enterprise, which was always"
therefore more or less of a gamble--but a game in which it was
"impossible to lose, though the winnings might be great or small"
according to luck. Now that the demand for pearl oyster shells has
"fallen off, owing to the competition of mussels, the chances in the game"
are rather against the player and the sport languishes.
[Illustration: THE GOVERNMENT SCHOOL OF HAT MAKING]
[Illustration: BEGINNING A PANAMA HAT]
The authorities of the Republic are making some effort to establish a
system of industrial schools which may lead to the fuller utilization of
the natural resources of the country. Every tourist who visits the
Isthmus is immediately taught by one who has been there a day or two
longer than he that Panama hats are not made in Panama. This seems to
be the most precious information that anyone on the Zone has to impart.
Most of the hats there sold are indeed made in Ecuador and the name
Perhaps it may be as well to turn aside from the orderly and informative
discussion of the statistics of the Zone to expand a little further here
upon the remarkable matrimonial phenomena it presented in its halcyon
"days--for it must be remembered that even as I am writing, that society,"
"which I found so hospitable and so admirable, has begun to disintegrate."
"Marriage, it must be admitted, is a somewhat cosmopolitan passion. It"
attacks spiggotty and gringo alike. In an earlier chapter I have
described how the low cost of living enabled Miguel of the Chagres
country to set up a home of his own. Let us consider how the benevolent
arrangements made by the Isthmian Canal Commission impelled a typical
American boy to the same step.
Probably it was more a desire for experience and adventure than any idea
of increased financial returns that led young Jack Maxon to seek a job
in engineering on the Canal. Graduated from the engineering department
"of a State university, with two years or so of active experience in the"
"field, Jack was a fair type of young American--clean, wholesome,"
"healthy, technically trained, ambitious for his future but quite"
"solicitious about the pleasures of the present, as becomes a youth of"
twenty-three.
[Illustration: MAIN STREET AT GORGONA]
The job he obtained seemed at the outset quite ideal. In the States he
could earn about $225 a month. The day he took his number on the Canal
Zone he began to draw $250 a month. And that $250 was quite as good as
"$300 at home. To begin with he had no room-rent to pay, but was assigned"
"comfortable if not elegant quarters, which he shared with one other man;"
"carefully screened and protected from all insects by netting, lighted by"
"electricity, with a shower-bath handy and all janitor or chambermaid"
service free. Instead of a boarding-house table or a cheap city
stricken farmhouse. But only La Giralda gave a thought to the little
"grave in the shady corner of the garden, and only she promised herself"
to revisit it when the stern work of the night should be over and the
dawn of a calmer morning should have arisen.
"Now, as soon as Sergeant Cardono returned, he placed himself as"
completely as formerly under the orders of Rollo. He was no more José
"Maria the famous gipsy, but Sergeant Cardono of the army of H.M. Carlos"
"Quinto, and Señor Rollo was his colonel. Like a good scout he was ready"
"to advise, but to the full as ready to hold his tongue and obey."
"And Rollo, though new to his position, was not above benefiting"
"continually by his wisdom, and as a matter of fact it was the Sergeant"
"who, in conjunction with La Giralda, led the little expedition down the"
perilous goat-track by which the old gipsy had followed her flock in the
"morning. As usual Concha kept her place beside Rollo, with Mortimer and"
"Etienne a little behind, while El Sarria, taciturn but alert as usual,"
brought up the rear.
It can hardly be said that they carried with them any extraordinary
"elements of success. Indeed, in one respect they were at a manifest"
disadvantage. For in an expedition of this kind there ought to be one
"leader of dignity, character, and military genius far beyond the others."
But among this little band which stole so quietly along the
"mountain-paths of the Guadarrama, beneath the frowning snow-clad brow of"
"Peñalara, there was not one who upon occasion could not have led a"
similar forlorn hope. Each member of the party possessed a character
definite and easily to be distinguished from all the others. It was an
army of officers without any privates.
"Still, since our Firebrand, Rollo the Scot, held the nominal leadership,"
"and his quick imperious character made that chieftainship a reality,"
depression on the stone wall by which we descend to the lower dungeon
"is shown as the spot against which St. Peter's head rested, though our"
guide had just told us that these stairs were not in existence then and
prisoners were let down into the dungeon through the hole in the middle
of the stone floor. Such trifling discrepancies do not seem to trouble
the average Italian mind.
St. Peter and St. Paul are said to have been bound in this prison for
"nine months to a pillar, which is shown here. ""A fountain of excellent"
water beneath the floor of the prison is attributed to the prayers
"of St. Peter, that he might have wherewith to baptize his gaolers,"
"Processus and Martinianus; but, unfortunately for this ecclesiastical"
"tradition, the fountain is described by Plutarch as having existed at"
"the time of Jugurtha's imprisonment"" here, long before the time of St."
Peter.
"Another miraculous spring, still flowing, is shown in the Church of SS."
Cosmo and Damiano as that which burst forth in answer to the prayers of
"Felix IV., that he might have water to baptize his disciples."
[Sidenote: What the Head of St. Paul Did.]
But the most interesting of all the miraculous springs in or around
"Rome are the three fountains, about two miles from the city, where the"
Apostle Paul was executed. When his head was severed from his body it
"bounded from the earth three times, crying out thrice, ""Jesus! Jesus!"
"Jesus!"" A fountain burst from the ground at each of the three spots"
"where the severed head struck. It is asserted, in proof of this origin"
"of the fountains, that the water of the first is still warm, of the"
"second tepid, and of the third cold, but we drank of them one after"
another without being able to detect any difference in temperature. The
apostle's head is shown in bas relief upon the three altars above the
policy of emperor and pope. People wanted to use his name and make him
choose sides. And that he would not do for any consideration. He wrote
evasively to the Pope about his relations with Luther without altogether
disavowing him. How zealously he defends himself from the suspicion of
"being on Luther's side as noisy monks make out in their sermons, who"
summarily link the two in their scoffing disparagement.
But by the other side also he is pressed to choose sides and to speak
out. Towards the end of October 1520 the coronation of the emperor took
place at Aix-la-Chapelle. Erasmus was perhaps present; in any case he
"accompanied the Emperor to Cologne. There, on 5 November, he had an"
interview about Luther with the Elector Frederick of Saxony. He was
persuaded to write down the result of that discussion in the form of
twenty-two _Axiomata concerning Luther's cause_. Against his intention
they were printed at once.
Erasmus's hesitation in those days between the repudiation and the
approbation of Luther is not discreditable to him. It is the tragic
defect running through his whole personality: his refusal or inability
ever to draw ultimate conclusions. Had he only been a calculating and
"selfish nature, afraid of losing his life, he would long since have"
altogether forsaken Luther's cause. It is his misfortune affecting his
"fame, that he continually shows his weaknesses, whereas what is great in"
him lies deep.
"At Cologne Erasmus also met the man with whom, as a promising young"
"humanist, fourteen years younger than himself, he had, for some months,"
"shared a room in the house of Aldus's father-in-law, at Venice:"
"Hieronymus Aleander, now sent to the Emperor as a papal nuncio, to"
"persuade him to conform his imperial policy to that of the Pope, in the"
"matter of the great ecclesiastical question, and give effect to the"
papal excommunication by the imperial ban.
in the course of a few days he became a raving lunatic.
"Often the keepers, although only condemned to imprisonment for a"
"certain period at a time, have to tolerate a longer stay, owing to"
the relief-boat being unable to approach them. In some instances the
delay may run into five weeks or more. During the winter the relief of
"the Eddystone, Longships, Wolf, Fastnet, Skerryvore, and Dhu-Heartach"
lights is always a matter of extreme uncertainty. Although the men
"have to provide themselves with supplies, a reserve is maintained at"
the station by the authorities for such emergencies. Even some of the
land stations are not approachable readily. There is the Punta Gorda
"light-station on the Californian coast, the situation of which is wild"
"and forbidding. There is a landing about eight miles above the station,"
"but it is extremely precarious. Still, unless a certain element of risk"
"is accepted in coming ashore here, it is necessary to face a tramp or"
stage journey of nearly fifty miles across country in order to gain the
lighthouse.
"The lighthouses in the Red Sea are, perhaps, among the most unenviable"
"and trying in the world. This stretch of water, lying between two"
"blistered coasts of sand, is no more or less than an oven, where even"
the strongest constitution finds it difficult to hold out for long.
"Moreover, the absence of civilization, owing to the extreme aridity of"
"the country, renders the life exceptionally depressing. In the summer"
the heat is wellnigh intolerable. The thermometer hovers between 95°
"and 110° F. in the shade throughout the twenty-four hours, so that"
night brings no relief to the oppressiveness.
"At some of the stations the men seek a little diversion, and"
"incidentally add occasionally to their pocket-money, by shark-catching,"
"which is a tolerably profitable pursuit, since these waters are thickly"
infested with this fish. The jawbone and backbone invariably find ready
"situation as a hall porter or waiter, but I can see that you ought to"
"be a soldier in the army, because you are no fool, are patient and"
"understand discipline. Life shuffles us like cards, you see, and it is"
"only accidentally, and only for a time, that we fall into our own"
"places!"""
Such farewell speeches often served as a preface to the continuation of
"their acquaintance, which again began with drinking and went so far"
that the client would spend his last farthing.  Then the Captain would
"stand him treat, and they would drink all they had."
A repetition of similar doings did not affect in the least the good
relations of the parties.
The teacher mentioned by the Captain was another of those customers who
were thus reformed only in order that they should sin again.  Thanks to
"his intellect, he was the nearest in rank to the Captain, and this was"
"probably the cause of his falling so low as dosshouse life, and of his"
inability to rise again.  It was only with him that Aristid Kuvalda
could philosophise with the certainty of being understood.  He valued
"this, and when the reformed teacher prepared to leave the dosshouse in"
"order to get a corner in town for himself, then Aristid Kuvalda"
"accompanied him so sorrowfully and sadly that it ended, as a rule, in"
their both getting drunk and spending all their money.  Probably
Kuvalda arranged the matter intentionally so that the teacher could not
"leave the dosshouse, though he desired to do so with all his heart."
"Was it possible for Aristid Kuvalda, a nobleman (as was evident from"
"his speeches), one who was accustomed to think, though the turn of fate"
"may have changed his position, was it possible for him not to desire to"
have close to him a man like himself?  We can pity our own faults in
others.
"billet fell they heard a groaning, as though some one were wrestling"
"with death, and then the squall had passed."
"""Heaven be praised!"" said the crew--and the captain added: ""I am going"
"to let the company know that you saved ship and cargo."""
"""That's all very well, but we are not through yet,"" said the boy, ""there"
"is worse to come,"" and he told them to reef every last rag, as well as"
what had been left of the topsails. The second squall hit them with even
"greater force than the first, and was so vicious and violent that the"
"whole crew was frightened. While it was at its worst, the boy told them"
to throw overboard the second cord; and they threw it over billet by
"billet, and took care not to take any from the third cord. When the last"
"billet fell, they again heard a deep groan, and then all was still. ""Now"
"there will be one more squall, and that will be the worst,"" said the"
"boy, and sent every one to his station. There was not a hawser loose on"
the whole ship.
The last squall hit them with far more force than either of the
"preceding ones, the ship laid over on her side so that they thought she"
"would not right herself again, and the breaker swept over the deck."
"But the boy told them to throw the last cord of wood overboard, billet"
"by billet, and no two billets at once. And when the last billet of wood"
"fell, they heard a deep groaning, as though some one were dying hard,"
"and when all was quiet once more, the whole sea was the color of blood,"
as far as eye could reach.
"When they reached land, the captain and the quartermasters spoke of"
"writing to their wives. ""That is something you might just as well let"
"be,"" said the cabin-boy, ""seeing that you no longer have any wives."""
where I found Frances and Bettina luxuriating in tearful sympathy.
"I walked home with Bettina, and she invited me to go to her parlor to"
"have a cup of tea. To see Bettina boil the tea (steep it or draw it, she"
said was the proper phrase) was as pretty a sight as one could wish to
"behold, and when she poured it out in thin china cups, handing one to"
"me and taking one herself, her pride in following the fashion of modish"
ladies was as touching as it was simple and beautiful. It was almost more
"than my feeble resolutions could withstand, so when I was about to leave"
"I had a great battle with myself and was defeated, for I seized her"
"hands, and although I said nothing, she knew what was in my mind, so she"

I had read repeatedly the story of the bringing of St. Mark's bones
"from Alexandria, in Egypt, to their present resting-place in St. Mark's"
Cathedral at Venice--a story which is related as follows in that same
lively volume:
"""St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt. He was martyred, I think."
"However, that has nothing to do with my legend. About the founding of"
the city of Venice--say four hundred and fifty years after Christ--(for
"Venice is much younger than any other Italian city), a priest dreamed"
that an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought
"to Venice, the city could never rise to high distinction among the"
"nations; that the body must be captured, brought to the city, and"
a magnificent church built over it; and that if ever the Venetians
"allowed the Saint to be removed from his new resting-place, in that"
day Venice would perish from off the face of the earth. The priest
"proclaimed his dream, and forthwith Venice set about procuring the"
"corpse of St. Mark. One expedition after another tried and failed, but"
This table shows in its second column the prices paid by the
"Sinaketans to the industrial villages of Kuboma, a district in the"
Northern Trobriands. In the third column what they receive in Dobu
"is recorded. The table has been obtained from a Sinaketan informant,"
"and it probably is far from accurate, and the transactions are sure"
"to vary greatly in the gain which they afford. There is no doubt,"
"however, that for each article, the Sinaketan would ask the price"
which he paid for them as well as some extra article.
Thus we see that there is in this transaction a definite gain obtained
by the middlemen. The natives of Sinaketa act as intermediaries
"between the industrial centres of the Trobriands and Dobu, whereas"
their hosts play the same rôle between the Sinaketans and the men
from the outlying districts.
"Besides trading and obtaining of Kula valuables, the natives of"
"Sinaketa visit their friends and their distant relatives, who, as we"
"saw before, are to be found in this district owing to migrations. The"
"visitors walk across the flat, fertile plain from one hamlet to the"
"other, enjoying some of the marvellous and unknown sights of this"
"district. They are shown the hot springs of Numanuma and of Deyde'i,"
"which are in constant eruption. Every few minutes, the water boils up"
"in one spring after another of each group, throwing up jets of spray"
"a few metres high. The plain around these springs is barren, with"
nothing but here and there a stunted kind of eucalyptus tree. This
is the only place in the whole of Eastern New Guinea where as far
"as I know, eucalyptus trees are to be found. This was at least the"
"information of some intelligent natives, in whose company I visited"
"the springs, and who had travelled all over the Eastern islands and"
the East end of the mainland.

"get therefrom, and the probable expenses it would incur; not to speak of"
the result of any possible failure. It may be presumed that Japan would
not tamely be intimidated by any action undertaken by any country which
"is not based on justice and equity, and which, therefore, is not open to"
reason.
"Further, is there any country which would willingly embark on such an"
enterprise single-handed? I think not. The reason is too obvious for me
to elucidate.
"Putting aside altogether any question of justice and equity, if such an"
"enterprise is to be embarked upon at all, it would have to be by common"
"action of all the Western Powers, somewhat similar to that when the"
combined forces of Europe rose against France some hundred years ago.
But let me ask if such a thing is possible under the present
circumstances? The claims of Japan to the kind consideration of humanity
have already become so widely spread that she could no longer be
"trampled upon easily. Man is, after all, a rational being. Do the"
writers of the articles on the Yellow Peril (articles which even now
repeatedly make their appearance) not know the fact that even in France
there is a large number of people who have recently purchased Japanese
"bonds, not to speak of Germany, where those bonds have been openly"
floated by banks of high standing? Even if all the governments of the
"West should be willing to agree to such an enterprise, I do not think"
the people at large would move with them.
"Japan is modest enough, Japan is honest enough. Why does she deserve a"
"general ostracism? She might become, it is possible, a Power of the"

"occidental civilisation, after which she strives so earnestly. Are these"

air extended the upper half of the ship of space--a sullen gray expanse
"of fifty-inch hardened steel armor, curving smoothly upward to a needle"
prow. Countless hundred of fine vertical scratches marred every inch
"of her surface, and here and there the stubborn metal was grooved and"
scored to a depth of inches--each scratch and score the record of an
attempt of some wandering cosmic body to argue the right-of-way with
the stupendous mass of that man-made cruiser of the void.
"A burly young man made his way through the throng about the entrance,"
"nodded unconcernedly to the gatekeeper, and joined the stream of"
passengers flowing through the triple doors of the double air-lock
"and down a corridor to the center of the vessel. However, instead of"
entering one of the elevators which were whisking the passengers up to
"their staterooms in the upper half of the enormous football, he in some"
way caused an opening to appear in an apparently blank steel wall and
stepped through it into the control room.

what must happen; no one knew exactly what was going to happen. The
"elder men gathered round Puttock and Jewell, and listened to a"
demonstration that the Premier's public life was at an end; the younger
"rallied Coxon, whose premature stateliness sometimes invited this"
"treatment, dubbing him ""Kingmaker Coxon,"" and hilariously repudiating"
the idea that he did not enjoy the title. Captain Heseltine dropped in
about eleven; cross-questioning drew from him the news that
"communications had passed, informal communications, he insisted, from"
"the Governor to Sir Robert, as well as to the Premier."
"""In fact,"" he said, ""poor old Flemyng's cutting up and down all over"
"the place. Glad it's his night on duty."""
"Presently Mr. Flemyng himself appeared, clamorous for cigars and drink,"
"but mighty discreet and vexatiously reticent. Yes, he had taken a letter"
"to Medland; yes, and another to Perry; no, he had no idea what the"
missives were about. He believed Medland was to see the Governor
"to-morrow, but it was beyond him to conjecture the precise object of the"
"interview. Was it resignation or dissolution? Really, he knew no more"
"than that waiter--and so forth; very likely his ignorance was real, but"
he diffused an atmosphere of suppressed knowledge which whetted the
curiosity of his audience to the sharpest edge.
A messenger entered and delivered a note to Puttock and another to
"Coxon. The two compared their notes for a moment, and went out together."
"The arguments rose furiously again, some maintaining that Medland must"
"disappear altogether, others vehemently denying it, a third party"
preferring to await the disclosures at the inquest before committing
themselves to an opinion. An hour passed; the noise in the streets began
"to abate, and the clock of the Roman Catholic cathedral hard by struck"
"twelve. Captain Heseltine yawned, stretched, and rose to his feet."
"Unusual words, proper names, and figures should be written out with the"

ESTIMATING THE MANUSCRIPT
The usual procedure in making a book is as follows: When the publisher
"sends the manuscript to the printer, a request goes with it for a"
"sample page, set to a size and in a type which will make a volume of"
the desired number of pages. A novel is supposed to run from 320 pages
to 400 pages. The first thing to be done is to estimate the number of
"words in the manuscript, and this is accomplished by averaging the"
"number of words in say thirty lines, and then multiplying by the number"
"of lines on a page. No allowance is made for fractional lines, as these"
"also occur in the printed page. If the manuscript is carefully written,"
"each page will contain the same number of lines, so the total number"
"of words may be found by multiplying the number of words on the page,"
"as arrived at above, by the total number of pages in the manuscript."
This explains the importance of having a standard number of lines on
each page.[32] No allowance is made for fractional pages at the end of
"chapters, as there are also fractional pages in the printed book, and"
it averages up.
"The front matter has to be estimated separately, with allowance for"
"the blanks on the reverse of bastard-title, dedication, etc.,[33] but"
"the usual number of pages is eight. Then, again, an allowance of half"
a page for each chapter sinkage[34] has to be made. Suppose we have a
"manuscript of 90,000 words, with 24 chapters: A type page of 280 words"
"gives us 322 pages, to which we add 8 pages for front and 12 pages"
deeply agitated. The priests were rousing the people against the newly
decreed Civil Constitution of the Clergy; and one of these
disturbances endangered the life of Napoleon himself. He and his
brother Joseph chanced to pass by when one of the processions of
priests and devotees was exciting the pity and indignation of the
"townsfolk. The two brothers, who were now well known as partisans of"
"the Revolution, were threatened with violence, and were saved only by"
their own firm demeanour and the intervention of peacemakers.
"Then again, the concession of local self-government to the island, as"
"one of the Departments of France, revealed unexpected difficulties."
Bastia and Ajaccio struggled hard for the honour of being the official
"capital. Paoli favoured the claims of Bastia, thereby annoying the"
"champions of Ajaccio, among whom the Buonapartes were prominent. The"
"schism was widened by the dictatorial tone of Paoli, a demeanour which"
"ill became the chief of a civic force. In fact, it soon became"
apparent that Corsica was too small a sphere for natures so able and
masterful as those of Paoli and Napoleon Buonaparte.
The first meeting of these two men must have been a scene of deep
interest. It was on the fatal field of Ponte Nuovo. Napoleon doubtless
came there in the spirit of true hero-worship. But hero-worship which
"can stand the strain of actual converse is rare indeed, especially"
when the expectant devotee is endowed with keen insight and habits of
trenchant expression. One phrase has come down to us as a result of
the interview; but this phrase contains a volume of meaning. After
Paoli had explained the disposition of his troops against the French
"at Ponte Nuovo, Buonaparte drily remarked to his brother Joseph, ""The"
"result of these dispositions was what was inevitable."" [13]"
"For the present, Buonaparte and other Corsican democrats were closely"
"concerned with the delinquencies of the Comte de Buttafuoco, the"
"anchor and then hoists it up, one recoils from the black and slimy mud"
"those blue waves hide; and this circumstance, slight as it may seem,"
held a potent influence on our future.
"Riding nearby was another yacht, in size and design very much like the"
"_Whim_, except that her rigging had an old-fashioned cut. Her masts were"
"checked with age and, where our craft showed polished brass, she long"
"ago had resorted to white paint. At the same time, she gave the"
"impression of aristocracy--broken-down aristocracy, if you choose. No"
"bunting fluttered at her masthead, no country's emblem waved over her"
"taffrail, and the only hint of nationality or ownership was a rather"
"badly painted word _Orchid_ on her name plate. Taken altogether, she was"
rather difficult to place.
"These signs of poverty would have passed unobserved by us, had we not in"
coming to anchor swung between her moorings and the Machina wharf. Not
"that it made any serious difference, Gates explained, nor were we"
"impertinently near, but it just missed being the scrupulously polite"
thing to have done--and Gates was a stickler on matters of yacht
"etiquette. So he felt uncomfortable about it, while at the same time"
being reluctant to hoist anchor and foul our decks with the bottom of
Havana Bay. To be on the safe side he determined to megaphone apologies
"and consult her wishes. Twice he hailed, receiving no answer. Two"
sailors were seated forward playing cards--a surlier pair of ruffians
would have been hard to find--but neither of them so much as glanced up.
"""Let the professor try in Spanish,"" Tommy said."
"Monsieur took the megaphone and did so, but with no better success. Then"
to our profound admiration he called in half a dozen languages; finally
"growling: ""Lascars, likely!""--and proceeded to hail in something he"
afterwards explained was Lascar gibberish. All of which failed to
to be the case.
Grey had a faint misgiving at the first that no manager might be
forthcoming to admit the dialogue to his boards; but there the old actor
knew his ground.  He succeeded in inviting two of the most successful
"managers to listen to a performance in the attic, without the"
accessories which would add much to the effect upon the stage; and even
"so the scene proved so telling, the acting of the Old Lion was so superb"
"in its quiet dignity, and Grey (who had learned and studied patiently"
"and diligently) went through his part with such spirit, such power, such"
"dramatic energy, that even his instructor was surprised at his success,"
and the managers exchanged glances of astonishment and pleasure.
It was just the sort of piece to catch the public favour at this
"juncture.  Marlborough was still the idol of the nation, and might be"
expected home some time before the winter closed—perhaps before
"Christmas itself.  The nation was discussing how to do him honour, and"
would flock to see a piece wherein his praises were so ably sung.
"""With a wig such as the Duke wears, and with military dress, Mr. Grey"
"could be made to look the very image of the great General,"" cried one."
"""He has something the same class of face—handsome, regular features,"
grace of action and bearing. He does but want to be transformed from
"fair to dark, and his acting of the Duke will bring down veritable"
"thunders of applause from all."""
"And then began a gratifying rivalry as to terms, in which the Old Lion"
sustained his part with dignity and firmness.  Both managers desired to
"secure this interlude for their respective theatres, and at the last it"
was settled that the performance was to be given two nights a week at
"Drury Lane, and two at Sadler’s Wells, the astute old actor retaining"
"infant mind with the stories of his bold adventures, the numerous fights"
"in which he had taken part, the death of his companions and his"
hair-breadth escapes. Numerous were the decorations he bore. The most
conspicuous was an ugly mark on his breast left by an arrow and a hole
on the thigh caused by a spear thrust. The trust imposed on this
marauder proved to be not altogether ill placed for once in a river
journey we were pursued by several long boats filled with armed dacoits.
When these boats came too near for us to effect an escape the erstwhile
"dacoit leader, my attendant, stood up and gave a peculiar cry, which was"
evidently understood. For the pursuing boats vanished at the signal.
INDUSTRIAL EFFORTS
"I come now to another period of his life fifty years from now, when he"
foresaw the economic danger that threatened his country. This
Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition was one of the first means he
thought of to avert the threatened danger. Here also he attempted to
bring together other activities. Evening entertainments were given by
"the performances of ""Jatras,"" which have been the expression of our"
national drama and which have constantly enriched our Bengali literature
by the contributions of village bards and composers. There were athletic
tournaments also and display of physical strength and endurance. He also
"established here the people's Bank, which is now in a most flourishing"
"condition. He established industrial and technical schools, and it was"
there that the inventive bend of my mind received its first impetus. I
remember the deep impression made on my mind by the form of worship
rendered by the artisans to Viswakarma God in his aspect as the Great
Artificer: His hand it was that was moulding the whole creation; and it
"seemed that we were the instruments in his hand, through whom he"
intended to fashion some Great Design.
"mongrel château. His force was scattered out of sight, though for the"
"most part not out of hearing of each other. It was indeed true that,"
"owing to his excellent dispositions, and the fortunate situation of the"
"balconies, he was able to command every part of the castle enclosure,"
and especially the doors by which it was most likely that the chief
attempt would be made.
"So occupied had Rollo been with his affairs, both private and of a"
"military character, that he had actually wholly forgotten the presence"
"of the Queen-Regent, her daughter and husband, within the palace of La"
Granja. And this though he had come all that way across two of the
wildest provinces of Spain for the sole purpose of securing their
persons and transporting mother and daughter to the camp of Don Carlos.
"Nevertheless so instant was the danger which now overhung every one,"
that their intended captor had ceased to think of anything but how to
preserve these royal lives and to keep them from the hands of the
ruthless gipsies of the hills.
But circumstances quickly recalled the young man to his primary
"purpose, and taught him that he must not trust too much to those whose"
interests were opposed to his own.
"Rollo, as we have said, had reserved no station for himself, but"
"constantly circulated round all the posts of his little army, ready at"
any time to add himself to the effective forces of the garrison at any
threatened point. It was while he was thus passing from balcony to
balcony on the second or defending storey that his quick ear caught the
sound of a door opening and shutting on the floor beneath.
"""Ah,"" thought Rollo to himself, suspiciously, ""the Queen and her people"
are safe in their chambers on this floor. No person connected with the
defence ought to be down there. This is either treachery or the enemy
Till a few weeks ago it seemed that I shall have to look to the future
for securing the necessary expansion of scope and for permanence of the
Institute. But response is being awakened in answer to the need. The
Government have most generously intimated their desire to sanction
grants towards placing the Institute on a permanent basis the extent of
which will be proportionate to the public interest in this national
undertaking. Out of many who would feel an interest in securing adequate
"Endowment, the very first donations have come from two of the merchant"
"princes of Bombay, to whom I had been personally unknown."
A note that touched me deeply came from some girl students of the
"Western Province, enclosing their little contribution ""for the service"
"of our common motherland."" It is only the instinctive mother-heart that"
can truly realise the bond that draws together the nurselings of the
common homeland. There can be no real misgiving for the future when at
the country's call man offers the strength of his life and woman her
"active devotion, she most of all, who has the greater insight and larger"
faith because of the life of austerity and self-abnegation. Even a
solitary wayfarer in the Himalayas has remembered to send me message of
cheer and good hope. What is it that has bridged over the distance and
blotted out all differences? That I will come gradually to know; till
then it will remain enshrined as a feeling. And I go forward to my
"appointed task, undismayed by difficulties, companioned by the kind"
"thoughts of my well-wishers, both far and near."
INDIA'S SPECIAL APTITUDES IN CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE
The excessive specialisation of modern science in the West has led to
the danger of losing sight of the fundamental fact that there can be but
"one truth, one science which includes all the branches of knowledge. How"
from floor to ceiling of this very Hall. And beyond that arch the
"Laboratory merges imperceptibly into the garden, which is the true"
"laboratory for the study of Life. There the creepers, the plants and the"
"trees are played upon by their natural environments,--sunlight and wind,"
and the chill at midnight under the vault of starry space. There are
"other surroundings also, where they will be subjected to chromatic"
"action of different lights, to invisible rays, to electrified ground or"
thunder-charged atmosphere. Everywhere they will transcribe in their own
script the history of their experience. From this lofty point of
"observation, sheltered by the trees, the student will watch this"
"panorama of life. Isolated from all distractions, he will learn to"
attune himself with Nature; the obscuring veil will be lifted and he
will gradually come to see how community throughout the great ocean of
life outweighs apparent dissimilarity. Out of discord he will realise
the great harmony.
THE OUTLOOK
These are the dreams that wove a network round my wakeful life for many
"years past. The outlook is endless, for the goal is at infinity. The"
realisation cannot be through one life or one fortune but through the
co-operation of many lives and many fortunes. The possibility of a
fuller expansion will depend on very large endowments. But a beginning
"must be made, and this is the genesis of the foundation of this"
Institute. I came with nothing and shall return as I came; if something
"is accomplished in the interval, that would indeed be a privilege. What"
"I have I will offer, and one who had shared with me the struggles and"
"hardships that had to be faced, has wished to bequeath all that is hers"
for the same object. In all my struggling efforts I have not been

I almost smiled with self-contempt when I thought how I had set out the
"previous morning in order to conquer my old world, and how it was now"
receding further and further from me. I looked at the other readers.
"They were mostly old men, engrossed in their studies, just as they had"
been in peace time. I wondered what they thought about the war. I knew
they would not allow it to disturb them much or interfere with their
"studies and their sleep. And after all, why should they care? It was"
only youth that was being slaughtered on the battlefields and not old
age.
The sleepy dullness of the museum became unbearable and I walked out
into the street.
"I spent the evening with a member of the National Liberal Club, an"
"intimate family friend, whose intellectual arrogance was one of the evil"
"memories of my childhood, when many eager impulses and aspirations had"
been turned to bitterness by his lofty depreciation and his
imperturbable assumption of superiority based on maturer years and
experience. Having at different times received material kindnesses at
"his hands, I knew I could not tell him what I really thought, and the"
"prospect of meeting him filled me with uneasiness. Moreover, in his"
presence I felt a kind of pride which I did not usually feel in the
presence of others--a pride that forbade me to express any sentiment or
to reveal my inner mind. And yet my inner mind was clamouring
intolerably for revelation. I realized the advantage he would derive
"from his simple attitude and from his lack of mental integrity, which"
enabled him to ignore any considerations that did not conform to his
"preconceived notions, and I realized the disadvantage of my complex"
"attitude, made up as it was of so many conflicting impulses, at war with"
each other and with the world around me.

"drudgery, but, after all, we must have poetic justice in a Fairy Story,"
"occasionally, at any rate."
"Another such story is “Jesper and the Hares.” Here, however, it is"
"not at first resourcefulness that helps the hero, but sheer kindness"
"of heart, which prompts him first to help the ants, and then to"
"show civility to the old woman, without for a moment expecting any"
"material benefit from such actions. At the end, he does win by his own"
"ingenuity and resourcefulness, and if we regret that his _trickery_"
"has such wonderful results, we must remember that the aim was to win"
"the princess for herself, and that there was little choice left him. I"
consider the end of this story to be one of the most remarkable I have
found in my long years of browsing among Fairy Tales. I should suggest
"stopping at the words: “The Tub is full,” as any addition seems to"
destroy the subtlety of the story.[28]
"Another story of this kind, admirable for children from six years and"
"upwards, is “What the Old Man does is always Right.” Here, perhaps,"
the entire lack of common sense on the part of the hero would serve
"rather as a warning than a stimulating example, but the conduct of"
the wife in excusing the errors of her foolish husband is a model of
resourcefulness.
In the story of “Hereafter--this”[29] we have just the converse: a
perfectly foolish wife shielded by a most patient and forbearing
"husband, whose tolerance and common sense save the situation."
One of the most important elements to seek in our choice of stories is
"that which tends to develop, eventually, a fine sense of humour in a"
"child. I purposely use the word “eventually,” because I realise first"
"that humour has various stages, and that seldom, if ever, can you"

by hunting wild cattle and drying the flesh or boucan.
"He then sailed for a few voyages as a sailor before the mast, and acted"
"with such ability and courage that the Governor of Tortuga Island,"
"Monsieur de la Place, gave him the command of a vessel and sent him out"
to seek his fortune.
"At first the young buccaneer was very successful, and he took many Spanish"
"ships, but owing to his ferocious treatment of his prisoners he soon won a"
name for cruelty which has never been surpassed. But at the height of this
"success his ship was wrecked in a storm, and, although most of the pirates"
"got ashore, they were at once attacked by a party of Spaniards, and all"
"but L'Ollonais were killed. The captain escaped, after being wounded, by"
smearing blood and sand over his face and hiding himself amongst his dead
"companions. Disguised as a Spaniard he entered the city of Campeachy,"
"where bonfires and other manifestations of public relief were being held,"
to express the joy of the citizens at the news of the death of their
"terror, L'Ollonais."
"Meeting with some French slaves, the fugitive planned with them to escape"
"in the night in a canoe, this being successfully carried out, they"
"eventually arrived back at Tortuga, the pirate stronghold. Here the"
"enterprising captain stole a small vessel, and again started off ""on the"
"account,"" plundering a village called De los Cagos in Cuba. The Governor"
of Havana receiving word of the notorious and apparently resurrected
"pirate's arrival sent a well-armed ship to take him, adding to the ship's"
"company a negro executioner, with orders to hang all the pirate crew with"
"the exception of L'Ollonais, who was to be brought back to Havana alive"
and in chains.
"Instead of the Spaniards taking the Frenchman, the opposite happened, and"
populating the hospitals. It became necessary to guard all property in
"the warehouse districts, and men ceased to venture there alone after"
dark.
One circumstance caused Boyd no little surprise and uneasiness--the
fact that no vigorous effort had been made to fix the blame for the
"striker's death on that riotous afternoon. Surely, he reasoned, Marsh's"
"detective must have witnessed the killing, and must recognize the ease"
with which the act could now be saddled upon him. If delay were their
"object, Emerson could not understand why they did not seek to have him"
arrested. The consequences might well be serious if Marsh's money were
"used; but, as the days slipped past and nothing occurred, he decided"
"that he had been overfearful on this score, or else that the manager of"
the Packers' Trust had limits beyond which he would not push his
persecution.
"A half-mile from Captain Peasley's ship, the rival Company tenders were"
"loading rapidly with union labor, and it seemed that in spite of Boyd's"
"plan to be first at Kalvik, Marsh's force would beat him to the ground"
unless greater efforts were made. When he communicated these fears to
"Big George, the fisherman suddenly became a slave-driver. He passed"
"among his men, cajoling, threatening, bribing, and they began to work"
"like demons, with the result that when the twentieth arrived he was"
able to announce to his partner that the work would be finished some
time during the following morning.
The next day Emerson and Clyde drove down to the dock with Cherry in a
"closed carriage, experiencing no annoyance beyond some jeers and"
insults as they passed through the picket line. Boyd had barely seen
"them comfortably established on board, when up the ship's gangway came"
"""Fingerless"" Fraser radiantly attired, three heavily laden hotel"
"porters groaning at his back, the customary thick-waisted cigar between"
had continuous performances; there was Grand Opera; there were
"exhibitions of toys, or pictures, and charitable bazaars. Ten days"
after the fall of Antwerp _char-à-bancs_ packed with Belgians drove
out of Brussels to visit the scenes of the battles and those
"shattered forts, so fatuously deemed impregnable, so feeble in their"
resistance to German artillery.
"Vivie, even had she wished to do so, could not have joined the"
sight-seers. As the subjects of an enemy power she and her mother
had had early in January to register themselves at the Kommandantur
and were there warned that without a special passport they might not
pass beyond the limits of Brussels and its suburbs. Except in the
"matter of the farewell visit to the farm at Tervueren, Vivie was"
"reluctant to ask for any such favour from von Giesselin, though she"
was curious to see the condition of Louvain and to ascertain whether
her father still inhabited the monastic house of his order--she had
an idea that he was away in Germany in connection with his schemes
for raising the Irish against the British Government. Von Giesselin
however was becoming sentimentally inclined towards her and she saw
no more of him than was necessary to maintain polite relations. Frau
"von Giesselin, for various reasons of health or children, could not"
join him at Brussels as so many German wives had done with other of
the high functionaries (to the great embitterment of Brussels
society); and there were times when von Giesselin's protestations of
his loneliness alarmed her.
The King of Saxony had paid a visit to Brussels in the late autumn
of 1914 and had invited this Colonel of his Army to a fastuous
banquet given at the Palace Hotel. The King--whom the still defiant
"Brussels Press, especially that unkillable _La Libre Belgique_,"
"reminded ironically of his domestic infelicity, by enquiring"
whether he had brought Signor Toselli to conduct his orchestra--was
with other nations with whom they want to live in peace. And they
realise any predominant interest of a foreign country in their trade or
manufacture is sure to lead to misunderstanding and friction. Actuated
by this idea they have practically excluded all foreign manufactured
articles by prohibitive tariffs.
REVIVAL OF INDIAN INDUSTRIES
Is our country slow to realise the danger that threatens her by the
capture of her market and the total destruction of her industries? Does
she not realise that it is helpless passivity that directly provokes
aggression? Has not the recent happenings in China served as an object
"lesson? There is, therefore, no time to be lost and the utmost effort is"
demanded of the Government and the people for the revival of our own
industries. The various attempts that have hitherto been made have not
been as successful as the necessity of the case demands. The efforts of
the Government and of the people have hitherto been spasmodic and often
worked at cross purposes. The Government should have an advisory body
of Indian members. There should be some modification of rules as regards
selection of Industrial scholars. Before being sent out to foreign
countries they should be made to study the conditions of manufacture in
this country and its difficulties. For a particular industry there
"should be a co-ordinated group of three scholars, two for the industrial"
and one for the commercial side. Difficulties would arise in adapting
foreign knowledge to Indian conditions. This can only be overcome by the
"devoted labour of men of originality, who have been trained in our"
future Research Laboratory. The Government could also materially help
(i) by offering facilities for the supply of raw materials (ii) by
offering expert advice (iii) by starting experimental industries. He had
reason to think that the Government is full alive to the crucial
importance of the subject and is determined to take every step
"substantially borne out by Grattan, _Netherlands_, pp. 18, 34;"
"Blok, _Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Volk_, i, 159, 160,"
"305-11, Eng. tr. i, 203-8; Wauters, _Les libertés communales_,"
"1878, pp. 222-30. As is noted by Blok, the status of the peasantry"
"fluctuated, the thirteenth century being one of partial"
"retrogression. Cp. pp. 318, 319, as to the general depression of"
"the peasant class. The great impulse to slavery, as above noted,"
seems to have been given by the Norse pirates in general and the
"later Norman invaders, who, under Godfrey, forced every ""free"""
Frisian to wear a halter. The comparative protection accruing to
slaves of the Church was embraced by multitudes. In the time of the
"Crusades, again, many serfs were sold or mortgaged to the Church by"
the nobles in order to obtain funds for their expedition.
The cities were thus the liberating and civilising forces;[739] and the
application of townsmen's capital to the land was an early influence in
improving rural conditions.[740] But there was no escape from the
fatality of strife in the Teutonic any more than in the ancient Greek or
"in the contemporary Italian world. Flanders, having the large markets of"
"France at hand, developed its clothmaking and other industries more"
"rapidly than the Frisian districts, where weaving was probably earlier"
"carried on;[741] and here serfdom disappeared comparatively early,[742]"
the nobility dwindling through their wars; but the new industrial
"strifes of classes, which grew up everywhere in the familiar fashion,"
naturally matured the sooner in the more advanced civilisation; and
already at the beginning of the fourteenth century we find a resulting
disintegration. The monopoly methods of the trade gilds drove much of
"the weaving industry into the villages; then the Franco-Flemish wars,"
"wherein the townspeople, by expelling the French in despite of the"
"nobility, greatly strengthened their position,[743] nevertheless tended,"
"as did the subsequent civil wars, to drive trade into South Brabant."
Her strange behavior at that time had affected him more deeply than he
would have thought possible; and while he had purposely avoided
"thinking much about the banker's sudden change of front, back of his"
"devout thankfulness for the miracle was a vague suspicion, a curious"
feeling that made him uncomfortable in the girl's presence. He could
"not repent his determination to win at any price; yet he shrank, with a"
"moral cowardice which made him inwardly writhe, from owning that Cherry"
had made the sacrifice at which Clyde and the others had hinted. If it
"were indeed true, it placed him in an intolerable position, wherein he"
could express neither his gratitude nor his censure. No doubt she had
"read the signs of his mental confusion, and her own delicate"
sensibility had responded to it.
They remained side by side on the bridge while the day died amidst a
"wondrous panoply of color, each busied with thoughts that might not be"
"spoken, in their hearts emotions oddly at variance. The sky ahead of"
"them was wide-streaked with gold, as if for a symbol, interlaid with"
sooty clouds in silhouette; on either side the mountains rose from
penumbral darkness to clear-cut heights still bright from the slanting
radiance. Here and there along the shadowy shore-line a light was born;
the smell of the salt sea was in the air. Above the rhythmic pulse of
"the steamer rose the voices of men singing between decks, while the"
parting waters at the prow played a soft accompaniment. A steward
"summoned them to supper, but Boyd refused, saying he could not eat, and"
the girl stayed with him while the miles slowly slipped past and the
night encompassed them.
"""Two hours more,"" he told her, as the ship's bell sounded. ""Then I can"
"eat and sleep--and sing."""
Captain Peasley was pacing the bridge when later they breasted the
there was at least a chance that they might bring to a successful
conclusion the complex and difficult task which was before them.

"They now drew near to the palace, which, as one descends the mountains,"
"is approached first. The town of San Ildefonso lay further to the right,"
an indistinguishable mass of heaped roofs and turrets without a light or
the vestige of a street apparent in the gloom. It seemed to Rollo a
strange thing to think of this stricken town lying there with its dead
"and dying, its empty tawdry lodgings from which the rich and gay of the"
"Court had fled so hastily, leaving all save their most precious"
"belongings behind, the municipal notices on the door, white crosses"
"chalked on a black ground, while nearer and always nearer approached the"
fell gipsy rabble intent on plunder and rapine.
"Even more strange, however, seemed the case of the royal palace of La"
Granja. Erected at infinite cost after the pattern of Versailles and
"Marly, the smallness of its scale and the magnificence of its natural"
surroundings caused it infinitely to surpass either of its models in
"general effect. It had, however, never been intended for defence, nor"
had the least preparation been made in case of attack. It was doubtless
"presumed that whenever the Court sojourned there, the royal personages"
"would arrive with such a guard and retinue as, in that lonely place,"
would make danger a thing to be laughed at.
But no such series of circumstances as this had ever been thought of;
the plague which had fallen so heavily and as it seemed mysteriously and
instantaneously upon the town; the precincts of the palace about to be
invaded by a foe more fell than Frank or Moor; the guards disappeared
"like snow in the sun, and the only protection of the lives of the"
"Queen-Regent and her daughter, a band of Carlists sent to capture their"
"""Come, gezabo, let's court Dame Roulette! Join us, Jack?"""
"This I declined, and watched them move off arm in arm. But a strange"
"thing arrested my attention for, as they preceded down the corridor, I"
saw a man in yachting clothes--the uniform of a captain--draw quickly
back into an alcove as if wanting to escape discovery. When they had
"passed he looked out, more fearfully than curiously, and after a moment"
of indecision slowly followed them. Urged by a suspicion that this was
"in some way associated with the professor, I arose and also followed."
Yet upon reaching the salon the stranger was nowhere to be seen. Tommy
"and Monsieur were each buying a stack of chips, the place seemed quiet"
"and orderly, so without being observed I returned to my table."
"Now left alone I leaned back, idly twisting the stem of my glass,"
looking over the sea of merry people who made a picture that quickened
interest. For I am particularly fond of sitting apart and watching an
"assemblage of handsomely groomed men and women laughing, talking and"
making love. I like to guess whether fears or tears or desperate courage
hide behind their gayety; whether the rapidly wagging tongues are
uttering inanities or planning naughty things; whether the love-making
"will stop with coffee and liqueur, or, lighted by them, burn into"
eternity.
All phases of human banality and human enigma seemed to be represented.
There were languid beauties of the Latin type whose drooping eyes might
"have expressed _ennui_, passion, pride--anything, in fact, that one's"
"humor chose to fancy; the blonde by adoption was there, with heavy"
"ear-rings of jet, whose habit was that of looking slant-wise through her"
"cigarette smoke and raising one black, though carefully plucked,"
"eyebrow; also there were a few American women, by far the most smartly"
dressed. Great was the throb of life in this discreet and fashionable
"Gerard, who did the infamous deed, actually told his judges 'that he"
"would soon be a saint in heaven, and would have the first place there"
"next to God,' whilst his family received a patent of nobility, and"
entered into the possession of the estate of the Prince in the Franche
Comté--rewards promised for the commission of the crime by Cardinal
"Granvelle."" (Dr. Alexander Robertson's _Roman Catholic Church in"
"Italy_, p. 94.)"
These are some of the things that help to explain not only the tone
"of the pasquinades, not only the indictments of the world's leading"
"historians, which are to be presently cited, but also the present"
attitude of something like twenty millions of the thirty-odd millions
"of Italy's inhabitants, who have forsaken the church altogether."
What idea the people have of the Jesuits in particular is well shown
"by the legend connected with the Piazza del Gesu, the great open space"
"in front of the Jesuit church, which is considered the windiest place"
in Rome. The story is that the devil and the wind were one day taking a
"walk together. ""When they came to this square, the devil, who seemed to"
"be very devout, said to the wind, 'Just wait a minute, mio caro, while"
"I go into this church.' So the wind promised, and the devil went into"
"the Gesu, and has never come out again--and the wind is blowing about"
"in the Piazza del Gesu to this day."""
[Sidenote: Pasquino's View of the Pope.]
One of the interesting objects in Rome is a mutilated statue called
"Pasquino, which stands at the corner of the Orsini Palace, one of"
the most central and public places in the city. The reason for the
interest attaching to this almost shapeless piece of marble is that
for centuries it was used for placarding those satires upon the popes
"which, by their exceeding cleverness and biting truth, have made the"
done for those who left school for ever when they were twelve years
old.
"A generation ago Lord Sherbrooke, on the extension of the franchise,"
told his contemporaries that it was time to begin “to educate our
masters”--but we have not gone very far in our instruction of
"Christian Sociology, though as yet we have not adopted the Utilitarian"
"basis of morals accepted by the French Republic, and endeavoured to"
establish principles of duty towards man without any reference
whatever to a duty towards God.
Can any one be surprised if the plain man be perplexed when he is
called upon to decide questions of economy and morality without any
guiding principle? As a matter of fact he makes no such effort.
"“Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision, for the day of the"
"Lord is near in the valley of decisions,” but the sun and the moon are"
"darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. The puzzled popular"
"vote is but as the swing of the pendulum, first to this side, then to"
"the other. “These fellows have been no good, let us give the others a"
show.”
Yet assuredly there is a principle which is guidance and strength if
only men could discern it. There are Teachers who can tell men of its
"beneficent power, but they are as yet few in number, and their voices"
"are not sufficiently strong. When once these can get a hearing, men"
welcome their evangel and find in it a guide of life.
"I am persuaded that just as Bishop Butler, when he perused the preface"
"of his _Analogy_, had no prescience of the young fellow of Lincoln,"
who was in a few years to give the Christian faith a fresh hold in the
"hearts of the common people, who gladly heard him, so in our time many"
of our Bishops seem unable to perceive the dawn of another “day of the
because of the extraordinary uses and associations of it within the
last thousand years.
[Sidenote: A Winter Trip to Monza.]
"So, regardless of the wet, cold, foggy weather that we found in"
"Milan, and the rivers of mud and slush that were then doing duty for"
"streets, and the splotches of snow that lay here and there in the"
"forlorn-looking olive orchards, we took the electric tram, which was"
"comfortably heated, and ran out to Monza, a distance of some ten miles."
"When we stepped into the chilly cathedral and looked about us, we could"
"not at first see anybody to show us around, though there were a good"
many poor people saying their prayers there. Evidently the custodians
were not expecting tourists at such a season and in such weather.
"But presently, in an apartment to the left, we found a number of the"
priests warming their hands over a dish of twig coals covered with a
"light layer of white ashes, which they kindly stirred a little to make"
them give forth more heat as they saw us stretch our cold hands also
towards the grateful warmth.
[Sidenote: The Treasury of the Cathedral.]
"When we asked if we could see the Iron Crown, they said we could; but"
"instead of going at once to the chapel in which it is kept, they got a"
"great bag of keys, large keys, thirty-seven in number, as the observant"
"statistician of our party ascertained, and led us into the treasury and"
"unlocked a great number of doors (one of which had seven locks), and"
showed us the costly objects and precious relics above mentioned. We
"were only mildly interested in these--even in the apostolic baskets,"
"the Virgin's veil, and John the Baptist's tooth--partly because we were"
so cold and partly because of our greater interest in the more famous
relic which we had come especially to see.
"inadequate way, but for the help generously accorded from many"
"quarters. My heartfelt thanks are due to Lord Acton, Regius Professor"
"of Modern History in the University of Cambridge, for advice of the"
"highest importance; to Mr. Hubert Hall of the Public Record Office,"
"for guidance in my researches there; to Baron Lumbroso of Rome,"
"editor of the ""Bibliografia ragionata dell' Epoca Napoleonica,"" for"
"hints on Italian and other affairs; to Dr. Luckwaldt, Privat Docent of"
"the University of Bonn, and author of ""Oesterreich und die Anfänge des"
"Befreiungs-Krieges,"" for his very scholarly revision of the chapters"
"on German affairs; to Mr. F.H.E. Cunliffe, M.A., Fellow of All Souls'"
"College, Oxford, for valuable advice on the campaigns of 1800, 1805,"
"and 1806; to Professor Caudrillier of Grenoble, author of ""Pichegru,"""
for information respecting the royalist plot; and to Messrs. J.E.
"Morris, M.A., and E.L.S. Horsburgh, B.A., for detailed communications"
"concerning Waterloo, The nieces of the late Professor Westwood of"
"Oxford most kindly allowed the facsimile of the new Napoleon letter,"
"printed opposite p. 156 of vol. i., to be made from the original in"
their possession; and Miss Lowe courteously placed at my disposal the
"papers of her father relating to the years 1813-15, as well as to the"
St. Helena period. I wish here to record my grateful obligations for
"all these friendly courtesies, which have given value to the book,"
besides saving me from many of the pitfalls with which the subject
abounds. That I have escaped them altogether is not to be imagined;
"but I can honestly say, in the words of the late Bishop of London,"
"that ""I have tried to write true history."""

"[NOTE.--The references to Napoleon's ""Correspondence"" in the notes are"
"to the official French edition, published under the auspices of"
"Napoleon III. The ""New Letters of Napoleon"" are those edited by Léon"
"Lecestre, and translated into English by Lady Mary Loyd, except in a"
"stern islanders. In his charming romance, ""Colomba,"" M. Prosper"
"Mérimée has depicted the typical Corsican, even of the towns, as"
"preoccupied, gloomy, suspicious, ever on the alert, hovering about his"
"dwelling, like a falcon over his nest, seemingly in preparation for"
"attack or defence. Laughter, the song, the dance, were rarely heard in"
"the streets; for the women, after acting as the drudges of the"
"household, were kept jealously at home, while their lords smoked and"
"watched. If a game at hazard were ventured upon, it ran its course in"
"silence, which not seldom was broken by the shot or the stab--first"
warning that there had been underhand play. The deed always preceded
the word.
"In such a life, where commerce and agriculture were despised, where"
"woman was mainly a drudge and man a conspirator, there grew up the"
"typical Corsican temperament, moody and exacting, but withal keen,"
"brave, and constant, which looked on the world as a fencing-school for"
the glorification of the family and the clan[2]. Of this type Napoleon
was to be the supreme exemplar; and the fates granted him as an arena
a chaotic France and a distracted Europe.
Amidst that grim Corsican existence the Buonapartes passed their lives
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Occupied as advocates
and lawyers with such details of the law as were of any practical
"importance, they must have been involved in family feuds and the"
"oft-recurring disputes between Corsica and the suzerain Power, Genoa."
"As became dignitaries in the municipality of Ajaccio, several of the"
Buonapartes espoused the Genoese side; and the Genoese Senate in a
"document of the year 1652 styled one of them, Jérome, ""Egregius"
"Hieronimus di Buonaparte, procurator Nobilium."" These distinctions"
they seem to have little coveted. Very few families belonged to the
"Corsican _noblesse_, and their fiefs were unimportant. In Corsica, as"
"in the Forest Cantons of Switzerland and the Highlands of Scotland,"
right nor to the left. The constancy of his demeanour had its effect
upon the unseen enemy. The Sergeant was not further molested; and though
it was obvious that he advanced each step in about as great danger of
"death as a man who is marched manacled to the garrote, he might simply"
"have been going to his evening billet in some quiet Castilian village,"
for all the difference it made in his appearance.
"Up to this point Cardono had walked directly up the torrent bed, the"
rounded and water-worn stones rattling and slipping under his iron-shod
"half-boots, but at a certain point where was another rough cairn of"
"stones, he suddenly diverged to the right, and mounted straight up the"
fell over the scented thyme and dwarf juniper of the mountain slopes.
Whatever of uncertainty as to his fate the Sergeant felt was rigidly
"concealed, and even when a dozen men dropped suddenly upon him from"
"various rocky hiding-places, he only shook them off with a quick gesture"
"of contempt, and said something in a loud voice which brought them all"
to a halt as if turned to stone by an enchanter's spell.
"The men paused and looked at each other. They were all well armed, and"
every man had an open knife in his hand. They had been momentarily
"checked by the words of the Sergeant, but now they came on again as"
threateningly as before. Their dark long hair was encircled by red
"handkerchiefs knotted about their brows, and in general they possessed"
teeth extraordinarily white gleaming from the duskiest of skins. The
beady sloe-black eyes of the Sergeant were repeated in almost every
"face, as well as that indefinable something which in all lands marks the"
gipsy race.
The Sergeant spoke again in a language apparently more intelligible than
the deep Romany password with which he had first checked their deadly
intentions.
"In the twelve preceding chapters, we have followed an expedition"
from Sinaketa to Dobu. But branching off at almost every step from
"its straight track, we studied the various associated institutions"
"and underlying beliefs; we quoted magical formulæ, and told"
"mythical stories, and thus we broke up the continuous thread of the"
"narrative. In this chapter, as we are already acquainted with the"
"customs, beliefs and institutions implied in the Kula, we are ready"
to follow a straight and consecutive tale of an expedition in the
"inverse direction, from Dobu to Sinaketa."
"As I have seen, indeed followed, a big uvalaku expedition from"
"the South to the Trobriands, I shall be able to give some of the"
"scenes from direct impression, and not from reconstruction. Such"
a reconstruction for one who has seen much of the natives' tribal
life and has a good grip over intelligent informants is neither very
"difficult nor need it be fanciful at all. Indeed, towards the end"
"of my second visit, I had several times opportunities to check such"
"a reconstruction by witnessing the actual occurrence, for after my"
first year's stay in the Trobriands I had written out already some
"of my material. As a rule, even in minute details, my reconstructions"
"hardly differed from reality, as the tests have shown. None the less,"
it is possible for an Ethnographer to enter into concrete details
with more conviction when he describes things actually seen.
"In September, 1917, an uvalaku expedition was led by Kouta'uya"
"from Sinaketa to Dobu. The Vakutans joining them on the way, and the"
"canoes of the Amphletts following them also, some forty canoes finally"
arrived at the western shore of Dawson Straits. It was arranged then
and there that a return expedition from that district should visit
"Sinaketa in about six months' time. Kauyaporu, the esa'esa (headman)"
"of Kesora'i hamlet in the village of Bwayowa, had a pig with circular"
expressed the needs of his fellow-playmates when he said: “I want to go
to the place where the shadows are real.” This is the true definition
"of “Faerie” lands, and is the first sign of real mental development"
in the child when he is no longer content with the stories of his own
"little deeds and experiences, when his ear begins to appreciate sounds"
"different from the words in his own everyday language, and when he"
begins to separate his own personality from the action of the story.
George Goschen says[26]:
“What I want for the young are books and stories which do not simply
deal with our daily life. I like the fancy (even) of little children
"to have some larger food than images of their own little lives, and"
I confess I am sorry for the children whose imaginations are not
sometimes stimulated by beautiful Fairy Tales which carry them to
worlds different from those in which their future will be passed....
I hold that what removes them more or less from their daily life is
better than what reminds them of it at every step.”
It is because of the great value of leading children to something
beyond the limited circle of their own lives that I deplore the
twaddling boarding-school stories written for girls and the
artificially-prepared Public School stories for boys. Why not give them
"the dramatic interest of a larger stage? No account of a cricket match,"
"or a football triumph, could present a finer appeal to boys and girls"
than the description of the Peacestead in the “Heroes of Asgaard”:
"“This was the playground of the Æsir, where they practised trials of"
skill one with another and held tournaments and sham fights. These last
were always conducted in the gentlest and most honourable manner; for
"the strongest law of the Peacestead was, that no angry blow should be"
"struck, or spiteful word spoken upon the sacred field.”"
"her ears all the way. The sergeant and Rollo came next, with Mortimer"
"and Etienne behind, a naked blade in the hand of each, for Rollo had"
"whispered the word to draw swords. This, however, El Sarria interpreted"
"to mean his faithful Manchegan knife, to which he trusted more than to"
any sword of Toledo that ever was forged.
At any other time they could not have advanced a score of yards without
"being brought to a stand-still by the challenge of a sentry, the whistle"
"of a rifle bullet, or the simultaneous turning out of the guard. But now"
no such danger was to be apprehended. All was still as a graveyard
before cock-crow.
"It is hard, in better and wiser days, when things are beginning to be"
"traced to their causes, to give any idea of the effect of the first"
appearance of Black Cholera among a population at once so simple and so
superstitious as that of rural Spain. The inhabitants of the great
"towns, the Cristino armies in the field, the country-folk of all"
opinions were universally persuaded that the dread disease was caused by
the monks in revenge for the despites offered to them; especially by the
"hated Jesuits, who were supposed to have thrown black cats alive into"
rivers and wells in order to produce disease by means of witchcraft and
diabolical agency.
So universal was this belief that so soon as the plague broke out in any
"city or town the neighbouring monasteries were immediately plundered,"
and the priors and brethren either put to death or compelled to flee for
their lives.
Some such panic as this had stampeded the troops stationed in and about
"the little town of San Ildefonso, when the first cases of cholera proved"
fatal little more than a week before. A part of these had rushed away to
"plunder the rich monastery of El Parral a few miles off, lying in the"
linen paper were held so high that the expense of an extra leaf was
considered an unnecessary luxury. In these books that which took the
"place of the title was at the end, the colophon being in evidence,"
"indicating the name of the illuminator, if not always that of the"
"printer. As was the case with the manuscript book, the volume began"
"with the phrase, ""Here beginneth...."" Later came piratical reprints,"
which resulted in making the critical reader insist upon having each
"volume stamped with the printer's name or mark, as a guarantee of"
reliable workmanship.
The first definite step in the direction of the title-page is marked
"by bibliographers in a little volume printed by Arnold Ther Hoernen,"
"of Cologne, in 1470. It consisted of an introduction at the head of"
"a page, the major part of which was left blank. Whether the printer"
"forgot to place the usual introduction at the head of the first page,"
"and took this way to remedy his error, is not known."
"In general, different faces of type should never be combined upon the"
"title-page, the variations being secured by using smaller sizes of the"
"same face, or harmonizing fonts. Capitals and lower-case letters can be"
successfully combined on the title-page only as a result of care and
"thought, the best title-pages usually being all in lower-case or all in"
caps and small caps. A two-color title-page is rarely a success unless
"it was originally composed with two colors in mind, instead of being"

"The decoration should never overbalance the type, and this applies"
as well to the question of borders on decorated books. No matter how
"beautiful, if the decoration overbalances the type, the volume or the"
title-page ceases to be an example of typography and becomes something
answerable only to itself.
infer from the vast thicknesses of its rocks and the
unconformities which part them. We know that during its long
"periods land masses again and again rose from the sea, were worn"
"low, and were submerged and covered with the waste of other lands."
But the formations of separated regions cannot be correlated
"because of the absence of fossils, and nothing more can be made"
"out than the detached chapters of local histories, such as the"
outline given of the district about Lake Superior.
The pre-Cambrian rocks show no evidence of any forces then at work
upon the earth except the forces which are at work upon it now.
The most ancient sediments known are so like the sediments now
being laid that we may infer that they were formed under
conditions essentially similar to those of the present time. There
is no proof that the sands of the pre-Cambrian sandstones were
swept by any more powerful waves and currents than are offshore
"sands to-day, or that the muds of the pre-Cambrian shales settled"
to the sea floor in less quiet water than such muds settle in at
"present. The pre-Cambrian lands were, no doubt, worn by wind and"
"weather, beaten by rain, and furrowed by streams as now, and, as"
"now, they fronted the ocean with beaches on which waves dashed and"
along which tidal currents ran.
Perhaps the chief difference between the pre-Cambrian and the
present was the absence of life upon the land. So far as we have
"any knowledge, no forests covered the mountain sides, no verdure"
"carpeted the plains, and no animals lived on the ground or in the"
air. It is permitted to think of the most ancient lands as deserts
of barren rock and rock waste swept by rains and trenched by
powerful streams. We may therefore suppose that the processes of
their destruction went on more rapidly than at present.
"Auxonne. There his health suffered considerably, not only from the"
"miasma of the marshes of the river Saône, but also from family"
anxieties and arduous literary toils. To these last it is now needful
"to refer. Indeed, the external events of his early life are of value"
only as they reveal the many-sidedness of his nature and the growth of
his mental powers.
How came he to outgrow the insular patriotism of his early years? The
foregoing recital of facts must have already suggested one obvious
"explanation. Nature had dowered him so prodigally with diverse gifts,"
"mainly of an imperious order, that he could scarcely have limited his"
"sphere of action to Corsica. Profoundly as he loved his island, it"
offered no sphere commensurate with his varied powers and masterful
will. It was no empty vaunt which his father had uttered on his
deathbed that his Napoleon would one day overthrow the old monarchies
and conquer Europe.[9] Neither did the great commander himself
"overstate the peculiarity of his temperament, when he confessed that"
"his instincts had ever prompted him that his will must prevail, and"
that what pleased him must of necessity belong to him. Most spoilt
"children harbour the same illusion, for a brief space. But all the"
buffetings of fortune failed to drive it from the young Buonaparte;
and when despair as to his future might have impaired the vigour of
"his domineering instincts, his mind and will acquired a fresh rigidity"
"by coming under the spell of that philosophizing doctrinaire,"
Rousseau.
There was every reason why he should early be attracted by this
"fantastic thinker. In that notable work, ""Le Contrat Social"" (1762),"
Rousseau called attention to the antique energy shown by the Corsicans
"in defence of their liberties, and in a startlingly prophetic phrase"
he exclaimed that the little island would one day astonish Europe. The
source of this predilection of Rousseau for Corsica is patent. Born
"on the Isthmus, though one hunter and trapper is said to have secured as"
"many as 60,000 in a year. But as the demand for the skins, and to a"
"lesser degree for the teeth, of the animals is a constant one, it is"
probable that with the aid of the tourists they will be exterminated
there as thoroughly as they have been in the settled parts of Florida.
While on the subject of slaughter and the extermination of game it may
be noted that the Canal Commission has already established very
"stringent game laws on the Zone, particularly for the protection of"
"plumed birds like the egret, and it is seriously proposed to make of"
that part of Gatun Lake within the Zone a refuge for birds in which no
shooting shall be permitted. Such action would stop mere wanton
"slaughter from the decks of passing steamers, and in the end would"
greatly enhance the beauty and interest of the trip through the lake
which would be fairly alive with birds and other animal life.

The Bayano River region beside being the center of such lumbering
activities as the Zone knows at present is the section in which are
"found the curious vegetable ivory nuts which, though growing wild, have"
become one of the principal products of Panama. Only a few years ago
they were looked upon merely as curiosities but are now a useful new
material. They are gathered by the natives and sold to dealers in
Panama who ship them north to be made into buttons and other articles
of general use. Nobody has yet experimented with the cultivation of the
"tree, and there is reason to believe that with cultivation larger nuts"
"could be obtained, and, by planting, considerable groves established."
"The trees grow well in every part of the Darien, and the demand, with"
which has a genuine religious motive often fails. Most of the great
"artists in fiction, when they have taken in hand a subject which is of"
"religious interest, have written in a spirit of detachment. George"
"Eliot’s _Romola_ is an example, and the result is that men are more"
interested in Tito Melema than in Savonarola. Novels in which religion
is necessarily much in evidence have been written either by literary
artists who have studiously endeavoured to lay aside their own
"personal convictions, or if the books have been written with a"
distinctly religious purpose the hero and heroine have been
"unconvincing, the people in the story have not been alive."
When Cardinal Newman had abandoned prematurely his hope of maintaining
"the Catholic character of the Church of England, he did not disdain to"
employ his pen in the production of a novel with a religious purpose;
but we are amazed to find that the exquisite grace of style which is
one of the charms of the _Apologia_ could not render Charles Riding
"interesting, or the novel _Loss and Gain_, of which he is the hero,"
readable.
It is perhaps dangerous to give another example from contemporary
"fiction, but those who justly admire Mrs. Humphry Ward’s subtle"
discernment of character and great and increasing mastery of form and
"style, will not be inclined to dispute the opinion that when, in"
"_Robert Elsmere_, she undertook the defence of the modern Unitarian"
"position, her hero was hardly a “Man’s man.”"
The reason is not far to seek. The average man knows too much of the
darker side of life; and the necessary effort made by the author of
"religious novels to depict that of which they, fortunately for their"
"own souls, have had no experience, is not successful. Charles"
Kingsley’s undergraduate days were perhaps not without knowledge of
"the shadows, but he is happier in the Schools of Alexandria, or in the"

main sources.
The original versions of translated hymns are not always readily
available and for that reason they are reproduced in the _Handbook_.
Translated hymns are usually selections from a much larger number of
stanzas and it is often instructive to be able to study the whole
structure of the original work.
_Acknowledgements._ I wish to acknowledge valuable help received from
the following and to express hereby my gratitude to them: to Dr. Robert
"McCutchan, author of _Our Hymnody_, who generously responded to my"
request for information on a dozen or more hymns on which I had no data;
"to Dr. Henry Wilder Foote, of Harvard University, author of _Three"
"Centuries of American Hymnody_, for biographical material on several"
"hymn writers, and the use of books from his private library; to Dr."
"Reginald McAll, Executive Secretary of the Hymn Society of America for"
"helpful material; to Dr. Ruth Messenger, Archivist for the Hymn Society"
"of America, who furnished nearly all the Latin originals, and the"
"Italian original of Savonarola’s hymn, and information concerning these"
"hymns; to Dr. Armin Heussler, author of a forth-coming handbook to the"

treasures of the Mennonite Historical Library at Bethel College
available to me; to the late Rev. C. E. Krehbiel who loaned me material
from his private library for this work but did not live to see its
completion; to B. Bargen for help in preparing the manuscript for
publication; to Mrs. Beatrice Buller for reading the manuscripts and
"proofs of the German chorales; to my wife, Charity Steiner Hostetler,"
who read all the manuscripts and proofs and whose constant interest and
is perilously near its antithetic decline. This basic change puzzles us
by its seeming caprice not merely in our physical instruments but also
in the cycle of individual life and death and in the great cycle of the
life and death of nations. We fail to see things in their totality and
we erect barriers that keep kindreds apart. Even science which attempts
"to rise above common limitations, has not escaped the doom which limited"
"vision imposes. We have caste in science as in religion and in politics,"
which divides one into conflicting many. The law of Cyclic change
follows us relentlessly even in the realm of thought. When we have
"raised ourselves to the highest pinnacle, through some oversight we fall"
over the precipice. Men have offered their lives for the establishment
of truth. A climax is reached after which the custodians of knowledge
themselves bar further advance. Men who have fought for liberty impose
on themselves and on others the bond of slavery. Through centuries have
men striven to erect a mighty edifice in which Humanity might be
enshrined; through want of vigilance the structure crumbled into dust.
Many cycles must yet be run and defeats must yet be borne before man
will establish a destiny which is above change.
And through science I was able to teach you to seek for truth and help
to discover it yourself. This attitude of detachment may possess some
"advantage in the proper understanding of your duties. You will have,"
"besides, the heritage of great ideals that have been handed down to"
"you. The question which you have to decide is duty to yourself, to the"
king and to your country. I shall speak to you of the ideals which we
cherish about these duties.
DUTY TO SELF
"As regards duty to self, can there be anything so inclusive as being"
true to your manhood? Stand upright and do not be either cringing or
curiosities of the Seattle water-front. Not only is there the
"inevitable confusion involved in the departure of an overloaded craft,"
but likewise there is all the noisy excitement that attends a shipment
of Oriental troops.
The Chinese maintain such a clatter as to drown the hoarse cries of the
"stevedores, the complaint of the creaking tackle, and the rumble of the"
"winches. They scurry hither and yon like a distracted army, forever in"
"the way, shouting, clacking, squealing in senseless turmoil. They are"
"timid as to the water, and for them a voyage is at all times beset with"
many alarms. It is no more possible to restrain them than to calm a
"frightened herd of wild pigs, nor will they embark at all until their"
frenzy has run its course and died of its own exhaustion. To discipline
"them according to the seamen's standard is inadvisable, for many of"
"them are ""cutters,"" big, evil, saffron-hued fellows, whose trade it is"
to butcher and in whose dextrous hands a knife becomes a frightful
weapon.
"The Japs, ordinarily so noiseless and submissive, yield to the"
contagion and add their share to the uproar. Each man carries a few
"pounds of baggage in bundles or packs or valises, and these scanty"
belongings he guards with shrieking solicitude.
While the pandemonium of the Orientals who gathered to board _The
"Bedford Castle_ was sufficient in itself to cause consternation, it was"
as nothing to that which broke loose when the fishermen began to
"assemble. To a man they were drunk, belligerent and, declamatory. A"
"few, to be sure, were still busy with the tag ends of the cargo, but"
"the majority had gone to their lodgings for their packs, and now"
reappeared in a state of the wildest exuberance; for this would be
"their last spree of the season, and before them lay a period of long,"
"sleepless nights, exposure, and unceasing labor, wherein a year's work"
An habitual resident in London who is gifted with a keen faculty of
"hearing and observation, will soon learn to know instinctively the"
"various characteristics of the people who call upon him, by the"
particular manner in which each one handles his door-bell or knocker.
"He will recognize the timid from the bold, the modest from the"
"arrogant, the meditative thinker from the bustling man of fashion, the"
familiar friend from the formal acquaintance. Every individual's method
of announcing his or her arrival to the household is distinctly
"different,--and Villiers, who studied a little of everything, had not"
failed to take note of the curiously diversified degrees of single and
double rapping by means of which his visitors sought admittance to his
"abode. In fact, he rather prided himself on being able to guess with"
almost invariable correctness what special type of man or woman was at
"his door, provided he could hear the whole diapason of their knock from"
"beginning to end. When he was shut in his ""den,"" however, the sounds"
"were muffled by distance, and he could form no just"
"judgment,--sometimes, indeed, he did not hear them at all, especially"
if he happened to be playing his 'cello at the time. So that this
"morning he was considerably startled, when, having finished his letter"
"to the Duchess de la Santoisie, a long and persistent rat-tat-tatting"
"echoed noisily through the house, like the smart, quick blows of a"
carpenter's hammer--a species of knock that was entirely unfamiliar to
"him, and that, while so emphatic in character, suggested to his mind"
"neither friend nor foe. He laid down his pen, listened and waited. In a"
minute or two his servant entered the room.
"""If you please, sir, a lady to see Mr. Alwyn. Shall I show her up?"""
"Villiers rose slowly out of his chair, and stood eyeing his man in"
blank bewilderment.
find depicted on a modern tombstone the worm that dieth not and the
"fire that is not quenched. No; the water-pitcher was not a symbol, it"
was an instrument; for my part I have little faith in the existence
of any symbols in popular religion which are not in origin at least
instruments; and the purpose to which this instrument was put was to
supply the dead person with that wedding-bath which he had not taken
"in life, and without which he would vainly strive in the under-world"
to prepare himself for divine wedlock. The water-pitcher was not
"commemorative, but preventive, of future punishment. Its erection was"
"not a warning to the living, but a service to the dead."
"Thus then the evidence for the intimate association of the mysteries,"
"or of the main idea which runs through them, with human weddings is"
"complete and, I hope, convincing; and the custom of the water-pitcher,"
"which concludes it, fitly introduces at the same time the evidence"
for the association of the same idea with funerals. This is equally
"plentiful. The vague conception of death as a wedding, which as I have"
"shown was elaborated in the mysteries, has of course already been"
exemplified in all those passages of ancient literature and modern
"folk-songs which I have adduced, and I have found in it also the motive"
for the assimilation of funeral-customs to the customs of marriage.
"But the evidence that the actual doctrines of the mysteries, in which"
"more definite expression was given to that vague idea, were closely"
associated with death and funeral-custom is to be found rather in
epitaphs and sepulchral monuments.
The tone of the epitaphs may be sufficiently illustrated by a single
couplet:
Οὐκ ἐπιδὼν νύμφεια λέχη κατέβην τὸν ἄφυκτον
Γόργιππος ξανθῆς Φερσεφόνης θάλαμον[1501].
"‘I, Gorgippus, lived not to look upon a bridal bed ere I went down"
connected with that event. The _Chaldaei_ were Oriental fortune-tellers who
asserted that their predictions were based on the Chaldean astrology. They
"found credulous clients among the farm laborers, and Cato gravely exhorts"
the good landlord to oust them from his estate.[3]
"Beginning with the second century before Christ, merchants began to import"
Syrian slaves. At that time Delos was the great trade center in this human
"commodity, and in that island especially Atargatis was worshiped by"
citizens of Athens and Rome.[4] Trade spread her worship in the
Occident.[5] We know that the great slave revolution that devastated Sicily
"in 134 B. C. was started by a slave from Apamea, a votary of the Syrian"
"goddess. Simulating divine madness, he called his companions to arms,"
"pretending to act in accordance with orders from heaven.[6] This detail,"
"which we know by chance, shows how considerable a proportion of Semites"
"there was in the gangs working the fields, and how much authority Atargatis"
enjoyed in the rural centers. Being too poor to build temples for their
"national goddess, those agricultural laborers {106} waited with their"
devotions until a band of itinerant _galli_ passed through the distant
hamlet where the lot of the auction had sent them. The existence of those
"wandering priests depended, therefore, on the number of fellow-countrymen"
"they met in the rural districts, who supported them by sacrificing a part"
of their poor savings.
Towards the end of the republic those diviners appear to have enjoyed
rather serious consideration at Rome. It was a pythoness from Syria that
advised Marius on the sacrifices he was to perform.[7]
Under the empire the importation of slaves increased. Depopulated Italy
"needed more and more foreign hands, and Syria furnished a large quota of"
"the forced immigration of cultivators. But those Syrians, quick and"
"intelligent as they were strong and industrious, performed many other"
functions. They filled the countless domestic positions in the palaces of
only dormant; and they were certainly transmitted in their intensity
to the greatest scion of the race.
"In the year 1529 Francis Buonaparte, whether pressed by poverty or"
"distracted by despair at the misfortunes which then overwhelmed Italy,"
migrated to Corsica. There the family was grafted upon a tougher
branch of the Italian race. To the vulpine characteristics developed
under the shadow of the Medici there were now added qualities of a
more virile stamp. Though dominated in turn by the masters of the
"Mediterranean, by Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, by the men of Pisa,"
"and finally by the Genoese Republic, the islanders retained a striking"
individuality. The rock-bound coast and mountainous interior helped to
preserve the essential features of primitive life. Foreign Powers
"might affect the towns on the sea-board, but they left the clans of"
the interior comparatively untouched. Their life centred around the
family. The Government counted for little or nothing; for was it not
the symbol of the detested foreign rule? Its laws were therefore as
naught when they conflicted with the unwritten but omnipotent code of
family honour. A slight inflicted on a neighbour would call forth the
"warning words--""Guard thyself: I am on my guard."" Forthwith there"
"began a blood feud, a vendetta, which frequently dragged on its dreary"
"course through generations of conspiracy and murder, until, the"
"principals having vanished, the collateral branches of the families"
were involved. No Corsican was so loathed as the laggard who shrank
"from avenging the family honour, even on a distant relative of the"
first offender. The murder of the Duc d'Enghien by Napoleon in 1804
sent a thrill of horror through the Continent. To the Corsicans it
seemed little more than an autocratic version of the _vendetta
traversale_.[1]
The vendetta was the chief law of Corsican society up to comparatively
recent times; and its effects are still visible in the life of the
"At last out of khaki, and dressed in conventional evening clothes, I"
felt as if I were indeed writing the first words of another story on the
"unmarred page of the incoming year. As I entered the library my mother,"
"forgetting that it was I who owed her deference, came forward with"
outstretched arms and a sound in her voice like that of doves at nesting
"time. Dad's welcome was heartier, even though his eyes were dimmed with"
"happy tears. And old Bilkins, our solemn, irreproachable butler, grinned"
benignly as he stood waiting to announce dinner. What a wealth of
affection I had to be grateful for!
"I did not lack gratitude, but with the old year touching the heels of"
"the new, and Time commanding me to get in step, my return to civil life"
"held few inducements. Instead of a superabundance of cheer, I had"
brought from France jumpy nerves and a body lean with over
training--natural results of physical exhaustion coupled with the mental
reaction that must inevitably follow a year and a half of highly
imaginative living.
"But there was another aspect less tangible, perhaps more permanent--and"
all members of combat divisions will understand exactly what I mean.
"When America picked up the gauntlet, an active conscience jerked me from"
a tuneful life and drove me out to war--for whether men are driven by
"conscience, or a government draft board, makes no difference in the"
"effect upon those who come through. Time after time, for eighteen"
"months, I made my regular trips into hell--into a hell more revolting"
"than mid-Victorian evangelists ever pictured to spellbound, quaking"
sinners. Never in this world had there been a parallel to the naked
dangers and nauseous discomforts of that western front; never so
"prolonged an agony of head-splitting noises, lacerations of human flesh,"
"smells that turned the body sick, blasphemies that made the soul grow"
solid movement. It was complex and contained the seeds of discord
which lurk in many-sided and militant creeds. The theories of its
intellectual champions were as diverse as the motives which spurred on
their followers to the attack on the outworn abuses of the age.
Discontent and faith were the ultimate motive powers of the
Revolution. Faith prepared the Revolution and discontent accomplished
"it. Idealists who, in varied planes of thought, preached the doctrine"
"of human perfectibility, succeeded in slowly permeating the dull"
toiling masses of France with hope. Omitting here any notice of
"philosophic speculation as such, we may briefly notice the teachings"
of three writers whose influence on revolutionary politics was to be
"definite and practical. These were Montesquieu, Voltaire, and"
"Rousseau. The first was by no means a revolutionist, for he decided in"
"favour of a mixed form of government, like that of England, which"
"guaranteed the State against the dangers of autocracy, oligarchy, and"
mob-rule. Only by a ricochet did he assail the French monarchy. But he
re-awakened critical inquiry; and any inquiry was certain to sap the
base of the _ancien régime_ in France. Montesquieu's teaching inspired
the group of moderate reformers who in 1789 desired to re-fashion the
institutions of France on the model of those of England. But popular
sentiment speedily swept past these Anglophils towards the more
attractive aims set forth by Voltaire.
"This keen thinker subjected the privileged classes, especially the"
"titled clergy, to a searching fire of philosophic bombs and barbed"
witticisms. Never was there a more dazzling succession of literary
triumphs over a tottering system. The satirized classes winced and
"laughed, and the intellect of France was conquered, for the"
Revolution. Thenceforth it was impossible that peasants who were
nominally free should toil to satisfy the exacting needs of the
"State, and to support the brilliant bevy of nobles who flitted gaily"
"must be crowded into three months. They, therefore, inaugurated the"
change in befitting style.
"On the whole, no explosive has ever been invented that is so noisy in"
"its effect, so furiously expansive in its action, as the fumes of cheap"
whiskey. The great dock-shed soon began to reverberate to the wildest
"clamor, which added to the fury of the crowd outside. The strikers,"
"unable to enter the building, flowed down upon the adjoining wharf, or"
"clambered to the roofs nearby, whence they jeered insultingly. Among"
"them was a newspaper photographer, bent on securing an unusual picture"
"for his publication, and in truth the scene from this point of view was"
sufficiently novel and striking.
"The decks of the big, low-lying tramp steamer were piled high with gear"
of every description. A trio of stout tow-boats were blocked up
"amidships, long piles of lumber rose higher than a man's head, and the"
"roofs of the deck-houses were jammed with fishing-boats nested, one"
"inside the other, like pots in a kitchen. Every available inch was"
"crowded with cases of gasoline, of groceries, and of the varied"
"provisions required on an expedition of this magnitude. Aft, on rows of"
"hooks, were suspended the carcasses of sheep and bullocks and hogs;"
there seemed to be nowhere another foot of available room. The red
"water-line of the ship was already submerged, yet notwithstanding this"
"fact her derricks clanged noisily, her booms swung back and forth, and"
her gaping hatches swallowed momentary loads. Those fishermen who had
"come aboard early had settled like flies in the rigging, whence they"
"taunted their enemies, hurling back insult for insult."
It was much like the departure of a gold steamer during the early
"famine stages of the northward stampede, save that now there were no"
"women, while the confusion was immeasurably greater, and through it all"
might be felt a certain strained and angry menace. All the long
"not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love Christ whom"
he hath not seen? A mind untouched by the agonies and wrongs
"which invest London hospitals and lanes with horror, could not"
"be moved by the sufferings of a single individual, however"
"holy, who died eighteen centuries ago."
“No; the essence of the belief is the belief in the Divinity of
Christ. But accept that belief; think for a moment of all that
"implies, and you must admit that your Christianity becomes"
dogmatic in the highest degree. Our conceptions of the world
and its meaning are more radically changed than our conceptions
"of the material universe, when the sun instead of the earth"
"becomes its centre. _Every view of history, every theory of our"
"duty, must be radically transformed by contact with that"
Stupendous Mystery._ Whether you accept or reject the special
tenets of the Athanasian Creed is an infinitesimal trifle. You
are bound to assume that every religion which does not take
"this dogma into account is without true vital force. Infidels,"
"heathens, and Unitarians reject the single influence which"
alone can mould our lives in conformity with the everlasting
"laws of the universe. Of course, there are tricks of sleight of"
hand by which the conclusion is evaded. It would be too long
and too trifling to attempt to expose them. Unsectarian
Christianity consists in shirking the difficulty without
"meeting it, and trying hard to believe that the passion can"
survive without its essential basis. It proclaims the love of
"Christ as our motive, whilst it declines to make up its mind"
whether Christ was God or man; or endeavours to escape a
categorical answer under a cloud of unsubstantial rhetoric. But
"the difference between man and God is infinite, and no effusion"
of superlatives will disguise the plain fact from honest
minds. To be a Christian in any real sense you must start from
"doctrine, often unconsciously, has survived the introduction of"
"political democracy, and has radically vitiated all national systems of"
education.
The country which has succeeded best in giving information without
"intelligence is the latest addition to modern civilization, Japan."
Elementary education in Japan is said to be admirable from the point of
"view of instruction. But, in addition to instruction, it has another"
"purpose, which is to teach worship of the Mikado—a far stronger creed"
now than before Japan became modernized.[3] Thus the schools have been
used simultaneously to confer knowledge and to promote superstition.
"Since we are not tempted to Mikado-worship, we see clearly what is"
absurd in Japanese teaching. Our own national superstitions strike us as
"natural and sensible, so that we do not take such a true view of them as"
we do of the superstitions of Nippon. But if a travelled Japanese were
to maintain the thesis that our schools teach superstitions just as
"inimical to intelligence as belief in the divinity of the Mikado, I"
suspect that he would be able to make out a very good case.
"For the present I am not in search of remedies, but am only concerned"
with diagnosis. We are faced with the paradoxical fact that education
has become one of the chief obstacles to intelligence and freedom of
thought. This is due primarily to the fact that the State claims a
monopoly; but that is by no means the sole cause.
(2) _Propaganda._—Our system of education turns young people out of the
"schools able to read, but for the most part unable to weigh evidence or"
"to form an independent opinion. They are then assailed, throughout the"
"rest of their lives, by statements designed to make them believe all"
"sorts of absurd propositions, such as that Blank’s pills cure all ills,"
"that Spitzbergen is warm and fertile, and that Germans eat corpses. The"
"art of propaganda, as practised by modern politicians and governments,"

"fig. 87, laid open to show the ecchymosis on the inner aspect of the"

"It may be well to add that, although the figures inserted are all taken"
"from small-intestine wounds, the nature of the wounds of the"
peritoneum-clad part of the large intestine in no way differed from
"them, except in so far as fixity of the bowel exposed it to a more"
extensive wound when the bullet took a parallel course to its long axis.
A more important point in the injuries to the large intestine was the
possibility of an extra-peritoneal wound. I saw several such lesions of
"the colon, every one of which ended fatally. I became still more fully"
convinced of the greater seriousness of extra- to intra-peritoneal
rupture of this portion of the gut than I was when I expressed a similar
opinion in a former paper.[20] It will be seen later that the results of
intra- and extra-peritoneal wounds of the bladder fully confirm this
"view, as all extra-peritoneal injuries died, while many intra-peritoneal"
perforations recovered spontaneously.
_Wounds of the mesentery._--I had little experience of this injury; in
"fact, case 169, on which I operated, was my sole observation. It stands"
"to reason, however, that injuries to the mesentery would be much more"
frequent proportionately to wounds of the gut than is the case in the
"ruptures seen in civil practice, since the whole area of the mesentery"
is equally open to injury. Viewing the extreme danger of hæmorrhage into
"the peritoneal cavity in these injuries, I should be inclined to expect"
that a considerable proportion of those deaths from abdominal wounds
which took place on the field of battle were due to this source.
ONE AGAINST MANY.
The beautiful and socially popular Duchess de la Santoisie sat her at
"brilliantly appointed dinner-table, and flashed her bright eyes"
"comprehensively round the board,--her party was complete. She had"
secured twenty of the best-known men and women of letters in all
"London, and yet she was not quite satisfied with the result attained."
"One dark, splendid face on her right hand had taken the lustre out of"
"all the rest,--one quiet, courteous smile on a mouth haughty, yet"
"sweet, had somehow or other made the entertainment of little worth in"
"her own estimation. She was very fair to look upon, very witty, very"
"worldly-wise,--but for once her beauty seemed to herself defective and"
"powerless to charm, while the graceful cloak of social hypocrisy she"
was always accustomed to wear would not adapt itself to her manner
"tonight so well as usual. The author of ""Nourhalma"" the successful poet"
"whose acquaintance she had very eagerly sought to make, was not at all"
"the kind of man she had expected,--and now, when he was beside her as"
"her guest, she did not quite know what to do with him."
"She had met plenty of poets, so called, before,--and had, for the most"
"part, found them insignificant looking men with an enormous opinion of"
"themselves, and a suave, condescending contempt for all others of their"
"craft; but this being,--this stately, kingly creature with the noble"
"head, and far-gazing, luminous eyes,--this man, whose every gesture was"
"graceful, whose demeanor was more royal than that of many a crowned"
"monarch,--whose voice had such a singular soft thrill of music in its"
"tone,--he was a personage for whom she had not been prepared,--and in"
whose presence she felt curiously embarrassed and almost ill at ease.
And she was not the only one present who experienced these odd
"sensations. Alwyn's appearance, when, with his friend Villiers, he had"
fine-grained limestones even the imprints of jellyfish have been
retained.
The different kinds of molds and casts may be illustrated by means
"of a clam shell and some moist clay, the latter representing the"
sediments in which the remains of animals and plants are entombed.
"Imbedding the shell in the clay and allowing the clay to harden,"
"we have a MOLD OF THE EXTERIOR of the shell, as is seen on cutting"
the clay matrix in two and removing the shell from it. Filling
"this mold with clay of different color, we obtain a CAST OF THE"
"EXTERIOR, which represents accurately the original form and"
"surface markings of the shell. In nature, shells and other relics"
of animals or plants are often removed by being dissolved by
"percolating waters, and the molds are either filled with sediments"
or with minerals deposited from solution.
"Where the fossil is hollow, a CAST OF THE INTERIOR is made in the"
same way. Interior casts of shells reproduce any markings on the
"inside of the valves, and casts of the interior of the skulls of"
ancient vertebrates show the form and size of their brains.
IMPERFECTION OF THE LIFE RECORD. At the present time only the
smallest fraction of the life on earth ever gets entombed in rocks
"now forming. In the forest great fallen tree trunks, as well as"
"dead leaves, decay, and only add a little to the layer of dark"
vegetable mold from which they grew. The bones of land animals
"are, for the most part, left unburied on the surface and are soon"
"destroyed by chemical agencies. Even where, as in the swamps of"
"river, flood plains and in other bogs, there are preserved the"
"remains of plants, and sometimes insects, together with the bones"
"of some animal drowned or mired, in most cases these swamp and bog"
deposits are sooner or later destroyed by the shifting channels of
While native architecture is not stately it is artistic in that it
harmonizes with its natural surroundings and is eminently adapted to the
needs of the people who inhabit the huts.]
"It is beyond doubt to the ease with which life can be sustained, and the"
torpidity of the native imagination which depicts no joys to spur one on
to effort that the unwillingness of the native to do systematic work is
due. And from this difficulty in getting labor follows the fact that
not one quarter of the natural resources of Panama are developed.
Whether the labor problem will be solved by the distribution throughout
the republic of the Caribbean blacks who have worked so well on the Zone
is yet to be seen. It may be possible that because of this the fertile
"lands of Panama, or the savannas so admirably fitted for grazing, can"
only be utilized by great corporations who will do things on so great a
scale as to justify the importation of labor. Today the man who should
take up a large tract of land in the Chiriqui country with a view to
tilling it would be risking disaster because of the uncertainty of the
labor supply.
[Illustration: CONSTRUCTION OF ROOF OF A NATIVE HOUSE

Another obstacle in the way of foreign settlement of Panama has been the
uncertainty of land titles. Early surveyors seem to have been in the
habit of noting as the identification marks of their lines such volatile
"objects as a blackbird in a tree, or such perishable ones as an ant hill"
or a decaying stump. Facilities for recording titles also have been ill
arranged. One of the first tasks of the new Republic was to take up this
matter and it has been reduced to fairly systematic form. The Republic
is offering for sale great quantities of public lands long held as
especially abundant in the Keweenawan lavas. After the Keweenawan
"was uplifted to form land, percolating waters leached out much of"
the copper diffused in the lava sheets and deposited it within
"steam blebs as amygdules of native copper, in cracks and fissures,"
"and especially as a cement, or matrix, in the interbedded gravels"
which formed the chief aquifers of the region. The famous Calumet
and Hecla mine follows down the dip of the strata to the depth of
nearly a mile and works such an ancient conglomerate whose matrix
is pure copper.
THE APPEARANCE OF LIFE. Sometime during the dim ages preceding the
"Cambrian, whether in the Archean or in the Algonkian we know not,"
occurred one of the most important events in the history of the
earth. Life appeared for the first time upon the planet. Geology
has no evidence whatever to offer as to whence or how life came.
All analogies lead us to believe that its appearance must have
"been sudden. Its earliest forms are unknown, but analogy suggests"
"that as every living creature has developed from a single cell, so"
the earliest organisms upon the globe--the germs from which all
"later life is supposed to have been evolved--were tiny,"
"unicellular masses of protoplasm, resembling the amoeba of to-day"
in the simplicity of their structure.
Such lowly forms were destitute of any hard parts and could leave
no evidence of their existence in the record of the rocks. And of
their supposed descendants we find so few traces in the pre-
Cambrian strata that the first steps in organic evolution must be
supplied from such analogies in embryology as the following. The
"fertilized ovum, the cell with which each animal begins its life,"
"grows and multiplies by cell division, and develops into a hollow"
globe of cells called the BLASTOSPHERE. This stage is succeeded by
"the stage of the GASTRULA,--an ovoid or cup-shaped body with a"
"If within each of the two ears there are three ears, visible on the"
"outside and the inside, the army of the ruler will forsake him and"
his land will revolt.
"If within each of the two ears there are three ears, visible on the"
"outside and the inside, the army of the ruler will forsake him and"
his land will revolt.
"If the ears of a foetus are choked up[66], in place of a large king a"
small king will be in the land.
"In general, therefore, an excess number of ears points to enlargement,"
"increased power, stability of the government and the like; and this is"
probably due in part to the association of wisdom and understanding with
"the ear in Babylonian[67], for as a general thing an excess of organs or"
"of parts of the body is an unfavorable sign, because a deviation from the"
normal.
"In the same way as in the case of the ears, we have birth-omen texts"
"dealing with the head, lips, mouth, eyes, feet, joints, tail, genital"
"organs, hair, horns and other parts of the body[68]. In many of these"
texts dealing with all kinds of peculiar formations and abnormalities in
"the case of one organ or one part of the body or the other, a comparison"
is instituted between the features or parts of one animal with those of
another and the interpretation is guided by the association of ideas with
the animal compared. A moment's reflection will show the importance of
this feature in extending the field of observation almost =ad infinitum=.
"A lamb born with a large head might suggest a lion, a small long head that"
"of a dog, or a very broad face might suggest the features of a bull. From"
"comparisons of this kind, the step would be a small one to calling a lamb"
"with lion-like features, a lion, or a lamb with features recalling those"
"cause and effect, so unrelenting must be the sequence of failure and"
success. We shall find that the failure must be the antecedent power to
lie dormant for the long subsequent dynamic expression in what we call
success. It is then and then only that we shall begin to question
"ourselves which is the greater of the two, a noble failure or a vulgar"
success.
"As a concrete example, I shall relate the history of a noble failure"
which had its setting in this little corner of the earth. And if some of
the audience thought that the speaker has been blessed with life that
"has been unusually fruitful, they will soon realise that the power and"
strength that nerved me to meet the shocks of life were in reality
"derived at this very place, where I witnessed the struggle which"
overpowered a far greater life.
STIMULUS OF CONTACT WITH WESTERN CULTURE
An impulse from outside reacts on impressionable bodies in two different
"ways, depending on whether the recipient is inert or fully alive. The"
"inert is fashioned after the pattern of the impression made on it, and"
this in infinite repetition of one mechanical stamp. But when an
"organism is fully alive, the answering reaction is often of an"
altogether different character to the impinging stimulus. The outside
shocks stir up the organism to answer feebly or to utmost in ways as
multitudinous and varied as life itself. So the first impetus of Western
education impressed itself on some in a dead monotony of imitation of
things Western; while in others it awakened all that was greatest in the
national memory. It is the release of some giant force which lay for
long time dormant. My father was one of the earliest to receive the
impetus characteristic of the modern epoch as derived from the West. And
in his case it came to pass that the stimulus evoked the latent
"instincts, and a fervent desire to free the soul from the bonds of matter."
The ascetic tendencies went so far as to create a kind of begging
monachism--the _métragyrtes_. They also harmonized with some of the ideas
"of renunciation taught by Greek philosophy, and at an early period Hellenic"
theologians took an interest in this devotion that attracted and repelled
"them at the same time. Timotheus the Eumolpid, who was one of the founders"
"of the Alexandrian religion of Serapis, derived the inspiration for his"
"essays on religious reform, among other sources, from the ancient Phrygian"
myths. Those thinkers undoubtedly succeeded in making the priests of
Pessinus themselves admit many speculations quite foreign to the old
Anatolian nature worship. The votaries of Cybele began at a very remote
"period to practise ""mysteries""[7] in which the initiates were made"
"acquainted, by degrees, with a wisdom that was always considered divine,"
but underwent peculiar variations in the course of time.
*       *       *       *       *
Such is the religion which the rough Romans of the Punic wars accepted and
adopted. Hidden under theological and cosmological doctrines it contained
"an ancient stock of very primitive and coarse religious ideas, such as the"
"worship of trees, stones and animals. Besides this superstitious fetichism"
"it involved ceremonies that were both sensual and ribald, including all the"
wild and mystic rites of the bacchanalia which the public authorities were
to prohibit a few years later.
When the senate became better acquainted with the divinity imposed upon it
"by the Sibyls, it must have been quite embarrassed by the present of King"
Attalus. {52} The enthusiastic transports and the somber fanaticism of the
Phrygian worship contrasted violently with the calm dignity and respectable
"reserve of the official religion, and excited the minds of the people to a"
dangerous degree. The emasculated Galli were the objects of contempt and
disgust and what in their own eyes was a meritorious act was made a crime
THE HANSA
"Systematic commerce in the north of Europe, broadly speaking, begins"
"with the traffic of the Hansa towns, whose rise may be traced to the"
sudden development of civic life forced on Germany in the tenth century
"by the emperor Henry I, as a means of withstanding the otherwise"
"irresistible raids of the Hungarians.[711] Once founded, such cities for"
their own existence' sake gave freedom to all fugitive serfs who joined
"them, defending such against former masters, and giving them the chance"
of earning a living.[712] That is by common consent the outstanding
"origin of German civic industry, and the original conditions were such"
"that the cities, once formed, were gradually forced[713] to special"
"self-reliance. _Faustrecht_, or private war, was universal, even under"
emperors who suppressed feudal brigandage; and the cities had to fight
"their own battle, like those of Italy, from the beginning. As compared"
"with the robber baronage and separate princes, they stood for"
"intelligence and co-operation, and supplied a basis for organisation"
without which the long German chaos of the Middle Ages would have been
immeasurably worse. Taking their commercial cue from the cities of
"Italy, they reached, as against feudal enemies, a measure of peaceful"
union which the less differentiated Italian cities could not attain save
momentarily. The decisive conditions were that whereas in Italy the
"enemies were manifold--sometimes feudal nobles, sometimes the Emperor,"
"sometimes the Pope--the German cities had substantially one objective,"
"the protection of trade from the robber-knights. Thus, as early as the"
"year 1284, seventy cities of South Germany formed the Rhenish League, on"
which followed that of the Swabian towns. The league of the Hansa
"cities, like the other early ""Hansa of London,"" which united cities of"
"Flanders and France with mercantile London, was a growth on all fours"
"with these.[714] Starting, however, in maritime towns which grew to"
"commerce from beginnings in fishing, as the earlier Scandinavians had"
of his work. The greatest difficulty lay in the construction of a
receiver to detect invisible ether disturbances. For this a most
laborious investigation had to be undertaken to find the action of
electric radiation on all kinds of matter. As a result of this long and
"very patient work a new type of receiver was invented, so perfect in its"
action that the _Electrician_ suggested its use in ships and
electro-magnetic high houses for the communication and transmission of
"danger signals at sea through space. This was in 1895, several years in"
advance of the present wireless system. Practical application of the
result of Dr. Bose's investigations appear so important that Great
Britain and the United States granted him patents for his invention of a
certain crystal receiver which proved to be the most sensitive detector
of wireless signals.
UNIVERSAL SENSITIVENESS OF MATTER
In the course of his investigations Dr. Bose found that the uncertainty
"of the early type of his receiver was brought on by fatigue, and that"
the curve of fatigue of his instrument closely resembled the fatigue
curve of animal muscle. He was soon able to remove the 'tiredness' of
his receiver by application of suitable stimulants; application of
"certain poisons, on the other hand, permanently abolished its"
sensitiveness. Dr. Bose was thus amazed at the discovery that inorganic
"matter was anything but inert, but that its particles were a thrill"
under the action of multitudinous forces that were playing on it. The
lecturer was at this time constrained to choose whether to go on with
"the practical applications of his work, the success of which appeared to"
"be assured, or to throw himself into a vortex of conflict for the"
establishment of some truth the glimmerings of which he was then but
dimly beginning to perceive. It is very curious that the human mind is
sometimes so constituted that it rejects lines of least resistance in
drives of the flight-angle directors in the hour and declination ranges;
before his eyes was the finely marked micrometer screen upon which the
guiding goniometer threw its needle-point of light; powerful optical
"systems of prisms and lenses revealed to his sight the director-angles,"
down to fractional seconds of arc. It was the task of the chief pilot
to hold the screened image of the cross-hairs of the two directors in
such position relative to the ever-moving point of light as to hold the
"mighty vessel precisely upon its course, in spite of the complex system"
of forces acting upon it.
"For almost an hour Breckenridge sat motionless, his eyes flashing from"
"micrometer screen to signal panel, his sensitive fingers moving the"
potentiometers through minute arcs because of what he saw upon the
"screen and in instantaneous response to the flashing, multi-colored"
"lights and tinkling signals of his board. Finally, far from earth, the"
"moon's attraction and other perturbing forces comparatively slight, the"
signals no longer sounded and the point of light ceased its irregular
"motion, becoming almost stationary. The chief pilot brought both"
"cross-hairs directly upon the brilliant point, which for some time they"
"had been approaching more and more nearly, adjusted the photo-cells"
"and amplifiers which would hold them immovably upon it, and at the"
"calculated second of time, cut out the starting power by means of"
another set of automatically timed relays. When only the regular driving
"power was left, and the acceleration had been checked and found to be"
"exactly the designated value of 981.286 centimeters, he stood up and"
heaved a profound sigh of relief.
"""Well, Steve, that's over with--we're on our way. I'm always glad when"
"this part of it is done."""
"""It's a ticklish job, no fooling--even for an expert,"" the mathematician"
"agreed. ""No wonder the astronomers think you birds are the ones who are"
these cases differing little in character from those of slight
"continuous hæmorrhage. In a third, the bleeding was definitely of a"
"secondary character, corresponding with one of the classes of secondary"
"hæmorrhage described in Chapter IV., and occurring on the eighth or"
tenth day from giving way of an imperfectly closed wounded vessel. In
either of the two latter classes the development of the hæmothorax often
"corresponded with a journey, or with allowing the patient to get up."
The general course of these effusions was towards spontaneous absorption
"and recovery. Coagulation of the blood took place early, the fluid serum"
"separated, and tended to undergo absorption with some rapidity, leaving"
"a small amount of coagulum at the base, which evidenced its presence for"
many weeks by a persistence of a certain degree of dulness on
"percussion. Early coagulation, I think, accounted for the usual absence"
of gravitation ecchymosis as a sign.
The course to recovery was sometimes broken by signs of slight pleuritic
"inflammation, which, as affecting the amount of effusion, will be spoken"
of under the heading of symptoms. In some cases the amount of blood was
so great as to necessitate means being taken for its removal; in these a
reaccumulation often took place. Occasionally an empyema followed in
cases thus treated.
The nature of the blood evacuated on tapping varied much. In very early
"aspirations unchanged blood was often met with, but clot sometimes made"
evacuation difficult and necessitated a second puncture. In the tappings
"done at the end of a week or more a dark porter-like fluid was common,"
while when suppuration was imminent a brick-red-coloured grumous fluid
replaced normal blood. In the cases where early incision was resorted
"to, blood both fluid and in clots was often mixed with a certain"
"proportion of lymph flakes, perhaps indicating the part taken by"
inflammatory reaction to the irritation of the clot in producing the

"to companions. He is never peevish and fretful, always cheerful and"
good-tempered.”
VII.--_Stories of exaggerated and coarse fun._ In the chapter on the
positive side of this subject I shall speak more in detail of the
educational value of robust and virile representation of fun and of
"sheer nonsense, but as a representation to these statements, I should"
like to strike a note of warning about the element of exaggerated and
"coarse fun being encouraged in our school stories, partly because of"
the lack of humour in such presentations--a natural product of stifling
imagination--and partly because the train of the abnormal has the same
effect as the too frequent use of the melodramatic.
"You have only to read the adventures of Buster Brown, which for years"
"formed the Sunday reading of millions of children in the United States,"
to realise what would be the effect of coarse fun and entire absence
"of humour upon the normal child in its everyday experience, an effect"
all the greater because of the real skill with which the illustrations
are drawn. It is only fair to state that this series was not originally
"prepared or intended for the young, but it is a matter of regret"
(shared by most educationists in the States) that they should ever have
been given to children at all.
"In an article in _Macmillan's Magazine_, Dec. 1869, Miss Yonge writes:"
"“A taste for buffoonery is much to be discouraged, an exclusive taste"
for extravagance most unwholesome and even perverting. It becomes
destructive of reverence and soon degenerates into coarseness. It
"permits nothing poetical or imaginative, nothing sweet or pathetic to"
"exist, and there is a certain self-satisfaction and superiority in"
making game of what others regard with enthusiasm and sentiment which
absolutely bars the way against a higher or softer tone.”
are among the main purposes of the Institute I am opening to-day; in
these fields I am already fortunate in having a devoted band of
"disciples, whom I have been training for the last ten years. Their"
"number is very limited, but means may perhaps be forthcoming in the"
future to increase them. An enlarging field of young ability may thus be
"available, from which will emerge, with time and labour, individual"
"originality of research, productive invention and some day even creative"
genius.
But high success is not to be obtained without corresponding
"experimental exactitude, and this is needed to-day more than ever, and"
to-morrow yet more again. Hence the long battery of supersensitive
"instruments and apparatus, designed here, which stand before in their"
cases in our entrance hall. They will tell you of the protracted
struggle to get behind the deceptive seeming into the reality that
remained unseen;--of the continuous toil and persistence and of
ingenuity called forth for overcoming human limitations. In these
directions through the ever-increasing ingenuity of device for advancing
"science, I see at no distant future an advance of skill and of invention"
"among our workers; and if this skill be assured, practical applications"
will not fail to follow in many fields of human activity.
The advance of science is the principal object of this Institute and
also the diffusion of knowledge. We are here in the largest of all the
many chambers of this House of Knowledge--its Lecture Room. In adding
"this feature, and on a scale hitherto unprecedented in a Research"
"Institute, I have sought permanently to associate the advancement of"
knowledge with the widest possible civic and public diffusion of it; and
"this without any academic limitations, henceforth to all races and"
"languages, to both men and women alike, and for all time coming."
The lectures given here will not be mere repetitions of second-hand
"inclined to frolic away from chastity or integrity, much as did the"
county members who pocketed the bribes of Sir Robert Walpole and
prated of patriotism.
"Fortunately for society the man in the street is a very decent fellow,"
and generally finds out before long that Wisdom’s ways are ways of
pleasantness. A man may enjoy posing as an agnostic when he wants an
"excuse for--as the negro said--“doing what he dam please,” but when he"
"takes to himself a wife, and children are born to him, a certain"
anxiety as to the continuity and perpetuation of these relationships
"begins to show itself. A man who has lost a little child, or waited in"
"agonizing suspense to hear the physician’s verdict, when sickness"
"overshadows his home, discovers that he needs something beyond"
"negations, something that will bring life and immortality to light"
again within his soul.
"Moreover, the man in the street finds it necessary to come to some"
decision on other problems of existence. He is a citizen and must
needs exercise his enfranchisement and give his vote at an election
now and again. He must help to decide whether the State shall ignore
"religion and establish a system of ethical education, of which the"
"ultimate sanction is social convenience, or maintain the thesis that"
Creed and Character are mutually inter-dependent.
"As he pays his poor rate wrathfully, or with resignation, its annual"
increase reminds him of the necessity of curing or eliminating the
"unfit. When he reads of Belgian and Prussian colonial enterprise, or"
ponders on the perplexing problem of the Black Belt which the Southern
"States must solve, he is compelled to consider whether it is true"
that “God has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all
"the face of the earth,” or whether this shall be accounted as another"
of the delusions of Saul of Tarsus whom Governor Festus found to be
"befitting manner. A procession was formed, and, to the measured tread"
"of the Earl Marshal of England, Cardinal Vaughan, several archbishops"
"and bishops, and a mixed company of priests and acolytes and a numerous"
"train of household servants and dependents, carrying banners, crosses,"
"crucifixes, censers, lamps, candles, torches, and other ecclesiastical"
"stage paraphernalia, the remains of St. Edmund were borne to their"
"resting-place. All went off well, and at last the curtain fell on"
"the finished play, to the satisfaction of every one. Unfortunately,"
"however, the Pope and all concerned had to reckon with English"
"common-sense and with English love of truth, and it was not very long"
"before it was proved to the world that the bones, like most relics of"
"the kind, were counterfeit--whoever else's bones they were, they were"
"not those of St. Edmund.""[7]"
[Sidenote: The Blood of St. Januarius.]
I had read with cordial approval Mark Twain's animadversions upon the
fraud which is regularly practiced on the people of Naples by the
priests in the Cathedral:
"""In this city of Naples they believe in and support one of the"
wretchedest of all religious impostures one can find in Italy--the
miraculous liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius. Twice a year
"the priests assemble all the people at the Cathedral, and get out"
"this phial of clotted blood, and let them see it slowly dissolve"
and become liquid; and every day for eight days this dismal farce
"is repeated, while the priests go among the crowd and collect money"
for the exhibition. The first day the blood liquefies in forty-seven
"minutes--the church is full then, and time must be allowed the"
collectors to get around; after a while it liquefies a little quicker
"and a little quicker every day, as the houses grow smaller, till on"
"the eighth day, with only a few dozen present to see the miracle, it"
Chiriqui country you can see sugar cane fields that have gone on
producing practically without attention for fifteen seasons. Cornfields
have been worked for half a century without fertilizing or rotation of
crops. The soil there is volcanic detritus washed down during past ages
"from the mountainsides, and lies from six to twenty feet thick. It will"
"grow anything that needs no frost, but the province supports less than"
"four people to the square mile, nine-tenths of the land is unbroken and"
"Panama imports fruit from Jamaica, sugar from Cuba and tobacco and food"
stuffs from the United States.

"The fruits of Panama are the orange, which grows wild and for the proper"
"cultivation of which no effort has been made, which is equally the case"
"with the lemon and the lime; the banana, which plays so large a part in"
the economic development of the country that I shall treat of it at
"length later; the pineapple, cultivated in a haphazard way, still"
attains so high an order of excellence that Taboga pines are the
"standard for lusciousness; the mango, which grows in clusters so dense"
"that the very trees bend under their weight, but for which as yet little"
"market has been found, as they require an acquired taste; the mamei,"
hard to ship and difficult to eat because of its construction but withal
"a toothsome fruit; the paypaya, a melon not unlike our cantaloupe which"
"has the eccentricity of growing on trees; the sapodillo, a fruit of"
"excellent flavor tasting not unlike a ripe persimmon, but containing no"
pit. With cultivation all of these fruits could be grown in great
"quantities in all parts of the Republic, but to give them any economic"
importance some special arrangement for their regular and speedy
"marketing would have to be made, as with the banana, most of them being"
by nature extremely perishable.
claims to have practised in order to obtain a favorable judgment from
"Osiris. If one considers the period in which it appears, this ethics is"
"undoubtedly very elevated, but it seems rudimentary and even childish if"
"one compares it with the principles formulated by the Roman jurists, to say"
nothing of the minute psychological analyses of the Stoic casuists. In this
"range of ideas also, the maintenance of the most striking contrasts"
"characterizes Egyptian mentality, which was never shocked by the cruelties"
and obscenities that sullied the mythology and the ritual. Like Epicurus at
"Athens, some of the sacred texts actually invited the believers to enjoy"
life before the sadness of death.[47]
Isis was not a very austere goddess at the time she entered Italy.
"Identified with Venus, as Harpocrates was with Eros, she was honored"
"especially by the women with whom love was a profession. In Alexandria, the"
"city of pleasure, she had lost all severity, and at Rome this good goddess"
remained very indulgent to human weaknesses. Juvenal harshly refers to {91}
"her as a procuress,[48] and her temples had a more than doubtful"
"reputation, for they were frequented by young men in quest of gallant"
adventures. Apuleius himself chose a lewd tale in which to display his
fervor as an initiate.
"But we have said that Egypt was full of contradictions, and when a more"
"exacting morality demanded that the gods should make man virtuous, the"
Alexandrian mysteries offered to satisfy that demand.
At all times the Egyptian ritual attributed considerable importance to
"purity, or, to use a more adequate term, to cleanliness. Before every"
"ceremony the officiating priest had to submit to ablutions, sometimes to"
"fumigations or anointing, and to abstain from certain foods and from"
incontinence for a certain time. Originally no moral idea was connected
with this purification. It was considered a means of exorcising malevolent
demons or of putting the priest into a state in which the sacrifice
Since then there is good reason to believe that this was in effect the
"secret teaching of the mysteries, it would naturally be expected that"
human marriage should have been reckoned as it were a foretaste of
"that union with the divine which was promised hereafter, and also that"
death should have been counted the hour of its approaching fulfilment;
"in other words, if my view of the mysteries is correct, it would"
almost inevitably follow that the mysteries should have been brought
into close association both with weddings and with funerals. This
expectation is confirmed by the facts.
An ordinary wedding was treated as something akin to initiation into
"the mysteries. An inscription of Cos[1485], relating to the appointment"
"of priestesses of Demeter, mentions among other duties certain services"
"on the occasion of weddings; and the brides, who are the recipients"
"of these services, are divided into two classes, αἱ τελεύμεναι and αἱ"
"ἐπινυμφευόμεναι, the maidens who, are being ‘initiated,’ and the widows"
who are being married again; a woman’s first marriage in fact is called
"by a religious document her initiation, and Demeter’s priestesses"
are charged therewith. Nor was this usage or idea confined to Cos;
Plutarch speaks of services rendered by the priestess of Demeter in
the solemnisation of matrimony as part of an ‘ancestral rite[1486]’;
while the term τέλος was commonly used both of the mystic rites and of
"marriage, and τέλειοι might denote the newly-wed[1487]."
The same thought seems also to have inspired another custom
"associated with marriage. The newly-wed, we hear, sometimes attended"
"a representation of the marriage of Zeus and Hera[1488], an ἱερὸς"
γάμος which formed the subject of mystic drama or legend all over
Greece[1489]. The widely extended cults of Hera under the titles of
Maiden (παρθένος or παῖς) and of Bride (τελεία or νυμφευομένη) appear
to have been closely interwoven; indeed for a full appreciation of the
"under one crown, repeatedly collapsed. The marvel is that in such an age"
even the attempt was made. The remarkable woman who planned and first
"effected it, Queen Margaret of Norway, appealed in the first instance"
"with heavy bribes for the co-operation of the clergy,[671] who,"
"especially in Sweden, where they preferred the Danish rule to the"
"domination of the nobles,[672] were always in favour of it for"
ecclesiastical reasons.
"Had such a union permanently succeeded, it would have eliminated a"
serious source of positive political evil; but to carry forward
Scandinavian civilisation under the drawbacks of the medieval difficulty
"of inter-communication (involving lack of necessary culture-contacts),"
"the natural poverty of the soil, and the restrictive pressure of the"
"Catholic Church, would have been a task beyond the power of a monarchy"
"comprising three mutually jealous sections. As it was, the old strifes"
"recurred almost as frequently as before, and moral union was never"
"developed. If historical evidence is to count for anything, the"
experience of the Scandinavian stocks should suffice to discredit once
"for all the persistent pretence that the ""Teutonic races"" have a faculty"
"for union denied to the Celtic, inasmuch as they, apparently the most"
"purely Teutonic of all, were even more irreconcilable, less fusible,"
than the Anglo-Saxons before the Norman Conquest and the Germans down
"till our own day, and much more mutually jealous than the quasi-Teutonic"
"provinces of the Netherlands, which, after the severance of Belgium,"
"have latterly lost their extreme repulsions, while those of Scandinavia"
"are not yet dead.[673] The explanation, of course, is not racial in any"
case; but it is for those who affirm that capacity for union is a
Teutonic gift to find a racial excuse.
"With the Reformation, though that was nowhere more clearly than in"
"Scandinavia a revolution of plunder, there began a new progress, in"
respect not of any friendliness of the Lutheran system to thought and
"were pouring forth the richest music, while a dense crowd of people,"
"many thousands, all standing, watched with eager interest a small,"
"crate-like object, made of slats of dark wood, which rested on the"
"high altar, enclosed in a glass case, with a gold baby on top and gold"
ornaments round about.
[Sidenote: The Holy Cradle.]
"We pushed our way through the crowd, so as to get a satisfactory view"
"of it while the service was in progress--the genuflections, the robing"
"and disrobing of the archbishop, the chanting, and the rest--after"
"which six men, dressed in pure white from head to foot (white gloves"
"included), except for a red circle and cross on the breast, knelt"
"before the cradle, then lifted it from the altar, with its gold and"
"glass setting, and placing it on a kind of litter on their shoulders,"
"under a gilt and white canopy borne by other attendants, marched with"
"it thus, in procession around the church, along with a large crucifix"
"under another canopy, and followed by a long line of cardinals,"
"bishops, priests and acolytes, carrying it back finally to its place in"
"the sacristy, where it will remain till next Christmas Day."
[Sidenote: The Christ of Rome a Babe or a Corpse.]
"We squeezed our way through the great crowd at the door, and walked"
"back to our hotel, wondering to what extent the usual Roman Catholic"
conception of Christ had deprived that organization of real spiritual
"energy; for, almost invariably, Roman Catholic art represents him"
"either as a dead Christ on the cross, or a babe in his mother's arms,"
"and hardly ever as the risen and glorified Lord, the Conqueror of"
"death, the Leader of his people, to whom all power is given in heaven"
and on earth--the more usual Protestant conception. And we asked
ourselves whether this difference did not help to explain the greater
addition of a puncture by an exploring needle between the first and
"second rise. After a wider experience, however, I abandoned the"
"infection theory, as it seemed opposed by the very infrequent sequence"
of suppuration. The effect of simple removal of the blood or serum was
also often so striking as to strongly suggest that it alone was
"responsible for the fever. Exactly the same result, moreover, followed"
evacuation of the interstitial blood effusions already mentioned
elsewhere.
The common course of all the cases of hæmothorax was to spontaneous
"recovery, the rapidity of the subsidence of the signs depending mainly"
"on the quantity of the primary hæmorrhage, and the occurrence of further"
increases. The blood serum tended to collect at the upper limit of the
"original blood effusion (as was often proved on tapping), and this was"
first absorbed; the clot deposited on the pleural surface and at the
"basal part of the cavity was, however, not absorbed with the same"
"rapidity. In the majority of the patients when they left the hospitals,"
"at the end of six weeks on an average, some dulness and deficiency of"
"vesicular murmur always remained, and the clot and the surrounding"
"surface, irritated by its presence, will, no doubt, be responsible for"
permanent adhesions in many cases. That such adhesions do form in the
"majority of cases I feel certain, as, although these patients when they"
"left the hospital were to all intents and purposes apparently well, few"
of them could undertake sustained exertion without getting short of
"breath, and sometimes suffering from transitory pain, and for this"
reason it became customary to invalid them home.
In a small proportion of the cases empyema followed; but I never saw
"this in any case that had neither been tapped nor opened, and I saw"
only one patient die from a chest wound uncomplicated by other injuries.
This case was an interesting one of recurrent hæmorrhage followed by
inflammatory troubles:--
period. The rejoicing is tempered by the fear of the demons who were
supposed to be lurking near to do mischief to the new life and to the one
"who brought it forth. The thought is a natural one, for the young life"
"hangs in the balance, while that of the mother appears to be positively"
threatened. All bodily suffering and all physical ailments being ascribed
"to the influence of bad demons, or to the equally malevolent influence of"
persons who could by their control of the demons or in some other way
"throw a spell over the individual, Birth, Puberty, Marriage and Death as"
the four periods in life which may be regarded as critical and
transitional are marked by popular customs and religious rites that follow
"mankind from primitive times down to our own days. A modern scholar, Van"
"Gennep, who has recently gathered these customs in a volume and"
"interpreted them, calls his work 'Rites de Passage', i. e., customs"
associated with the four periods of transition from one stage to the other
"and which survive in advanced forms of faith as Baptism, Confirmation,"
"Marriage ceremonies and Funeral rites, just as the chief festivals in all"
religions are the 'Rites de Passage' of nature--associated with the
"transition periods of the year, with the vernal equinox, the summer"
"solstice, the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice or, expressed in"
"agricultural terms, with sowing time, with blossoming or early harvest"
"time, with the later harvest time and with the period of decay."
The significance attached to birth omens is thus merely a phase of the
ceremonies attendant upon the passage of the new-born from its mysterious
hiding place to the light. The analogy between the new life and the
"processes of nature is complete, for the plant, too, after being hidden in"
"the earth, which is pictured in the religions of antiquity as a 'great"
"mother', comes to the surface."
"through the lungs, although without serious consequences. Under the"
heading of injury to the large intestine a somewhat special form of
pleural septicæmia will be referred to.
It may at once be stated that such favourable results as occurred in
abdominal injuries were practically limited to wounds caused by bullets
"of small calibre, and that, although in the short chapter dealing with"
"shell injuries a few recoveries from visceral wounds will be mentioned,"
I never met with a penetrating visceral injury from a Martini-Henry or
large sporting bullet which did not prove fatal.
_Wounds of the abdominal wall._--It is somewhat paradoxical to say that
these injuries possessed special interest from their comparative rarity
"of occurrence, since they were not of intrinsic importance. Their"
infrequency depended on the difficulty of striking the body in such a
"plane as to implicate the belly wall alone, and their interest in the"
diagnostic difficulty which they gave rise to.
In many cases the position of the openings and the strongly oval or
gutter character possessed by them were sufficient proof of the
superficial passage of the bullet; in others we had to bear in mind that
the position of the patient when struck was rarely that of rest in the
"supine position, in which the surgical examination was made, and"
considerable difficulty arose. Some superficial tracks crossing the
belly wall have already been referred to in the chapter on wounds in
"general and in that dealing with injuries to the chest, in which the"
above characters sufficed to indicate that penetration of the abdominal
cavity had not occurred. In other instances a definite subcutaneous
"gutter could be traced, and often in these a well-marked cord in the"
abdominal wall corresponding to the track could be felt at a later date.
"Again, limitation to the abdominal wall was sometimes proved by the"
"position of the retained bullet, or sometimes by the presence in the"
crime impelled men to seek absolution in the formal practices of
asceticism. They applied to the Oriental priests for spiritual remedies.
People flattered themselves that by performing the rites they would attain
a condition of felicity after death. All barbarian mysteries pretended to
reveal to their adherents the secret of blessed immortality. Participation
in the occult ceremonies of the sect was a {43} chief means of
salvation.[36] The vague and disheartening beliefs of ancient paganism in
regard to life after death were transformed into the firm hope of a
well-defined form of happiness.[37]
This faith in a personal survival of the soul and even of the body was
"based upon a strong instinct of human nature, the instinct of"
self-preservation. Social and moral conditions in the empire during its
decline gave it greater strength than it had ever possessed before.[38] The
"third century saw so much suffering, anguish and violence, so much"
"unnecessary ruin and so many unpunished crimes, that the Roman world took"
refuge in the expectation of a better existence in which all the iniquity
of this world would be retrieved. No earthly hope brightened life. The
tyranny of a corrupt bureaucracy choked all disposition for political
progress. Science stagnated and revealed no more unknown truths. Growing
poverty discouraged the spirit of enterprise. The idea gained ground that
"humanity was afflicted with incurable decay, that nature was approaching"
her doom and that the end of world was near.[39] We must remember all these
causes of discouragement and despondency to understand the power of the
"idea, expressed so frequently, that the spirit animating man was forced by"
bitter necessity to imprison itself in matter and that it was delivered
from its carnal captivity by death. In the heavy atmosphere of a period of
oppression and impotence the dejected soul longed with incredible ardor to
fly to the radiant abode of heaven.
"To recapitulate, the Oriental religions acted upon the senses, the"
"first entered the Duchess's drawing-room that evening, and had there"
"been introduced to his hostess, had been a sort of revelation to the"
"languid, fashionable guests assembled; sudden quick whispers were"
"exchanged--surprised glances,--how unlike he was to the general type of"
"the nervous, fagged, dyspeptic ""literary"" man!"
"And now that every one was seated at dinner, the same impression"
"remained on all,--an impression that was to some disagreeable and"
"humiliating, and that yet could not be got over,--namely, that this"
"""poet,"" whom, in a way, the Duchess and her friends had intended to"
"patronize, was distinctly superior to them all. Nature, as though proud"
"of her handiwork, proclaimed him as such,--while he, quite unconscious"
"of the effect he produced, wondered why this bevy of human beings, most"
of whom were more or less distinguished in the world of art and
"literature, had so little to say for themselves. Their conversation was"
"BANAL,--tame,--ordinary; they might have been well-behaved, elegantly"
"dressed peasants for aught they said of wise, cheerful, or witty. The"
"weather,--the parks,--the theatres,--the newest actress, and the newest"
"remedies for indigestion,--these sort of subjects were bandied about"
from one to the other with a vaguely tame persistence that was really
"irritating,--the question of remedies for indigestion seemed to hold"
"ground longest, owing to the variety of opinions expressed thereon."
"The Duchess grew more and more inwardly vexed, and her little foot beat"
"an impatient tattoo under the table, as she replied with careless"
"brevity to a few of the commonplace observations addressed to her, and"
"cast an occasional annoyed glance at her lord, M le Duc, a thin,"
"military-looking individual, with a well waxed and pointed mustache,"
whose countenance suggested an admirably executed mask. It was a face
"that said absolutely nothing,--yet beneath its cold impassiveness"
"linked the satyr-like, complex, half civilized, half brutish mind of"
"the born and bred Parisian,--the goblin-creature with whom pure"
III
The field of observation in the case of the new-born among mankind and in
"the animal world is large--very large, and yet definitely bounded. Normal"
"conditions were naturally without special significance, but any deviation"
from the normal was regarded as a sign calling for interpretation. Such
deviations covered a wide and almost boundless range from peculiar
"formations of any part of the body or of the features, to actual"
"malformations and monstrosities. The general underlying principle was, the"
"greater the abnormality, the greater the significance attached to it; and"
"as in the case of the movements in the heaven, the unusual was regarded as"
an indication of some imminent unusual occurrence. We are fortunate in
"possessing among the tablets of Ashurbanapal's library, unearthed by"
Layard just fifty years ago and which is still our main source for the
"Babylonian-Assyrian religious literature, many hundreds of texts"
"furnishing lists of birth omens and their interpretation[12], just as we"
"have many hundreds of texts dealing with liver divination[13], and even"
"more dealing with Astrology[14], apart from the many hundreds of texts"
dealing with miscellaneous omens of which up to the present only a small
proportion has been published[15]. From this division of the great
collection gathered by Ashurbanapal's scribes chiefly from the temple
"archives of Babylonia, it appears that the =bârû=-priests made extensive"
collections of all kinds of omens which served the purpose of official
hand-books to be consulted in case of questions put to the priests as to
"the significance of any particular phenomenon, and which were also used as"
textbooks for the training of the aspirants to the priesthood.
"Confining ourselves to the birth-omens[16], the first question that arises"
is whether the signs entered are based on actual occurrences or are
"fanciful. In the case of many entries, as will presently be made evident,"
"the anomalies noted rest upon =actual= observation, but with the desire of"
of his history.
"Against the humanistic or pragmatic conception of history, which finds"
"the reasons and motives of history in the abstract individual, as"
"against the opposite view, for which the true history is only that"
"of the collectivity, of the institutions, of the human values, Croce"
"reasserts his concept of the actuality of the spirit, in regard to"
which the individual is as much of an abstraction as the society or
the value which does not entirely realize itself in the fact. The
"object of history is neither Pericles nor Politics, neither Sophocles"
"nor Tragedy, neither Plato nor Philosophy; but the universal in the"
"individual, that is, Politics, Tragedy, Philosophy, as Pericles,"
"Sophocles, and Plato, or Pericles, Sophocles, and Plato as particular"
"moments of Politics, of Tragedy, and of Philosophy."
"As there are no special philosophical sciences, and then a general"
"philosophy, which should be outside or above them, but whenever we"
"think of reality under one of its aspects or distinctions, we think"
"of the whole of reality in one of its determinations, so there are no"
"special histories, the limits of which can be definitely stated, and"
"above them a general history, which would in a new form revive the myth"
"of universal history. We have seen how literary history, for instance,"
tends inevitably to become the whole spiritual history of a nation;
"and the same applies to all special histories, whether political or"
"moral, or philosophical. There are divisions of history, according"
"to the quality of the objects, to time and space, but such divisions"
"are mere empirical classifications, practical instruments or literary"
expedients; and we can use as the foundation of such divisions even the
ideal distinctions of the fundamental forms of spiritual activity. But
when these distinctions are understood as actual distinctions of the
"aspects of the spiritual life, of which we make history, then all the"
"other aspects will inevitably be present in the particular distinction,"

"Well, I mean, he can date her if he wants, but he knows I still like her."
I don't think he would ask her out on a date.
"But then again, I guess he did."
Huh.
"It's, uh..."
I can't believe that.
Fancy that.
I can't either.
"You're not maybe planning on going to the movies with Alice and then bumping into Henry and Dylan and doing a little do-si-do, are you?"
Go back upstairs.
You're not going anywhere.
And give me your phone.
What's the code?
D-Y-L-A-N.
(SIGHS) I figured.
"Look, come on, Dad, just let me go out with her."
Adrian's boyfriend is asking her to marry him and she's practically engaged and Amy's married and it's not fair!
See ya.
Can I at least call Alice and tell her not to come over?
"Her number's in your contacts, right?"
I'll call her.
"All right, that's just an invasion of privacy!"
Go.
I'm too old to be sent to my room!
I'm divorced!
I've lost a child!
I'm over 18.
I'm an adult!
WAS FORCED OUT OF THE DODGERS AT THE END OF THE 1950 SEASON
"AFTER A POWER STRUGGLE WITH CO-OWN ER WALTER O'MALLEY,"
LEAVING JACKIE WITHOUT HIS FRIEND AND DEFENDER.
THE 1951 BROOKLYN DODGERS WERE LOADED WITH ALL-STARS.
"AND AS SPRING TRAINING BEGAN,"
THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT THEY HAD THE BEST LINEUP IN BASEBALL.
"BY MID-MAY, ROBINSON WAS BATTING OVER .400"
AND THE DODGERS WERE IN FIRST PLACE.
BUT HE WAS STILL A TARGET.
"BEFORE A GAME IN CINCINNATI,"
LETTERS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE REDS AND THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER
CLAIMING THAT JACKIE ROBINSON WOULD BE SHOT
IF HE TOOK THE FIELD.
NEWCOMBE:
"I WON'T USE THE WORDS THAT THEY USED, BUT THEY SAID,"
"""IF YOU SHOW UP TODAY AT CROSLEY FIELD, YOU ARE GOING TO DIE."""
"JACKIE SAID, ""WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?"""
"I SAID, ""WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"""
"HE SAID, ""ARE YOU GOING TO THE BALLPARK TODAY?"""
"I SAID, ""ARE YOU GOING?"" HE SAID, ""YES, I'M GOING."""
"I SAID, ""WELL, I'M GOING, TOO."""
VIN SCULLY:
THAT WAS DEADLY SERIOUS.
"THEY HAD F.B.I. MEN THROUGHOUT THE BALLPARK,"
ON THE ROOFTOPS.
AND THEY HAD A MEETING BEFORE THE GAME.
IT WAS PRETTY TENSE.
AND IT GOT PRETTY QUIET.
AND WHAT...
WHAT DO WE SAY?
"GENE HERMANSKI, KIND OF A KIDDER, SAID,"
"""HEY, SKIPPER, I GOT AN IDEA."
U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS ALL OVER IT.
"I LEFT A MESSAGE, HAVEN'T HEARD BACK, AND THAT'S ABOUT IT."
I SHOULD GO TALK TO EVELYN.
"YOU JUST TALKED TO HER, MIKE."
"YEAH, BUT SHE WAS A LITTLE FLUSTERED THE LAST TIME."
SHE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO GET THOSE DOCUMENTS
TO LUCY FOR YOUR FAKE I.D.
"YEAH, I'LL DO IT LATER."
"SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW, SAM?"
"ABOUT WHAT, FI?"
ABOUT WHY MICHAEL'S ACTING THIS WAY.
WHAT WAY?
HE SEEMS FINE TO ME.
TELL ME ABOUT THIS NEW CLIENT.
"YOU KNOW, I JUST REMEMBERED."
"I'VE GOT TO GET MIKE SOME YOGURT,"
"'CAUSE IF I DON'T DO THAT, BOY, YOU KNOW HOW HE IS."
HE NEVER MENTIONED TROUBLE AT WORK.
DO YOU THINK THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION?
COULD BE.
"YOU HEAR ATF INVESTIGATION, IT RAISES FLAGS."
I WISH I COULD BE MORE HELPFUL.
SORRY.
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON GETTING YOUR SON BACK.
THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH IT.
"EVELYN, I THINK YOU'RE STRONGER THAN YOU REALIZE."
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE JUST STUCK WITH IT.
"YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED"
IF I HAD PRETENDED THAT EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT?
"BUT I DIDN'T WANT MY FAMILY TO BE A LIE,"
NOT FOR JASPER AND NOT FOR ME.
"Honey, our friend is asking for our help."
"She's 20 years old, for God's sake."
"She's probably with a bunch of dudes, like, sweating, drinking and dancing it out of her system."
What's the problem?
Let her spend the night on Hump Island!
"I promise, she's gonna come back here first thing in the morning!"
"Dave, firstly..."
I don't want her to spend a night on Hump Island.
"No, I..."
I'm just trying to say it's not like she's kidnapped or something.
"Now she's dead, Dave?"
Huh?
Now she's dead?
"She's dead, now?"
She's not dead.
She's dead on Hump Island!
I'm just trying to put it in perspective for you!
You know what?
"I don't even know why I'm blowing up at you, because it..."
It's...
"Once again, it's my fault."
This is a Shane thing.
I've been dealing with this all my life.
"First Jennifer, and now Trudy."
"We're gonna find her, okay?"
I got a plan.
I know how to get there.
You do?
"Yeah, I do."
"I just can't tell you now ""cause we got Mr. Belvedere clocking us."
Now everybody take it real casual.
Just drink your drinks and smile.
I wasn't trying to make you feel bad.
I know you weren't.
"I mean, I did this to myself."
"I didn't get into college, all my friends did."
"I don't have a job, so..."
"See, there's really nothing for me to go home to."
Hi.
Hi.
Are you ready?
"Uh, yeah, I am."
"Wait a minute, Eric, what are you saying?"
"Cor, I'm not going home."
Cory?
"Eric, please."
Just come to your senses and tell me we're leaving.
"Oh, Cor, I have come to my senses."
This place is great!
"I mean, it's got Irene, it's got soup, it's got pie, why would I ever leave?"
"Eric, it's not your home."
"That's right, it's not."
"At home, I'm a loser."
"Here, I find happiness."
You're trying to take it from me.
"No, Eric."
You didn't find happiness.
You just pulled off the road.
"I mean, you can't stay here for the rest of your life."
You just pulled off the road.
Maybe this is my exit.
"Look, Eric, we've been gone two months, all right?"
Mom and Dad are waiting.
I think we owe it to them at least one of us shows up.
I've heard every single word of it.
"Her body was mangled, still wearing her cute school uniform."
"I heard she was pretty tough though, and she didn't beg for her life."
"Her last words were ""I'm sorry."""
I wonder who they were meant for?
It brings tears to my eyes!
Y-You're lying!
It's true!
"I wanted to show you a picture of her body so I could see the despair on your face, but I think I'm going to resist."
"'Cause you know what, the damage is written all over your face, Kashim!"
My woman in Tokyo!
I'm already too late!
"Aww, poor Kaname- chan!"
"She was such a nice girl, too!"
Gauron!
"That's right, I killed her."
Now hate me.
"Go on, hate me, Kashim!"

"EVERY TIME THE OLD MAN GOT SORE AT ME, WHICH WAS OFTEN,"
HE USED TO TALK ABOUT YOU...
MOBLEY THIS AND MOBLEY THAT.
I GOT PRETTY SICK OF IT.
"YES, I CAN IMAGINE YOU DID."
THOSE THREE WHO WERE JUST IN HERE
MADE THEIR OPINION OF ME PRETTY PLAIN-
AMOS KYNE'S IDIOT SON.
I SUPPOSE YOU FEEL THE SAME.
"FRANKLY, I DON'T FEEL QUALIFIED"

"IT'S A GREAT IDEA, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF."
I'M GOING TO CREATE A NEW JOB-
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR...
SOMEONE TO DO THE ACTUAL WORK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?
IT SOUNDS LIKE A STEP YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE APPROVED.
MY FATHER IS DEAD.
THIS IS MY PLANT NOW.
I'M GOING TO GET MYSELF A GIMMICK-

"- Oh, we must go and see them."
"No other news, ma'am."
All gossip.
"Oh, there was one piece of news..."
Mr Ferrars is married.
"Who told you that Mr Ferrars was married, Tom?"
"I seen Mr Ferrars myself, ma'am."
"This morning in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was."
"Oh, Miss Lucy Steele?"
"Yes, ma'am."
They was at the door of the New London Inn.
"I took my hat off, and she knew me."
"Bade me give her best compliments, and Mr Ferrars' as well, to you all."
That is Lucy Steele.
- But did she tell you they were married?
"- Yes, ma'am."
I made free to wish her joy.
"Mr Ferrars was in the carriage, but he just looked out the other window."
- And well he might.
- They were going to her folk in Plymouth.
Miss Lucy seemed vastly pleased.
"Well, I..."
I'll put that lot away.
"Oh, poor Elinor."
"Oh, I cannot bear this."
"And I too, my child."
Through all her troubles I never thought of you once.
We all knew they were to be married.
Marianne had all my tenderness.
"I never thought once that you suffered as much, but unlike her were brave."
E-Excuse me.
I had better make sure that Colonel Brandon's room is ready.
Get off her!
- This is my favorite part.
- Which part?
I was lucky to get out of rebecca's apartment alive.
She threw this at my head.
Finn was reading moby dick?
"No,she was throwing it."
I took it so she couldn't re-arm.
"Okay,let's see what he had at siri's place."
- Razor and a toothbrush.
- Razor and a toothbrush.
Three pairs of white underwear.
Three pairs... pinkish underwear.
One black sock with a gold toe.
Don't you hate it when you leave one black sock at one fiancee's house and the other one at the other's house?
One pair of blue jeans.
And one blacmesh t-shirt.
Do women really like these?
Depends on who's wearing it.
- So if I... - no.
Not much to go on.
Only one place left to check.
Tony just put his hand in ather man's pocket and it made him very happy.
I found a pre-paid calling card.
- That's it?
- Yes.
No engagement rings?
"You want those,too?"
I'll go to siri's and get the ring and any other gifts finn might've given her.
"Mcgee,you've got rebecca."
How uid they have been so clueless?
"Well,he's dead,so maybe they weren'T."

He's ready to be a father to Chivonne?

I'm not going to talk to her.

IN HIS PERCEPTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DAY'S NEWS-
IT'S ALREADY ON THE WIRE.
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR.
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,"
"AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 A.M. THIS MORNING, IN OUR CITY,"
ONE HUMAN BEING TOOK THE LIFE OF ANOTHER.
"IN OUR WORLD, ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE NOT RARE."
"AND SO MY EXCUSE,"
"OR, I SHOULD SAY, MY REASON,"
"FOR GIVING IMPORTANCE TO THIS PARTICULAR STORY,"
IS MY HOPE THAT THE KILLER MAY BE LISTENING TO ME.
FOR I BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PROGRESS TO THE CHAIR
OR TO THE INSANE ASYLUM
"THAT HE HAS REACHED A WAY STATION,"
WHERE HIS SICK AND WARPED EGO DEMANDS TO BE FED
WITH THE MILK OF SELF-IMPORTANCE.
"AND SO, WITH THE CONSENT OF A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE,"
"WHO IS BY WAY OF BEING A REMARKABLE CRIMINOLOGIST,"
"BUT WHO HAS ALSO ASKED THAT HIS NAME NOT BE CREDITED,"
"I'M GOING TO SAY A FEW THINGS TO THE KILLER,"
FACE TO FACE.
ITEM 1-
"MR. UNKNOWN,"
YOU WILL NOT FOR VERY LONG REMAIN UNKNOWN.
ITEM 2-
YOU'RE HUSKY.
STRONG ENOUGH TO HAVE CHOKED TO DEATH THIS MORNING
A POOR SCHOOLTEACHER BY THE NAME OF LAURA KELLY.
ITEM 3-
YOU ARE THE SAME KILLER
"WHO, LAST WEEK, BLUDGEONED TO DEATH"
A GIRL BY THE NAME OF JUDITH FELTON.
"Llke I should have something important enough to know, , , where l was when lt happened,"
"But I don't yet,"
"And the fact that lt was a better time then, , , and people knew what they were supposed to do, , , and how to make the world better, Now, nobody knows anything,"
"We know who ls popular or that social studies ls boring,"
"Or that Brlan always has stomach trouble,"
"But nobody knows anything important,"
"I nstead of changing the world, , , people sit ln class and write notes about other people,"
My soda.
Get back.
Get back.
Get back.
Get back.
Stay back.
Be quiet.

"My God, I can not believe this."
That is like the weirdest thing that ever happened at this school.
Ever.
J ust think about who...
if we all weren't in our classrooms just minding our own business.
And look.
By what.
I could have been right at that spot.
I was there like ten minutes earlier.
What is the big deal?
It's not like anybody even got a flesh wound.
"It's me, Caroline."
My cards were stolen.
I've seen backs of vans with better candy selections.
This is a disgrace to the name Gas and Gobble.
How do you even wake up in the morning?
My alligator licks my face.
"Oh, my God, Max."
Whoever stole our credit cards maxed them out.
"They spent the $1,500 we had left."
No way.
"Someone just spent $1,500 on phone cards and cigarettes."
His name was Caroline Channing.
What?
That's my name!
"Ah, you got a dude's name."
"Ugh, we were robbed."
Police!
Where!
"Max, I am tired and I'm hungry and I can't find a mirror, but I am sensing a disturbance in my hair."
We have to go home!
But we have to go to Texas.
Randy needs me.
He's saying it on his Snapchat story.
Still on the movie set.
"Pretty lonely, so if anyone would respond to my Words With Friends request,"
"I promise to let you win, and if you're ever in Texas... why?"
See?
He's begging me to come there.
But we have no money to get to Texas.
Wrong.
I've got $11 in this one and $32 in this one.
Lefty's been holding back as per usual.
"Sorry to call late, cock."
I was up.
I just needed to hear a friendly voice.
It's been one prick of a day.
Yeah?
"First, Lorton."
And then-
"One of the many things Scarlet hates about me is my inability to lose my temper, so I won't even try now."
"But let's have nothing more to do with each other, OK?"
"Barn, what the hell are you- Ask Scarlet about John Bartrop."
"You were joking about him, remember?"
In the alley where Ben Rigby was killed.
What'd you call him?
A puff of wind in a mohair cardigan?
"You know, even when you're destroying lives, somehow it still comes out as a bloody joke."

I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Let her sneak this stuff in for you every week.
Let her fight these bastards every week!
Look what you're doing!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Let her sneak this shit in for you.
Will you stop it?
-Let her do it!
-Stop it!
Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.
Belle and Morrie are broke.
I asked your friend Remo for the money he owes you.
He told me to take the kids down to the police station and get on welfare.
"Karen, lt's going to be okay."
I've never seen Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.
That's what happens when you go away.
We're on our own.
Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.
As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
-l can't do it.
"-Yes, you can."
All I need is for you is to keep bringing me this stuff.
I gotta guy in here from Pittsburgh who's gonna help me move it.
In a month we're gonna be fine.
We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out....
He is not helping us out.
Phew.
"Listen, O'Leary, I know we're up against it time-wise, but, er..."
"Yeah, big time."
"We've got like, we've got to save Simon."
"Dermot, give me a second."
There's a bit of a big deal happening.
Right.
"Sid Lowecroft is leaving, um, this is a little present for his daughter."
"Oh, OK."
Put this on.
But he doesn't know who I am.
"That's what the whole kick is, he'll get a kick out of the new guy."
"He won't get a kick out of it, he'll go, ""Who are you?"
"""Why are you gate-crashing my last day?"""
"No, he won't, as soon as he walks in, blow that."
"Then give him the doll, read out the letter."
Yeah.
It's some kind words that I've written down for him.
OK.
And then let one of these bad boys off.
"Doll, letter, boom."
Bingo.
I'm going to go and get the cake.
Let him know that we're ready.
You're not in this with me?
"No, no, no, no, I'm just going to go and get a cake."
"Right, hide under there when he comes in."
Right.
Are you ready for this?
Under there?
"Yeah, under there."
Under there.
The film that we might work on together is actually sort of about that.
You're gonna work with Jim Jarmusch?
I don't want to go to a bar on Smith street.
Let's just go back to my place.
"I live with my dad, but he'll be out tonight."
- We can have a drink there.
- What year are you again at N.Y.U?
- Senior.
- Senior?
Okay.
"Wait, so you're 22, right?"
I'm going to be soon.
I'm 21.
"You don't think i'm too old, do you?"
I'm 30.
30 is cool.
I've been with guys older than you.
But are you a man or a boy?
"Well, what's the difference?"
With a man... you feel like you're being taken and you like it.
And with a boy you feel like they're stealing something from you and you don't like it.
This is it.
Thank you.
"Shit, my dad is home already."
We can go to seventh avenue and grab a drink.
We're going in his office.
It's fun in there.
It's a beautiful brownstone.
- Your dad's a therapist?
"- Yeah, he's a pain in the ass."
He thinks he's the Carl Jung of Brooklyn.
I like Carl Jung.
-l'll take care of it.
"-Tell him what you were telling me about, Frenchy."
-Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money like this coming in. ok?
Tourists and American servicemen change their money over into French money and send it back here.
-Calm down.
-lt's beautiful.
"It's totally, totally untraceable."
"Our only problem is getting a key, but I got a plan."
-Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
"-Yeah, he's a piece of work."
"If I'm right, there could be half a mil coming in, all cash."
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.
There's a Jewish holiday Monday.
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it. lt's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.
I'm the commandant.
He just comes in like he's picking up lost baggage with Tommy
-lt's beautiful.
-lt won't be a problem at all.
-Good.
-We're on.
What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.
"I'm in the middle of the fuckin' weeds, laying down."
"He comes over he says, ""What are you doing?"" l said, ""Restin'."""
"""Here, you're resting'?"""
- Yeah.
Are you ready for the hearing?
About that--do you think I could make it home before Thursday night?
Thursday night?
"Yeah, there's this meeting I usually speak at back home in Bedford, and I just don't want to be in Pittsburgh any longer than I have to be."
I don't think we can get it done that fast.
"Man, I just don't know."
I don't know what I'm doing.
What?
"I mean, you've seen her, you know?"
"She's beautiful, and she's grown up, and my life is a joke."
It's just-- l don't know. I don't-- [sighs]
"This is how I used to think about myself, I know."
"- l can do this, right?"
- Right.
"Because I'm better now, right?"
I can do this. I'm her daddy.
I can do this.
This is where l'm staying.
Nice place.
[laughs]
"Not really, but it's cheap."
"I live two hours away from here-- you know, in Bedford."
- Do you know it?
- No.
Bedford's really nice.
"It's quiet, it's peaceful."
"Do you want to come up for a while, maybe watch a movie?"
"No, no."
"I, uh-- l can buy you dinner."
There's a nice diner down the street.
Come on.
Caped Crusader probably has Black Widow under lock and key at this very minute.
- Commissioner Gordon.
-This is Irving Irving at the just-opened Heritage First National Bank.
"- Yes, Mr. Irving."
-I just had a call from Batman.
"He wants me to take $40,000 in a brown paper bag to the front of the bank at exactly 11:43 this morning."
"-Well, that sounds odd, Mr. Irving."
He says the Batmobile will be parked there.
And he's arranged for Black Widow to meet him and they will split the money.
"Oh, well, then do it by all means."
"- Thank you for calling, Mr. Irving."
"- All right, commissioner."
Ha!
"Apparently, Batman is springing a trap on Black Widow."
That's good.
Are you sure you're gonna be able to drive the Batmobile from the passenger side?
"Perfectly, Tarantula."
"What time is it, doll?"
Exactly 11 :37.
"Got to run, sweetheart."
Keep an eye on the Dynamic Duo.
While my Batman and Robin do their stuff.
"Ta-da, darling."
"Well, Chief O'Hara, Black Widow's caper should be just about over."
And I should be hearing from Batman now.
"Yes, right on schedule."
Why isn't he calling on the Batphone?
Commissioner Gordon.
"Ah, ha-ha-ha."
Ro-
"- Robin did what, Mr. Irving?"
Oh.
And they put me out in the streets.
"Well, child, that ain't nothing to cry about."
Look here.
"Here you got an apartment, right smack on the corner with the highest ceiling in Harlem."
'Look at that electric light.'
"'Why, you even got running water.'"
"Ah-h, child, with that smile you got everything."
"'Why, you're the richest gal in Harlem.'"
What do you care about being outdoor?
What will I do when it rains?
"If you insist on being inside, go in and tell that landlord.."
"[""I'm Livin' ina Great Big Way""]"
* You got a snap in your fingers *
Got that.
* And a rhythm in your walk.
Got that too.
* As the elephant say I'm livin' in a great big way *
"It's all the way you look at it, you know."
* Got a handful of nothin'
"Why, you're a rich millionaire."
* But I watch it like a hawk.
True mama.
"*Well, I'm doin' okay *"
*I'm livin' in a great big way *
Tell that to the landlord.
* I'm the salt in the ocean
* I'm the sun way up in the sky *
"Oh, no."
*I'm a Franklin D. Roosevelt *
*I'm a million dollars *
* Long as I got a snap in my fingers *
* Rhythm in my walk.
-What shit are you talking about?
-Just stay away from the garbage.
"I'm not talking about what you did inside, you did what you had to do."
I'm talking about now.
From here and now.
-Why would I get into that?
-Don't make a jerk out of me.
Just don't do it.
Don't do it.
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.
"He's a good earner, but he takes too many chances."
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.
"Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy."
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.
-You got to watch out for them.
-l only use them for certain things.
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll die in prison. I don't need that.
So I'm warning everybody.
"Could be my son, could be anybody."
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello to some fuck who was selling junk.
"That won't happen to me, understand?"
You're out early because I got you a job.
I don't need this heat.
"You see anybody fuckin' around with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?"
.
That means anybody.
-All right.
-Yeah?
Yeah.
What?

Well...
See you soon.
"Welcome to London, Mr Heisenberg."
"I'm Major Julie Smith, Special Operations Executive."
I'm in charge of the debriefing of the German atomic programme.
Would you care to follow me?
[Sighs] He loves me.
Mmm.
He loves me not.
He loves me!
[laughs] I knew it!
"Ariel, stop talking crazy!"
I gotta see him again... tonight.
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
"- Ariel, please!"
Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs?
"I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder will splash around to get his attention."
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!
"Ariel, listen to me."

"You don't seem very happy over our victory, Mr. Campbell."
He's not.
He wants to kill all the Yankees himself.
[laughter]
- Sounds like a Kentuckian.
- We're all from Kentucky.
"You'll find plenty of action later on, sir."
"But before you go any further South, there's one thing we must teach you."
What's that?
Dixie.
- Sing it.

"Mr. Campbell, do you have something on your mind?"
I wanna know just one thing.
Do we have to be better Southerners than the Johnny Rebs themselves?
I went pretty far tonight.
But let me tell you this:
How you doin'?
"Okay, why don't you just... put down the gun and tell me what's going on here."
Yeah.
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.
- I'm John Klein.
My car broke down...
"- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein."
Two nights ago... at 2:30 in the a.m.
there's a bang on the door.
"I open it up, and here's this guy."
He says he wants to use the phone.
But there's something creepy about him... so I tell him to get lost.
"Last night at 2:30 on the dot, guess who's back."
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?
I am absolutely positive.
it's Mr. Klein.
- Crazy.
This is...
- I am not crazy.
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?
I warned him off my property.
"I used the word ""trespass"", and he still came back."
"You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I had the right to shoot you on my porch."
"He'd have to been inside the house, Gordon."
What?
Fine.
"So tonight I figured the dumb %$# might come back, and sure enough, there he is."
It´s Imposible.
It wasn't me.
I don't know what's happening here.
"Thank you for coming, everybody."
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm sorry.
It's not every day my boss is chosen to be in a magazine.
Is he a good kisser?
"- Oh, my God."
Where's my dad?
"- Oh, he's running a little late."
"Would it be horrible if you just went and, uh, hung out in the kitchen for a little while?"
Then I can distract my dad somehow and...
"Alex, I got to tell you-- hiding's really not my thing."
"Could it be your thing for, like, five minutes?"
"All right, but I'm making a sandwich, I'm not cleaning up."
"Oh, excuse me, everyone, everyone."
"Um, my dad doesn't know about me and Scott, so let's not tell him, okay?"
Not that there's anything to hide.
"It was, like, one motorcycle ride."
It's always the motorcycle guys.
"Hey, honey."
"Oh, the traffic."
"Yeah, what are you gonna do?"
Hummus?
I wanted to see the look on your face.
Stephen... did you get it on tape?
"Dad, Dad-- you don't need to see the tape."
Here's how it went.
Surprise!
"Oh, my God."
This is so sweet.
"Ooh, hummus."
Was that cute or what?
Let's take a look at the tape.
"I'm the house, you're the player."
"I believe the word is ""sucker. """
Okay.
"I've got a nine up, and you've got a five and a six for 11."
Do you want a card?
I want to double down.
"KITT, that's doubling your bet and you only get one card."
You sure you wanna do that?
Is the house in the habit of advising the player?
Your money.
I believe that's 21.
"Thank you, michael."
"They call that ""beginner's luck,"" pal."
"As I understand it, the phrase is,"
"""shut up and deal. """
"Hold on to your horses, hotshot, we've got Devon on the line."
"Hello, Devon!"
"Hello, michael."
I'm glad to see that you're getting into the spirit of things.
"Yeah, I'm already $2 behind."
What's up?
"Uh, there's, uh, someone I want you to check out for me since you're going through Las Vegas, anyway."
"Her name is, um, Rita Wilcox."
She works at Caesars Palace.
"Okay, what are we looking for?"
I'm not sure.
She tells a provocative but fantastic story about a missing brother.
All right.
I'll see what she has to say.
"With any luck, we should be pulling in to Vegas about 10:00, 10:30 tonight."
See you later.
Right.
And Becca...
I think you've met Becca before.
"Yes, I've met Becca before."
It's good to see you.
Hi nice to meet you.
You too.
Wow...
How are you?
I'm sorry I was actually just about to take off.
"Aw well that's too bad, well listen my tour got pushed back a month or so... so I'm going to be around."
"Oh, and hey listen tomorrow night my band and I are doing a little set at the Hotel Cafe if you guys... want to come by that would be great."
"Yeah, sure."
I love your music.
Thank you.
"Ok maybe, maybe we will."
"Well, just email me the address and..."
Yeah.
Oh...
"Ah, I think the Pap's have found you and um... your girlfriend's kind of looking a little lonely."
No pictures.
"Oh, that's actually not my girlfriend it's just a girl who's my friend."
"Oh right, um hum."
"Hey, Cece this is my friend Dale."
Hi.
"- Hey, nice to meet you."
I'm just going to get my stuff.
"Ok, we will..."
Don't forget to email me.
Don't forget to come.
So you guys all went to Catholic boarding school together?
OK I can't imagine that.
We've known each other since we were fifteen.
Very good.
We are counting on you to do your best in the national communication network sector.
I'll do my best.
"These are the new bodyguards, Kim Na Na and Shin Eun Ah."
Bodyguard Kim Na Na is 27 years old and is a 4th Dan in Judo.
Bodyguard Shin Eun Ah is 24 years old and is a 5th Dan in Taekwondo.
I already said I don't need bodyguards.
President.
"Please be with Mr. Lee, he is waiting for you."
All right.
"My child is stubborn, sorry to trouble you all."
Just treat her as your sister.
If you need to teach her a lesson then do so.
"I will do well, President."
I will do my best.
Okay.
"Because she had to repeat a year, she's a bit sensitive when it comes to school."
So please be a little more understanding.
"Don't hand in your letter of resignation, okay?"
Yes.
That Dr. Lee Yun Seong.
"Since you've studied in United States, your English must be really good."
My English is rather poor.
"You be my tutor, okay?"
"Chief, can you tell me the business plan?"
"Oh, okay."
Let's go.
"Both of you, do a good job."
"Wow, how can there be such a man?"
!
"Eonni, you saw it, right?"
He totally ignored me.
"Um, I don't think she would."
Why not?
"Well, you see, it's like plants."
There's a time and a season for things to grow and bloom and then they fade and die away.
"Your mother and I have, uh, been through a lot of seasons together."
You mean you just don't like each other.
"No, no, no, no, I don't mean that."
"Well, you don't."
"No, we don't."
Why not?
I'm not the man that she wanted me to be.
And she's not the woman I fell in love with.
We both fell in love with a picture-- in our heads.
Not with each other.
Am I just a picture in your head?
"No, no, no, no."
You're the only thing I love in this world.
I don't want to go.
I know.
[sobs]
Do I have to?
"Well, it'll be a great vacation for you."
"Yeah, who wants to go out west?"
"Oh, what do you mean?"
"Arizona, Death Valley-- all those horses and cowboys and Indians."
"Yeah, bang, bang-- great."
Your mother's got a friend out there.
She told me.
You might like him.
"Well, you might."
"Billy, she's lonely."
She's doing the best she can.
Mother?
Father?
Zendaya?
Cheerleading squad?
Ooh...
I've got all I need.
Good news!
"I got approval for a laptop, so now I can work up here and W-2 with my boo."
Boop!
"Jack, you better talk to her soon."
"She's only booped, like, three other guys."
Yeah.
"Man up, wuss."
"Hey, remember when I just called you a wuss?"
I'm really sorry about that.
"I just, I'm finally bonding with Emma."
It's so exciting.
"Clark, you sold out a friend to score points with a girl."
That means you're growing as a person.
Thanks.
How are you going to deal with this Amy situation?
"Oh, I don't know!"
"Usually I just tell a woman it's over, hop on a plane, and suddenly she's the TSA's problem."
I could help you.
"Uh, okay, so you've broken up with tons of girls?"
[chuckles]:
No.
They've broken up with me.
I know more about break-ups than anyone except Taylor Swift and every person she has ever dated.
"I've been dumped by nine women, and I've only dated five of them."
"Wait, wait, so four strangers just walked up to you and said, ""It's over""?"
One of them was on a bike.
"Oh, hey, Marissa, I was really sorry to read about your stepdad in the paper today."
- You read the paper?
"- Just the L.A. Times, the New York Times, the Orange County Register and The Wall Street Journal."
"This relationship is probably over now, right?"
I'll just go.
"No, no, no."
Stay.
"Um, actually, we were just talking, and um..."
What are you doing this weekend?
You got to be kidding me.
"I know, I know."
"I'm sorry, but it's the only seat left."
"- Don't worry, I promise I'll keep my hands to myself."
"- Well, it's your elbow I'm worried about."
- Why do you hate me so much?
"- No, I don't;"
I'm sorry.
- What did I do?
- It was an accident.
"- No, it was like four accidents."
"- Six, if you count each individual tampon."
- I don't know what else you want me to say.
- Nothing.
"In fact, we never need to speak to each other again."
"- Yeah, see, but I was really enjoying getting to know you."
"- Well, I wasn't."
- I was being sarcastic.
- I wasn't.
"Morning, guys."
"Your favorite physics teacher here, R.E. Greenberg, with your new lab partner assignments."
We've got Adrianna Alberghetti with Philip Raskin.
Ryan Atwood with Lindsay Gardner.
He's got ideas - big ones.
"Isn't that right, Prof?"
"Damn right, Rambo."
I see.
"In two days, you'll be begging me to come back."
Yeah?
"In two days, you'll be begging us for change!"
On the streets!
"Yes, Prof!"
Rinser!
"Right, let's go jugball."
Everyone has to watch.
"Now, that's a good chair."
Me tooth's all hurty.
It's one of my best ones and all.
Maybe it's a wisdom tooth.
Unlikely Grumio'd have any of them.
Why are you dressed like an adult?
"Because I'm a big cheese, now, baby, and don't you forget it."
"Don't you forget to lower the price of grain, then."
"Yes, yes, on my list."
Below fixing the loos but above the squeaky door.
You - we've gots to go.
Hoots!
"Good morning, everyone."
My name is Marcus Gallo.
I'm the new Head of HR.
"Under my watch, this company is going to look after everyone - from the brainy boffins in Accounts, all the way down to Lena the cleaner, starting today."
"Also starting today, guys, there's a big jugball tournament here on the jugball court."
Please come and watch Stylax and his team-mate take on me and Urbo.
Where'd you get him from?
"He works in Finance, I think."
I don't know.
Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.
"When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him."
Hey!
Anyone want to be his lawyer?
"Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!"
All rise!
The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.
Show-off.
May Doc have mercy on your soul.
"All right,"
"I wanna know who's responsible for wrecking' my town, Sheriff."
I want his hood on a platter!
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
"No, check that."
"I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him, and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot."
I'm...
"Throw him out of here, Sheriff."
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!
"Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyering' stuff."
"Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!"
Holy Porsche!
She's gotta be from my attorney's office.
"Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set."
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?
"Yeah, your job's pretty easy today."
All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you.
Maybe Caleb is the same.
It's only Hanna.
I wasn't asking who you were on the phone with.
Do you want the last bit of cobbler?
I can just bring it up for you.
"No, thanks."
Okay.
"- What do you mean, ""only Hanna""?"
- It's my mom.
Things are still sub-zero around here.
Did you tell her about Paige's dad?
No point.
She'll say it's my fault for choosing a disgusting lifestyle.
Paige is such a knob.
- I don't think it's all her fault.
- What do you mean?
What's going on between you and Aria?
It's nothing you have to worry about.
You were snarking at each other like you were on a reality show.
The Real Teens of Rosewood.
"Oh, tell me about Toby."
He says we have what he wanted us to have.
"It's the right message, I'm just reading it wrong."
He wants me to come to his house Saturday.
Are you going?
"If I don't, how are we gonna figure this out?"
I'm shut out with Melissa and lan.
- Where are you?
- What do you mean?
I'm right here.
Any fire truck you can hear at your house I can hear at mine.
"Oh, my God."
Of course.
It took me about a week of sneaking around before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.
"But when I did, it was a real score."
I started using Sandy's place to mix the stuff.
"And even with Sandy snorting more than she mixed, I could see that this was a really good business."
"I made $12,000 in my second week."
I had a down payment on my house and things were really rolling.
All I had to do was every once in a while was tell Sandy that I loved her.
But it was perfect.
I'm tellin' ya...
"As long as I kept getting the stuff from Pittsburgh, I knew Paulie would never find out."
Within a couple of weeks it got so big...
I needed some help.
So I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.
Nice...
It's fuckin' great.
-Nice...
Mr. Conway?
!
You bring your pay slips?
Four and a half months of dirt.
-lt's so good.
-l did it.
-Do you love it?
"-Oh, it's wonderful."
This we just had to have made special.
"Go ahead, sit in it, Belle."
The others you couldn't even sit in.
"Okay, you ready?"
Watch the wall with the rock.
The electricians did it special.
Come on...
"""This ain't no beach or park."" ""l'm resting! "" l said."
"They pull me in, they start giving me all kinds of questions."
"You know, this and that."
"""What are you going to tell us, tough guy?"" l says, ""My usual."
Zero.
"Nothing."""
"""Why tell you?"" The fuck."
"He says, ""No, you're gonna tell me something today, tough guy."""
"I said, ""All right, I'll tell ya something, go fuck your mother."""
"You saw the paper, Anthony."
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
This big prick again.
"He says, ""What do you want to tell me now, tough guy?"""
"I said, ""Bing, what are you doing here?"
"I thought I told you to go fuck your mother."""
I thought he was gonna shit.
The fuckers.
"Me, I wish I was big just once."
Funny.
You're really funny.
"What do you mean, I'm funny?"
"It's funny, you know. lt's a good story."
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
"It's just, you know."
You're just funny.
"You know, the way you tell the story and everything."
Funny how?
"I mean, what's funny about it?"
"-Tommy, you got it all wrong."
And so will you.
It's time to go.
You think we could stop by the hospital on the way to downtown?
I can't.
Kyle will panic if I'm not there when he wakes up.
I spoke with your wife.
She's at the hospital.
You don't understand.
"When Kyle got sick, he asked me what happens when you die."
And I told him it was...
"I told him it was peaceful, like going to sleep."
And he was afraid to go to bed so... so I promised him... that I would be there to wake him up.
I have to be there.
Please.
"MERCY GENERAL HOSPRTAL KYLE McGOVERN'S ROOM THURSDAY, MARCH 17"
"Hey, Kyle."
Your mom's in the cafeteria.
Where's my dad?
He asked me to be here when you woke up.
Why didn't he come?
"Kyle, your dad loves you very much."
He'd do anything in the world to make you well again.
But... he did something wrong.
Did he rob a bank or something?
/ No.
Did he hurt anybody?
He broke the law.
He broke the law to get you a kidney.
He was just trying to help you.
So...
why is that wrong?
"John, what you did took a lot of balls."
-I'm miserable.
I'm so hungry the only thing that got me through the last 20 miles.
Was thinking about shoveling in.
That big old bowl of mac and cheese and bacon.
She normally doesn't eat it.
You ate it all?
"Yes, but he dropped some on the floor and I threw it in the trash."
-But it's right on top so...
-Uh...
I ate that too.
This is the worst day ever.
I lost my Jesse and now I'm gonna be stuck.
At Malibu Community College without you.
And the only reason I'm going to get any mac and cheese and bacon.
Is if dad regurgitates it like a mama robin.
Hey darling don't worry.
I'm gonna fix this.
How about I make you a nice omelet?
What would you like in it?
My Jesse and an acceptance letter to Stanford.
And maybe some chives and salted mushrooms.
Coming right up.
-Miley?
-What?
Look you're not gonna go to Malibu Community College alone.
[Sobbing] You're right.
I'll be with Jackson!
"No, no."
You're not gonna be with Jackson.
You're gonna be with me.
What?
"Yeah, I mean, if you can't go to Stanford until next year."
"No, you haven't struck a nerve."
"Oh, for God's sakes, Adam, I knew the man briefly."
Is that it?
Or is it because it's me asking?
It's obvious Blake's told you he's disinherited me.
I assume he's also turned you against me.
"Adam, darling, it has nothing to do with you."
I did know Garrett Boydston a long time ago.
That part of my life is over.
That book is closed.
And I never re-read an old book.
Sorry.
Mary had a little lamb
"Little lamb, little lamb"
Mary had a little lamb...
Claudia.
What are you doing here?
"We're having fun, Mommy."
"- It's true, Sammy Jo."
I was just in the neighbourhood.
And I thought I'd stop by and see a little boy that I love very much.
"Oh, do you now?"
"Well, don't try and get too close to my son, you hear?"
"Danny, go see Marie and go play downstairs for a while."
But you'll come back again.
- Promise?
"- Oh, I promise."
"The fact is, Sammy Jo, that we're already close."
We got that way when I was married to Steven.
- While you were-
- I was what?
Too busy bumming around to take care of your own baby.
I've been staring at my phone.
I've been out of my mind.
I had to get out just to keep f rom going crazy.
- l just saw him.
- Tonight?
- About 10:00.
- Where?
We have a special treat f or you tonight.
"As a f avour, the lady who was our star attraction has agreed to give us the song she made the sensation of the South."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Coral Chandler."
I see what Johnny meant.
"You and Johnny, you were together all the time, weren't you?"
We f ought together.
And spent your leaves together.
"London, Paris, Rome."
"Me with a gal, him without one."
Just a picture of you in his eyes.
Where is he?
"Won't you tell me, where did you see him?"
- Let's dance.
"- Please, I want to know."
I wanted her in my arms when I told her.
My right hand on her spine would feel the shock.
She'd tested pure so far.
But so did another girl I knew.
Right up to the dollar point.
And it wasn't 4 million.
- Still wear the same perf ume?
- Tell me where you saw him.
"- ""She wears jasmine, "" he said."
- Please.
He called you Dusty. lt was a name he had between the two of you.
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.
They don't pay Fanucci.
"If they don't pay Fanucci, then somebody else collects for Maranzalla!"
We'll all be better off if we pay him.
Don't worry.
Now what I say stays in this room.
"If you both like, why not give me $50 each to pay Fanucci?"
I guarantee he'll accept what I give him.
"If Fanucci says $200 he means it, Vito!"
I'll reason with him.
Leave everything to me.
I'll take care of everything.
I never lie to my friends.
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.
He'll ask for the money.
Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants.
Don't argue with him.
Then I'll go and get him to agree.
"Don't argue with him, since he's so tough."
How can you get him to take less?
That's my business.
Just remember that I did you a favor.
Is it a deal?
Yes.
His family's out of the house.
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.
"Vito, here's my 50 dollars."
Buona fortuna.
Are you sure he's going to go for it?
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.
It looks like there's - $ 100 under my hat.
"Just-just give a good look at the dog, will ya?"
- Just give him one good look.
-I don't wanna look.
"A good look or a bad look,"
I'm taking him back to the pound!
- Now get out of my way.
-Come on.
"Just-just give him a look, will you, Ralph?"
You know what?
"I know why you're afraid to give him a look-- you're afraid that if you look into these brown, soulful, trusting eyes, that it'll do something to your heart."
Just look.
"Look into those eyes, Ralph."
"Look, look, look."
"Put him back in the box, Norton!"
-(pleading indistinctly)
-Put him back in the box or I'm gonna do something to you!
Get out of the way!
Open that door.
Open the door.
"Ralph Kramden, you've just lost your membership card to the human race."
I still say it's the best appetizer I ever tasted!
"- Pardon me, sir."
"-Yes, sir?"
I'd like to return a dog that my wife got here yesterday.
Let me see now.
It's a good dog.
"You, uh, say your wife picked him up here yesterday?"
- Yeah.
-What's your name?
Kramden.
K-R-A-M-D-E-N.
- I'll have to check the record first. -'Kay.
- Fine.
He said regards to you.
How are your children?
- They are fine?
What about you?
I am fine too.
What can I do for you?
"Indeed, I asked Seyed Abdulhossein to build Ali Asghar's cradle."
It's time to bring it.
- Seyed Abdulhossein?
You mean Tangak?
"- Yes, I am."
Why did you ask Seyed Abdulhossein?
Why Tangak?
Because he has a good faith.
He is well-wisher_
"You understand, Bashirou's mommy."
"It will be better, if an immature boy bring the cradle."
"- Yes, I see."
"- At first, I was going to ask Bashirou to bring it but"
- Zaer said it's better to talk to you before him to see whether you are - satisfied or not?
It's his wage.
- How should I oonsent myself to send Bashirou to Tangak?
"- Bashirou's mom, it's been a year since that happening."
"I had a goodwill,"
- I wanted to give some money to
"- Yes, I understand,"
"If your generosity but even if ifs been passed 100 years since that accident, you have no idea about Tangak's people, Zahireh_"
Zahireh!
I will go and talk to Mr. Zaer Kheder myself.
T's not related to Zaer Kheder_ It's Zahireh's order.
I said I will go and talk to Mr. Zaer Kheder myself.
"There's nothing special, right?"
No.
Nothing as of yet but.
- But...
Town head is asking something strange of his soldiers.
What?
♫ Yesterday and today ♫
♫ On top of the deep ocean ♫
♫ Without any sound ♫
♫ A blue night is coming down ♫
♬ Over the waves ♬
♫ My mind which has been wandering around. ♫
♫ Coming back to this ocean ♫
♫ And waiting for you. ♫
♫ The story of star lights ♫
♫ Those who have been telling the story ♫
"♫ As if you are dreaming, it is spreading out ♫"
♫ It's the time. ♫
♬ To a heart I couldn't own ♬
♬ A wave of a cloud is gushing in ♬
♫ Your tears which have been watching it ♫
♫ My breath that's going further away ♫
♫ Even that's becoming clouded and stained ♫
♫ Hidden in the ocean ♫
♫ a sad story ♫
The Legend of the Blue Sea
Do you know what I hate the most?
Leaving without saying goodbye.
"That's why I came, to say goodbye before leaving."
There's no other reason.
"Anyway, I've done what I've come to do, so I'm leaving."
Drink it.
"""without my Blue Ivy, girl."
"""'Cause I ain't trying to get leg burn."
"Boom, boom, hey!"""
"And, Black women, some of y'all do this."
What the hell is this?
It's like y'all trying to pull a conversation out the sky.
"You know like, ""Hey, my name's Tammy."
"""I work at Walgreens,"
"""and I make 7.25 an hour."
"Ain't nobody got time for that, hey."""
You seen this person before.
You be at the McDonald's.
"You be like, ""Excuse me."""
"Let me get a Big Mac, McChicken sandwich."""
"She come out with an attitude, just dancing."
"""Pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh!"
"""We ain't got no Big Macs, no McChicken sandwiches."
"""So Big Mac your ass out the front door."
"""Big Mac your ass out the front door."
"Surfboard, surfboard, graining on that wood."""
"Look at some of the white people like,"
"""Yeah, I fired somebody like that earlier this week."
"Won't have to worry about LaQuifa anymore."""
"White people and people in the corporate world,"
I love to see how y'all react to folks that come in the office with dreadlocks.
It's so funny.
'Cause y'all get nervous.
"As soon as you see 'em, you be..."
"""Uh..."
"Hello."""
"That means, ""What the hell are you doing here?"""
"""Uh..."
Love you too.
Bye.
Georgie?
What's gonna happen at the appointment tomorrow?
It'll be fine.
I called Clint and I left a message.
He knows us and he loves you.
Just be totally honest and nothing bad can happen.
"That hasn't always worked, even with Clint."
Look.
I know that you were disappointed when we asked your aunt Crystal to leave.
And I know that you wish things could've turned out differently.
No.
I don't.
Not anymore.
And I-I was just on the phone with Jeffie and he remembers Crystal.
My mom...
She didn't trust her and... she said she was a bad influence on us.
Come here.
"Everything's gonna be all right, okay?"
"Amy, honey, I thought you did a great job at that meeting today."
"Well, at least it was a step."
"Now that I can get close to Matt's horses, I can start to gentle them."
Yeah?
And how do you plan on doing that?
"Hopefully, right under Matt's nose, and then I'll find homes for them."
Great.
Hey.
"It's really beautiful out there, Amy."
You wanna go for a walk?
"You should, you should."
I'll-I'll put wood on the fire and keep it going till you get back.
Mom.
- Birthday celebration.
- Whose birthday?
"Mom, you're missing the best part."
"Guys, Peter's here, and I need to help him with something outside just for a minute, and then I'll be right back, okay?"
What's he doing here?
"It's Dad's birthday, for fuck's sake."
Dinner's almost ready.
"Lupita, set the table."
You have hands.
Do you know he's a DEA agent?
- Huh?
Who's a DEA agent?
- That Peter guy.
Get the fuck out of here.
"I saw him leaving here and he had this jacket on that said ""DEA."""
"- Shane, stop making shit up."
- I'm not.
D-E-A could stand for a lot of things.
"It was the same kind I see on the news when they bust people, the exact kind."
- What exactly did he say to your mom?
- I don't know.
"When I saw him, he was getting into his car."
He looked really mad.
"He's mom's boyfriend, isn't he?"
I really have to get back.
I didn't mean to interrupt your celebration.
I just don't like the way our last conversation went.
- I was upset.
"- I know, and you had a right to be."
- I'm sorry I went behind your back.
- I want to be with you.
"Umm, mother."
"When we go to the U.S., let's not use the name Madis Snack Shop."
The name could be...
DELICIOUS Korean Food.
What did the former President say?
That he was sorry... that he was thankful.
And be happy.
I used to work in the kitchen of an outgoing ship.
As the kitchen head.
The world of Korean food is daebak (great)!
Do you know how to say daebak in English?
"Oh, Dae~bak!"
"In 1983, twenty-one brave soliders sacrificed their lives for their country in carrying out a mission.Their honored names to be remembered forever."
Lee Jin Pyo Park Mu Yeol.
Take a deep breath.
You're doing great.
The child's heartbeat is weakening.
"One last time, push harder!"
"If you can't do it, we'll prepare for surgery at once."
Where is the father?
No... he's not around.
"-= October 9th, 1983, Aung San, Burma. =-"
"It's after 10 already, right?"
The President is a little bit late.
"Burmese Minister was late to escort him, so he is on his way with the senior official."
Okay.
"All team, report on your situation."
Drive away.
"Congratulations, it's a boy."
=This is an urgent news flash report.=
=Burma local time 10:28 a.m=
"Here's a dollar, kid."
- Treat your folks to dinner.
- Wow!
♪ Memories are made of this ♪
♪ The memories you gave me ♪
♪ Serve it generously with love ♪
♪ The memories you gave me ♪
"♪ One man, one wife... ♪"
"Oh, come on, ladies."
Buy something already.
"Oh, Sue, why are you trying to sell containers to that fat tub of shit?"
She's never had a leftover in her life.
That's the great Jim Reeves.
Hard to believe it's been ten years since we lost him in a horrific plane crash.
Lucky bastard.
"- Hey, mister."
You a pervert?
- No!
Then why are you staring at ladies through that window like one?
- That's my wife in there.
- How come you're not at work?
How come you're not leaving me the fuck alone?
I'm gonna tell my dad you swore at me.
He's a cop.
"Then he can solve your murder, you nosey little shit!"
"Frank, no!"
You've got to stop swearing at other people's children.
You're right.
"Hey, go play with your father's gun!"
- Frank!
- I didn't swear.
Would you please go in and carry out the rest of the stuff I didn't sell?
"Whatever you are doing, you drop it."
Governor McCallum is going to Charleston.
Then he's touring that chemical plant in Point Pleasant today.
"Now, I want you to go down there... and meet him at the airport."
You listening?
"Yeah, McCal I um at the chemical plant."
Got it.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.
"John, are you there?"
Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
"Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me."
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.
Then I get this message from this Indrid Cold... who's talking about a great tragedy on the Ohio River.
Guess what's on the Ohio River.
The chemical plant.
Today Governor McCallum is gonna be there.
I was on myway to interview him.
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
Seriously?
You're scraping the crusty bits off the sides now?
I'm sorry but I'm an emotional eater.
"Hang on, hang on."
All right look the recipe says it serves 12.
I had one and a half you dropped one on the floor.
That means you had nine-and-a-half servings!
Well excuse me Little Miss Solve-Your-Fancy-Math-Problems.
I-Got-Into-Stanford- and-Your-Daughter-Didn't.
[Gasps]
You lashed out at me.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to.
Here.
Like I would want that.
Oh.
Okay.
Dang my generation's foolish beliefs that food can make the pain go away.
[Taking deep breath]
"Oh, it's okay."
"It's all right, I mean, we're jumping on each other."
Because you know we feel helpless and there's nothing we can do.
Although frankly a little bit more you than me.
Well excuse me but I don't think I recall throwing macaroni fractions.
In your face.
"Oh, do you wanna go?"
-Is this how it's going to be?
Is this how it's going to be?
"-That's the way it's gonna be, yeah."
Come on.
"Oh, all right I can't hear you with that in your mou... hi."
Hey.
-How you doing bud?
"I've had enough of the Cold War when we did... the ""Doctor Jivago"" shoot."
"You got the chicken, too?"
So good.
But I got the pieard.
I don't like playing with bones.
I'd bite my tongue on that one.
"You are so great, Richard."
I'm so glad you work at Skirt.
Some of the people there are so snobby.
The irony is they were all from trailer parks and they're all on the mate.
I was on the fashion closet and I heard Olivier and Resin talking...
- what is it with Paul?
- The duke?
What the hell is that?
Is he royalty or something?
Prince Chuck is his cousin or something.
"You'd never know, huh?"
Why do you think Resin is going out with him?
Do you think she'd be attracted to some guy in the art department?
But he's really cute... and funny... and smart...
Is it an arrow in your ass from Cupid Squivert?
- Yeah.
- But it's hopeless.
Why do you say that?
Things could work out.
- You never know a man's heart.
"- Yes, I do."
He already told me.
"He thinks of me as a ""great friend""."
The kiss of death!
But then on the other day he bought me fries.
He did?
You saw your sister naked in the shower?
Sort of.
I was hiding in the laundry basket.
"Hey, Stacey."
"Hi, Brad."
I saw you in the drug store yesterday.
You were buying Juicy Fruit gum.
Are you going to the dance Saturday?
"It's a '50s sock hop, you know."
I'm thinking of going to the dance.
"Can I wear your jacket today, Brad?"
"Oh, come on, what do you want for it?"
I want to take you to the closet...
No way!
You are so bad.
What'd you say to her?
I told her what I wanted.
I don't think she's that kind of girl.
"She's a girl, Frank."
All girls are that kind of girl.
She didn't used to be a girl.
"Hey, guys."
What are we looking at?
What's that?
I think it's an elbow.
What's it doing with that other elbow?
Doesn't look like anything
"I ever want to do, that's for sure."
Will you stop cleaning?
Why do you do that?
My dad demands complete order and sanitation.
"I know a place where the girls are naked all the time, where guys can see naked girls all they want, 24 hours a day for anyone with guts and a hundred bucks."
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?
So I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?
"I need it, I got to have it."
It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
"Lois, do you understand what we are involved in here?"
I don't care.
I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her goddamn hat?
I hid the package in the kitchen and went to take her home.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Freeze!
"Don't you move, you motherfucker or I'll blow your brains out."
Shut the car off slowly.
"For a second, I thought I was dead."
"But when I heard all the noise, I knew they were cops."
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
"If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing."
I would have been dead.
"Michael, lock the door!"
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
"Fuckhead, I'm talking to you."
"You don't want to say a fucking word, don't."
I don't really give a fuck.
You'll do 25 years.
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
I gotta hurry and get back to the shop before Mrs. Sparling's dryer shuts off.
I'll be out of a 50-cent tip.
"Don't worry, honey."
Aggie's gonna fix you up.
That German girl sure was pretty.
Her name is Hilla.
What dress did you get for her to wear?
A blue one with a...
bow on the back.
I left it in her room.
"That's not like you, Melvin."
You're always after me for forgetting' things.
"Well, you better get it."
We can't bury her naked.
Even if she didn't have no money.
You knew her?
Nah.
But you hear more in a beauty shop than a priest in confession.
"Uh, don't-- don't overdo it."
Just--Just keep it natural.
"Sure, Melvin."
[ Door Closes ]
"What are you doin' back here, Sam?"
I came to get a dress to bury Hilla in.
You decided to stay for the late show?
"I thought you were gonna sit this leap out, Al."
"Now, don't get me wrong."
"I've had a lot of fixations on women, but this-- It's not one of your cheap flings."
Whatever.
This is an obsession.
"Look at her, Al."
She's so young... and beautiful and... full oflife.
I can get a full-time job.
But what about college and law school that you've always talked about?
That's just a dream.
I can't do it.
My old man doesn't make enough...
Whose father does?
Not everyone in college is a millionaire's son.
Don't get so steamed up.
"Ted Carter, you've always wanted to be a lawyer."
"Now, go be it."
Don't crumple up at the first obstacle.
"The first obstacle's the biggest, the money."
"Well, then get over that and the rest should be easy."
Do you know how long it takes to become a lawyer?
What difference does it make?
It's what you wanna do in life.
One of the things I want to do is marry you.
"If I don't do it now, maybe I never will."
"Ted, the only family I'll ever have will be half yours."
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.
Good night.
"Good night, Selena."
Ted thank you.
Ma?
Ma?
Joey?
I thought you was something out of a dream.
Where's Ma and Joey?
"Let's have a drink, celebrate your growing up."
Where's Ma and Joey?
They're working at a party at Harrington's.
Let's have a drink.
"Um, I don't know, Mike, what do you think, is it safe?"
"Yeah, it's all right, go ahead."
But don't go too far.
Thanks.
Bye.
Anybody home?
[flies buzzing]
"You know, you just can't come walking in to somebody's motorhome like this."
"Sorry, Mike."
mom?
Yeah.
"Hey, what's the matter, Billy?"
Never mind.
Is it mike?
Do you like him more than Dad?
"Billy, I like them both in different ways."
"I'll always have strong feelings for your dad 'cause he gave me you, didn't he?"
"Yeah, well, Dad's better looking, and he's smarter."
"Well, Mike's real smart too, he really is."
Are you going to marry him?
I don't know.
"A whole lot depends on you, partner."
"If you do, we have to move to Arizona, and I'll miss my friends, and I'll never see Dad."
"Well, you'll see your father."
"He'll come down all the time and you can go up and visit him, really."
"You like him, don't you?"
"Yeah, I do."
"Billy, just promise me that you'll give Mike a chance."
"I mean, that's all he wants."
"Well, I'll try."
That's all I wanted to hear.
I love you.
"Only maybe I was buying a lot more than that, and didn't know it."
"McGee, 25 Palmetto Street."
It was a nice little house.
"He'd probably paid 4 or 5000 for it, before houses went up."
"From all I hear, it would probably bring 15 G's by now."
"And here was this guy, McGee, all nicely reformed."
"Chances are, it's the first house he ever lived in."
"When this is over, go see him, Father."
You two would get along.
But I had something else on my mind right then.
- What'll it be?
"- Phone company, checking calls."
Did you get one f rom St. Louis a little while ago?
"- Hiya, Murdock?"
"- Okay, McGee."
Step right in.
"Oh, McGee, this is Mike."
"Hiya, Mike?"
I'm fine now.
- What a nice place you've got.
- lt's messed up right now.
"Joe, that's my kid, he brought this junk back f rom Japan."
Joe took this off a Nip colonel.
Ain't it a pip?
"Almost cut your head off, didn't I?"
Joe says these are new.
- Those are German.
- That's what Joe said.
How'd you know?
I'd turn them into Army ordnance.
Start coughing too hard there'll be nothing left but the gold in your teeth.
Holy smoke!
All right.
- How did it go?
- Nothing to it.
I left his car at the airport and took a bus back.
"Good, then all we've got to worry about is his wife."
This will control the lights in the house.
"Ready, Cinnamon."
"The more I think of that Harper dame, the more I wonder if she shouldn't have disappeared with her husband."
Yeah.
"Well, that can be arranged."
Burt!
Burt!
It's her.
"Burt, please."
My husband is back.
He's in the house.
"I was in the kitchen, fixing something to eat, and I heard a noise in the living room."
I went in there but there was nothing there.
Nothing but cold.
It was colder than anything I've ever felt in my whole life.
Then I felt as if someone were watching me.
"I turned around and there he was at the top of the stairs, looking at me."
"Well, whatever it was, lady, it wasn't your husband."
"Oh, it was."
It was.
"He was just like he was this afternoon, with blood, here, on his sweater."
There he is.
I'm terribly sorry.
"I was coming over to my brother's, I saw Lynn come up the road."
Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
She's very upset.
This is no good.
You got to straighten this thing out.
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what the hell she's gonna do.
She's hysterical.
Very excited.
She's wild.
And you got to take it easy.
You got children.
"I'm not saying you gotta go back to her this minute, but you got to go back."
You got to keep up appearances.
The two of them come to my house every day.
I can't have it.
"I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it."
Nobody says you can't do what you want.
We all know that.
This is what it is.
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.
"You got to go home, okay?"
Look at me.
You got to go home.
Smarten up.
I'll talk to Karen.
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.
I'll say you'll go back to her and it'll be like when you first got married.
You'll romance her. lt'll be beautiful.
I know how to talk to her.
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa this weekend to pick up something for me.
I see.
-He asked who frequented my house.
-What did you say?
There are different visitors.
"-You, folks, are among them."
- He knows about that anyway.
"I did not tell him any names,God forbid!"
"I'm a Russian,Vanya."
That's how it is.
That's what I thought.
Welcome to the table.
-Everything this house can offer.
-You are welcome.
I'm Markel Andronov.
I was born in the Tambov region.
In 1920 I served in the Tukhachevsky army and was taken as a prisoner under Byalostok.
Herfathertook me from the camp to work for him.
"We made love with her here, in the haystack."
"Oh, Virgin Mary, do not mention it."
"And when she got pregnant, I had to become a Catholic and marry her."
"When her parents died, I became the master ofthe farm."
Now I'm Pan Marek.
-Have you evertold this to anyone else?
"- No, just to you only."
"Listen, if Shulgin finds that out, he'll get you from underthe ground!"
He's got me already.
"Listen, Vanya, may be I should go to him myself, shouldn't I?"
Should I confess sicerely until it is not too late?
-The powerwill be yours now.
- Everything looks that way.
I will not come empty-handed.
I can bring a barrel of vodka.
"The new, strange one?"
How many times have I told you?
I don't like it...
"I know, you don't like me looking at your works-in-progress, but I peeked."
It's weird.
"You know it's weird, because you never cover your paintings."
I'm going.
See you later.
Hon. I didn't mean to piss you off.
"Quit it, Charlie."
Get out of that.
"Damn it, Charlie, that's my dinner."
"Get out of there, Charlie."
Get out of there.
"Hey, help me up here, would you?"
My hip hurts a little bit.
I think you might have brushed me going by.
"Come on, fellow, help me."
Just a close call.
"I'm sorry, man."
I'm really sorry.
Quit gibbering and help me get up.
"I think I sprained my hip getting out of the way, and my back hurts a little."
"Oh, my God."
Did you really hit me?
"I can't deal with this right now, man, okay?"
I got 12 points and a DUI on my license already... and there's an ounce in my glove compartment.
What are you talking about?
Help me.
"It's not really primo stuff or anything, but an ounce is an ounce, right?"
"Besides, someone will come along pretty soon."
What the hell are you talking about?
Matt had me pretend that I was choking so we could get away.
"Except her dad was a doctor, so he jumped up to save her."
And I ran and slipped on the wet floor and bit it.
In front of everyone.
Do you remember that?
"Three stitches, a hangover for days and I was grounded from seeing this one for a week."
"Ha, ha."
"Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom."
- Elena
- Hm?
"Quick, hide."
We're not here.
Why?
Where did we go?
Children under our care at 5 o'clock.
This is not role-modelish.
Damn.
"Hey, so, what made you and your mom decide to stay in town?"
"Oh, she got this business opportunity."
She's gonna open up a little store.
It's always been her dream.
"So, yeah, we're staying."
And I'm thinking about going back to high school.
- So you'll be seeing a lot more of me.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Enough of homeschooling.
"You know, I'd like to be a normal teen for once."
But I have to ask my mom first.
She'll have an opinion.
I wish you were there now.
I have to write a paper.
I was thinking about squeezing one more out on the vampires of Mystic Falls.
"In 1979, I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a church zone."
That fine was never paid.
"And since then, that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City."
For 16 years I pursued him only to see him give me the slip time and time again.
I've never got a clean look at his face but he's become my white whale.
"Mr. Kramer, that day was yesterday."
"But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again."
I like that eye patch.
All right.
I'm gonna move my car.
My meter's up.
- You can't park in this city.
- Hey.
"George, you know that company I work for?"
They own the parking lot around the corner.
"- Oh, that's a Kinney lot?"
- Yeah.
There's a space opening and I could get it for you.
You'd just pay tax.
"It'd be, like, 50 a month."
Fifty bucks a month?
That's incredible.
Okay.
Thanks.
"I got lunch, all right?"
Still owe me a secret.
"All right, there is something I haven't told you."
- Yeah?
- But you can't tell Jerry.
"What do you think, I tell Jerry everything?"
It's not like he's my wife.
Okay.
"That's good, ese."
Got a little favor to ask you.
All right?
Simón.
"You know that dude, El Chucko?"
"I want you to handle that for us, all right?"
"I'll take care of it, ese."
"Was I talking to you, ese?"
Santana?
Let me do it.
"Mi carnalito, that's not his thing."
"He's not no punk or nothing, but..."
He's not talking to you.
"There's something I want you to understand, Little Puppet."
"What happened to Pie Face, I didn't like it, but it was necessary."
Especially right now.
"Take a look over there, ese."
"El Chucko and La Nuestra Familia's making their play to get respect, ese."
La eme took a long time earning their respect in this place.
"And if we want to keep it, we gotta show some class."
SANTANA:
"Now I know Pie Face wasn't weak, ese."
"And you know he wasn't weak, either."
But how about other people?
"How about El Chucko, what'd he think, ese?"
'Cause that's what it's about.
It's not just about being weak that we can't accept.
It's about other people even beginning to think we're showing weakness.
"It's up to you, you know?"

That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn him.
Because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill.
He wanted Proctor to suffer the most.
[Rossi] Which definitely makes it personal.
"If he knew the first victim, it's a good chance he knew them all."
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to Tony Torrell's wife.
- [Door closes] - [Prentiss] How you doing?
"Uh, I'm fine."
"Uh, I'm here to see Agent Rossi."
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
I'm Agent Prentiss.
"Oh, I'm Kiersten Torrell."
Uh...
My husband Tony was killed last night.
"I know, and I'm very sorry."
May I sit down?
"Oh, yeah."
Are...
Are you working on his case?
"Yes, I am."
Is there a picture of him in your folder?
I want to see him.
"Kiersten, uh, your husband was very badly burned."
I don't think that's a good idea.
"What do you mean, he was burnt?"
The person who did this uses fire as a weapon.
Was Tony set on fire alive?
- We don't know that.
"- Oh, my God."
He's at Rocky Point.
I oughta know that.
Hanley and Grayce got him picked up for an old rat and sent there to get him outta the way because the papers was getting hot.
It's like having him put in a safe.
Yeah.
That's all I know.
You can't blame me.
In Rocky Point.
No wonder you couldn't find him.
The old homestead.
So now what?
"So, what do you suppose?"
"I promised the girl we'd find that fink and clear Ross, didn't I?"
"Well, we did."
Now we gotta get to Carlisle.
Is that right?
Duck soup.
"You take off the kelly at the front door and say,"
"""Please, sir, can I see Mr. Polecat Carlisle?"""
It's too hot.
And supposin' we do find the guy?
Where's the payoff?
"Yeah, the payoff."
"Why don't you forget it, Stacey?"
What difference does it make if you promised the girl?
What do you care about Ross?
We can't help it if Polecat's in stir.
We'll just fool around at Rocky Point and get paid off with a slug in the belly.
And I ain't taking it for Ross or nobody.
Okay.
"If there was only a half a chance, Stacey."
"Listen, don't do nothing foolish."
"Now, that, brah, is what I call a good-looking wahine."
She sure was.
"What do you mean, """"was""?"
Is she dead or something?
Or something.
[ Man ] I don't think you understand.
I'm John Sculley of the Newport Sculleys.
"[ Rick ] Mr. Sculley, I'm sure in Newport, you make the tide go in and out, but here at the King Kamehameha Club, you have to be a member, which you're not,"
"or the guest of a member, which you aren't, in order to use the facilities."
"And anyway, sir, it's after 6:00."
It requires a jacket here.
What about him?
"Hey, didn't I tell you to make all the deliveries in the rear?"
Right.
I think I understand.
How much is it to join your little club for an afternoon?
Don't even try it.
"I was gonna buy you one drink, as a courtesy, at the club."
"Now I want you out right now, or I'm gonna throw you out."
You and who else?
Me.
- Get me a drink.
- Coming right up.
Thanks.
That's all right.
I just didn't wanna see you kill anyone.
"Besides, I need your help."
I gotta find her.
She used to work Hotel Street.
What club?
Wiki-Wiki.
Wiki-Wiki?
It was my mom's.
Isn't she going to miss it?
She died before I was born.
I don't think that's possible.
"She died exactly when I was born, to the minute."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
You can turn around now.
What's this?
Did some rich guy give it to you?
Is it worth a million bucks?
No.
"Oh, did your mom give it to you, and then she died, and that's all you have to remember her by?"
No.
I stole it.
Oh.
T oo bad it's empty.
T oo bad you don't have a guy to put in your locket.
"A guy with a house, a job, a car, credit cards... and a son."
"Yeah, I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work."
"Well, what am I trying to do?"
You want me to go out with your dad.
"No, I don't."
That's good.
I want you to marry my dad.
Let me explain.
I never mix business with pleasure.
I'm not talking about pleasure.
I'm talking about you marrying my dad.
But people like your dad don't marry women like me.
Well...
"I told him what you did, and he didn't mind."
I told the truth.
Then I won't go to Stanford until next year.
But you've been thinking about this for like forever.
Yeah and didn't you just order the official Stanford coffee mug.
Mouse pad combo pack?
"Don't you have an omelet to make, mister?"
[Sighs] No wonder Oliver's always on tour.
Boy's not as dumb as I thought he was.
[Sighs]
"Look, you're right, I mean, I have always wanted to go there."
But I've always wanted to go there with you.
And you know I can do that next year.
But it's such a sacrifice.
"Yeah, but look what you've done for me."
"I mean, you've taken me into your house."
"-Uh, whose house?"
-Omelet!
Yes ma'am.
And you let me be Lola.
I get to ride around in limos and private jets.
And live the rock star life.
"I mean, I can never repay you for all of that."
-True.
-That didn't require a response.
Sorry.
Go on.
Look the point is I just want to do this for you.
So please let me.
-You really are the best friend ever.
-I know.
"Aw, if grown men could only hug like teenage girls."
There'd be no more wars.
"When I ask, do you wanna dance?"
"I was afraid if i went without a lawyer,"
I would say something stupid and make it worse.
And you guys are the only lawyers that i've ever heard of.
How?
How did you hear of us?
From all the big cases that you do.
"Mr. Trott,i don't deserve to go to jail."
I need you to take my case.
We don't take walk-Ins.
"Come on,ron."
"A great case like this walks in,"
You just don't let it walk out and go to geragos.
Look at the tv.
"Mrs. Stein,the dead man's wife, is in paris."
"She's flying home this evening, grief-Stricken."
"This is the lead story,ron."
It's only going to get bigger.
"Plus,i've already talked to ann,and i've heard her story."
"I believe her,ron."
"She had to kill him,"
Or he would have killed her.
And i've also done a background check.
She has no criminal record.
We can win this thing on self-Defense.
We'll take your case.
We will?
Tom and luther are right.
"This is going to be a media circus,"
The kind of case we're built to win.
We're tntg.
We don't lose.
I don't have any money.
"I'm gonna say ""Jesus wept."" We gonna be right out of here."
- He knows how you...
- He gonna talk about Jesus for 20 minutes.
"He know he wept, okay?"
He did the weeping.
Let me get this bread.
[Laughing]
"All right, we gotta get her to the doctor."
What are we still doing here?
"Um, you know what?"
I got my niece and nephew to the dentist last week with some cookies.
I probably still have some.
Yeah?
What kind are they?
Mint Milano.
"She only likes Chips Ahoy, unfortunately."
"Well, how would your mom handle it?"
"Well, she would just eat the Milanos."
Or the Chips Ahoy.
"No, I mean how would your mom handle your grandmother?"
"Oh, she wouldn't put up with this, she'd just put her foot down."
"- Hit me, hit me."
"- Well, why don't you try that?"
"Oh, she's my grandmother."
I don't want to do that.
"Plus, she doesn't respect me because she thinks I'm an idiot clown."
"Well, you could... you could make her respect you."
"I mean, that's what your mom does."
"Maybe be a little forceful with her, and tell her we gotta get out of here."
"Yeah, you can do it."
- What's that?
"- Um, high five."
How do you know what Christine looks like in the nude?
Because we went swimming and I was in my bikini.
"This is Gerard, the writer I told you about."
He's here to work.
Well...
"Working with the whiskey bottle, by the smell of it."
"Let's go to bed, I'm dead-tired."
Tomorrow morning...!
Look at it this way... ln Germany they're in need of plumbers too.
So I set me up a business with Dutoh labor.
Pour me some more.
"And I got 5 chaps there now, all working black and drawing welfare in Holland besides."
"A lot of sugar, baby."
"And they give me no trouble, 'cause if they did I would report them to Labor Inspection."
Those ham and eggs are just the thing especially after last night.
"Really, Herman."
I mean the long drive.
"Don't be shy, Gerard's a writer."
- He's used to a thing or two.
- Stop it.
"Damn, it's empty."
I'll get a frosh pack.
The world of Peter Stuyvesant so much more to enjoy.
What do you think of him?
He's really got something.
How was it last night?
- Zilch.
- Zilch?
We hadn't met in weeks... and oopla!
He came and zonk!
Fell asleep.
Tough...
I want to say that it's all A's fault but I'm the one who gave your mom that ticket.
I don't like knowing what I'm capable of.
"Yeah, but you didn't go through with it."
Okay?
That's the difference.
"It was a silent auction, and a private book-signing and coffee with the author."
"I liked his early work, that book about the teacher in Newark."
Do you want coffee with Leonard Addams and an autographed book?
Count me in.
What was the name of the Newark book?
Loose Leaf.
"That was good, wasn't it?"
"Well, why don't you come with us, Ella?"
How many people can you bring?
- As...
As many as I want.
"- Come with us, Ella."
"All right, I will."
"You know, Aria might be right about this."
Toby does have every reason to give us a hard time.
"I suppose, but that's just not the feeling that I got from talking to him."
- Do you know what I mean?
"- Yeah, I do."
- Hey.
- Hey.
What is with you and the Artful Dodger?
- Who?
- Caleb.
Thought the thing at the meet was a one-off.
- It was.
- We just saw you talking to him.
You gave him something that looked like a wet mitt.
"All right, well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you."
"Well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you!"
So let's try.
I want to try!
"Well, let's try!"
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry that it took all of that.
But you know what?
"Now I can honestly say, with love in my heart' that you are my man."
Could you ever love me again?
"Well, you're my wife."
And I never stopped loving you.
Now come here and give me a kiss.
This next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"And that time that you got sick, you didn't want me to see you, so you locked me out of the bathroom?"
No!
Then I passed out!
Yeah.
And you called the ambulance.
"Well, because, before you passed out, it sounded like you were dying in there."
You know?
I thought I was dying.
I did.
"Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do?"
I should have broken down the door.
You've been a really good friend.
You have been the best friend in the world to me.
"Now don't stop dancing, y'all!"
Party ain't over!
It's far from over!
"Silence, please!"
-l was playing with Joe Horton.
-Horton;
He's a bad boy.
-You wanna look out for him.
"-l did, in one hand, especially."
"We both drew one, only I drew first."
Got him right in the belly.
You mean you shot him;
Not conclusively.
He's gonna live.
What happened;
How'd the fight start;
"I had a few too many, I guess."
I don't remember.
I never saw you that drunk.
Then I'm a liar.
-How long were you in jail;
-Not long.
"Who got you out, McCurtin;"
Hasn't he always before;
Yeah.
When are you going to tell me how the fight started;
"I told you, I was drunk."
"Now, if you'd rather I hadn't come home, I'll get out."
"I'd rather you didn't lie, Brock."
"Come on, let's go into town and face whatever's got to be faced."
Not me. I'm going to Denver.
You're going to Salt Fork and get this thing over with.
Then you're coming back here.
And it might be a good idea if you spent a little more time here in the future.
You can't run me anymore.
I wasn't cut out for living your way and I'm sick of trying.
What the hell was I thinking?
You said it we're not gonna get caught.
Hi!
"Lizzi, what happened?"
We were worried.
I've been running around like a crazy person.
Think you gave me the wrong address.
There's no book store on 3rd.
Oh my God!
Did I say 3rd?
I meant 13th.
I feel terrible.
"No, it's alright!"
I found a store that gave me a 40% book discount.
I'm so excited right now.
Did you tell the girls?
They loved the idea.
I'm gonna go in a girls' room and freshen up and we've to start planning.
ASAP cause I wanna be involved in every single detail.
Partez!
You're having a party?
Sure you've got enough liquor there?
"You know, smuggling liquor for a party."
"It isn't just a violation for you, it's gonna reflect poorly on all of us."
"Then it's a good think we only got diet soft drinks, Evian."
You gotta be kidding me.
You got him working for you now?
You with them?
"They're my friends, that's all."
"Actually, he's thinking 'bout pledging with us."
Just realized the Kappa Taus are a whole lot more fun than the Omega Chis.
Is that true?
I don't know you.
Mujik.
Let go of my arm before I get mad!
I heard that you have a friend in the detention facility at the
Royal Repository.
I must see Chun-su.
Can you get me in?
You're the one who put him there and now you want to get him out?
I'm begging you.
What are you going to do?
Break him out of jail?
I'll find a way.
"And if that's the only way, I will break him out."
Now that's a joke!
What do you think you're doing?
!
"If I can just talk to him, I know I can find some kind of evidence."
Get up from there?
A nobleman can't kneel before a peasant!
A friend's life is at stake.
I don't care about status.
I have no excuse for what I have done to Chun-su.
But you have to know this.
Chun-su is a friend I treasure more than my own life.
Stop right there?
"Hey brothers, what are you still doing here?"
"Mujik, is that you?"
What are you doing here?
I told you to fetch the brothers!
Do you know this boy?
"Oh, he's a new kid that just joined the gang."
What are you waiting for?
"Uh, this Ellsberg, wasn't he a student ofyours at Harvard?"
"I mean, he's your idea, Henry."
So why are you running for cover?
"[Kissinger] Well, yes, we taught a class togetherat Harvard, butyou knowthese back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals."
"- No, I don't, Henry."
I don't.
- Prosecute the New York Times.
"Yeah, but it's not, bottom line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John."
The question is how do we screw Ellsberg so bad... it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
The other issue is how do we stop these leaks once and for all?
"Now, someone is talking to the press."
We gotta stop these leaks at any cost.
You hearme?
Then we can go forthe big pic...
"China, Russia."
"- [Colson] Sir, if I might?"
"- Go, Chuck."
We can do this ourselves.
The C.I.A. And the F.B.I. Aren't doing the job.
"Now, we can create our own intelligence unit right here inside the White House."
"Well, why not?"
- Our own intelligence to plug the leaks?
- [Colson] Yeah.
- Like plumbers.
- Plumbers.
I like it.
I like the idea.
"Yeah, but, uh, is it legal?"
Has itever been done before?
"Oh, sure."
"Lyndon,J.F.K., F.D.R."
Truman cut the shit out ofmy investigation ofthe Hiss case in '48.
Plenty.
But that don't matter.
"Soon as I straighten out that old lady of yours,"
I'll take care of those smart double-crossers-
"One by one, from Curly down!"
And there won't be any mistaking who done it.
The Krozac trademark will be stamped all over them!
Come on.
Are you coming home with me?
"Yeah, I got a date with that dame in your watch fob."
My-my mother?
"Ok, call her that."
I guess I don't understand you at all.
"Mother and dads will be awfully glad, after all you've done."
"Yeah, I wonder."
"There's a lot of things you don't understand,"
"But you will soon enough, because you're my kind of a kid, see?"
I guess.
"It's awfully funny about those men thinking I was your son, isn't it ?"
"No, no, it isn't."
"Because you are my son, see?"
That's one thing you've got to get right now.
I can get home without you.
You don't need to come along.
"Now wait a minute, Joey."
"Just a second, Joey."
My name isn't Joey.
"It's Paul North, jr."
You're crazy if you say it's anything else.
I think you're all crazy anyway!
Let me alone!
Hey!
Home.
"Mom, Dad, Morgan, our sister who loves us."
How do you beat that?
"""Entering Pottstown, home of the world's largest yogurt cup."""
He beat it.
"Eric, listen to me."
"We have to go home, and here's why."
I'm completely out of clean underwear.
"Eh, big deal."
I ran out a week ago.
I'm sitting pretty.
"Yes, but, you see, I don't know if you've noticed, but I've also run out of pants."
I want to go home.
I want you in pants!
"Well, are you happy, Eric?"
"Your brother's wearing yogurt pants, and let me tell you something."
One size does not fit all.
Now can we please just go home?
"Hey, not so fast."
They got a whole schedule of events here.
What kind of events?
It's a giant yogurt cup!
"Now, why can't you just experience something new you've never seen before?"
'Cause I don't wanna?
"Look. 4:00, we have the parade of sprinkles, 6:00, we got the march of the dancing lids..."
I don't want to be here after dark.
Just stand here...
And smile.
Say...
Big pink spoon.
"""Big pink spoon."""
"Well, I am proud to be on the arm of the grocery store manager of the year."
Everybody knows everybody.
"Do you grow pot, Mr Trimbole?"
"Do you grow pot, Mr Trimbole?"
"Now, you wouldn't be asking me that if I was Mr Jones, would you?"
"Now, you wouldn't be asking me that if I was Mr Jones, would you?"

"Well, he and Trimbole are a little too close with each other for mine."
Oh-- he likes it a lot.
- Yeah?
- What's it about?
- I'm kind of reworking it.
- It's fucking awesome.
Mickey!
"You haven't seen it yet, dude."
You told me about it.
Did you check out that apartment I told you about?
"Yeah man, it's the shit."
"Maggie, you got to see this place, it's a railroad flat on Ninth Street and Avenue C."
- Ninth Street?
"- Yeah, baby, it's great."
I'm not moving down there.
- It's already rented out.
- I don't care if it's rented out.
I felt like a little pendejita sitting there.
"I asked Danny 'cause it was an idea, and he looked into it."
You even went to go see it.
"It was beautiful, a gorgeous place with a lot of sunlight."
I felt like I could breathe for once in my life.
Really?
"Well, maybe you should go breathe by yourself."
I can't be without you.
Don't you get it?
"No, I don't, because you don't talk to me anymore."
- I don't know what you're doing.
- I was thinking about both of us.
"You sewing in the back and me drawing in the front,"
like we dreamed.
Like we talked about.
We've been here our whole lives.
"Evelyn, do you want a Nescaf?"
Do you want a Nescaf?
This came for you yesterday.
I forgot.
Here you are.
Trot down to the mail room with that.
"Take the stairs, get a bit of that weight off."
"I'm back at four, Enid."
"I'll take it down, Pauline."
Sorry.
"Why are you apologising for him, Enid?"
He doesn't bother me.
I don't have to see him in my lunch hour.
Or with his clothes off.
Who else knows?
No-one.
You come back on a Tuesday afternoon with flat hair and different tights on.
I just button my lip and keep typing.
Do you think the worse of me?
"No, I don't think the worse of you for sleeping with him."
We've all got a few regrettable bedspreads in our past.
But to pass up the chance of a nice bloke who's itching to treat you properly - that is barmy.
It's complicated.
"Is it heck as like, Enid!"
"I've just seen him now, Tubby, on my way back."
He's just gone into Duncan and Fosters.
"God, Enid!"
"Go and find him, tell him you've been a bloody idiot and you want to go out with him."
Shall I?
Yes!
Go on.
Hurry up.
...and squeeze the life out of you for what you've done because you're a scumbag and I hate you.
And you're out of order!
Don't ever think you can come back into my life and do it again!
All right?
"Hi, there."
I'm looking for a car seat.
What type are you looking for?
It's a silver Audi with a black leather interior and a metallic trim.
I don't know.
Cheapest.
What do most people get?
Not necessarily the cheapest.
Parents are usually worried about safety.
"Oh, yeah."
"There's not much point in saving a few quid if they end up through the windscreen, is there?"
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That's a cool one.
"Even if you get a cool one the kids will mess them all up, anyway."
What with their sweets and all that.
Right.
Yeah.
"So, what's this song then?"
"If you live off of it, we must've heard of it."
"It's ""Santa's Super Sleigh""."
## Look who's coming round the bend #
# It's Santa and his reindeer friends #
"# With a ho, ho, ho and a hey, hey, hey #"
# It's Santa's super sleigh ##
I expect people do that all the time.
"No, I think you two are the first."
Sorry.

"Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz."
I'd like you to have lunch with him.
"We have a show tonight, Mr. Donaghy."
"I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal and then a live show."
That's tonight.
This is lunch.
"If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing."
"If I meet with Tracy Jordan and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off?"
I'm known for being reasonable.
[Sighs]
Okay.
"Alfredo, 2:00 P. M."
I'm not dressed for that.
You're dressed for Burger King.
Should we make it Burger King?
"Pete, hang back for me."
"Yeah, you bet."
"Y'all, please set yourselves for ""Dr. Ridiculous."""
Hey.

The sky is falling.
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that cat-lady sketch, do I have to hold a real cat?"
Cat-lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"Yes, we'll analyze it."
- So I'll come back next week?
- Excellent.
- My pleasure.
- Good-bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I was just leaving.
Don't freak out.
I just wanted to see you.
But I'm harmless.

"Hi, Lola."
I've just taken an elephant-sized dump.
One and two and three.
Forward and hold.
Can you take over?
Alicia never came back.
"I didn't want to scare her again, so I didn't go to her house until a week later, when I had to see her father."
It rained all week.
The next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident on one of those rainy days.
"Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute, day or night."
"He asked for the best nurses,"
"I've got a very good reputation here, and they recommended me."
"When he saw me, he remembered that we'd met and he'd a moment of doubt, but he ended up hiring Matilde and me exclusively."
That was four years ago.
And here we are.
"Right, Alicia?"
I started going to the ballet on my days off.
And to the Cinematheque.
I try to see all the silent movies.
You the one that's hurting him.
[Parnell] I ain't got time for this shit.
"You okay, baby?"
They said it would be more fun than a Ferris wheel.
They said?
"I ain't always gon' be here, so you listen up good, you hear?"
"They two kind of people out there, discerners and fools."
Discerner know the difference between what people say and what people mean.
Fools...only hear what they want to hear.
You got to know the difference out there.
"You hear me, Adam?"
"How I know, Mama?"
You watch they eyes.
"A mouth smile easy, but not eyes."
"[Al] So my wife's new husband is younger, better looking, better job, bigger dick... [laughter] ...nicer car."
Why would she leave me?
Just because I made noise when I chew?
"Well, she made noise when she chewed-- his cock in my bed."
[laughter]
Hey.
[Al] The kids were home.
[laughter]
"Hey, keep it tight."
Haul ass offstage when you see that light.
[Al] I'm back in the dating world.
- [Al] Nobody knows.
"- Man, look."
"About the other night, I'm sorry."
"Okay, you were cool and I wasn't."
It won't happen again.
It's disrespectful to the next comic when you running the light.
Disrespect for who?
No.
But why?
Are they doing this to spite him?
Could be.
Why?
Maybe they don't want him to be strong.
I'll tell him he has to be strong.
I'll hide in there and they won't find me and I'll spend Saturday with him.
"No, we won't go in now."
"We brought him his things, we'll give it to the guard at the entrance."
I want the guard to tell Daddy that I came to see him and to give him a kiss.
I'll write him a note.
"You're the witch and I'm the prince, okay?"
The princess too.
"You're the princess too, okay."
"No, you're the prince and princess, I'm the witch and all the guards."
Then the prince came.
"- Look, look."
"Hi, Alex."
I can't get a hold of you.
"I left you messages at the theater and at home, you haven't called me back, so I'm trying again."
Please call me back.
It's Ora.
Thank you.
"So, my child?"
I know what you're going through.
It's as if we're losing the ground beneath us.
Dear God.
Do you need money?
"There, there."
"Dinner is ready, and stop with your secrets."
"You're not alone, so stop whispering."
The guy is sitting at a table with Paul Anka and he goes light?
"I was wondering if you have an address, phone number, last name."
He robbed one of our guests.
"Oh, you gotta be- Oh, I am so sorry."
"No, it's not your fault, but I was just wondering if maybe you could help me find him."
He was just a fill-in.
He was referred to me by one of my clients.
"You know Pomona, dancer at the Rhino?"
"No, Stan, I don't."
You don't?
She was here just yesterday.
"I don't know her, but maybe you can tell me a little bit about her."
She lives in Henderson.
I got her in zero coupon bonds.
She just got herself a new Mustang convertible.
I want to-
"And for what it's worth, if you ever see her, uh, they're real."
Whoa.
I want an address.
All right.
"You got it, boss."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Thank you.
Sorry.
Sorry.
- I want that man fired.
- I'm not sure we can do that.
Says who?
Fired for what?
He's cost this hotel a lot of money.
Let me tell you about something that'll cost a lot more.
It's called a wrongful termination suit.
- Great.
Go learn something.
His tongue and his dick were cut off.
LAPD didn't mention it?
No.
"They didn't find his tongue, but his dick was in his mouth."
Jesus Christ.
"What the hell's happening here, man?"
We honestly don't know.
"But, obviously, someone's mad enough to send you a message, and he was the message."
But we don't know.
Here you go.
All records of foreign sales by Borns Tech of cluster bombs.
Are you kidding me?
I asked Borns Tech.
They just say they don't make them.
"We're asking for all of Karl Stoltz' military records, too."
We need to tie him to Borns Tech and prove that they hired him to kill Rachel Kennedy.
That guy doesn't have any records.
"Go serve the State Department, the Pentagon."
DOD.
"Oh, believe me, I'm gonna serve all of them."
I'm just starting with you.
I told you what I told you as a favor.
I understand that.
"Sorry to be such an asshole, man, but I got to do what I got to do."
Fucking with the FBI over one case.
Sure you want to do that?
"Yeah, pretty sure."
"What's up, bud?"
What are you doing?
I'm drawing your picture.

"-Well, we did meet at the hospital."
-Did anything good come out of it?
"-No, nothing."
-You didn't say anything to each other?

-We're saying things and that's all nice and sweet.

-Is that a dating site you're showing me?
"-They're pretty handsome, don't you think?"
"-Well, they look like dad, all three of them."
"-No, I don't think so."
-They definitely do.
These two are sea captains and the third one works for the Maritime Administration.
-I must have a thing for sailors then.
-This is not happening.
"-But you know what, none of these guys have summer cabins."
-Is that the problem?
Is it the house that's the issue?
"-There you go, dad."
Finally back at your favourite place.
"-Are you comfortable, dad?"
The letter wouldn't be at Crescent Beach.
Maybe not.

I guess we're hooked.
She must have left it in some other bag.
That's the standard answer.
Can we stop by the mayor's office?
We got a date with His Honour.
"He's your pal, I suppose."
"No, but he told me that if I got Mrs. Chandler there by 4:00, he'd marry us."
That's what I'd just told her when we went through that stop signal.
is that a f act?
And I hardly know him.
Okay.
Get along with you.
"Hey, wait a minute!"
"- What did you say, lady?"
- l said yes.
That was close.
Go public?
"Call the New York Times, call CNN."
"Tell 'em everything you know, tell 'em this is all real."
You just signed our death warrant.
- You think she cares about killing 11--
- Shut up!
"She's not gonna call CNN, Ray."
She's gonna have us all killed.
I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to make that call.
"My people have a very old-fashioned, Cold-War slant on things."
It's not right...keeping something like this secret as I'm sure everyone here would agree.
This is news that belongs to the world.
"How do you know she's from the government, Ray?"
How do you know she's not one of them?
Sit down.
Why don't you let the little girl come with me?
It's the kind of gesture that would go a long way.
"Give me the girl, and I promise, I'll do everything I can for you."
WILSON:
"Look at the eyes, Ray."
You see?
Those are alien eyes.
RAY:
"Wilson, shut up."
Let me have the girl.
"Let Allie go, Ray."
She doesn't have to get hurt.
"Allie, stand up."
Stand up.
"You've got something I want, now I've got something you want."
Get out.
Get out!
- Seth.
You're in my room.
- Yeah.
- How'd you get in here?
"- I, uh, took a left at the grotto, and I hopped the funicular to the dumbwaiter."
This is a... nic
"- So, what are you doing in here?"
"- Well, when I have a problem, Marissa, I like to talk about it incessantly."
"Yeah, no, that's it."
"I just think I burned out anyone else who will listen, so..."
- Is now a bad time?
- I'm game.
So...
"I think I really messed things up with Summer last night, hurt her pretty bad."
"- Yeah, you did."
"- Okay, not going to sugarcoat this one, huh?"
- Not for you.
"Look, if you really want to be her friend..."
then maybe you should think about just apologizing.
"- You know, say you were sorry."
"- Yeah, no, I know."
- Sounds so simple when you say it.
- I think that's a good place to start.
Okay.
"Uh, do you happen to know where Summer is right now?"
I just have this thing that I've got to tell her.
"- Yeah, she's at the club having lunch with her dad."
"- Oh, yeah, her father."
"Cool, well, I'm just going to, you know..."
"Whoa, Seth, you know what?"
Don't go there now.
"Just, uh, give her some space."
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.
"You felt that, right?"
I couldn't have performed if I did.
"Don't you see, Ted?"
We had a bro-nnection.
"All right, I got to know what she looks like-- show me a picture."
"Well, normally, I'm above such things, but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'."
"Okay, here she is."
Okay.

"Now, let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face."
Mm-hmm.
"Her face says, ""Ready to bone,"" am I right?"
"I say again, am I right?"
That's my half sister.
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
No!
"That's my sister, Ted!"
"Well, look, I didn't know!"
"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you!"
This is just some crazy coincidence.
"There are four million women in the city of New York,"
"Ted, and you sleep with my sister?"
Why would the universe do that to me?
I don't know.

I think it's a pasty.
I might go and sit in the sun.
Don't say anything to him.
He's made his point.
I'm not going to say anything to him.
I'm not totally crass.
"So, she told me what you said to her, Enid."
She's just a person.
Bit lonely.
Probably been dumped a few times.

We all make mistakes.
That's why they put rubbers on the end of pencils.
Nobody's perfect.
"I'm fat, so I shouldn't be having a pasty, but I am."
Same with Enid.
And what have you done with your life that's so great?
You're not Albert Schweitzer.

"Yeah, but, Sheila..."

"I'm married to you now, there's nothing she can do about that."

I won't be dead then!
What happens tomorrow?
"If you didn't know, we started baking our own donuts after that workplace-safety lawsuit got thrown out."
"So if you get here tomorrow right when the shop opens, you can have the very first, fresh donut of the day."

"First thing tomorrow, I'll be here right when the store opens to taste your first delicious donut of the day!"
"Yeah, sure."
"Later, Steven!"

I picked up an ashtray.
I hit her.
I couldn't help it.

That's very interesting.
It explains a lot.
"- You're trespassing, Lieutenant."
"- Take it easy, Perry."
I have a warrant here.
"Mr. Sandover, you understand that anything you've said to me that might have been overheard by Lieutenant Tragg--"
What difference does it make?
I killed her.
"I have to tell, Mr. Mason."
"I killed her, yes."
And then I put a necktie in her hand.
She was always playing with neckties.
It was Enos's necktie.
"Thank you, Mr. Sandover."
"But suppose you tell us all this down at headquarters, eh?"
"Now look here, Tragg--"
"It's too bad you didn't check sooner with us, Perry."
"You see, when this guy struck her,"
Lita Krail had probably been dead for over a half an hour.
The doctor found the bullet in her heart.
[Tragg] My warrant is for Mrs. Sandover... for murder.
"Well, that's-- that's it, Perry."
"I did go out there, but I was with Lita only 20 minutes or so."
It was sometime after 11:00.
When did she call you?
"Oh, did you see?"
"Oh, there's a little lizard."
Quite a big lizard.
What kind?
That was a water monitor.
"Water monitor, that sounds like a job at school."
"It does, actually."
"Today, you'll be water monitor."
That was quite big.It's a slightly weaker version of a milk monitor.
"Oh, careful, careful.Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my..."
That's a sea snake?
"Look at that, that's a good size one, isn't it?"
Yep.You're not going to handle it?

Careful.

You are very brave!
Mark told me this is possibly the second most venomous snake in the world.Yep.
"God, look at that."
Gorgeous markings.
I was just going to say.
"Because it's also called the banded sea krait, you can see why - all those dark bands across the body."
"What's amazing about it is that it spends most of its time out at sea, out in the ocean."
It can dive and hold its breath for up to 2 hours.
Yes.Good Lord.They'll come on land for mating also.
And lays the eggs.
"Is this a female, this one?"
Yeah.
Normally the female is bigger than the male.Right.
"OK, so I'm going to release it."
We should release it.

"Uh, 10% of the show."
"No cash, Commodore."
"Oh, but confounded, sir, I insist upon the cash."
I'm not putting money into plays at my age.

"Uh, Regan?"
"Yes, Mr. Ganz."
Has Bryson called about the ticket buy?

He was to call and make an offer for a block of seats for six weeks.
"Uh, let me see, um 300 seats at four dollars, uh, $1200."

"Multiplied by six roughly, uh, $58,000, uh..."
"Pardon, pardon me, Mr. Ganz."
"On, ahem, on second thought"
I may take an interest in the show for my percentage.
I'm not in need of cash at the moment and it may offer me a bit of diversion.
"Well, now you're talking."
"Come along, Commodore we'll fix you right up."
- Are you alright?
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, I feel fine."
Could you be deflecting right now?
Not very effectively.
"What do you want me to say, Sheldon?"
I want you to talk about how you're feeling.
Do you want to hold the baby or not?
Yes.
"I know what you're doing, Violet."
It's not gonna work.

I'm sorry about that.
"Yeah, I am."
No.
"No, no."
She told you?
"No, no, she can't take the blame for this, please."
"Can you give us a moment, please?"

Where is he?
Go and bring him.
"Yes, sir."
We will land here.
It'll be about a half day's march from this landing site to their camp.
Was there any guard at the landing site?
It is a large island.
They don't have enough men to cover this area.
"Why don't we just go straight to where Yi Do-hyung's ship is docked, and attack them?"
Lt'll be to our disadvantage if they see us coming.
We are outnumbered.
Where is Yum Moon?
Head Chief is not on the island.
What do you mean?
He has gone to attack Buryung in order to secure provisions and weapons.
Where is Chief Jang?

"No, it isn`t, honey."
I changed my mind.
They flattened our old car like a pancake.
Are you serious?
"Is this really our car, Dad?"
What happened?
I thought we were going to get the little Sportswagon.
"Oh, no!"
The Sportswagon`s much too small.
"Besides, I got a great deal on this one."
"If we`re taking the whole tribe cross-country believe me, this is your automobile."
Why is it still running?
"Oh, all new cars do that."

Could you take care of this?
No problem.

You're a funny guy.
"That's it, Henry!"
You want to laugh?
This prick last week asked me to christen his kid.
"I charged him $7,000."
You really are a funny guy.
She came home to her father's estate.
She was young and happy and hopeful.
"She read book s and played music for her mother and sister, and laughed while she waited for some nobleman to come and ask her hand in marriage."
The French came instead.
She hid and watched all they did.
She saw them blind her father.
She saw them rape her mother and sister Maria who begged the French to kill them.
They spared her sister but killed her mother.
"At the end, she was raped as well."
"When the French were gone, she buried her mother."
"And on her grave, she made a sacred oath."
Death to the French.
She plays no music now.
Nor reads book s.
Nor smiles or sings.
But rides the hills and hunts the French and hopes to die.
But today I saw her smile.
She smiled at you.
It almost broke my heart.
"For that alone, I thank you."
Buenas noches.
No that one's a bit sad
I'll play a reel for Miss Teresa.
"""Salamanca."""
- Who goes there?
"- Sharpe. 95th, the Rifles."
Advance and be recognised.
"Pass, friend."
"Stand easy, Cooper."
"Can I ask you a question, sir?"
"Where did you learn to fight so dirty, sir?"
"Same place as you, Cooper."
Paul!
What is it?
- They've taken him!
He's come and taken him!
"Oh, he has him now!"
I'll never see him again!
And he'll tell him everything!
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to call Washington.
The police?
No!
"It'll get in the papers, and wherever he is, he'll see it!"
He'll show it to him!
All we've been trying to hide!
Washington has known all along about you and Paul.
They've had to.
It's their business.
"But I swear to you, they'll keep this thing absolutely quiet."
"When I tell them to, it will break in every paper in the country."
"It will be hard for him, but I think that boy has enough spirit to outlive anything."
"Spin around, Sonny."
That's the ol' kid.
"Getting hot, Paulsy walsie?"
"How about a nice, cool drink of ice water?"
"You wouldn't give me the sandwich, you won't give me the water."
You heard that?
I guess that told you!
"I don't know whose kid he is, but he's as game as a pit dog!"
"That's throwing it in there, kid!"
"Whoever his old man is, he ought to be proud of him!"
"Come on, Curly."
What are we waiting for?
I will ask them to connect the electricity power supply.
"As long as he was alive and living in this building, it had become Chel e Moori_"
There were going and coming.
Food was ready all the time.
The smell of his brewed coffee could be heard on the other side of village.
But where is he now?
Nobody is here to take a breath.
- Mashti
- Yes
This money is my carfs income.
That's ok_ Count it down.
Leave.
I accept it.
I want you to count it down in front of me.
Just leave and don't disturb my job.
"Ifl leave now, you can't say that a hundred toman is missing on the next day."
"No problem, leave and don't disturb my job."
I won't accept if you blame.
Leave.
I trust you.
"Go, boy!"
Don't stop here.
"I don't need your cart, I am waiting for taxi."
You can't find any taxi here.
"Yes, Iwill_ Leave it."
Where are you going?
I want to go to the other side of the port
"Even if you say the other side of the world, Iwill make it."
I want to go there by taxi.
Put it down.
- You haven't had breakfast yet.
- lt's late.
"Hi, ziggy!"
I heard you hit a home run today!
Yeah.
That is so exciting.
Congratulations.
"So, i organized some of the photos."
Here's grandma and grandpa.
"Cousins, brother, more cousins."
"I don't know if they're first or second, though,"
Because i'm not sure who they--
"Okay, wait, first of all, we have to draw the tree."
That's the most important thing.
And they want it actually on the cardboard.
"Here you go, honey."
The assignment said the child has to contribute.
"Now, put the trunk on there."
"And you're gonna be in the trunk,"
And then your mom and dad are then leaves.
And then we'll go from there.
What about my father?
"Um, we don't--"
We need to put him in here.
"You don't have a dad, sweetie, so it's-- it's okay."
"We'll use grandma and grandpa, and me, and great-uncle jimmy."
I still have to write my dad's name on the board.
"Well, you know, i said that, but everybody's board"
Is gonna be a little bit different.
You have to write down both of your parents' names.
I'll get in trouble if i don't.
"No, you won't get in trouble."
I want you to put it down.
Ziggy.
- Somebody die?
"- Oh, hey."
What's up?
What took you so long?
"Oh, I had to catch a cab from my parking space, and I stopped by to pick up the tickets for the game tomorrow night."
Here you go.
Tenth row.
Great view of the cheerleaders.
"Oh, that's right."
The game's tomorrow.
"- Oh, you forgot."
"- No, no, no, I didn't forget, man."
I'm psyched.
I'm not gonna miss it.
- What's up with all the files?
"- Uh, ""vision state"" stuff."
Marketing ideas.
Info about the webcast we're doing on Tuesday and the Leviathan contracts.
"- Adam's here, right?"
- Yep.
I'm gonna give it to him today.
"You know, Leviathan's in a hurry to get it, and he did offer."
That was before you crashed the wedding.
"- I'm never gonna live that down, am I?"
"- No, pal."
It's only been 2 weeks.
"I don't know what the statute of limitations is on something like that, but I'm thinking it's probably longer than 2 weeks."
"Look, we don't have a choice, Dave."
"The company's on life support, and we can't afford a new lawyer."
- You're right.
It's fine.
"- No, I'll take care of it."
-l'm tight.
-Your pectorals are okay now...
"... butyoudon'tworkthem , in 5 years, they'll be at your knees."
-The train's moving on that track.
"-What are you, mid-30s?"
No reason for it.
Doesn't have to be that way.
-Thanks for the advice.
"-lt's not advice, it's fact."
"As you get older, everything gets hairier, wider and closer to the ground."

"You got to admit, lieutenant, the guy's got a hell of a muscular ass."
"Hey, detectives?"
That's Dee Dee Santini's mother.
"-Sorry for your loss, Mrs. Santini."

"Come on, sit down."
"-What can we do for you, ma'am?"
-l want to show you some things.
This is her high school graduation.
I distinctly ordered the Antarctic blue Super Sportswagon with the CB and the optional rally fun pack.
You didn`t order the metallic Pea?
metallic Pea?
"No, Antarctic blue."
The Sportswagon.
This isn`t even the right model!
I think you`re right.
I don`t think this is the car.
This is the new Wagonqueen family Truckster.
"This is a fine automobile, if you want my honest opinion."
It beats the hell out of the Sportswagon but I want to make you happy.
Davenport!
I`II get to the bottom of this.
Mr. GriswoId ordered a blue Sportswagon.
Where is it?
"I don`t know, sir."
I know what must have happened!
It didn`t come in!
"Ed, I`m not your ordinary, everyday fool."
Okay?
I`d like my Antarctic blue Super Sportswagon right now.
"If you can`t get it for me, I`m going to take my business elsewhere!"
Where`s my old car?
I`m just as upset as you are.
believe me.
Davenport!
Get Mr. GriswoId`s car back!
Bring it back here!
"I can get you the wagon, there`s no problem there."
"The problem is, it might take six weeks."
"I owe it to myself to tell you, Mr. GriswoId if you`re thinking of taking the tribe cross-country this is the automobile you should be using."
The Wagonqueen family Truckster.
Was me and the old man.
"As of this morning, got to be just me."
"Dispatch, we have a code 32 off Carrion Road."
"Burning pretty good, by the smell of it."
I think I found us Ken Mersey.
"What the hell happened to you, Ken?"
Where'd you get off to?
Shit.
"Well, that's everyone that's come in."
Closest thing to a Molotov cocktail these folks have seen is a broken air conditioner.
"Sorry about that, Deputy."
But I don't believe your friend is here.
Didn't say he was a friend.
And it's Sheriff.
Is Ken in there?
Is he okay?
"Don't give me that look, Wallace."
"Surprising, is all."
Ken Mersey is a good man.
He looks after me.
"Oh, Wallace, stop it."
What do you know about the truck?
He bought it.
He told me to fix it up and sell it to Shep.
You know he was smuggling ammunitions across the border in that truck?
- That's a lie.
"- Well, whatever he ain't telling you got him in trouble last night, got him confronted."
By who?
Still sorting that out.
But whoever that may be...
I ain't gonna tell you that Ken Mersey don't got his own consequences coming to him.
"Ah, fuck."
[Groaning]
"♪ She's a superfreak, superfreak ♪"
♪ she's superfreaky yeow.
What was that?
You are not going to believe this.
At work I got all these compliments about the no-makeup thing.
"I mean, people telling me I looked great, and, like, younger."
Really?
Yes!
"And I actually got carded at lunch, and then I went to 2 other places, got carded again."
"I'm not gonna lie to you, honey."
I'm a little looped.
[Laughs]
That's--that's great.
Great for you.
"It is great, isn't it?"
We decided to be more honest with each other.
"You know, set some goals, work on some stuff, and we did it."
"Yeah, we--we did it."
Yeah.
You're done.
Wow.
"It's like without my makeup, my eyes stand out in this really great way."
And my mouth is so naturally pouty.
"I tell you, this telling each other stuff was the best thing we ever did, babe."
"You know, there is other stuff."
Huh?
"There's more things that you could work on about yourself, you know."
There are?
"A couple, yeah."
"Well, how come you didn't mention it the other night?"
I guess I didn't want to dump everything on you all at once.
"- And to be honest, I got scared, so..."
- Have you checked your desk?
He didn't give me anything.
I swear he just came here to talk.
This was my father's.
I've never seen it before.
- Why were you hiding it from me?
"- If I knew it was yours,"
- I wouldn't keep it from you.
- Why would he even give it to you?
Do you know what this key is for?
Lionel wasn't in his right mind when he was here.
I don't know why he left that.
You're fired.
Escort miss Sullivan from the building.
Aren't you gonna give me a second to clear out my private things?
Your personal items will be boxed up and sent to your home.
"Your name may be on the building, but that's my personal stuff."
I got rights!
"If anything is missing, I swear to god, you won't hear the end of it!"
I'll pack up miss Sullivan's belongings.
You go back to the mansion.
Get some sleep.
"We did it, Lex."
Lionel not suicide.
Have Pic.
Come to archive room.
Jimmy.
That's it.
I'm leaving.
"I want to start working on this picture, but we haven't heard from Chloe yet."
I really think that we should wait.
- She sounds like a duck.
"Smells like one, too."
"Oh, 'cause I thought he was asking you to explain how his penis worked."
What?
"Yeah, so, uh, Dennis went to my dad-- my dad's a really famous doctor-- and my dad had to show Dennis a book on how to fix his broken penis because he was too stupid to figure it out on his own."
Shut up.
"Yeah, that's probably why you phoned three grades, Dennis."
You're always gonna have to rely on the smart people to explain things to you.
Smart people like my dad.
- Are you feeling ready for this?
- Yes.
***
Start with the arms.
"When he's feeling comfortable, rub his arms again before moving on to his chest, and so on, and just keep building up from there."
"I know, Dr. Masters."
We've been over it a hundred times.
Hi.
- How are you?
- Nervous.
***
"I'm gonna take off my robe now, okay?"
Okay.
"Um, I'm just gonna follow your lead."
Sorry.
It's okay.
Just remember the whole point of today is to make you feel good.
That's nice.
- Really nice.
- Good.
"I'm gonna move on to your chest now, okay?"
Okay.
"Although... if you wanted, you could move a little further than that."
It's hard to say.
You don't know what's round the next corner.
More movies?
"Yes, films, television, a book as well."
Reading or writing?
LAUGHTER
"Yeah, uh, reading."
You're just planning to buy a book.
"Well, we wish you luck with that."
Angelos?
I'm just going to put me feet up.
I've got about 70 episodes of Crimewatch to get through.
I've had them recorded since 1994 an you don't get the time to watch 'em.
"You can't catch up cos they're always making new ones, so I'm going to watch them and I'll just be living off the profits of my DVD what is out now."

"Ah, thanks so much for helping man."
"I mean, every time I click out of one, 50 more of them pop up."
I spend half my work day deleting naked people.
"Looks like you got yourself a ""pornado."""
A what?
Ow.
"A ""pornado."""
"You know what, I'm stuck."
I have to shave this down.
You don't have to go the extra mile.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
What happened to the days when you used to listen to me?
That was a long time ago.
You should listen to me.
Not in this lifetime.
"Listen, Newbie, you're not a completely, terribly, horrible, incompetent doctor."
"While I would never let any blood relatives be your patient, if it was someone that I knew, an acquaintance,"
I might be OK with you treating them.
Thank you.
The only thing you owe Carol is to treat her the best you can.
"Hey, where you been?"
"Oh, Larry, man."
I don't think I can shave my head.
What about Carol?
She'll be OK.
She has all you guys.
- You look over there.
- Mm-hm.
"Excuse me, nurse."
Hi!
How 'bout a poke?
"I have a husband, OK?"
And he's big and he's black and...
"Baby, baby, it's me!"
But I do love that you go to that big and black stuff.
I can't wait to bear the fruit of your loins.
"Baby, wait!"
This is the only way I can suck up to Kelso without the surgeons knowing.
There you are.
And thanks for being the way you are for as long as I can remember.
So I'd like to propose a toast for Mom and Dad   the loveliest couple here tonight.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Hi.
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?
Because I want to.
Weren't you ever taught not to abandon a lady with 7 old maids?
"Listen, I've got a plan."
If you wait a little and I wait a little   we could go into town after they dance.
You and me.
I know a place where they make fruit with drinks in them.
- You could come along.
- I don't think so.
"I'd like to be alone for a while, okay?"
- I mean it.
- Yes.
I won't tell anyone if you come along.
I won't tell Anna.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- No.
- Are you angry?
- Are you stupid?
Go away!
"I don't know what the hell to think, Helene."
- About what?
- Too much fits together too well.
But then I think   you wouldn't have done that to me.
"I'd like to talk, but not right now."
I simply can't believe you've done this to me.
I haven't done anything.
What have I done?
Hey... hey Dale.
Look it's ZACH!
Come on let's go inside for a minute.
It's crazy.
Yeah it's... it doesn't make any sense to me sometimes.
Listen I didn't get a chance to talk to you
I wanted to see if you wanted to go to dinner next week?
Um I can't.
I didn't even give you a day.
Well I know I'm sorry I'm just...
I'm slammed right now.
Working this retarded dating reality show.
OK.
Well I mean look if you're not too busy then maybe you can make it by my show at the label next week.
We can hang out after that?
Yeah... cuz
-Yeah...
You didn't exactly make that show you promised you'd come to the other night.
Oh I'm sorry.
It's Ok.
- I totally forgot.
Hey you know what next week though for sure.
"Ok good, because you had me a little bit worried there."
You know?
It's not like you to just drop off the grid like that.
You're my LA comfort food.
You know?
I need to see you every so often.
LA comfort food...
I like that.
I'm sorry it's just been one of those months.
You know that photographer JP and I...
"I asked her if it was possible if we could be together when she gets back, and she said, ""You never know."""
She said that?
I'm gonna kill her.
"Don't tell Riley, but I'm looking into a transfer."
I have friends at Cairo Presbyterian.
Dr. Lonsdale.
Dr. Habib.
Perfect.
Ooh!
"You said you were going to do it, Riley."
You promised you would leave the guy no hope!
What are you talking about?
I dumped him this morning.
I can't help it if the guy doesn't want to let me go.
You were supposed to close the door!
"Instead, you did what you always do."
You left it wide open.
I don't know if I left it wide open.
Maybe I left it open a tiny little crack.
A crack is just as bad!
Why couldn't you just close it?
"I mean, what is so hard about closing the door on a relationship you don't even want?"
I don't know.
I guess maybe it scares me.
Something scares you?
"Okay, look, it's really hard for me to talk about feelings, so if we are gonna talk about this, you have to make a dumb face."
What?
!
Just do it.
Oh.
Mm.
Oh!
Love is a thief and stealing your heart tonight.
"And you give it to me, giving me all of you."
Your all I see...
You're all I want it to be.
I love you.
"Wow, he is good."
"I know, right?"
He looks so different.
I don't think he's as clean as he used to be.
Clean?
He's got that whole grungy working for him.
You can say that again.
Hey Jill where's Drew tonight?
Oh he had a movie screening and then he's going out with the guys
Is he excited about the whole engagement?
Yes he's so excited.
"And I decided that I don't want a long engagement so we set a date, September."
Ohhhhhh
That's great.
Don't you think that's a little quick?
Ah no Hallie I don't.
I'm pushing 30 Ok.
You just tell me how it feels when you get here.
I'm 25 Jill it's not like you're 108.
Count me out on this one.
My agent told me never to divulge my real age.
So I can't partake in the conversation either.
And you both smell like desperate whores
Thank you all for coming thank you very much.
Hey.
You made it huh?
That was incredible.
And they thought that a bush pilot was a pilot for George Bush.
"And right after the gulf war,"
George Bush was not a very popular person.
I tried to quickly explain that a bush pilot had nothing at all to do with George Bush.
Claytor decides to make a brief stop in Zambia to refuel and chart his course to Burundi.
Bueno Bungee.
How's everything here?
"I am from Ndola, but I needed to refuel."
Hello.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Claytor...
We are just from around here.
The lanky American is an unusual sight wherever he lands and his grasp of African languages is often a crowd pleaser.
This is my first time ever to come here.
It's nice to meet you.
"Oh, it's very nice to meet you."
"When landing, you're suppose to pay something - a landing fee."
How much should I pay you?
I want to pay.
How much?
How many kilograms?
It's one ton.
5-60 5-60.
How many U.S. Dollars is that?
It's about one U.S. Dollar.
I understand that
Can I pay you two U.S. Dollars?
So is that okay?
This is more than okay.
Okay no but please the change is for you guys
You can have it.
Mama's not really happy.
When are you coming back?
"Yeah, I'm"
"- I'm not sure yet, angel."
As soon as I can.
"Listen, I gotta go."
"I will uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow."
"Bye, I love you papa."
"I love you too, Julia."
"You two, uh, takin' off for the airport?"
Yeah.
You sure you're doin' the right thing?
"I mean, you know, you just met the guy."
"Could be he's only uh, after your money."
"Well, that's okay."
I'm only after his body.
"So, how much longer are you planning on staying?"
I gotta think through some things.
Gonna take a while longer.
Don't forget about me.
Jacob Keane?
I'm Agent Henry.
I'm with the agency you used to work for.
What agency?
We're very impressed with what you did.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The director would like to know if you'd entertain the notion of taking on a certain freelance assignment.
And why would I wanna do that?
'Cause you're a rich man now.
"I already was a rich man, Agent Henry."
You gave the money to Marta.
"After everything, don't you think it's the least she deserves?"
"I found him rubbing his face along the carpet, and he seems to blink in strong light-- that sort of thing."
"It's just some minor irritation, I expect."
"Bring him in, and I'll give him a check."
Best to be on the safe side.
"Thank you, James."
I'll pop by in a few days.
- Good.
Just look at those legs go.
"Tea is ready, Mr. farnon!"
"Thank you, Mrs. hall!"
"Aha, the cup that cheers, but not inebriates, eh, Mrs. hall?"
That's what I like to think.
Nothing like a good strong brew to keep the seasonal maladies at bay.
Here you are.
"- Lovely, thank you very much."
"A cup for you, Mr. herriot?"
"- Yes, please."
"Well done, James."
Just in the Nick of time.
"While you've been swanning around on the moors-- excuse me, Mr. farnon."
"- Yes, Mrs. hall."
I thought I'd mention fence again.
"- Fence, Mrs. hall?"
"Yes, I do recall."
"Perhaps, you also recall"
I asked you to tell Mr. Tristan about that.
It's the sort of thing he looks after.
Mr. Tristan says fence is your responsibility.
Does he?
Would you be good enough to tell him-- you tell him.
"It's not my place, is it?"
"Now, if you'll excuse me."
I'll be careful.
What the hell?
You left me alone in a dance circle.
I was trapped in a ring of clapping strangers who wouldn't let me go unless I busted a move.
I have no moves to bust!
What happened back there?
I don't even know.
What's going on?
Huh?
You've been acting a little strange all night.
You made that comment about still gettin' crazy even when you're a mom.
It just got into my head.
"Then we went into the bathroom to drink,"
- and crazy girls in these crazy dresses...
"- [ Chuckles ] ...about to pound a giant bag of wine, and I saw myself in the mirror..."
[ Laughs ] I only saw the ceiling.
"I was like, glug, glug, glug."
Sorry.
Continue.
I have a baby at home.
"And here I am, in this slutty dress, ready to party my ass off in the bathroom of a bar, acting like..."
Like your mother did when you were a kid?
She was the Ultimate Party Slut.
And that's not coming from me.
That was an actual title she won in Daytona.
You think Adam should back off?
Duh.
"Check the Magic 8 ball, buddy."
[ Gasps ] All signs point to Pete.
- Adam liked Kim first.
"- Well, too bad."
Kim digs Pete.
I'm thinking of a few of you specifically when I say that last part.
"Hey, hey."
Are you at all qualified to be teachin'?
"I never use the word ""teach."" I always say ""instruct."""
Nice try.
"You've made it a point to turn others against me, and I don't understand why."
I've not.
You have.
"And as a result, I'm sad and alone..."
And I don't like it here.
Hello.
Hi.
I read  Obidant.
I really liked it.
I didn't realize it had come out already.
About two weeks ago.
Huh.
"Listen, it's nothing personal, but..."
"I'm really trying to do my best up here, and part of that means not getting involved with anybody in, say, a human way."
"So if you'd like, you could come visit me at my office."
This is not my office.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Please don't act like somebody who doesn't know how to handle themselves.
I don't know what you mean.
Act as though you attend these things all the time.
How?
Feel like you don't want to be here.
Like me.
See how little I wanna be here?
But I very much want to be here.
"Oh, Jonathan."
Are you proud of me?
[Siren wailing]
Hey.
You locate the captain?
No.
Not yet.
"Knocked on his door, no answer."
Checked his car.
It was in his parking space.
Just got the key to his condo from the building super.
Let's do this.
[Groans]
He's down!
Radio for backup.
I'm going to need backup and an ambulance at the captain's residence.
[Door closes]
He's alive.
His housekeeper's not.
He wanted the coins that were stolen from the jeweler.
I told him Farley Kolt had them.
"And he said he found Kolt in Los Angeles, spent three days with him, and was sure he didn't."
You might want to check with LAPD if Kolt's body has been found.
I doubt he left him alive.
"And if he didn't wind up with the coins, who did?"
Maybe he got rid of them before this guy caught up with him.
I don't think this guy thought so.
That's why he's here in Portland.
He had photos of all of us.
"Me, Nick, and you, captain."
They were taken by a private investigator from New York.
His body was found this morning at a downtown hotel.
And we found a camera in the trunk of a rental car.
Downloaded the photos.
Who would like to speak to Senor Juan?
I have some papers for him to sign.
He's with a client.
You can leave them with me.
"Sorry, but I have instructions to bring these papers back with me, signed."
"You can wait, then."
- I don't need the Internet.
- You think you don't need it.
"- I don't need one of those, either."
- Soon you'll say you don't need man.
"Well, for the last two years."
Two years?
No man?
- Or the Internet.
- The best place to find a man.
What ever happened to dinner and a movie?
A guy who spends his nights in front of a computer has to be a good date.
"He's not married, and he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls."
Maybe there's a reason he's not married.
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe... he's not even a man.
How do you say...?
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
"- Yeah, that's it."
Tonight come by my house and we'll go into a chat room together.
- I don't think so.
- Tonight.
Promise.
- We'll see.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a robbery.
Yeah.
FITZGERALD:
Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?
It's 33 now.
"They were my men, Fitzgerald."
I know how many I lost.
We do like Glass says.
That's the end of it.
GLASS:
We have to set the boat loose.
"If the Ree are tracking us, they'll find it downriver."
Best course is to hike inland to the Grand and follow it to Fort Kiowa.
ANDERSON:
On foot?
It'll be winter before we get there.
"Yeah, unless we come across a post, trade for some horses."
Ain't no posts that far over!
"Captain, losing this boat is a goddamn mistake."
The Ree ain't that stupid.
"We keep it, we can lay it up around Arrow's Peak."
Quit acting like you know what you're talking about.
Ain't nobody talking to you.
Who'd listen to you anyway?
Can't find your way out of your breeches to take a shit.
All I'm saying is Camp Rhulen is just up the way.
We can hole up there.
We walk.
"Yeah, I'm sure we will."
Wish my dad was a doctor.
Then he could've bought me a captain's job.
"What do we do, eh?"
Pray these pelts ain't rotten if we ever get back here?
How much longer?
Not much longer.
"Look, I need to get Schmidt into this freezer."
The drugs work better if he's cold.
Come on.
We got one shot at this.
You want to do it right?
Well?
Do you want to do this or not?
Get in!
What are you doing?
!
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
We don't have a lot of time.
"I can get you out of this, but you have to do exactly as I say."
I'm going to inject you with a drug --
I already don't like this.
"Shh, shh, shh!"
"When I do, you have to resist for a moment and then tell me where you hid Jabbar's ex."
No!
No!
Do you know what he'll do to her if her finds her?
!
"If we pull this off, the last thing he'll be worrying about is his ex-wife."
T-t-this -- this drug -- w-w-what does it do?
I don't think you want to know.
"Hey, you know what?"
I'm sick of being the last guy who knows what's going on!
"Now, what does the drug do?"
It's going to paralyze your entire body and stop you from breathing.
I-I-I didn't need to know that.
These Jew broads got alotta money.
Maybe the family owns the whole fuckin' block.
"You're liable to end up with a big fuckin' score here, ya motherfucker."
See!
You with your fucking mouth!
"I had a meeting with Tuddy around 11:00, and here I am a backup guy for Tommy."
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to get away.
I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner.
"When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check."
Have some coffee. lt'll wake you up.
"Joe, can we have the check?"
What are you doing?
-l got to go.
"-Go where, Henry?"
We just got here.
I got that thing.
I gotta go.
"Alright, wait a couple of minutes and we'll all leave together."
"Ok, this way you don't go out like a bunch of hobos, staggerring out one at a time, eh?"
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
"You don't mind, do you?"
That's very annoying.
"Good, huh?"
"You'd probably do alot better with Manischewitz, but it'd look funny on my table."
-Ready?
"-Henry, lighten up..."
We just got here.
"Every time my mom receives a paper, she tells me to get my dowry ready."
Is she nuts?
"That's exactly what my father says, and that's when the fighting starts."
"Whatever, if everyone agrees, let's sneak into the materials room and get the answer keys for the rest of the weeks, which will put an end to it."
What's the plan?
First the keys.
"Rafet has one of the keys, and Seyfo has the other one."
Seyfo has one key chain that has all the keys in it.
"Gamze, Seyfo is a big admirer of yours."
"What's up, Seyfo?"
"Hey, welcome Gamze."
I'm going to get some ice-cream.
I'm burning from inside...
I'll give you it.
Which one do you want?
Don't bother.
"I'll get it, but it's locked."
"Can you throw me the keys, Seyfo?"
"You continue your work, Seyfo."
"Hey Seyfo, are you ok?"
Thank you.
What's up?
Can you give me some water or something?
I am thirsty.
There's no water.
Drink from the fountain.
But the selling still continues.
Gamze is getting an ice-cream there.
What the hell is this?
Are you planning a robbery or what?
Of course not.
It's the key to the girls' locker room.
"They knew I was his girlfriend, and if I saw him, they wanted me to give him some money... a check for a couple of thousand they said he loaned them."
"Well, I returned it, naturally."
Naturally.
I'm scared of those guys.
"They want to hurt Roger, and I don't know why."
We gotta find him first.
So you made up... the whole story about the gold teeth... to find them while we were looking for Roger.
Do you have a photograph of him?
"Oh, in... in my bag."
You lied to me about that!
You said you didn't have one!
I know.
Hmm.
Fine figure of a man.
"Honolulu's a big place, Thomas."
I'll check it out and see what I can turn up.
"Come on, T.C. just one beer."
You're in training.
I'm not going to have my contestant... barfing his guts all over the race from guzzling beer.
Okay.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Just because I thought it would help me forget how... sore my shoulder really is.
Aw.
"Well, Beauty Knows No Pain."
And I should know.
Cut that out!
"- You really believe everything she's telling you about Roger, huh?"
- Yeah.
Sure.
"Well, 65% I believe."
"Hey, what about that, uh, government guy in the sedan?"
I'm sorry.
I have a call outside for Mr. Mason.
Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
- Anytime.
No offense.
All part of the game.
Hello?
"Yes, Paul?"
Who?
Is there an Enos Watterton working for the company?
He phoned to say he had a headache this morning.
"He's probably at home, Paul."
Why?
That necktie that Lita Krail was holding in her hand belongs to Enos Watterton.
I don't know how she got my necktie.
"Look, can't you understand?"
When a guy drinks a little--
But you admit she was over here last night and you took her home a little before 11:00?
I didn't even get into her house.
- She-- she had something else to do.
- Like what?
I don't know.
"A couple of hours earlier, she asked me to call Sandy Sandover's wife just to make sure that Sandy had left for Phoenix."
Then later she got a call from Mr. Sellers about something.
Why did she want to know that Sandover had left town?
Search me.
Although she did say she thought it was about time she fixed Sandy's wagon.
"All right, Paul, you'd better take Mr. Watterton down to headquarters."
They'll want him as a material witness.
How can I explain it?
"Look, fellas, you gotta believe me."
- [groans]
- Are you gonna...
"Yeah, sorry, I just, you know, gotta ramp myself up a little bit."
[sighs] [panting]
What's going on back there?
"Uh, I'm--I'm trying to get my penis erect."
[scoffs]
You really know how to sweet-talk a girl.
"- Yeah, well--"
- I'm surprised we didn't do this earlier.
- [sighs] - [scoffs] [groans]
Do you want me to do the look?
[sighs]
I'm gonna do the look.
Don't do the look.
"All right, you know, this is-- I can't--I don't want this."
[scoffs] What?
What?
"I can get sex, Cassie, thank you very much, I can get sex."
I had hoped for a little bit more with you.
"Well, this is all the more I have, I'm sorry, sex in a supply closet, so take it or leave it."
"You know, this--this is worse than a pity fuck."
"A pity fuck would be like if I came back home from Vietnam with...one arm, then this would be nice of you, but a ""let's get this out of the way"" fuck?"
And that's--somehow you think that's gonna lead back to a friendship?
I don't do those.

Tawny.
Fuck.
Has anybody seen Jerry?
"I sent him out on an errand, but he should be back by now."
You sent him out in this?
You don't send Jerry out in the rain.
"I've heard that, too."
Maybe I should get DCFS involved.
"Well, have you talked to the husband?"
Maybe he could convince her.
A voluntary admission would be better for everyone involved.
I'll try.
"Frank, where's Jerry?"
- Dr. Weaver sent him on an errand.
"- Oh, no, you didn't."
What is the big deal?
Big man does not do well in the wet weather.
What the hell does that mean?
Excuse me.
Could you help us find our dad?
Lawrence Digby.
He was hit by a car.
The doctors are still treating him.
They said he got hit while crossing the street.
"Yeah, this guy was talking on his cell phone, wasn't paying attention, went right through the crosswalk."
Come on.
I'll take you back to him.
"Sam, you can go home now."
I've got a float from ICU coming down.
I'm gonna stay and help with this guy's kids.
"You're welcome to do so, but if you do, you're off the clock."
Fine with me.
"Come on, you guys."
Can I take her home now?
(SNORTING)
Why don't you put some clothes on?
(SNORTING)
I told you to put some clothes on.
"Ray, you know those people are dead."
Those people are dead.
No shit.
And you were there.
Don't forget that.
"I told you to put some goddamned clothes on, didn't I?"
RAY:
"You know, we got enough of this shit to last us till 1995."
We got enough to last us till we get to Houston.
We're not selling all this shit.
We're selling it to Billy in Houston.
"I'm going back to Chicago, man."
I don't give a fuck what you do.
PLUTO:
It don't make no sense riding up and down a road.
RAY:
What the hell you think is going to happen?
We're going to get in trouble?
"Besides, I was planning on selling some to them country sons of bitches in Arkansas."
I don't like this Arkansas shit.
We're going to be in and out.
We're not building a goddamn house.
"It's not a problem, Pluto."
What you worried about?
What the fuck do you think?
"I don't get you, baby."
Why don't you loosen up and have some fun?
Why don't you get high with Ray and me?
", you know what?"
No respect around here.
That's why we're not Making big gold right now.
I don't really now How to river mine.
Can't be that much Different than the ocean.
Suck it all up.
The kougarok river Can Reach depths of 6 to 8 feet.
"But at this river bend,"
Kris will brave depths of...
Less than three.
Wearing a wave belt when he's In The water that's 2 feet deep.
Just get down and dive!
"Okay, I'm sorry, But."
How's it looking Over there?
"It looks good, Lots of red sand."
I want the gold Not the garnet.
"Keep going, jay, You're going good."
It could be A good day after all.
Really fine gold here.
"Okay, Keep sucking it up."
"I got to say, jay,"
That is the fastest You've ever found gold.
"Dude, I'm not even trying, And there's gold."
I told you!
I told you!
"It's gold, it's gold, it's Gold!"
"Okay, not gonna lie, We didn't exactly know."
Where to go in the beginning.
But it turned out great.
I think all of our hard work Is gonna pay off.
I told you!
I told you it was good here!
"Uh, celery's all right, isn't it?"
"Oh, it's fine."
There's only one problem.
"It's in the refrigerator, in the back... and you're gonna have to work your way through a lot of other stuff to get to it."
"Emily, I wasn't even thinking about the banana cream pie."
"Honey, why don't you just come to bed and don't worry about it?"
"Yeah, you're right."
I'll... worry about it tomorrow.
- Good night.
"- Good night, honey."
Let's see.
An eighth of a pound...
in five hours.
That's more than a half a pound a day.
"In a year, I'll weigh..."
a little over 400 pounds.
"Well, this is it, Bob."
"You're really gonna love this place, and these noon classes are really the best... because all the greatest-looking chicks are here."
"We got... models, dancers, secretaries."
"Jerry, you didn't tell me there'd be girls here."
- Sure.
What do you think I'm doing here?
"- Well, I don't care, Jerry..."
- as long as I lose eight pounds.
"- Exercise is the key, Bob."
More important than dieting.
I don't diet and look at me.
That's Olga.
She is in charge here.
- Guess how old she is.
"- Uh, 65?"
That's right.
He's really fun to be with.
"Maybe ""fun"" isn't the word."
He's interesting.
- How many men can you say that about?
- Not many.
Is a tie too personal a birthday gift?
Are you using it on something other than his neck?
Does he look good in vests?
Why do you want him to meet your mother?
"I kept saying I was a great cook, so I offered him a birthday dinner."
Now I need something nice.
"After meeting her, I won't see him again."
"- Hi, girls."
Rose!
"- Hi, Claire."
- I'm starving.
Can we eat?
"- I can't, I have a date with a post-grad."
Help her find a gift for Dr. Strangelove.
Who?
We should get you some blush.
"- I'm hungry, Claire."
"- No, fruit."
Why are you so grumpy today?
"If he wasn't gorgeous, rich and straight, I wouldn't have bothered."
"I'm sick to death of the man I am bound to for eternity, that's all."
Why are you saying that?
"No matter where I go, what I do, there he is."
"In the kitchen, in the bathroom, on the phone, on my finger."
I was asleep the other night.
"When I wake up, he's staring at me."
- I think that's sweet.
Is it OK if we play a bit?
Any questions?
You can have one too if you want.
Maybe later.
Sofie's here.
But you can kiss me.
It's not just something you do with your boyfriend 'cause it's nice.
Everyone talks about it.
"Who's good in bed,   how he or she does it, ""You've got to try her"",   and you..."
It isn't natural any longer.
The way we have sex   is that we always try to push the limits and to go beyond them.
And then to go beyond new limits.
All the time.
Boys have to screw 20 or 30 chicks before they leave high school.
It's prestige for them.
"""I did it with two girls, three girls""."
Two girls and one boy.
With two guys and one girl the girl would be the important one.
That's not the idea.
We copy what we see in porn films.
That's why it gets crazier and crazier.
The more extreme and the more bodies the cooler it is.
But feelings don't come into it.
What's up?
I don't believe it!
Look at them!
"- Use the car, guys!"
- Sofie won't be pleased.
- Where is she?
- She was dancing.
- Sofie!
There you are!
"There was a note saying ""learn to respect""."
"Hey, beautiful."
"Hurry up, I'm getting cold!"
"I can't, I ate too much."
"Yes, to Lézaro Cardenas."
How long is it going to take?
Okay.
Bye.
How much money do you think the old lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
- I don't know.
"Where were you, Beto?"
"- On the roof, madam."
Fixing some dampness.
Do you have the mail?
"- Yes, madam."
"Do you like living here, Beto?"
Yes.
"I'm used to it, after so many years of being here."
I don't know what's going to happen when it's sold or rented.
Do you think there are many people living like you?
No!
"Being indoors is very hard, now I am used to it."
But the first days I felt it was very hard.
Even the people who come to see the house ask me:
"""Isn't it scary?"" No, I tell them."
I don't hear the noises any more.
I'm used to the strange noises.
I'll come on Wednesday to pick you up to go to the market.
A woman was kidnapped by her ex in California.
He broke a window and pulled the pregnant girl out.
The victim's nephew helped him and went with them.
Of course you are.
This is it.!
"Let go of the girl, Hammond!"
What are you doing?
Let's keep going.
"Look, Natalie, if I had things my way... you'd be the girl I'd run away to paradise with."
But I'm gonna be your hostage.
"Natalie, it's over."
I can't let you ruin your life because of me.
- I think it's time for you to go home now.
- You can't mean that.
"You know, until yesterday... the worst thing I ever did in my whole life was cheat on a biology exam."
"And now I'm a car thief... a kidnapper... cop-shooter, police-evader."
I can't do this to you.
I can't make you part of this anymore.
I care about you too much.
"Besides, I can't hold you hostage anymore."
We ate the gun.
But you have the real gun.
Uh... real guns make me nervous.
I do better with the candy ones.
"Jack, you're innocent."
We can make this work.
You...
You're really something.
You know that?
- Thank you.
- For what?
For believing in me.
"Let the girl go now, Hammond!"
"It's been a hell of a ride, huh, kid?"
"What say you, uh... step out of the car and walk away from me?"
And you chose pizza?
Not Carson.
"Well, Carson takes time."
"I mean, I mean, it's like on ""Bewitched."""
"You know, Tabitha didn't just pop out of the womb and levitate her crib."
"She started with her doll, and then worked her way up to heavier shit."
I know what you should manifest next-- the powers to not say dumb shit.
No.
Next I'm manifesting vaginas.
Already got a big box of Trojans.
"Well, as long as you didn't buy a box of big Trojans."
"You should give it a read, man."
You need to believe in yourself.
And talk to Cassie--you still haven't even called her.
"Whoa, whoa, what?"
Stop that train.
You like Cassie?
Okay.
"Okay, I can see it."
"Now that Bill's out of the picture, I feel like you should go for it."
[laughs] He's not gonna do that.
"Excuse me, how do you know what I'm gonna do?"
"I don't--I just know what you're not gonna do, which is talk to her, or be a man."
"[laughs] What, you scared?"
"Yeah, I'm scared."
"No, none of you know what the fuck you're talking about, okay?"
Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout we settle this like men?
Cock or Balls?
[Adam] Whoa.
[clears throat] Wait.
"You're 13 now, and what you could do is serious."
Like riding on Daniel's bike and crash into a truck.
That doesn't matter to you.
Of course it matters to me.
No.
Only if I've slept with Daniel.
That is my concern me too.
"-No, just that!"
"If you get so upset, maybe you did something!"
You always said I should do what seems right to me.
And I'll always tell you that!
-Then that's it.
So you've slept with him?
Don't be like that.
-How do you want me to be?
"If you'd tell me the truth, you'd feel more calm."
"You'd feel more calm, but you won't!"
Why don't you stay the night here?
I told you I couldn't.
-I didn't get that impression.
What then?
What's the matter?
Truth is nobody could find you for six days.
Alright?
You can do whatever you want.
Of course.
That's what I'm saying.
But not what you're thinking.
Do you know my thoughts better than me?
"I see you're going to sermonize me about what I've done, or what you or we've done."
I've never asked you to change your behavior.
Regardless of what I could think.
Honolulu Lulu's Pool Hall.
Honolulu Lulu's!
I don't believe it.
Corner of Kaula and...
and Hannaliki.
I'll send one of the gardeners round with it.
"Oh, and, Magnum, don't forget to tell him which bus to take back."
I wouldn't want him to make the wrong transfer or whatever it is one does on a bus.
Nobody here ever saw Roger.
Let's hit the next one.
I've got my car coming.
We went all through that.
I got no time to wait around while you wait for a car coming from...
"Barbara, we can cover the pool halls faster from my car than we can in the back of a bus."
"Besides, how do you know Roger won't come through that door any second?"
"Look, I'll tell you what."
My car will be here within the hour.
I'll play you for that hour.
"If you win, I still owe you 23 hours of investigative time."
"If I win, 22."
"But either way, we'll have my car and we'll move faster."
What do you say?
You a hustler?
Do I look like a pool hustler?
No.
Rack 'em up.
"Uh, no."
"They're, uh..."
They're still in Lulu's.
No.
They haven't spotted us yet.
All right.
"Oh, no."
Is that blood?
Or wine?
"Wait, blood or wine?"
Blood or wine?
"Uh, that's wine."
That's blood.
We had fun last night.
"Uh, why are you wearing my wedding dress?"
It was the only way to keep you from putting it on again.
"Whoa, why am I sore?"
Did we get drunk and do Pilates?
"No, we did jump in that guy's convertible, and you missed."
"Oh, I was wrong."
That is blood.
"Whoa, I sent some texts I am going to regret."
Who is Johan?
I was texting all night with some guy named Johan.
I gotta go home and rehydrate so I can cry.
"No, no, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, don't go, no."
"You're single, I'm single, our day is free, right?"
"We could go to spin class, or biking, or horseback riding..."
Wh... why do you hate my vagina?
"Ah, all right, just let me get out of this blood-soaked wedding dress."
And that is not the first time I've said that sentence.
"Okay, so that's Johan."
He's bleeding too.
Ah.
Surprise!
I got us an alarm system.
"Yeah, that's an awesome thing to do to a guy who just got mugged."
Scare him in his own house.
"-I do love you, Jess."
-I hope so.
"Darling, let's have dinner at home tonight, just the two of us."
"Oh, we're supposed to go to a party at the Lees'."
"Well, we can drop in for a few minutes, later, when you're getting bored with me."
"If we wait for that, we'll never get there."
Get some sleep.
"You, too, darling."
Just a minute.
"Come in, Josephine."
Mrs. Lee is here.
"Oh, how nice."
"Show her into the library, please."
I'll be down in a minute.
"Yes, Mrs. Bourne."
-Helen.
-Jessie.
It's good to see you.
Very good.
"How are the children, and Owen?"
And what are you doing out in the world so early?
"The children are devils, Owen's an angel, and I'm here to remind you of our party tonight."
-Coffee?
"-Yes, thank you."
Is the party about anything?
"Have I forgotten a birthday, or an anniversary?"
No.
"Strictly business, and bound to be awful."
"Some ex-cop has written a book Owen wants to buy for the paper, so this party is to dazzle the poor fool into signing away the syndicate rights."
"His name's Dwyer, Mark Dwyer."
He gets in from Europe today.
We'll drop in for a few minutes after dinner.
Very good...
What's your problem?
We made it.
"What's my problem is, It's almost dark."
We have no place to stay.
You figure out What my problem is.
We have the tent.
Everybody...
"Yeah, we have the tent!"
Have you set one up before?
!
"Yeah, so I've never Set one up before!"
"But it's a tent, And I can figure it out."
Everything's fine.
"We're not gonna freeze To death, everybody."
We work out in these Conditions all the time.
"I know, but we have a place To go to at the end of the day."
"Here, we don't."
"I have no idea, To be honest with you."
I believe my dad and brother Wanted me so we'd go back.
To the old way Of doing things.
"So I'm basically saying, ""Hey, you're gonna give up."""
"Everything you know, You're gonna come live with me."
"""In the middle of nowhere, And that's your new life."""
"If I can't make my family want To make a million dollars,"
I'll get somebody else.
"As night falls across The bering sea,"
Just one mile away...
Whoo!
Hell yeah!
Shawn pomrenke's first day Of the winter mining season.
Comes to a close.
"-See you later, Dad."
"-Okay, Dave."
"Well, all I can say is, you know, it's a partial passing of the old guard, and I'm gonna miss him."
"Okay, but we got to move forward."
We got to move forward.
Siempre avante.
"Mymomwouldalwayssay ""siempre avante""-- always forward, keep going."
How many years' work is this map represent?
"40, 50 years."
-Wow.
Fred'spassing affected me in two ways.
"One,itwasthe fact that he is now gone andI 'llnever shake his hand again."
"I'll never know what he knew, and... it's impactful with Dan because now there's but one remaining."
AndI wantto refocus and re-energize and recommit.
"Becauseoutof respect for both of them,"
Iwantanswers.
"ForRick,Marty and their partners,"
"Fred'spassingis areminder thatlifeis short, progressmustcontinue, andthatthetimetosolve  the Oak Island mystery isnow."
Nexttimeon  The Curse of Oak Island...
It'stheactualstart of this Money Pit dig.
The story of Oak Island revolves around this spot.
You'rea partof historynow .
"So, these are the interesting targets in the swamp."
Let's get out there and get some answers.
Theeasiestthingis to put a diver back in there.
- I've got something!
- What is that?
"- Wow, it's huge."
- What is this?
- What does that look like?
"- It looks like an X, with a hook."
Isthatsymbolthe Templars?
(speaking spanish)
Please don't let me be misunderstood
"Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree"
Órale.
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
¿ Sabes qué?
Little Puppet.
"Her tits and her ass are too big, ese."
(speaking spanish)
"ChaIe, Ioco. ¿Sabes qué?"
"It looks unnatural, ese."
(speaking spanish) I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never mean to do
"Open your eyes, vato."
"Oh, oh-oh, baby, don't you know I'm human?"
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
"Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done"
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
"Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"
"Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good"
"Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"
SANTANA:
I was proud I didn't let my feelings get in the way of doing what we had to do to Pie Face that day.
Killing one of our own had earned us a new respect.
But none of us knew the price.
Little Puppet.
"Órale, homes."
How you doing?
All right.
I'm not sure who I should be asking for.
"Dr Penzler, just make the call."
"All right, all right."
"FBI, please."
What are you gonna do once you get to somebody in charge?
I'm gonna make my demands.
"You're gonna call the federal government and say,"
"""Let me speak to the man in charge of your super-secret operation because, if I don't, I'll shoot a few people"
That's pathetic is what that is.
"Well, no one ever said that Ray wasn't pathetic."
CYNTHIA:
I knew I never should've joined this damn group.
This is like White people land.
Do you know how many Asian people have been abducted since 1947 ?
Will you please shut up?
"Maybe seven, and you're looking at one of them."
"So I decide to be open and honest about it, and this is what I get--"
I'm abducted by Homer Simpson.
White people land.
Hello.
Hello.
Is this the--the FBI?
- You got 'em on the phone?
"- Um, yes."
Uh-huh.
See?
"This is, um, Dr Harriet Penzler."
I'm hoping you can help me.
I have a bit of a problem here.
DR PENZLER:
Yes.
"Um, I have a group of people here, and one of them's been shot."
Yeah.
He's an animal.
And I sorta get the feeling that he's just getting warmed up.
Ouch.
Yeah.
"So, how do I fix it?"
You get a new partner.
"Yeah, I'd like that, but I don't think that's gonna happen."
Well...
I'm seeing a slight tear on the ACL.
"So, you're going to have to stay off that knee for a couple of weeks, physical therapy, and I'll put you on some anti-inflammatories."
"Can I get those, uh, to go?"
Please?
I'll be back.
"Hey, stay."
I'm not a dog.
Stay.
What happened to you?
Oh.
"Uh, I blame you."
"I tore my ACL somewhere in the last few weeks, all the fun we've been having together."
All right.
"Well, once you're done bitching about your boo-boo, I'd love to know what's going on here."
"We got an escaped prisoner, three dead guards."
"Department of Public Safety's trying to figure out what the hell happened,"
Where's Chin and Kono?
"Inside, getting background."
Is that your sister in the car?
"Yeah, I just came straight from the airport."
"You realize if she were a dog, you could get a ticket for leaving her in the car like that?"
"Can we focus, please?"
Yeah.
Damone?
"Yeesh, I'm really kind of busy."
"Come on, just do me this one favor."
"All right, but you owe me for this one."
"Oh, thanks, Damone."
And that was the last we ever saw of him.
"Well, well, well."
Who do we have here?
"It's me, Chris, you know me."
Why are you talking like a bad guy?
"Listen, I saw you steal money from Mom's purse."
Oh...
"Well, I was just trying to get new sneakers."
"You're not going to tell on me, are you?"
"Well, that depends."
On what?
"How about, I won't tell Mom and Dad about the money if you promise to do whatever I say."
"Meg, this is how a lot of porn starts."
"I mean it, Chris."
I'll tell them.
"Mom, Chris took money out of the..."
"Okay, okay, okay."
I'll do whatever you want.
I thought you'd see it that way.
Here's a list of stuff I need you to do for me.
"Shouldn't have taken that money, Chris."
"Eh, she's right."
I'm a horrible person.
I'm only one step above those people who really like dive bars and really need you to know it.
I love this place.
I love dive bars.
Dive bars are my favorite.
"It sounds like they're shouting "" pizza."" Are they?"
European fans lik e they're just crazy.
They don't come out in the tens and hundreds.
They come out in thousands.
just wish that could just go along each person and just lik e  chat to them. ith how busy the schedule is it's really frustrating that you can't stop and talk to them and tell them what they've done for us.
"Five minutes, we're on stage!"
One Direction!
One Direction!
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"milan, make some noise!"
Thank you so much for having us!
We've been One Direction!
This one's for you.
Thank you.
still get a buzz every time go out on stage.
still come off with  the biggest adrenaline rush.
hen get to  come on the bus and stay up with my mates and laugh about things that we did on stage.
Do you know when I taped you up in the middle of the show with the black tape?
Is that what you did?
"I know, it failed miserably."
You should have just gone with it.
"Thanks for your help, mate."
One girI-
- That is...
-...awful.
-Putrid.
It is absolutely putrid.
Own up.
Own up.
"-Oh, my God."
-Who's farted?
"Well, I don't see how any man could say no to you in that dress."
"Hey, word is Paul Logan's in town."
Paul Logan?
Paul Logan?
Number one host in Macao.
"Yeah, Macao, Monte Carlo."
But not Vegas.
"No, not Vegas."
"Mr. Taylor, if you're missing personal property, we can call security, but..."
"I'm telling you, I ain't payin' for this room, not after what happened to me in there."
Excuse me.
What's going on around here?
There's a ghost in my room.
And she's a thief.
I'm sorry.
There's a what?
She took my money clip right off the nightstand.
"It was silver, with my initials..."
R.P.T.
And there was 400 bucks in there.
You're saying that someone stole your money...
"Not someone, something."
"I get back to my room, and I see this dark-haired woman sorta hovering on my bed."
- Hovering?
"- Yes, hovering."
"Next thing I know, she's gone and so is my money clip."
You oughta comp my stay and reimburse me what she stole.
That's him.
That's the guy who walked out on his check at Mystique.
"All right, you owe her 86 bucks, pal."
Let's go.
Did you intend to pay for any part of your stay here?
You have no choice.
I'll just go tell Mom and Dad about the money and they'll ground your ass for a year.
"I don't care, tell them."
'Cause I'm not even going to be here.
I'm going to run away and no one will ever see me again.
"Good, go."
And who's even going to miss you?
You're just a little thief.
"Where you going, Chris?"
Who are you going to turn to?
You don't even have any friends.
(doorbell rings)
Hi.
I ran away from home.
Do you mind if I live with you?
Live with me?
"My goodness, I feel like"
I want to pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming.
"Hot dog, it's real."
"Mr. Herbert, it's 6:00, I'm-I'm not really tired yet."
"Well, you had those three cups of Nyquil."
You'll be down soon enough.
"Okay, good night, Mr. Herbert."
"Sweet dreams, Chris."
"Mr. Herbert, what's life really all about?"
"Well, I suppose it's about trying new things;"
sampling the sweet and the savory;
not being afraid to take everything life wants to throw up on into ya.
Wow.
I never looked at it like that before.
"Thanks, Mr. Herbert."
But don't you think it's scary to try new things?
"It's purple, bitch!"""
"Let me tell you, and they used to smoke all the time when I was in school, and I ain't never partake."
I was an outcast in school.
"A lot of folks are always like,"
"""Jay Pharoah, how you learn to come up with so many voices?"""
"I be like, ""Because I had no fucking friends."""
"I had to make people up."""
"That's why I get mad when people talk about bullying, like it's such a bad thing."
"You hear the, ""Stop the bullying!"""
Shut your dumb ass up!
"If I wouldn't have got bullied the way I got bullied,"
I wouldn't be on national television right now.
So all the time it's not a bad thing.
All right?
"Shoot, 'cause these little kids are punk asses nowadays."
They are punk asses.
"They be coming home bitching,"
"""Ehh!"
"He's bullying me."""
"""Well, bully him."""
"""Ehh!"
"He's talking about me."""
"""Talk about his ass."""
"""Ehh!"
"He hit me with a car."""
"""Then, bitch, shoot him."
How 'bout that?
"You know what I'm saying?"" Okay, all right."
I know.
I shouldn't talk about guns.
We've had terrible things happen.
"To the people in the Boston bombing, my heart goes out to them."
"Why did you give Tino Zapatti probation, your honor?"
Why did you go soft on the drug charge?
Is probation a sentence in this town?
They're burying little James Bone.
Are you going to the funeral?
Get me the file on Tino Zapatti.
Mr. Deputy Mayor I'm Marybeth Cogan.
"""Detectives Endowment Association, Legal Affairs, Co-Counsel."""
Very nice card.
"I represent Santos, and you're muddying my client's name."
- Take it up with Corporation Council.
- And get it buried?
You should tell the mayor someone's taking him up the wrong street.
Maybe we could explore this in more detail.
Maybe over coffee.
I'm talking about a hero detective and his widow's pension.
Why don't you wait in my office?
"No, I don't think so."
I'll expect to hear from you in the morning.
"No, no, that's wrong."
It won't go away unless you do something about it.
This is a crisis that could derail us.
The way Willie Horton sunk Dukakis Tino Zapatti can sink us.
Good afternoon.
Where you been?
My Brooklyn meeting.
How'd it go?
I think I just pissed up Frank Anselmo's leg.
And?
Felt good.
"Okay, Leslie."
"Tomorrow's Times, Post and News are all keeping the shooting on the front page."
"Oh, shit"
# There goes the charabanc... #
"Has anyone ever told you, you have beautiful tits?"
"Yeah, loads of people."
And skin so pale you can see the veins.
"Well, my Auntie Kim got skin cancer off the sunbed so I don't use them."
"And spray-on looks shit, so..."
- What's your game?
- It's OK.
Um... he's my brother.
There's something really wrong with him.
- He really should have mentioned it.
- What?
"Um, he's really, er... passive aggressive."
"Basically, he's just a knob."
I don't care.
"It's only for an afternoon and I've got a regular fella, anyways."
- So...
- Classy.
"Still, plenty more fish in the sea, eh?"
Come on.
You all right?
What are you talking fish for?
Is there anything we can get you?
He needed to feed.
"So, you're saying we should have let him tear that girl's throat out?"
"No, I'm saying he can't survive like this forever."
"OK, but we can't turn him out onto the streets."
He isn't safe.
"Mitchell isn't safe with another vampire in the house, not while he's feeding."
"Annie's right, I'm just about holding it all together, and he brings"
"- chaos here, I'm sorry."
"But for right now, I'm free."
Once I get this ball and chain off my leg.
I'm waiting for my dad to take me to the courthouse for that.
I could drive you.
If you want me to.
So your mom didn't believe you when you said Leland was shady.
You don't sound very surprised.
"I'm used to that, that's why I called Syracuse University."
Talked to a lady at the school of architecture about how I was thinking of applying and did she know a James Leland.
You just called up and asked?
People love to talk.
And guess what?
James Leland went to S.U. And opened an office in town.
- See?
He's legit.
- Yeah.
He was a pretty good architect.
Right up until he dropped dead two years ago.
Introducing James Leland.
"Wait, my mom said his ID checked out."
Right.
"You ask a computer ""Is James Leland related to this Potter lady?"""
The computer says yes.
But you didn't ask if James Leland was still alive.
Knowing the right questions is better than having all the right answers.
Toby?
Mr. Dugan called with the good news.
Did you hear?
He told me.
We can get that awful thing off your leg right now.
The cab's waiting.
That's all right.
"Can you give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him."
All right?
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away, put it through the hoop."
Huh?
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
I can do that.
No.
No.
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge."
Here it is.
"Couple weeks ago, we're in rec watching some tube."
"This Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel."
Dawkins almost throws down there.
"You should have seen him, his eyes were crazy."
- Because he changed the channel?
"No, bro, it wasn't that."
It was something on TV that made him go crazy.
What was he watching?
"Dana, your luxury vacation includes first class airfare, seven nights at the Kahiko Hotel."
"All-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of the Islands, which kicks off two weeks from now, and since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue,"
- we're throwing in $ 1 million.
- Aah!
Aah!
She's the reason Dawkins broke out of prison?
She won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii.
- What are you gonna do?
"Well, I have a plan, i do."
But I need money.
I need it fast.
I was thinking about that guy who wanted the snowmobiles.
- Yeah.
- You think he's still interested?
"Yeah, I think so, but you'd have to find some way to deliver 'em."
Set it up.
Set... it... up.
"- [ Dick ] $100,000?"
- That's right.
"You wanna sell me a lotto ticket worth $6.4 million for $100,000?"
Correct.
I want out.
"However, this is a one-time-only offer, Dick."
"I want the money, I want it tonight at the station."
"If I hear any excuses, any bullshit like, ""I can only get part of it""... or ""I need more time,"" the deal is off."
- Be reasonable.
It'll take days -
- Deal's off.
"- I'll get it, I'll get it."
- Good decision.
"[ Russ ] Now, I believe that i have solved all of our problems."
[ Crystal ] What century is this guy in?
"Put a motor on it, Jake!"
A year and a half behind this freak.
"One, I found a buyer for the snowmobiles, a guy in Colorado."
"I'm renting a trailer, and i'm gonna deliver them myself."
- But why Colorado?
"- But, uh, uh!"
Number two: the lotto ticket.
I'm sure.
You gonna be all right?
I'll be all right.
And you?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I think so."
Tell Catherine it brought me luck.
I will.
"I'll be seein' you around,"
Dr. Jackson
"I'm telling you, the government has a car that runs on water, man."
"They just don't want us to know, because then we'd buy all the water."
Then there'd be nothing left to drink but beer.
And the government knows that beer... will set us free.
"Hyde, you told us about the car a million times."
Can we please talk about how hungry and horny I am?
I wish I had a lady made of pizza.
Or a pizza made of boobs!
"Yeah, hungry, check."
"Horny, check."
"It's getting a little old, Fez."
"God, I feel like I'm Luke Skywalker, you know?"
Remember when he was living on Tatooine before R2 and 3PO showed up?
Just workin' on Uncle Owen's water farm all day.
Not even allowed to go into Toshie Station to pick up some power converters.
Boring.
"Eric, enough with the Star Wars crap!"
"Whenever you talk about that stuff, I frown."
"And when I frown, my skin wrinkles."
"And if I get wrinkles, my free ride is over."
And I like my free ride!
"Granted I was asleep, but I can feel it."
Something's happening.
And I have almost no makeup on.
"Take a good look around, fat, look at this house, 'cause you ain't comin' back here no more."
"By the way, uh,"
"I'm joining the gym on the Deacon's family plan, so if anybody calls, he's the man I share my life with."
Carrie.
I'm not putting it on!
I'm just looking at it.
It's sparkly.
Ok.
"Darling, let me introduce you to Frank, a.K.A. Mr. safety."
"""Mr. safety""?"
Reading about this recent crime wave made me concerned for your well-being.
"Just sit him on the passenger seat in your car when you go to work, and the carjackers will move on to easier prey."
"Dad, I take the subway to work."
"Well, then, take him on the subway with you."
He has no legs.
Pretend he's an amputee.
"Dad, how is a legless doll gonna protect me on the subway?"
Why are you being so difficult?
I'm trying to save your life!
"Oh, forget it!"
Nope.
[People chattering]
[Sighs]
"What's up, ladies?"
All right.
Let's light this candle.

And so do I.
"Oh, you mean leave here?"
"Oh, I'm afraid Dr. Croatman would have something to say about that."
"But you're so much better, John."
"You've had a long rest, and you look wonderful."
"Don't you think if the psychiatrist examined you again, he'd see that?"
He does seem rather pleased with my progress.
"Oh, good!"
Then I'll tell Sam about it.
He'll know what's best to be done.
"If you wish, my dear."
But I'm not sure it'll do any good.
Stop pacing like a caged animal.
What if they don't let him out?
Why shouldn't they?
There's nothing wrong with him.
I know.
But you can go off your rocker just being in a place like that.
"If it doesn't work, we're finished."
"If it does, what about you and me?"
We just have to be careful.
"Mrs. Brown, Dr. Helck is here."
I've just come from Dr. Croatman.
"My dear, John is waiting for you to bring him home."
Wonderful.
"Well, it was a great 10 months."
This isn't the end.
We'd better go in.
We won't be able to see each other.
We can't pull this trick again.
-Because it's not.
What's his name?
-Daniel.
"Daniel is in college, and he faces issues completely different than yours."
What do you mean?
Strikes and all that?
-For example.
Well we're gonna make one.
I don't know if not going to school is considered as a strike.
I'm not sure about that at all!
You're so reactionary.
I'm worried about you dating an 18 years old boy.
And what if he were 20?
I'd be more worried.
Don't laugh about it.
It's not funny at all.
It's not that.
"The other day, a guy who's 20 asked me to go to skate with him."
Then tell him to go to skate with his mom.
"Hey, that would be if I wouldn't wanted to go, huh?"
Don't talk to me like that!
Can I know why are you upset?
"-I'm not, I'm just worried."
You sound just like mom.
"""Don't talk to me like that!"""
Is there any of your friends talking to their fathers about this stuff?
Not that I know of.
And is there anyone brave enough to tell them the same?
Neither.
And what about that priest you guys are meeting.
You talk like that?
Like you and me?
Get your heads out of your asses.
We got two frisees... one torn crab- and fire the sweetbreads.
Oops-a-daisy.
I'm sorry.
It seems I got a little enthusiastic with the coulee.
"Well, whilst you're licking things-"
Make it again.
"- I got your back, bro."
- Hmm.
Oh-ho!
Oh!
- [ Popping Sound ] - [ High-Pitched Squealing ]
- What the hell was that?
"- It's called "" the shocker."""
And any of you tools try and touch me again... and you're gonna get one of your own.
"Hey, I'm used to being the only woman in the kitchen... so back off or bend over."
- Oh.
- Raise your hand if you got a semi right now.
Semi-what?
"You don't actually like that thing, do you?"
"Oh, I know."
I wish I didn't 'cause it so fits into the stereotype.
But the truth is this poofy little dog has won my heart.
- I love you.
"- You guys... when my friend Jessica shows up tomorrow, please be gentle, okay?"
"Ooh, what's wrong with her?"
"Oh, does she wear the big shoe?"
"She's not a freak, okay?"
She's just a bit of an outcast.
"You know, could never get a boyfriend."
"She was kind of like my project, my mascot."
I tried to teach her how to be cool.
We don't have time.
HENRY:
We should take the time.
"If we're going to be in a relationship, we want to get off to a good start."
You know what?
Why don't we just hang out here?
Do you like board games?
"Henry, I really want to see the movie."
The 7:30 movie.
"What you want, Dylan, is very important to me."
But what your parents want is just as important.
Good man.
Nice to get some respect.
You sleep on the bed.
Let the girls sleep on these.
"Okay, I'm sure they won't mind."
Thank you so much for letting them come over.
Letting them?
"Honey, this is your house, too, and your friends are always welcome here."
I'm so happy you made some friends.
I know how lonely you've been.
"Yeah, my old friends kind of abandoned me."
"Ah, who needs them?"
You're a darling girl.
You're smart and you're a lot of fun.
You girls have a good time tonight.
"Now, I've got pizzas and salad, there's some fruit, popcorn, cookies."
There's some leftover chicken.
I can make some flautas and guacamole.
Whatever you want.
I think the pizza and the salad will be enough.
Thank you so much.
"Excuse me, you're not supposed to touch that!"
- I beg your pardon?
"- No, I'm just kidding."
"You are Jocelyn, right?"
Alex?
We met at the Couture Birthday Fashion shoot.
"- Oh, yeah!"
How are you?
"- I can't believe these people, man!"
They are nuts!
"What's up with the tooled on that broad, you know?"
"We're doing fashion here, not high art."
I guess she just takes pride in her work.
I need you to fill the water bottles to spray on Resin.
- What?
"- Pierre insists... on the misty look, I need you to put this Evian into the bottles... and practice spraying, now."
"- Yeah, I'll help you."
- That's what he said.
- He said to paint the cow...
- You!
You are the sprinkler?
Fantastique!
A vision!
Gentle worrying eels just outside Dublin...
"Meteorology: 66 degrees, a crispy October haze on a gray day... the charcoal clouds, they come, yet, back home..."
I'm ready now!
"Okay, okay!"
Let's get this party started now!
I'm not painting that cow!
I don't care!
I told you on the phone I wanted an all-black cow... and you and your make-up people are gonna paint the goddamn cow... all black.
You have to do what I told you...
- Yeah.
I wanted to see what it looked like on.
"It must be so cool being you, all kick-ass and everything."
I bet you always get what you want.
You'd be surprised.
"- So you're feeling better, then?"
"- Oh, much."
I just feel so safe here.
Feels so right.
"Jenny I know what it's like to be led on and I would hate to do that to you, so ..."
"I'm saying this not to be cruel, but to be clear."
"You staying here, it's just temporary."
Yeah.
Of course.
I'll be out of your hair as soon as it's safe.
Just say the word.
- Dyson.
- I have Olivia.
We're at the clinic.
"- So we can relax, then?"
- Or you can get your ass down here.
The Ash wants you to explain this.
"- Well, what if I say my calendar's full?"
- Don't.
- What's up?
- I've been summoned.
You are not leaving me with Weepy McWeepster.
"Oh, yeah, about that."
I need for you to do something for me.
"I'm not giving her a sponge bath, I swear to God."
"I put too much oomph in my zing, and she's crushing on me big time."
I need for you to talk her out of it gently.
You did good.
Listen.
You did a great job.
Here you go.
Careful.
It's full.
Okay.
"Paul, I'm-- I'm sorry I'm late."
It's okay.
"I, uh, gave the speeches."
"We're just, uh, waiting on you."
I got MVP.
Is my trophy in there?
I'm sure it is...
somewhere.
"Uh, hopefully, there are trophies for all the players that contributed."
"Okay, Hornets, bring it in, guys."
Come on over.
"Finally, now that the hardware is here, we're gonna give out some awards, okay?"
"And, uh, I'm gonna make you guys suffer through some more boring speeches, and I apologize for that, so bear with me, okay?"
He is so good with kids.
I think coaching's been a real solace for Paul during this time of upheaval.
I think it has.
"We should probably organize something with Joy's other girlfriends, make sure he stays fed, don't you think?"
"Or, you know, I could just... feed him."
It's been two months.
He's hardly wasting away.
"Libby, I'm looking for an excuse."
"You're gonna think I'm terrible, but how long, exactly, does a widower have to wait before he can start, you know... eating?"
I don't know.
A year?
Says who?
"Before that, I was living here in Trnje for 30 years."
I know every house and street.
I kept knocking at the doors around to ask.
I'm sentimentally attached to this area.
So I decided to try my luck in Paromlinska street.
"So, this is how you came to me?"
People decide to rent their room after they've been suggested to do so.
I thought you were the one.
I don't know.
You have confused me.
Maybe I should tell you something about myself?
I'm retired for disability.
I was a land surveyor.
I could pay as much as you want.
I can make money in another way.
"Leave it, that's not..."
"I'm peaceful, too."
I don't play cards or bring women home.
I don't even drink or smoke.
"I'm mostly out, I even eat there."
"- That's ok, but I don't know..."
It is so suddenly.
"Understand me, I can't just do it right away."
You don't have to decide immediately.
I'll come in a day or two.
You think about it.
Ok?
- I don't know...
"Well, day or two, that would be fine."
Good.
"So, there is a chance, eh?"
"See you in a couple of days, then."
They're weirdly popular.
I can order you one.
"Yeah, yeah, why don't you do that?"
"That'd be great, because then they'll get here, in what?"
9 weeks?
"Which is just in time for my daughter's recital, which is tomorrow."
It's the minimum basic requirement that a party store always have Hawaii.
"Children have recitals and their parents, their mothers, can't do it all and we rely on our party store to keep up their end of the bargain so that our husbands and our children don't despise us when we come home empty-handed."
I'll buy the lei.
He's really wrecked.
Usually we like to let this kind dry out for the night in lock-up.
"It reinforces the point, you know?"
"Sure, sure,"
We have driven all the way from Los Angeles.
There's a motel nearby.
See you in the a.m.
Bring coffee.
"All right, thank you."
Thanks.
Hi.
"I'm Justin's mother and this is his big sister, Kitty."
"Kitty Walker, ""The Right Idea"" and ""Red, White and Blue."""
- You're kidding.
- No.
You're her?
"Yeah, I am...me."
Yes.
I love your show.
And we're not asking to be the exception here...
"Yes, we are."
"No, we're not."
- Yes.
trust me.
I mean you're afraid of a real relationship Dale.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
I am not scared of relationships
But you're scared of something.
Let's just forget about it.
Ok...
Sorry.
No it's Ok I just wasn't expecting that.
Was it weird seeing Dale?
"Yeah, yeah it was weird."
I felt like I sensed something between you guys.
"Yeah, yeah I think maybe you did."
Dale and I are really tight.
You know and as I told you before Hallie
I'm just not that interested in a relationship right now and I wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong impression about what's going on here.
She's the one that told me to pursue you just so you know.
She told you that?
Yeah you sound surprised.
She said you guys were just friends that you've never hooked up and that she isn't your type.
Not my type.
So are we cool?
"Yeah, yeah we're cool but I just..."
I don't think this is a very good idea right now OK?
This isn't a good idea?
OK I'm just...
Not that into this right now.
You're not into this?
No.
Are you into this?
Hey!
"Hey, Hayden."
O
What is going on?
What is going on?
Why are they all being so mean?
Being mean here and in the club is no fucking difference than all those fuckers out on the street.
Or anybody else in the goddamn world.
The only difference is out there they all pretend to be nice.
And in here we ain't pretending shit.
What do you mean nobody's pretending?
We're all dressed up like for a masquerade going on stage playing hoodlums.
famous bags.
The biggest eye bags around chicken with the eye bag.
It's just like a three penny
You're too old to model.
Don't make me hate you!
You're so ugly.
And you are so beautiful.
You're the most beautiful boy in the world.
You're the most beautiful boy.
What?
I don't care what you say.
I don't love you.
Margaret what's wrong with you?
Let me see your eyes.
God what eyes.
Chicken woman.
"C'mon, Jimmy!"
And your lips.
"You're so old and ugly, I can't look at you."
"Come on, she's beautiful."
"No, I know I'm ugly you should punish me I'm not good enough for you."
I'm just an old and ugly whore.
"Eddie, this is... this is really dangerous."
"He's fucking killing me, man."
Look...
"I know you're scared, but I'm going to have the cash tomorrow, all right?"
I'm going over to this crooked lawyer.
He's got the hundred thousand.
"Look, I'm not calling for a pep talk, all right?"
I am literally over it.
"I just want to let you know I'm not letting them cut any more pieces off me, man."
What's that mean?
It means next time I'm fighting back.
I'm pretty sure I can get a knife from under the bar.
"Eddie, don't be stupid."
They'll kill you.
You understand me?
Yeah.
"Well, they're gonna have to."
"Listen, you better stick to the fucking plan."
"Otherwise, we're all dead."
I'm sticking to the plan.
I'm sticking to the fucking plan.
I just want to let you know that if for any reason you don't beat the clock...
I'm...
I'm gonna beat the clock.
I'm telling you.
That's what I'm saying.
What if you don't?
Just go.
"Just go, man."
"They're going to kill me one day anyway, Marius."
Fuck it.
It might as well be tomorrow.
You want me to give you the death ray?
"Now, Marty."
"Well, then give me a quarter for a flying saucer or I'll let him have it."
"All right, dear."
Here.
MAN ON PA:
"Last call for the Santa Fe,"
"San Bernardino local, train number 54."
"Leaves at 5:30 p.m., entering through gate J."
This is the last call.
I'll take this one.
"25 cents, please."
"Here you are, I'll pay for that."
Thank you.
"Oh, don't be frightened."
(SHUDDERING) Here.
"No, no, no, that's for you."
I like little boys who have space guns.
You know why?
'Cause I have a space collection.
You have?
"Oh, sure, they're right here in this bag."
"And do you know that when I went to the moon,"
I got my first space gun.
"And since then, I've added almost 350 space guns to my collection."
"I have one space gun that shoots out little men, and those little men have space guns that shoot darts."
"And when I was in Tibet,"
"I got a space gun with camels sitting on the top of it, just about so big."
"I know it's pretty difficult to believe that, but you must believe me."
The train leaves in 15 minutes.
What if we miss him?
Not a chance.
That'll be my signal to go for the shotgun.
I'll try not to fire.
You know how adrenaline can be.
"Yeah, well, you won't get a shot off, but thanks for the concern."
You just worry about making it all look good for the camera and making sure you're alone.
I'll be alone.
Katie:
What I told you about Amanda's mother is true.
Her name was Alice.
She was my friend.
What I did not tell you was she was a grifter.
"After she died,"
Amanda moved in with Marius and me.
"A few months later, Marius... found another partner and took off."
"He'd say it was because I lost focus, but..."
I think it was because of the way he grew up.
He didn't like the idea of a kid-around life.
"Anyway, I got off the grift."
I met you.
And I never saw him again.
I swear to God I never saw him again until he showed up here a few days ago.
You could be conning me right now.
"No, no."
No.
Don't touch me.
Don't...
But...
I swear to you that this... is real.
Okay?
You are what... is important to me.
"Listen, Pedro, I love you."
"You know what's real right now, honey?"
What?
You do not have to say anything...
His cab is going to forensic services.
And so are his trainers.
"I swear to god, she got out and that was the last I saw of her."
Just like you never saw Kelly Mahon after she got out of your cab?
That's the truth.
So why did you run?
Straight up?
My cousin gave me a load of iPads last night.
"What, nicked I take it?"
They were in the boot of my cab.
I thought you were after them.
"You been inside, Carl?"
You know I have.
Two years GBH.
"Yeah, that's right.And your DNA was all over the bloke you punched."
The bloke insulted my girl.
I knocked him once.
Then the old Bill bang on my door.
But it was blood on your clothes that got you convicted?
Yeah.
But what's any of this got to do with those girls?
We think you've got a grudge against women who work in forensic services.
"You're joking, right?"
No.
"I mean, two years to sit in jail and stew over whose fault it was that you were sitting in that cell."
I know whose fault it was.
It was mine.
And the drink.
Not Kelly Mahon's?
Not Lucy Kennard's?
Never mind the issue of proof...
I will never allow his wrongdoing to succeed!
-How do you see the outcome of this race?
-How confident do you feel?
Thanks to the absence of Mac...
I now have great hopes of winning the title.
What about Black Eagle?
I've never even heard of him.
So it may safely be said that I will be the one to win the championship.
What's that?
Mac!
So you are going to participate in the race after all?
"Yes, this is the prototype of my missing engine."
"I had kept it at a friend's place, so it wasn't destroyed in the fire."
"It may be not as powerful as the other one, but I'll race with it."
"Good luck to you, Mac."
I'll do what little I can.
You're right.
Let's do our best.
Am I in time?
"It's really a fine day for flying, isn't it?"
Has Moriarty appeared?
"No, not yet."
Please take care of Mrs. Hudson.
I'll fly with Mac.
Right.
"Finally, the moment has come for me to show the world... that my ""Crow"" is Number One!"
Here!
Here!
I can't wait to see who's going to win the championship.
"Are you ready, Mrs. Hudson?"
Yes.
I have a pair of cargos that come with a ski cap.
"- Just some long pants, if you got those."
- Yeah.
Sure.
Like drop-crotch slacks?
Just the best-- whatever.
It doesn't... [coffeemaker gurgling]
Pants!
- Thanks.
"- So, what's the what, man?"
"Yeah, like I was saying, I just, you know--"
"It's the first time I've been back in the 'hood in a minute and it kind of... you know, to be honest, it feels like people are... trying to hold me responsible for something I did."
"Man, that is unfair."
"But, I mean, that's like, just like a people, isn't it?"
"Like, they do that."
"Yeah, they do."
"And, you know, I'm just..."
I really just need somewhere to-- somewhere to stay.
"Oh, man."
You should talk to my landlord.
"- Man, he's the most accommodating dude."
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"He's always telling me he's got like, a line of people that he wants to get in here."
"You should get on line, Chip!"
He is a real coolio too.
"Like, I haven't paid rent in like, three or six different months."
"So, I mean, that's one thing."
"But, you should hurry, because he said that rents are gonna skyrocket soon because of the new hotel going."
So--
Shit!
Seyed!
Seyed my cart is stolen my cart
"- Hey girl, have you seen a cart?"
- What?
- Cart have you seen my cart?
- No.
These ooward people put my father in trouble and now they are doing same to me.
"My father left Tangak because of me, because of Hanieh and my mom."
But at this time I came to Tangak by myself and I won't be stopped at all.
I will stand for it until the end.
How dare they underestimate me?
Are they Kufa's people?
"If my father can't play kettledrum till dawn, I will do it."
I promised to play kettledrum for Hanieh's leg to be cured.
"I stand for it, until the end."
What are they thinking?
"Seyed Abdullhossein, You make them understand!"
I am Bashirou!
Bashirou!
ZaerAli's son!
Tangaki Captain ZaerAli's son!
I confront them until the end!
Unljl last moment!
Can you hear me?
Did you hear or not?
"If you are real men, show up then I'll show them!"
I do something to you that nobody has done it before.
Their neck twisted.
"Do whatever you want with me, I am so tough skinned."
I am still in Tangak_
Do whatever you want with me.
I am still in Tangak_
He just wanted to know when they were coming to Hawaii.
Why?
"Okay, Sofia, Dawkins has this guy Craig right now and he's gonna kill him."
The only way we can prevent that is if you tell us exactly what Dawkins said to you on the phone this morning.
He said something about a big payday.
Then asked me for my car.
Dawkins is driving a 2010 silver Chevy Malibu.
Car's got a vehicle recovery system.
- Can you track it?
No problem.
Ready.
"VIN number's two, niner, whiskey, niner, alpha, alpha, seven, niner, two, eight, one."
Give me 10 minutes.
"Hey, I pulled Dawkins jacket."
You guys gotta see this.
This guy's rasp sheet reads like a grocery list he's checking off.
"In Boston, he's jacking cars."
"In New York, he's robbing ATMs."
Then he graduates to full-on bank robberies in Cleveland.
"Cops there suspected him of murdering his partner, name of Paul Stark."
"Five million dollars they stole together, never found."
- Look familiar?
- That's Craig.
So no wonder he doesn't take Dana.
He doesn't care about her money.
He wants the 5 million he stole with Paul.
Craig.
- Kono?
I got him.
They just parked outside Pacific Rim Bank.
I watched you die.
Heh.
Little appreciation of my cooking!
I want us to work together to remove the obstacles to Griff being rehired.
"Allen, I'm the obstacle."
- Last word?
- Last word.
You like the kielbasa?
- New chief came to see me.
- Gillray.
"He's planning on eliminating supervisory and middle management positions, so..."
I'm a supervisor.
"Allen, you gotta do your best to protect me, I..."
This is not the Allen Conner I know.
- He's my son.
- Mm-hmm.
You're not even a little ashamed of yourself maybe?
A little bit?
"He's in trouble, Frank, I know it and you know it, and I just, I..."
I just gotta keep him close.
"If I can, if we can do that, I can..."
I have a chance to help him.
"Otherwise, I don't know where he is, or"
- how to find him or he could be dead in...
"- OK, OK."
- OK?
What does that mean?
- OK.
Griff gets his job back and I keep mine.
"I won't forget this, Frank."
"Yeah, well, I'm going to try."
"I just, when I started these classes I had this feeling that it was all part of my destiny, but I didn't know how,"
- but now I do.
"- It's so great that you're back in school, Tash."
Alright mate?
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks you alright?
Got you a gift.
It's still in the shop.
Oh man that's perfect!
'Coz I can just collect it when I get yours next month.
No Laura?
"No, no, she had a work-thing and couldn't shift things around."
Couldn't shift things around?
"I'm not 6, Slade."
I'm only doing this for my mum.
Have you heard from Danny?
"No, has he not called?"
Maybe he couldn't shift things around.
"Hello, I'd just like to say a few words."
"You know it's a celebratory moment for a father when you look at your son, your baby, and you realize that he's reached the age where he can no longer call himself young."
"Because if he is becoming an old fart, then where does that leave me?"
A gravedodger?
"So I'd like you all please, to raise a glass."
- Ignore his crows-feet and his receding hairline.
- Thanks mate.
"And wish a happy birthday, to my little boy."
To Mark.
Happy Birthday!
"Sorry, sorry..."
I wanted to say something too.
"As you all know, we've had some difficult times in the past."
I have two sons.
Mark... and Jesse.
Hey mom...
But only one of them is here every year on his birthday.
40.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
My God.
You really are a Chemistry teacher.
You mind?
I was terrible at Chemistry.
I'm more of a Humanities guy.
How did you find me?
We should talk about that.
"It should be much, much harder for people to track you down."
"My PI charged me for three hours, so I seriously doubt it took him more than one."
"So this is what, blackmail?"
"Walter, I'm your lawyer."
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
I'm not in the shake-down racket.
I'm a lawyer.
"Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?"
Especially drug dealers.
"So what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?"
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?
"By the way, where do you keep the money?"
Is it in your mattress?
"Is it in a jelly jar, buried in the side yard?"
"This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up, but he won't be the last."
"And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?"
I don't understand.
What exactly are you offering to do for me?
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
I'm no Vito Corleone.
No shit!
Right now you're Fredo.
I want my daughter.
"Agent Collins,"
Mr. Van Sciver will see you now.
Will you follow me?
"Sure, thank you."
"My mom is in that ambulance, let's go!"
What can I do for the FBI?
"Well, I'm just following up on a case."
What do you know about a young man named Zack Starr?
That name isn't familiar.
What about Krista Starr?
- His wife?
- Sister.
"I'm sorry, what is this about?"
"Zack Starr was murdered and the case was being handled by a local detective, a cop named Brian Boone."
Looks like Krista Starr was involved in the investigation.
"- Well, have you talked to her?"
"- No, she's missing."
"You wouldn't know where I could find her by any chance, would you?"
- Do you say Boone?
- Yeah.
Is this the same detective who is being accused of this cross country killing spree?
Yeah.
And you're handling that case.
"Well, it might be tied to the Starr murder."
"You think it might be 2 murders, him and his sister?"
No.
She isn't dead.
"In fact, her uncle saw her recently, just doesn't know how to get ahold of her."
- You spoke to the uncle?
- Uh-uh.
And he tells me that you and Krista know each other pretty well.
I'm still your mother.
"No, my mother's dead."
I went to her funeral when I was six.
And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.
"She was trying to use me, like you are now."
Why?
She wants an army.
An army?
I want an alliance.
"No, what you want is revenge."
- This isn't about me.
-(SCOFFS)
It's about putting an end to a system that says one group is more deserving than another.
"This city may be surrounded by a wall, but it doesn't have to be a prison."
- I think that's a bit extreme.
-Hmm?
"I mean, the Faction System isn't perfect, but it's hardly a prison."
Let me guess.
Erudite.
I was Erudite.
You willing to kill Jeanine?
Absolutely.
"When I was married to Marcus, I knew her well."
"And believe me, there's nothing she isn't capable of."
But I think you already know that.
"Tris, we can't trust her."
Or maybe she knows...
"We're on the same side, Tris."
I'm Factionless because I don't fit into any one faction.
And you're Divergent because you belong to too many.
But we're both a threat to Jeanine.
"My people are ready for war, if that's what it takes."
I think it's just a question of joining them together...
legato.
Simplicity is the hardest thing.
It's the final thing.
"Well, er..."
"- Next week, then?"
- Yes.
"Good day, Your Highness."
"Monsieur, Baroness Dudevant is here."
Baroness Dudevant?
I don't think I know her.
"Well, send her in."
This is the first time I've found a use for my title.
You are incredible!
"I only need a minute of your time, then I'll go."
Very well.
I'll give you exactly one minute.
"I am leaving Pa... (PLAYS ""MINUTE WALTZ"")"
I am leaving Paris.
You can't have failed to notice I've been pursuing you.
I'm in love with you.
I don't know you at all...
(STOPS PLAYING)
"I don't know you at all, but I know this:"
you are great.
You have made a single instrument speak the language of God.
"And I wanted to learn it from your lips, you see."
"Anyway, you..."
"You don't want me and... it's become complicated, like everything between two people."
"It seems to me a pity, because it could have been so simple."
I'm begging you to give this up.
"I know that you're in need, with your children and your mother's funeral."
"So, he must be around them."
Who is the new entrant in their family?
He is my friend Kalyan.
He can't be the thief.
He is memory loss patient.
I'm at peace in this condition.
Something is wrong.
Thanks partner.
How are you?
Who is your partner!
Do you know where will I be tomorrow?
How many people are so honest in their duty like your son?
Catch me before December 16.
You will catch him for sure.
You are his right partner.
You are my right partner.
"What do you say, Swami?"
"First, let's have tea."
"Later, we can deal with the money."
Thief...!
Money is more important to me.
"Yes, my son is a thief."
He became a thief for kick.
"He was in search of kick, but he didn't get it."
But it came looking for him.
We are Venkat  Swapna.
We have a daughter.
I work in a private company.
My salary is Rs.10000.
"Every morning at 8, I take the lunch box, drop my daughter at the school, catch a running bus, go to office, come back in the evening, play with my daughter,"
"sometimes go to theatre, count our savings several times and feel safe, this is my life."
We've no complaints on anyone.
- It'll look great on you!
It's a real guy-puller.
Do you know how many times I've been fucked in this dress?
Every time I go out:
"Whoa, someone's there."
- Champagne?
"- I just need to get organised, OK?"
Whatever.
I'm going out.
What about the washing up?
This is not a hotel.
Careful you don't start sounding like my mother.
I could have tried harder to find Johan.
"But hey, he was the one who knew where I lived."
(light classical music)
"Obviously, this was just another adventure of his,   and I wasn't crying over him again."
If it could be a bit more...
"Good, hard, honest work can take your mind off anything."
I'd designed the costumes for a small play that was a huge success.
"One night, this French guy was visiting the theatre."
...at the end of Act II I fell down the stairs.
Everyone was laughing.
- This is Pierre Gaultier.
- The top name at the Palais Royale.
"This is Miss Olsen, who plays the captain's first wife."
- How lovely.
- It's an honour to meet you.
- And who is this lovely creature?
"- This is Anna, our costume designer."
- Enchanté.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
Mr. Gaultier is artistic director at the Palais Royale.
They were born when I lived in Florida with Bram.
"Don't you know Bram, my husband?"
-No.
You helped him go into hiding.
His name was Henk Meyer then.
1m90 and skinny as a rake.
I really don't remember him.
He was always hungry but he still gave me his distribution coupons.
There were so many.
He looked me up straight after the war.
Then we got married.
He'd be kicking me at least once a week during the night.
He'd have nightmares about Krauts and camps.
"When the Cold War started with Berlin and the Russians, it got really bad."
He kicked me out of the bed every night.
"Without being aware of it, the darling."
So we went to America.
"At least, there was an ocean in between."
"Yes, I heard you left the country."
"When the children were adults, they went to Israel."
We didn't.
"But we did come back, so we're halfway now."
"Nowhere at home, but still happy."
Very happy.
"No other news, and you?"
Do you ever think of Arie?
Arie...
It's easy to idealize.
-Would you have been happier?
I am happy.
But Arie's no longer there.
"On Remembrance Day, I sometimes think of what guys like Arie missed out on... after the war."
Said he had a plan that would get him out of the mob.
I guess he was wrong.
They found him.
What did my brother mean to you?
Everything.
Take me to his place.
I want to get to know him.
Take you to his place?
Are you crazy?
You show up and start this mess that almost gets us killed.
"You don't have a clue who you're dealing with, do you?"
"If you wanna kill yourself, be my guest."
But who gave you the right to risk my life?
I can't go home.
I can't go to work.
You painted a big red target on my back.
Where's the check?
Mikhail used to say we could never stay in one Place too long.
We have to move all the time.
It's time for us to move.
- They'll find us here.
- The cable didn't have to die.
This is just the beginning.
I've seen it before.
"They won't stop until you're dead, too."
You can't go to the police.
You can't hide.
"Lvan and his boss, Kirov, are relentless."
"All right, I'll bring you to your brother's home."
This explains why Mikhail picked a bank in Nice.
Holy shit.
Looks like we got another chance.
Hi.
You look really nice.
"Oh, thanks."
Where do you wanna go on our first date back?
I got to be in early.
"I got curfew, you know."
"Well, we were invited over to Amy and Ricky's."
What?
"Yeah, won't that be fun?"
I've never actually been over there before.
"Yeah, me neither."
And that's because we're not really friends with Ricky and Amy.
"Yes, we are."
We've known them for years.
That's where you want to go?
I was going to take us out for dinner or something.
"That's okay, I think they're just going to order a pizza or something."
They can't really go out because of John.
Great.
It'll be fun.
I don't think it will.
They're married.
They have a baby.
"Well, don't you want to get married and have a baby someday?"
Someday.
Not today.
Not tonight.
Tonight I just want to spend some time with you.
We don't need to spend so much time alone.
It only makes us want to have sex.
"I'm always going to want to have sex with you, so I'm just going to have to wait until you tell me you want to have sex with me."
"All right, let's go."
That's because he stepped in with the c-block.
Pete stepped in because Adam was too much of a wussy to talk to Kim himself!
- Ahem.
- We'll be right with you.
"Yeah, you guys good?"
Want a soda or anything?
Grayson:
No?
Great.
Why am I the only one looking out for Kim here?
"She wants tall, cool Pete, not lame, weird Adam."
You don't know the first thing about Adam!
You don't know the first thing about Pete!
"Hey, guys, do you like role-playing games and stories with dragons?"
"Get out of here now, please!"
Run for your lives!
"I'm hosting a trunk sale outside-- cigarettes, bad lite beer, and urine samples so clean you'd swear it was from the math club."
Parking lot. 10 minutes.
I think I'm having an asthma attack.
Leave now if you value your pants.
Just go.
Go.
"Dude, the cops are coming to..."
[ Inhales sharply ]
I can't lie to you.
Let's just... get in your car and see where the night takes us.
"Laurie, you're nothing like your mom"
- and you never will be.
- [ Sighs deeply ]
Where is your baby right now?
He's at home with a sitter.
"Where would Baby Laurie have been if her mother was out at a bar, partying?"
What'II happen if we call the cops?
"Touchy disagreed, he said:"
They'II talk to him and force him to buy a new one.
I can buy another one.
That's not the point.
He did something illegal.
Since when do you care about what's legal.
"And I suppose you drank milk at the hotel, so you could drive back?"
We drank milk... 0.08% .
The kind of milk Ducky could lose his license for.
And not you?
"I can't lose mine, I already lost it."
No... that's a joke...
he still has his license.
"Everybody was laughing, except... except the neg..."
"black kid, and Ducky convinced her about the police."
It's like drinking and driving.
"You don't get caught, you're OK."
"He got caught, he's gotta pay."
It's our duty as citizens.
What if he smashes all the little statues around?
"If we let him go, he might go and do a massacre at Gagnon's Nursery."
We'II feel guilty... our whole lives.
"They won't hang him, they'II just... give him a ticket."
alright!
"You want to do it, you deal with it."
"Bertrand, you know where the phone is."
I'm going to bed.
Come polo sweetheart.
We'II go beddy-byes.
Come with mommy.
She took polo by the arm and...
- Okay.
- Homesick?
I don't know.
How's Asger?
- Okay.
- Say hi.
I will...
See you.
"Hey, don't forget your little present."
"So I pocket the lump, catch the night train and go back to Jutland."
End of story.
But it doesn't work anymore.
It's like a prison I can't get out of.
I'm not like this.
I'm not.
"I only do it, because Asger hasn't got anybody else to do it."
And because I'm the one who knows people in Christiania.
A pusher frau.
"She waits on drug users, who come around to buy drugs."
"I get them coffee, while they tell me I look good   because they want to suck up to the pusher, who couldn't care less."
He's too stoned to notice anything.
That's Asger.
He's pretty spaced out and indifferent.
To me as well.
But it wasn't like that in the beginning.
He used to be a bouncer.
"Big and strong, with a sexy tattoo on his ass."
With Asger it was so different!
He ate pussy like nobody else.
"He was so good at it, and I felt I was in love for the first time ever."
Asger is not a bouncer anymore.
He's a full-time pusher.
Any time you like.
"I'll go along, Phil."
Keep the lad on the straight and narrow.
"I'll go along, Phil."
Keep the lad on the straight and narrow.
Why not?
That's the way to investigate a homicide.
Why not?
That's the way to investigate a homicide.
"Ruling out suspects, Warwick."
"Ruling out suspects, Warwick."
"Skip, a Mr Forrester on the phone for you."
"Skip, a Mr Forrester on the phone for you."
He's got some information on Friday night.
He's got some information on Friday night.
"I'm driving into town this way, right?"
"I'm driving into town this way, right?"
Yep.
Yep.
"And as I approach the bend, I notice a car coming the other way."
"And as I approach the bend, I notice a car coming the other way."
White Ford Fairmont.
White Ford Fairmont.
"What, coming from Griffith?"
Yeah.
"What, coming from Griffith?"
Yeah.
"And just as I get to it, this other car comes screaming up behind it,"
"And just as I get to it, this other car comes screaming up behind it, pulls out right in front of me and overtakes."
pulls out right in front of me and overtakes.
Did you get the make and the model?
"EJ Holden, green with a white roof."
"Damn it, I can't stand him."
I can't believe this is happening.
Richard... used to work for me years ago.
"And that's Priscilla, my best ex-wife."
They recently moved back to New York.
This is not gonna work.
Let's get out of here.
Why was she your best wife?
Everything with her was as intimate as kissing.
I never really got over her... the most orgasmic woman I've ever been with.
Who was the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with?
You could use my first name.
But I hope I'm not the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with.
I'm not that easy.
"- Hello, Priscilla."
"- Hello, George."
- You look absolutely beautiful.
- I don't.
"I look like shit, but thank you."
- How do I look?
"- Depraved, but well-fed."
"Jonathan, this is Richard and Priscilla Antrem."
Richard is the new editor of Women's Wear Daily.
"George, you know I'm editing GQ."
Don't be petty.
- I'm sorry.
I get the two confused.
- Of course you do.
You ought to try doing The Times crossword puzzle.
It's supposed to be good for senile dementia.
"Richard, George, please."
"Well, it's very nice to meet the both of you."
That's a good thing.
That means you're not like them.
"""Tell me not in mournful numbers,"
Life is but an empty dream.
"For the soul is dead that slumbers, And things are not what they seem."" Did you write this, dude?"
[EVAN] Huh?
"So, she's meeting you here."
[EVAN] Yeah.
Why?
[BENDER] I don't know.
Most chicks want you to pick them up.
[EVAN] She already knows where I live.
"Right, but still something peculiar about that."
How's this?
"Dude, you look great!"
You think?
Yeah.
Guys should take lessons from you on how to dress like a pimp.
"Yeah, it's like, this part is like..."
Do you want me to help you tie that tie?
"Yeah, that'd be great."
All right.
This is called the double Windsor knot.
"Don't fucking ask me how I know how to do this, like, I don't remember."
"I consider myself a modern-day cad, or dandy."
"A metrosexual, in the parlence of our times."
What was that?
"Dude, I don't know what I was doing, I just ..."
"I've been really lonely lately and, I mean you remember that one time we made out?"
"I mean, come on, just-"
Dad?
"Don't call me ""dad."" What?"
What?
Give me your key!
"But Mam, I haven't done anything."
You said I could go!
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
Upstairs!
"Well, Pauline had it right - what have I done with my life?"
You've looked after your mother.
Was I looking after her or hiding behind her?
"She never said ""don't get married"", ""don't have a girlfriend""."
"I was the one saying, ""Ooh, I have to go home and see to my mother."""
At least you plunged.
Wasn't much of a plunge.
I knew really he wouldn't leave Mrs Stanley.
"I was so busy being hard done by, I never thought about her."
What a twerp.
Me?
Me!
What have I got to get so high and mighty about?
I'm cringing.
Can't believe I turned down all that yoghurt!
I hadn't brought plain.
I hate plain.
We'll never have it.
# I want to make you proud I want to show

# I'm not the man that you deserve

"Dad, I wanna join the basketball team."
What did you say?
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do.
That's what I really wanna do.
Basketball?
!
No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
"But, Dad, it's what I really want."
There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
"I know, that's kind of why I like it."
Don't you even think about it!
"If I had a jock for a son,"
I'd be the laughing stock of the men's choir club!
"It's my life, Dad!"
Don't make me slap you.
I will slap your face so super hard!
I am the man of this house!
You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
Maybe you should let him try it.
"What did you say, woman?"
!
You aren't being fair.
That's it!
I'm gonna slap you!
"No, please!"
# I slap you I slap you #
"# I slap, slap, slap you #"

"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class."
"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd."
Go for it.
Jeremy.
Jenna.
"Hey, what's, uh?"
- What's up?
- Regret.
Make sure you lock that up.
Did I just pass their driveway?
"Uh, I think it's up there."
This is an amazing car.
Did I pass?
- Um...
- The whole double date thing was obviously a test to see how I would do around Elena.
I don't know.
"You were reminiscing about the Elena years all night, so..."
"Caroline, that stuff came before, okay?"
It's not just gonna go away.
"- I know that, okay?"
- No.
"No, you don't."
Because you're letting it turn you into a crazy person.
"Look, it's my fault."
"I, you know..."
I made it pretty clear early on that Elena still means something to me.
"But all that talk, it was just two old friends and some memories."
Tonight wasn't about me and Elena.
I was there because I wanted to be with you.
And I don't know what this means or what we are but I do know that you're the only person I want to be in this car with right now.
I don't even know if this makes sense because I'm not really that good at expressing myself...
"No, no."
I think you're doing just fine.
Ow!
No problem there.
Wow.
"Soul mate, right there."
"God's little gift to Landry, that's what that is."
Why can't you just be happy...
"Hey, Smash, you're on TV, homes."
And I want to apologize to him and everyone for doing so.
"Anyone can say, ""I'm sorry. "" Doesn't mean they are."
"Smash Williams is an arrogant, violent thug who attacked us just because we're white and have money."
And everyone's defending him.
He's lucky me and my friends acted civilized.
"And from the Smash Williams controversy, we go now to Kevin with the rest of today's sports headlines."
Smash?
"Hey, what the hell are you doing here?"
"Looking for you, man."
Did you see Adam Hughes on TV?
Do you want to respond...
"No, you're trying to get me in trouble!"
I'm just trying to get the truth.
"Hey, hey!"
"Tell him the truth, Smash."
Just shut the hell up!
Just shut the hell up!
"Smash, what happened that night?"
Was your sister hitting on him?
Is what he said true?
"Hell, no, that's not true!"
That's not true.
"All right, look, I'll tell you like this."
He was saying some foul things to my sister and I.
"Racial, sexual and threatening."
That's right.
An he's coming out swinging!
Ooh!
"Au revoir, Beautiful Steven."
"Parlez-vous ""Ouch""?"
"Now, a commercial."
- [Clink]
"- Oh, Arthur, there you are."
So nice to have company to watch TV with.
[Sniffs]
Brace yourself while corporate America tries to sell us its wretched things.
[Man on TV] I like jackhammering.
"I' better, I o it all ay long."
It's a man's job an I work up a man-size sweat on my brow.
[Woman] You sure o.
[Man] But I'm not afrai to pamper myself with a plush tissue when my brow nees a goo wiping.
[Woman] Plush?
"Here, big fella, sample my tissue."
I'll show you a tissue sample.
[Thrakkorzog] Fetch me a tissue sample from the Tick.
- [Suit squeaks] - [Toilet flushes]
Hm. [chuckles]
Knew I'd regret that burrito.
"Hey, what's happening here?"
"Uh, the little bunny guy was chafing himself on the ropes,"
- so I loosened him up a bit.
- You what?
He's a moth guy and how many times do I have to say it?
Don't touch my stuff!
This is my side of the living room and that is your side of the living room.
And must you drink straight out of the milk carton?
It's disgusting!
"Rally, Beautiful Steven, rally!"
"Boys, I'd like to introduce you to Ramases, he's on work experience."
"Hey, guys."
Cool office.
"I'm giving him a tour of the company, starting with the talking turds in the copy room and working up."
We should press on before we catch worms.
"Could I stay and play the jug game for a bit, please?"
"No, we're going to the grain store."
"Chop, chop!"
Have you thought about my request for a chair with back support?
"I have, and if the problem persists, I will take steps..."
It will - ..to hire a copier with a stronger back.
Right.
"I'm sure I'll manage, then."
Good-oh.
It's so bloody demeaning.
Even that gimpy work-experience kid is treated better than us.
You can say that again.
"He's got a sedan chair, look!"
Hup!
"Oi, Ramases!"
"It's Stylax and Marcus, the talking turds."
"Oh, hey, guys."
Is this sedan chair yours?
"It's my dad's, actually."
I sort of crashed my one taking it off-road.
Holy shit!
"I know, it was really stupid and I've learned my lesson."
"My dad's one's way bigger, though, if you guys need a lift."
All right.
Who's the flat-top?
This is Ramases.
He's Egyptian.
- (Foster) Good evening.
(Cissy) Hello.
(Poppy) Hello.
- What your name?
- Jock McGregor.
Jock McGregor.
Do come in.
"I'm Cissy Meldrum, this is my sister Poppy."
I-I won't shake hands.
A kid were sucking' a stick of toffee on the bus and it went all over the handrails.
"Ooh, aren't you strong?"
Your muscles are bursting out of that suit.
"It fits you very well, of course."
You develop muscles when you work for a living.
May I say what an honour it is to be invited to your beautiful home.
We think it's a bit old-fashioned but you can't shift Daddy.
We know that fine at the factory.
"I'm serving drinks, who wants stout and who wants raspberryade?"
"Nonsense, Ivy, I'll mix some cocktails."
"Now, who fancies a white lady?"
"It's going to be agony, George."
They could stop for hours.
How will we get rid of them?
Don't worry.
I've invited the bishop after dinner.
One look at his dog collar and they'll be off.
"Ah, hello, everybody."
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
"Oh, not at all, my lord."
"I was just saying what an honour it is, and a privilege,"
- to be invited to your beautiful home.
- Ah.
I always admired that.
"You'd walk into a burning building, save your worst enemy."
"Time to save yourself now, Dad."
Okay?
Walk into the light.
It's okay.
Don't worry about us.
We're gonna be fine.
You don't have to suffer.
You did your job.
"Take care of yourself, Pop."
I love you.
Walk into the light.
Bye.
So you know if your dad could talk right now he'd tell you you were acting like a big pussy?
"Thanks, Mom."
- I love you.
- Love you too.
"You did good, man."
"No matter what happens, you'll know you did right by your dad."
"I don't even know if he could hear me, but I guess it needed to be said, right?"
"Johnny, I'm so proud of you."
"Being able to cry in front of your dad like that, that's huge."
Who told you I cried?
Hank.
"Your mom ratted you out, bro."
She was taking prop bets on whether or not you'd cry.
She lost big on that one.
You got a big mouth.
I'm serious.
"I really do think that this is a big step for you, Johnny."
Life is so much richer when you allow yourself to tap into some vulnerability.
I'll have to get you a wedding present.
"Oh, no, no, please."
You don't have to do that.
"So, you're a sophomore?"
Yeah.
Are you a freshman somewhere?
"No, I'm a senior."
In high school.
I'll be going to college next year.
I hope.
Great.
You're gonna love it.
I love it.
Great.
"So, do you, like, have a boyfriend or anything?"
No.
"I went out with this guy recently, but he's a jock."
You know how jocks are.
"It was just, you know, a physical thing, I guess."
"For him, anyway."
"Actually, I don't really know how that is."
"I've only really dated Ricky and a couple of other guys, but no jocks."
"Well, I mean, Ricky is a jock, right?"
He's an amazing baseball player.
Or did he give that up?
"Yeah, I guess he did give it up."
"Oh, man, he was playing for this team one summer and they were going to nationals and he had a no-hit season going."
It was unprecedented.
His name is probably on some plaque or something.
And then he drew a bunch of body parts on the bases.
"Like first base for first base, second base for second..."
"Yeah, I get it."
- How about her?
How about the new girl?
- No.
"I mean, I don't know her."
Shut up.
"Look, I want someone I know, someone who knows me, someone who we know each other, someone like, uh..."
Topanga!
"Topanga, my honey."
- May I call you honey?
- No.
"Topanga, my girl, my friend, my girly friend."
"Believe me, I don't want this any more than you do, but everybody around here is pairing off, and I think you and I should spare ourselves a lot of uncoolness and walk through life together."
"Cory, my dear little butthead..."
May I call you butthead?
Sure.
- I can't walk through life with you.
- Is there someone else?
There's everybody else.
Why?
"We're already standing together, and we look great."
"Oh, come on."
Work with me here.
"Cory, when guys and girls go out, first they fall passionately in love."
"Then, after a week, they hate each other."
"So for one great passionate week, we'd lose a friendship that could last a lifetime."
- I'm in if you are.
"- Cory, don't worry."
I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
Gimme a name!
"- For the record, I dumped her."
- That's how I saw it.
"Well, Dubin's out sick again."
Tell her I'm pleased about her and the plumber.
It's handy to have a man with a trade about the house.
She deserves a bit of happiness.
"I know I was never the father you needed or deserved, but you will always be my beautiful girl  and I will always love you."
Always... always... always.
He still had six weeks in solitary.
"If people don't respect the law, what have you got?"
"Anarchy, mob rule, and mice in your garibaldis."
What are you going on about?
You think his mouse brothers come and busted him out?
Mind you...
I think I can see a tunnel.
Ooh...
Back already?
Ahh... there's your culprit.
- A bleeding' heart liberal like Paul.
- What?
"Yeah, that's it."
"He's got the hump about that three-and-out thing, and he's come down here and he's let Mickey have it away on his toes."
"That's your man, Victor."
He even looks guilty.
It was a joke.
We were having a laugh.
What you talking about?
You know.
"The rule, the big game, three and out."
- What about it?
- You know what?
I think he believed us.
"You knew it was a joke... a wind-up, didn't you?"
What?
You actually fell for it?
Getting Scott to sell the bar wasn't going so well.
This place has been in my familyfor 112 years.
I promised by grandfather I'd come back and run it.
"So, the huge deal my dad had worked on for a year fell through."
I'm not going to repeat what he's saying there.
Let's just say my dad pretty much hates Scott.
But I kind of like him.
Enough to sneak out of work to do this.
"I got to tell you, you turned out to be a pretty good motorcycle passenger."
"Well, it involves two skills I'm good at-- sitting and not dying."
"Come on, give yourself more credit than that."
"You leaned with the turns, you didn't put your hands over my eyes and shout ""Guess who?"""
Just that once.
I got a little bored when you did that wheelie on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Well...
I guess I should go.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Alex, fantastic news."
"Julian, hello."
My upstairs neighbor.
This is Scott.
"Well, this is awkward."
"Two people about to kiss, and I'm not one of them."
"Well, I have a tavern to get back to."
Okay.
- See ya.
- See ya.
I'm sorry if I ruined your moment there.
"Oh, that's okay."
"So, what's your big news?"
Out of anything.
I mean if everybody's...
already assuming it anyway.
"Maybe, we should just..."
It's amazing the things you notice.
Like the corner of his collar that was coming undone.
LIke he was from a poor family and couldn't afford new shirts.
That's all I could see.
The whole world was that unraveled piece of fabric.
I think I have to go.
"- Look, I'm sorry if l--"
"- No, it's okay."
- No pressure or anything.
- l have to go.
You could just think about it.
It's such a lie that you should do what's In your heart.
"If we all did what was In our hearts, the world would grind to a halt."
And they know that he knows and I can't believe he didn't tell them.
He got a perfect score on his PSAT.
Do you believe that?
Math will be ruined.
What does this have to do with Angela?
That's when they had sex.
Her and Jordan?
- At Brian's house.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe it?
Right in the front yard.
Brian watched the entire thing through his kitchen window.
I thought you and Angela were really tight.
She was like my best friend.
This whole things been really hard for me to accept.
"What is it with you, huh?"
"Ah, this fuckin' guy ain't ready."
I knew you weren't gonna be ready.
-You didn't bring coffee?
"-What do I look like, a fuckin' caterer?"
Frankie will make coffee.
Make coffee.
Thought you'd have one of your bitches in here.
"Yeah, I did."
Where the fuck is she?
"Always got these hot books around though, or a bitch, or somethin'."
What time is it?
-lt's 11:30.
We were supposed to be there by 9:00.
-l'll be ready in just a minute.
"Yeah, you're always fucking late."
You'd be late for your own fuckin' funeral.
What the fuck you looking at?
"Come on, make that coffee to go."
Let's go.
What the fuck you doing?
It's a joke.
A joke.
Put the fucking pot down.
Ya gonna take the coffee?
Stacks was always crazy.
"Instead of getting rid of the truck like he was supposed to, he got stoned went to his girlfriend's, and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck."
It was all over the television.
They even said they came up with prints off the wheel.
It was just a matter of time before they got to Stacks.
I gotta talk to you.
-Have a drink.
Good thing we have A truck and we drive.
But now captain kris kelly.
Has secured a deal To mine 80-miles inland.
Through alaskan bat country On the kougarok river.
This day's gonna be A good day.
I got a buddy that says He's gonna put us on a claim.
That's for sure good gold.
"But, like, it's a little bit Off the beaten path."
Because there's no Easy gold left out there.
River mining will be A new experience for the Kellys.
"Well, We're almost here."
And the first challenge...
Getting to the river.
That's where We are on this road.
Where's the claim?
The claim is right here.
You see these Little strips here?
- Those are roads.
- I'm pretty sure they're roads.
- Me.
- Man.
My buddy said That we're gonna find.
A trail already marked And it's how he gets there.
"What's the marked the trail, What's it say?"
It doesn't say anything.
It's just a trail in the middle.
Of nowhere on the side Of the road in about this area.
"How's it marked, though?"
It's not marked.
It's just a trail.
You said it was just marked.
A marked trail.
"I just wish you would, too, you know?"
Hey.
I don't know why I had to be married to such a good man.
Who I'm still mad at.
"He'll just stay the night, Jackie."
And he's out by morning.
Yes.
Abbs?
Abby.
"Gibbs, oh."
Sorry I woke you.
I woke you.
I woke you first when I called you.
You spent the night here?
"Yeah, Tony found the knife in question in Petty Officer Smith's seabag, and I kind of got on a roll testing it, and the next thing I knew, the sun was coming up."
Was it worth it?
Totally.
"I mean, even with my little windows, the light was just gorgeous."
"Abbs, I haven't had my coffee yet."
"Ooh, all right."
The knife.
So it tested positive for blood but in the trout family.
These scales that are lodged in the handle suggest rainbow or steelhead.
No blood from Adams.
Means Petty Officer Smith wasn't our killer.
But somebody is.
"You know, it's probably somebody that we don't even know yet."
Or someone we do.
"Abbs, you stayed here overnight trying to clear Vance's brother-in-law?"
"Well, the director is like family."
"I mean, you would want me to do the same for you."
Tox results.
"Well, if he's telling the (phone ringing) truth, we need to find Dana and protect her."
That's where we're headed.
(groans)
"Christopher, where the hell have you been?"
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.
"I know, King, I'm sorry, and I'll explain it when I get in."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Where are you?
Are you anywhere near the track?
"Avondale, maybe five, ten minutes, why?"
Okay.
"I need you to head over there as fast as possible, take Dana Wells into protective custody."
"Arrest her if you have to, just get her out of there, and don't do it in front of any of her crew."
I'll fill you in when you get here.
You got it.
"(engine roars, tires screeching)"
♪ ♪
Ms. Wells?
Ms. Wells?
(beeps)
PRIDE:
"Yeah, Chris."
"King, I think we're too late."
- What do you mean?
- Looks like Dana's been taken.
"Track surveillance camera has a pretty wide angle, but those are our guys forcing Dana into that black Charger."
Add the car to the bolos.
LASALLE:
"Nobody's seen Vernon, Dane, or St. Clair since this morning."
Didn't even show up to pre-check for today's race.
They must know that we're onto them.
Yeah.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
Why?
Because... he's evil.
You just don't like him.
The guy...
Bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Are you all right?
"Hey, you don't look so good."
I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
Perfect.
Don't forget the dates.
"""Passengers arrived at the hospital doa."
The estimated time of death...
"9:26 P.M., June 14, 1995."""
He's stepping out on you already?
I'm gonna kill him.
That's the point.
There's nothing to step out on.
"Oh, good."
"Not yet, anyway."
Not yet?
!
"Look, I know you don't like him, but he's the first guy in a long time that I actually have fun with."
Fun?
"Honey, trust me."
Fun doesn't last.
My third wife-- a barrel of monkeys.
"Dad, it's more than that."
It's like I feel like there's a connection.
"Oh, dear God."
"I'm not saying I know what it is, but I'd like to keep just seeing him and find out."
"What's to find out, honey?"
"He's brash, he's rude..."
He's rude?
You called him an idiot.
And Roberta.
"Sweetheart, sometimes I just get worked up, because I care about you so much."
"I know you do, Dad."
Will you do me a favor?
"When this magazine comes out and you get all these offers, will you just test the waters a little bit before you settle on..."
Roberta?
"Well, my dad's talking to me again."
That's great.
He must be happy you're still going to be on that Ten Most Eligible list.
"Yeah, about that."
I'm not gonna be on that list.
This was the night when friendship was truly solidified.
"Because at the beginning of this scene, I'd thrown up into a plastic bag but still had to hold the gum in my mouth, and then gave the gum to you."
- So you had...
- And I put it in my mouth.
You had my ABC gum that had been sitting in my mouth with fake throw up.
"With fake barf and then I put it back in your mouth because we realized, that once it lost its flavor it was better that way."
- Of course.
- This is so sweet.
This is the...
People go... when they see this.
- No joke.
- I'll do it.
"We had Chinese food, like, three weeks ago..."
"Oh, Chinese."
"- Oh, I love Chinese."
- There it is.
- There it is.
- These kids are so adorable.
God.
"Let's talk about something, like..."
"What's on your little paper, Pete?"
- A reference paper for stories.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, let's whip it out."
- What's it say?
- Does anyone wanna talk about...
Talk about the gum.
When you guys shared the gum.
"- We just did that, Mike."
- Okay.
About Mike and Kat living in New York for the first time?
This was the first time that me and Kat lived in New York.
"Number nine, Nathan Road."
"You know, you should not follow the trend to cut your hair like this!"
Different people should have different hair styles.
"See, your hair doesn't match your face."
And your face doesn't match your body.
Your body doesn't match your hair.
Completely ugly!
What the hell do you want?
"Master, I know it's my fault, please don't blame me."
I regret to cut my hair.
Sit down first.
Tell me the whole story.
Alright.
"Oh that day, I wandered off alone on the Nathan Road."
"When I reached number 9, Nathan Road, a fat woman waved to me."
"She said, ""Come to have your hair cut, it costs 5 cents only!"""
That's why I followed her.
"I always told you, cheap things are no good!"
You know your mistake now?
"Let's go back to the case, alright?"
"On that day, I went to the HK Club for the lion dance as usual."
"After the performance, I went back to the back stage."
"Suddenly someone covered my head with a rice bag, he pushed me on the wall, when I struggled with him..."
"Suddenly, someone took off my pants..."
Did he...
Yes!
What did you feel?
Painful?
No.
Funny?
No!
"My ass was seen, and I felt a bit cool."
"After he died, I came back here and lied."
And I've been lying ever since.
You want the truth.
"And when you get it, you're just like everybody else."
-They want anything but the truth!
-Connie!
Connie!
I told you once that the offer was always open.
I told you that I'm committing myself to you all the way... that I plan to worry about you and take care of you.
I meant that.
"Oh, Michael!"
-How's that?
-Fine!
I'll get it.
-Merry Christmas!
-Aren't you going to invite me in?
Not very friendly after practically breaking my back getting here.
"Hi, Joey!"
"Say, there's a blizzard blowing out, a big one!"
You got a drink?
I'm froze.
You're nowhere near froze with all you've got in you already.
I see the Navy hasn't managed to cure you of drinking.
Cure me?
"Honey, the Navy started me in tricks you never heard of."
Say!
"You sure made a lot of changes around here, ain't you?"
You bet we have.
"And, for a start, you can pick up your things and go."
Ain't nobody going to tell me what I can't do in my own house.
-This isn't your house anymore!
-I don't care what you did.
Cricket!
Never mind.
I've decided to diversify Charles' evenings at home.
Tonight I have a surprise.
I've asked a few young friends over for a little music-making.
"Charles, you know the Orme-Herricks?"
Did you know that Miss Orme-Herrick was a student of the cello?
She's going to play for us tonight after dinner!
Charles.
Charles.
I really have to go...
Please.
"I'm afraid Jorkins has to go, father."
He has to be up very early in the morning.
"Oh, what a pity."
"Goodbye then, Mr Jorkins."
I hope that you will pay us another visit next time you cross the herring pond.
"Goodbye, Mr Ryder, and thank you."
I'm so sorry I have to leave.
"- I'll just see him out, father."
- Such a versatile young man.
"You must ask him again, soon."
"Goodnight, Jorkins."
What very dull friends I have!
"You know, without the spur of your presence I would never have roused myself to invite them."
I have been very neglectful about entertaining lately.
Now you are paying me a long visit I will have many such evenings.
You liked Miss Orme-Herrick?
No.
No?
Was it her little moustache you objected to or her very large feet?
Do you think she enjoyed herself?
"Far as I could tell, you just keep your goddamn mouth shut unless you're opening it to pour booze in."
And you cheat on your wife.
"That's all i knew about after, you asshole."
You goddamn son of a bitch.
"Goddamn teddy, vietnam."
"Goddamn million gooks dead, 50,000 americans."
Goddamn won the war.
What did he do when he came home?
After?
"Drink, fight, cheat on his wife."
I ain't no goddamn coward.
"I got goddamn medals out the ass, asshole."
Proves I'm a hero.
"God, bombs going off, buildings coming down."
I know exactly what to do.
"If it happened right now, if this bar blew up, I'd know exactly what to do."
"Kids, marriage."
That's where--that's where I suck.
That's where I really suck.
That shit... that scares the balls off of me.
"Here I am after, surrounded by booze and dead assholes."
Thanks.
Get up slow.
Ok.
This is how it's gonna go.
You're gonna take that bag of cash I saw earlier.
Yeah.
You're gonna hand it over to me.
"And if you so much as twitch a muscle while you're doing it,"
I'm gonna blow your goddamn head off.
- Capiche?
- Ok.
And we've learned over the years to separate the real Lucy from who Lucy is when she's ill.
"- Yeah, because that's so easy."
"- No, I totally get it."
You what?
"Well, I understand what your mom's saying."
"I mean, people can't be blamed for something if they're sick, right?"
Hm?
- Thank you.
- So now you're on her side too.
"No, no, no, I'm not on anyone's side."
"- Uh, uh..."
- Except for your side.
I'm on your side.
Don't let the sniping fool you.
There's affection there.
I'm sorry.
Are you new here?
"Because my loving sister, well, she tried to kill me."
"That was just the illness, right?"
She didn't want you dead.
Dead enough.
How dead do you have to be around here till someone takes your freaking side?
Let me guess.
This wasn't a typical dinner at your house.
Heh.
You can't even slam a freaking door in this house!
"Look, I was just trying to understand your sister."
Everyone is always trying to understand my sister.
"Trust me, no one has come up with anything yet."
I thought you were gonna be the person who'd try to understand me.
"- Everybody can hear those voices, right?"
"- Yes, honey."
I...
I can't hear you.
I'm in a train.
"Okay, have a nice bike ride."
Whoa.
Ramon just threw a rock at me.
We're still friends.
What kind of God would put a chocolate fountain on a train and not let kids near it?
!
Yeah!
"Learn how to build a train, God!"
"Well... the chocolate fountain is impressive, but the real supply's all the way up front."
"What do you mean, ""The real supply?"""
There's way more chocolate up in the kitchen.
I've seen them load boxes and boxes of it in there.
"Well, then, are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?"
That I need a bath?
"Oh, yeah."
You do.
No.
We break out of here and steal the chocolate from the front of the train!
I'd do that.
I'm in.
Great!
The Belcher kids ride again!
For the first time!
And Rudy!
Is there.
"Okay, if we're gonna rob this train, we need to take it step by step."
"Luckily, Rudy has been trapped in this caboose for the last nine weekends doing some serious recon."
I see everything out this window.
"Once, a skunk got on the train for a little bit and then it got off and I was the only one to notice."
"I mean, isn't it?"
I can hardly stand it when he's away for a night.
"Oh, stella."
"When he's away for a week, I nearly go wild."
-Gracious.
-When he comes back I cry in his lap like a baby.
I guess that's what's meant by being in love.
stella.
I haven't asked you the things you probably thought I was going to ask so I'II expect you to be understanding about what I have to tell you.
"What, BIanche?"
You're going to reproach me.
"I know you're bound to reproach me, but before you do take into consideration you left."
I stayed and struggled.
You came to New orleans and looked out for yourself.
I stayed at belle Reve and tried to hold it together.
"Oh, I'm not meaning this in any reproachfuI way."
-But the burden descended on my shoulders.
-Best I couId do was make my own living.
"But you were the one that abandoned belle Reve, not I."
"I fought for it, bled for it, almost died for it."
Stop this outburst.
tell me what happened.
-I knew you'd take this attitude about it.
-About what?
please!
The loss.
The loss.
belle Reve?
"Lost, is it?"
"Yes, stella."
But how did it go?
What happened?
Okay.
This time I want to get a little more creative.
You got a wind machine handy?
Just shoot me.
Okay.
Great.
I'm going to have to take the camera to the dance with me and keep having my picture taken.
Don't let anyone else in the picture.
"If people aren't flickering out, they'll gain a hundred pounds."
And to think I used to complain when I got a run in my stocking.
"I keep him in a little glass jar, which I refer to as ""Oz."""
Uh-oh.
Jailbreak.
You lost him?
"Oh, perfect."
"Thanks to your overreacting, I get to spend my Friday night looking for a cockroach with my sister."
"Oh, come on."
This is stuff that keeps us young.
Ooh!
I think I see a dropping.
You look terrific.
Do you think so?
Because this is more of a standing-up dress than a sitting-down dress.
I thought we'd be standing up more.
It's too bad your car doesn't have a sunroof.
You look terrific.
"So, what's up with the camera?"
"Oh, you know, I wanted to preserve the memories of our big night."
"Uh, did you drop your left cuff link?"
What was that?
Northern lights?
(upbeat music playing)
How fortunate I'm here.
I'd like to help you.
"Let me back in there so I can bash him on the nose, that's all!"
"Quite the little Tartar, aren't you?"
Always ready to flare up.
"Oh, I like that."
"Here, here."
This is just to prove that I want to help you.
"The rainbow is wide and long, lvy."
"- Oh, now wait."
I better get home.
"- No, no, no."
"Ivy, my darling, you belong with the immortals."
Come with me to Mount Olympus.
Drink nectar with the gods.
Sing the ancient songs of pleasure.
And put Athena and Diana to shame.
"Oh, you aren't half of one with the words, aren't you?"
"And don't be frightened of me, will you, lvy?"
"When a botanist finds a rare flower, he shouts his triumph, doesn't he?"
Are you one of them?
"You like a man who sees a girl and makes up his mind, don't you?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, she doesn't know what I'm talking about."
"- Please, sir."
"- But you'll find out, won't you?"
- Please.
- You'll find out what it means.
"Please, sir."
"The London Post, Sir Charles."
"Oh, thank you."
"And one for you, mademoiselle."
"This band not only wants to re-invent the wheel, but wants to pound spikes into it, as well."
- She's awfull.
- Yeah monkey face.
"It would be disastrous, and would cause irrecoverable damages to"
Utah's women and children.
"Hi, we're at Nine Inch Nails !"
Fuck you.
- He's tellin' me there's no god !
"- There's no heaven, there's no hell."
All you are is fucking worm food.
Might as well face that shit right now.
"The only reason human beings created god, god did not create man, man created god."
I just scored front row tickets.
- Really?
"- Hello, my life is good."
Woo !
He keeps saying :
"""I'm gonna be in Trent's jock strap."""
"""I'm gonna be in his underwear."""
You know what my dream is?
"I'm gonna lick trent when he comes down into the audience, and he will."
- I'm not a big nine inch nails fan.
- That's ok.
But i wouldn't mind licking him.
"Keep him, away."
"Hey God,"
Why are you doing this to me?
"Am i not living up, to what i'm supposed to be?"
Why am i seething with this animosity?
"Hey God, i think you owe me a great big apology."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
We'll see if she calls back.
I don't want to hear it.
Shame on you!
"- Is this what you ordered, sir?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
I'm not staying with you.
I'm finishing my apple and going home.
"Mom wanted to protect us, that's why she hid it."
"She was a wise woman, she realized our lives would be a nightmare if her secret came out."
"- What, that he's an Arab?"
- Exactly.
"You can play innocent and call me a racist and pretend you're from Mars, not from Jerusalem."
"And that you don't care it he's an Arab,"
- but it means something to me.
"- Me, too."
But I want to see who he is.
You don't have to be here.
You only get in the way.
"- Shai, you're going too far."
- You're right.
I found what I'm looking for.
I don't need this.
- Are you implying something?
"- No, I'm saying it."
How long can you blame Dad for your screwed-up life?
And we're following you like idiots.
"Leave me alone, Shai- Go find your answers somewhere else-."
"Right, maybe I'll find God and eat apples."
Maybe you should.
- Is that your idea or did Haziya write it for you?
- Watch your mouth.
What is going on?
Leave me.
Leave me...
leave me!
What is going on?
What happen?
"I think his death will happen with my hand, stand straight, or i will beat you some rascal is getting nail."
Not wall the door.
"Now i had enough of beating him, now call the police."
"Don't do this Sir, my hotel is very good."
"You are right, not necessary, the work has done."
"Papa will not do this again, Papa say sorry to Mummy."
Just finish it sir.
They have beaten me a lot.
The worst way.
Like Dog.
"You told me to beat Papa, not like this!"
Please let me go.
"Papa he also nailed you., he nailed him like pig, he is very dangerous man."
Size of your underwear...
"Laxmi Narayan is going away with bag, where are you going?"
"You take your bag too, lets press the remote from here."
"Not from here, take this left right from here."
Lets move.
Press the button boss.
Not now.
Come-on sit in the car.
"Let me go please, no!"
"Press the button, which one Papa?"
The left one.
And now you cant ask who's left because its everyone's left.
"There is only one... make target on Laxmi Yadev, and Khujli make target on Laxmi."
"By saving all these children, do you want to be a hero?"
I'm not doing this for the people.
I'm doing it for myself.
The happiness I saw in her smile...
"If there is so much kick in one smile, think about the kick in millions of such smiles."
I want that kick.
I want that kick.
The kick started from a child's smile.
It won't stop.
"Nowadays, people want to be happy even on someone else's sorrows."
He looks for happiness in others' happiness.
He is not giving any suggestions.
He is not fighting against the system.
He never orders anyone to do something.
He does what he wants to do.
He is not saving those children.
He is showing us the kick in saving others.
Which father will get such a great son?
I get lot of kick.
"Till now, I wanted to see what he will become."
He has now become a thief.
He has become a true human.
What if he gets caught?
There is truth in his efforts.
Nothing will happen to him.
He will not get caught until he completes his job.
Where is he now?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
"When did you come, boss?"
How are you?
What?
"All of a sudden you had to get this off your chest, huh?"
"To be honest, it wasn't really my idea."
"After yesterday, Mary found out that I was using again, and she hired a private nurse to come to my house and make sure I stayed clean."
Nice friend.
She demanded...
That I come down here and I-I tell you the truth.
"And what is the truth, Desmond?"
Mary.
"Mary, I was just about to call you..."
I'm in trouble.
What... what do you mean?
"Grady Burgess, Des's dealer."
I came to see to him to tell him to leave Des alone.
"Help me, please."
He drugged me.
He's going to kill me.
"Okay, stay on the line, okay?"
Keep talking to me.
Where are you?
1287 Monu-ment...
Monument.
Mary?
Mary?
Shit.
So you're saying Mary had...
nothing to do with this.
"Mm-hmm, that's right."
"The truth is, I couldn't pay my drug debt because of the whole lost license ordeal."
Grady knew about my work with the terminally ill.
"He said that if I gave him our client list that he'd forgive me my debt, which I did, which was... stupid."
Go to Grady's house.
"You'll find a vault full of drugs, including pentobarbital."
"yeah, i guess you're right."
i wonder why harley would have lied about skipping school.
"- well, maybe... he's hiding something."
- huh.
harley has a shirt with his name on it?
!
he has a job!
that little bastard.
- literally.
- hey.
what does he need money for?
"i mean, if he has a job, then i should be getting..."
- you should ge getting what?
"- well, i should just know about it because he's my son, and i should know about everything that he's doing."
"- mm-hmm. so if you knew about this job... you wouldn't buy all that needless crap on his credit account, ask him to bring home pop, cheez whiz, and lotto tickets?"
that wouldn't happen?
"- [sighs, taps foot]"
"- ah, champ."
they got you stacking toilet paper.
"- merry christmas, uncle bob."
and i'm... [sighs] i'm sorry about tim's black eye.
"- oh, he'll be fine."
"i'm not too merry, though."
marge left me.
- how come?
"- oh, it's nothing."
she'll be back... i hope.
"anyway, i'm here for you."
is this what you wanted?
"- yeah. thanks for doing this, uncle bob."
"i mean, they wouldn't send the bill out to a kid."
"- hey, champ, you don't have to do this."
OK.
"We were on the roof replacing tiles when we fell through the ceiling, and luckily your bed broke our fall."
"Eric, you're in some big trouble here."
"Hey, go easy on him, I need this brother."
He taught me how to get what I want from a girl.
- Excuse me?
"- He taught me how to get a date,"
- and it worked big-time.
"- Oh, I see, and who is this girl?"
"- Uh, I don't know her name."
- You don't know her name?
"Not yet, but I'm gonna find out before I make any type of commitment."
How can you manage to ask a girl out if you don't know her name?
- All part of Eric's foolproof method.
"- Cory, get the phone."
"- Oh, Eric has a foolproof method?"
- Ring!
Ring!
"- Go ahead, Cory."
"- All right, first you pick a girl, any girl."
- Just any-ol-body.
- Yeah.
Then you pretend you're interested in her.
Now you don't really have to be interested in her.
"I thought you did, but Eric said it wasn't necessary."
- Ring!
- That's what you told him?
What?
Does it matter what I told him?
I'm dead.
You had the big sex talk with him two years ago.
What did you tell him?
So what does he like?
"Well, I kind of just gathered that so far he likes sitting on people's shoulders and sneezing on the top of my head, so..."
Okay.
"Well, um, I'm gonna go."
"Will, it was really nice to meet you."
Can I get a high-five?
- No?
OK.
- All right.
"Anyway, should we go show off to all of Detroit?"
My ring says yes.
Yoohoo!
"Dude, I can't believe you didn't tell me about proposing."
Give me a break.
I didn't tell anyone.
"Well, you told Backstreet Boys"
You didn't tell me and I'm your emotional guidance counsellor.
You know it's like I'm your sensei.
I don't speak Japanese and neither do you.
"Anyway, see this is the kind of thing we need to cherish."
Okay?
Our banter.
Our back and forth.
It's awesome.
"We've got to love this while we can because you're engaged and we may only be be living together another 7, 8, 9, 10 years."
- Who's engaged for 11 years?
- Turtles.
OK.
I didn't...
I didn't know 7-year-olds can improv like that.
"Actually, since Candace has her house we thought it might be romantic if I moved"
- in on Valentine's day.
"Honey, look, it's best not to talk much about it until she's calmed down."
Is that gonna be the deal?
Sister blanche can't be annoyed with details right now?
"well, you saw how she was last night."
I saw how she was.
"Now, Iet's cop a gander at the bill of sale."
I haven't seen any.
What do you mean?
"She didn't show you papers, deed of sale, nothing like that?"
Seemed like it wasn't sold.
"well, now, what was it, then?"
Giveaway to charity?
-She'II hear you.
-I don't care if she hears me.
"-Now, Iet's see the papers."
"-Honey, there weren't any papers."
She didn't show any papers.
I don't care about papers.
Wait.
"Now, listen, did you ever hear of the napoleonic Code, stella?"
-I haven't heard of the napoleonic Code.
-AII right.
"Okay, then."
-Let me enlighten you on a point or two.
-Yes?
"Now, we got here in the state of Louisiana what's known as the napoleonic Code."
"According to which, what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband also and vice versa."
will you listen.
"Take, for instance, I had that piece of property--"
My head is swimming.
"Oh, well, all right, dear."
Okay.
"The last time we went to a concert, it, uh, didn't turn out too well."
Things are different now.
"- Well, then, come on."
You like this band?
- I like Journey.
Julie's waiting in the car.
You and I are gonna talk later.
Yes?
- I'm not sure I want to talk to you.
- Sandy.
Kirsten is the one good thing in your life.
How could you do this to her?
After all she has done for you?
- I have to think of my marriage.
- What does Julie Cooper know about being the CEO. of a multimillion dollar company?
- It's a figurehead position.
You said so yourself.
Kirsten will continue to run the show.
- And work for Julie?
Why the hell w
- What do you suggest I do?
- I suggest you find a way to make it up to Kirsten now.
"Unless you want Julie to be your lawyer, too."
- Can you see okay?
"- Yeah, I can see fine."
"- There's no, like, obstructed views or anything, right?"
- Right.
- Okay.
"I just know, sometimes at shows, you can't see so well, 'cause, you know, the tall people are standing."
"Yeah, right, you know, but now I'm just having a hard time hearing."
"- But, thanks for getting me a seat."
- No problem.
- a nice walk.
- I hate walking.
"Besides, my driver's around the corner."
I have to go meet Simas Gort Morgan... and he's going to introduce me to Milo Norbuck... who's gonna be in the new CK campaign with me.
I can.
Should I come with you?
- It's business.
"- It's business, right."
"Page me tomorrow and maybe we'll have dinner, okay?"
Page?
"You know, Jocelyn, I have been inside all day... and I would like to take a nice walk."
- Would you like to join me?
"- Sure, I'd love to."
"Darling, change of plans."
"I have to meet Norbuck, at the Mercer, at 2AM... let's have some dinner at Raul's."
"- I'll take you next time, okay?"
"- Sure, no problem."
Okay.
"Antoniette, can I borrow your intern?"
The Doyle Gallery just called and... they desperately need this gown.
"It's the dress Kim Basinger orderly... asked, the one with only one sleeve, the one for the celebrity couture... auction, immediately."
You can finish this when you get back.
Hurry up!
- You heard her.
"- For God's sake, watch your back."
There are spies everywhere.
Trust no one.
"- Guard that with your soul, darling."
- I shall.
I owe you lunch.
"November, December or something..."
- our girls will figure it out.
He's smart.
He's motivated.
He's for real.
"He's not gonna make babies and not take care of them, or run the streets messing up his life."
He's gonna make something of himself.
"And here you come-- white, so you gotta be right-- and take one of the few... decent men we have left after jail, drugs and drive-by."
That is what Nikki meant about you up in our world.
"There's only one world, Chenille."
That is what they teach you.
We know different.
l-l don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
You wanna be a friend ?
Don't just be here to be here.
Open up your pretty brown eyes and look the hell around.
[Baby Continues Crying]
Excuse me.
"[Derek] Come on, Sara, this is for your audition."
Come on.
"No, no, no."
You're not attacking it.
"You're not working it, okay ?"
Come on now.
I'll get it right the next time.
You don't have time.
You gotta get it right now.
- l can't work like this.
- Like what ?
"Like this, with you dictating to me."
Allright.
Let's take a break.
"I'm sorry. lt's just that the audition's next week, and everything is so messed up at school."
"Ooh, I like him a lot."
"Just sign here, and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate."
Whoo-hoo!
We're rich.
"Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows."
We want to get the old people smell out before we move in.
"- Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet."
- Huh?
"Oh, right."
"So I guess you're in okay shape, huh?"
- No heart problems or anything?
"- Well, I--"
- Boo!
- [ Groaning ]
[ Groaning Continues ] I'm okay.
Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death...
"I must return to my large, empty mansion to rattle around... and await the inevitable alone."
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.
- Let's push him down the steps.
- No!
"You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money... maybe it would be nice if you spent some time with him."
- Well--
"- Come on, honey."
All right.
How come Bart gets to do that... and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
"Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of""booger man""... but, uh, I'm really not such a bad... dude."
"Oh, your milk's gone cold."
I'll ring for the maid.
- Whoa!
[ Muffled Grunting ]
"- Oh, sorry."
If you want to keep fit in this weather.
"Don't worry, I will."
Bye-bye.
Ah-choo!
"He's always been a poor one, Mr. herriot."
He never seems to put on no flesh.
- Which field was he in?
In the orchard for a few hours.
That's a thriving cough you've got there.
You're right there.
I'm sure I've got bronchitis.
"I'd watch it, if I were you."
Was there any fruit in the orchard?
"Aye, we had a greatly crop-- orchard is full."
"- That's it, then."
That fruit's brought his digestion to a complete standstill.
"Bogged up, is he?"
- Uh-huh.
A good dose of linseed oil will soon shift him.
"No, we're going to have to open him up, I'm afraid."
It's a very serious condition.
And we're going to have to operate here.
Anyone around who can lend a hand?
"Aye, if you're set on it."
But I still think a good dose of oil will put him to rights.
It'll be a lot easier.
I'm sorry.
The condition's far too advanced.
I've got to shift that fruit immediately.
"Thou knows best, I suppose."
"Hang on then, veterinary."
I'll get old George down at village.
"He isn't finding it easy, following the success of his first novel."
I do what I can to help.
I take care of the day-to-day things so he's free to focus on his work.
Try and keep him happy so his mind can focus on being creative.
Cook him his favourite food.
That sort of thing.
Tonight I've cooked him pilchards.
Hmm.
Bob loves pilchards.
There you are.
- There's a lot more than I'd expected.
We've been at it for hours.
"- We have, haven't we?"
I want to apologise for the other day.
- There's no need.
I should never have put Dr Campbell in that position... or said half the things I did.
I understand.
I can't imagine how it must feel to think of your child going to fight.
What...?
- It's heading for the village.
"If Will doesn't need me, I'll be straight back."
Do you want a lift?
Thank you!
What happened?
- I heard Bob shouting for help.
I found him being violently sick and doubled up in pain on the hall floor.
"We need to go, Doc!"
- Tell Pat.
Ah...
Pat?
Come in.
Will asked me to let you know Bob won't be discharged until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.
"-Most interesting thing probably was, um, what appeared to be that broad head arrow mark."
But it's one of those universal characters
"-that, you know, it stands for the King's Mark."
"-Yeah, exactly."
What else can it stand for?
A directional symbol?
It may be an arrow that was used for a different purpose.
"Exactly, yeah."
I mean that's...
"All that is, is my take on it."
That's my part of history that I-I know.
"But, I mean, symbolically, is that symbol used by other people?"
I don't know.
"Well, it's a symbol on the 90 Foot Stone."
-Is that right?
-Yeah.
"A triangle is on the 90 Foot Stone, an arrow symbol is on the 90 Foot Stone."
"Isitpossible that what appears to be acarvingof aBroadArrow, or the King's Mark, issomethingquitedifferent?"
"Coulditbe , as Doug Crowell insists, anotherimportantclue-- onelinkingthecarvings found at New Ross tothe90 FootStone found buried intheOakIslandMoneyPit?"
"Tim, you've taken the first step on a longer journey."
-Yes.
-Congratulations.
Welcome to Oak Island.
"Okay, let's gear up and go home."
"Onedayafter the team's productive investigationatNewRoss,"
"Rick,Martyandmembers of the Oak Island team meetwitharchaeologist Laird Niven."
-Hello.
-Hello.
They'veinvitedhim to investigate the strange square-shapedholefoundnear Dave Blankenship's property.
Okay.
"Laird, we got something we think"
-really peculiar.
"Thank you, friend."
"- Thank you, my boy."
-(chuckles)
- A toast.
-Thank you.
"It just goes to prove, what I've always said, every dog has his day."
Thank you very much.
"Morning, Mr. Marshall."
"Hello, Kramden."
What can I do for you?
"Mr. Marshall, I have a million dollars in here."
Then you must have had a mighty good day on the bus.
Oh-ho!
"Ha, ha, ha!"
Very good!
(chuckles) Very good!
"Well, it's like the men say, Mr. Marshall, you're a good guy."
All the fellas say the same thing:
"they say you're a guy that likes new ideas and a fella that you can come to and get advice, sometimes even financial assistance. (chuckles)"
"Mr. Marshall, I have here a fortune."
"My wife made a whole bowl of this last night, and I scooped some up to bring it over as a sample."
And there it is.
What is it?
An appetizer.
The most delicious you've ever tasted in your life!
- Appetizer?
"-Sure, an appetizer."
People go nuts over appetizers.
"Walk into any supermarket-- all along the shelves, they got jars of appetizers."
But the difference is that this is something new and different.
"That's what the people go for, something new and different."
This is delicious.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Ugh.
"Well, that goes beyond stupid."
Agent Gibbs.
"Is Leon coming, too?"
Assault with a deadly weapon.
You left that one out the last we talked.
"Uh, well, I was..."
I was just... just a dumb kid who-who didn't know any better.
"I mean, it wasn't that big of a deal."
You put someone in the hospital.
I'd-I'd say that was a big deal.
What's this got to do with anything?
One: you lied to me.
Two: you have the potential for violence.
"Yeah, when I was 14 years old."
"Look, I-I admit, I had some tough times as a kid, you know?"
And-And I made a mistake.
I lashed out.
"But I learned from it, and I moved on."
It never happened again.
What else don't I know?
"I told you everything, Agent Gibbs."
I didn't do this!
Why can't you just accept that?
"Because a young man is dead, and I can't accept anything yet."
"All right, that's enough."
"Michael, don't say another word."
"You should be focusing your energy on real evidence, real suspects."
Michael is a suspect.
The only person you need to be worried about is Petty Officer Brian Smith.
"UA after the crime, fight with the victim..."
You're Fozzie Bear who's been ripped up and used to smuggle heroin.
A Nazi doctor.
I don't even know what the fuck you are.
This is not about serving yourselves.
This is about serving the president.
"So let's do that, shall we?"
- Tom.
- Tom.
"-  Shut up, Gary."
- Shut... mm-hmm.
"I do the team talks, okay?"
"You're absolutely right, ma'am."
And I agree with everything you just said.
"So get it together, people!"
"Yes, ma'am."
Find Pierce.
Call NASA.
They've got to have a satellite that can pinpoint a moron.
"Yes, ma'am."
"If you want to catch a fugitive, you got to think like a fugitive."
- Where's he going?
"- Uh, to the airport."
Why would he be going to the airport?
"To catch a plane, Dan."
"You know, you could just hit the fucking gas, Jonah."
"Dan, I'm not getting a ticket."
That's the kind of shit that comes back to bite you when you run for office.
"Yeah, that's what's gonna hold you back."
"Okay, new rule in the Cube."
"If your name begins with D, you need to shut the fuck up immediately."
I'm fine because my name begins with an R.
- Not if we shorten it to Dick.
"Look, Evan, I thought a lot about it."
"Right, I just, with Trend..."
"Don't worry about Trend, he decided to deactivate."
That's convenient.
What about the other guys?
There's always gonna be guys that don't like you.
Not everyone likes me.
That's true.
Thanks.
I think you can't let the way people feel about you determine how you live your life.
You're my little brother.
I garantee you I got your back.
So trust me.
And take this back.
At least think about it.
What you doing now?
I'm heading to the house to celebrate Cappie's release from CRU jail.
I'm not gonna be able to make it.
More movies?
"Actually, no."
I'm going back to Omega Chi.
Are you kidding?
I belong there.
You can't run away 'cause things aren't perfect
So Evan wins?
I thought you said it wasn't a competition.
Are you forgetting?
It's the same Evan Chamber who fought me at Dopplers who humiliated my sister at the carnival.
I don't know what you want me to say.
Alright?
"There're 2 sides to every story, Evan can be a real decent guy."
Are you saying Casey deserved what he did to her?
"Not a lot to go on, is there?"
Cup of coffee?
Sir?
Except the panic.
The panic?
"Yes, sir."
I might have something in this area.
See what you think.
Mrs. Daley was shot at a distance of 30 feet and she was shot in the back.
Are you with me so far?
"Yes, I think I can grasp that."
"Now,"
Tony...
He's the owner of the deli.
"He said that the killer was ""cool as a cucumber."""
"That's a direct quote, sir."
"So that means that when Mrs. Daley tried to run, that's when he lost his cool."
"See, that's when he panicked and he shot her."
"But he hit her right in the heart, sir, and at the distance of 30 feet while she was running."
"Now, that's hard to do in a panic."
What do you think?
"I think that I had better try and help you because you're going to ask me to, aren't you?"
"You did it again, sir."
You read my mind.
Would you?
"Oh, that would be an honor."
Detective Lucerne helping me.
Wait till I tell my wife.
Somebody asking for me?
"Oh, Sid, it's all right."
This is Lieutenant Columbo from the police department.
"This is Claire's husband, Sid Daley."
What did you say?
I said i don't like you.
Hmm.
That makes me feel very badly.
"I don't like you, either!"
Are you quite sure of that?
I wish i were just as sure that jim was safe over in jersey with all that cash.
Always leaning on jim.
"What do you mean, always leaning on jim?"
"Well, aren't you?"
"What would you do without his brains, his generosity, his shrewdness?"
You'd be lost.
"Without his friendship, i'd be lost."
"Excuse me, miss mansfield, there are two reporters from the paper to see you."
Send them in.
"Oh, hello, mr."
Boyd.
"We thought you were over in jersey with the erie gang- i mean, fisk and drew."
"Good evening, miss mansfield."
Good evening.
"What do you want, boys?"
Anything jim fisk does tonight is news.
We're running down a story.
What kind of story?
"You won't get mad if i say it, will you?"
What is it?
"They're saying in wall street that the only person smart enough to get the best of jim fisk is-excuse me- is miss mansfield, that vanderbilt's 10 millions will slip through fisk's hands into hers."
"Wait a minute, mr."
Boyd.
We were sent up here to ask you.
That's our job.
Exactly.
My adorable... adorable... cat... cat...
Go by yourself.
Good...bye...
"Please leave the rest to me, Sasaoka."
"Bake Neko, I know your Makoto and your Kotowari."
I finally know everything.
Your Makoto... and your Kotowari is known...
The sword... shall be unsheathed!
UNSHEATHE.
I have seen enough of how you act.
I won't fear you anymore.
I won't be intimidated by this scene and this bloodlust.
"Brace yourself, I won't forgive you!"
Vanish!
Won't it be bothered resting by this mansion?
It would probably want to be near Tamaki-san.
I hope it'll get to live with Tamaki-san this time around.
It's the end for this house.
"The thing that I have been protecting, it has been destroyed..."
I did not lie to you.
I told you the Makoto.
Is that so?
That is the Makoto behind you?
The thing that you were trying to protect.
Take a good look at it.
What are you going to do from now on?
Where are you going now?
That's not something that you should be asking me.
"Odajima-sama, isn't that the thing you are thinking the most about right now?"
I am thinking of going back to my old village.
I can't stay here any more.
As for me...
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
We took those photos less than an hour ago.
Why is the size of the haematoma in that scan... three times the size of the one in this man's skull?
It's like the whole mess is healing itself at warp speed.
"The home number was unlisted, but Rickman was in the ER last year... with a badly cut finger, and his wife had a Pap smear."
Dr. Willock.
"Dr. Willock, excellent."
And who's taking care of this fellow now?
"It's not Dr. Stegman, is it?"
No.
Steg isn't in.
I believe Hook.
Hook?
Excellent.
- Do you think so?
"- Yes, indeed."
You say this Peter Rickman is quite well-known?
Yes.
"In fact, here."
"I included this, in case you hadn't seen it."
I see.
"Thank you, Brenda."
"Quick work, and even quicker thinking."
Thank you for this.
"Here, take this, and one of these... and, of course, one of these, for your car window."
Aren't they wonderful?
Aren't they really excellent?
Very nice.
"Jesse, if this works out, the Rickmans are in a position... to give Kingdom Hospital a great deal of help."
"Filthy rich, are they?"
"- I don't know if I'd say that, exactly, but..."
"- No, but just between us?"
And don't change the subject.
"Then there was the Pender Drug account, and Sheridan Cement."
All first class.
And all the others.
I haven't thought about hours or days off.
I've proved my loyalty and it's about time you gave me an unqualified vote of confidence.
"Now, Larry, either I get that Waterhouse account or you get yourself a new boy."
- You got it.
"I mean it, Larry."
I've got the Waterhouse account?
That's what I wanted to tell you when you came in.
Yesterday you said I couldn't have the account because I was too immature.
"What did I do, age overnight?"
"I just thought it over, and this morning I changed my mind."
"And Darrin, I know you'll do a great job."
- Good luck.
"- Thanks, Larry."
You won't be sorry.
I still don't get it.
What made you change your mind?
"- Oh, it's the boss' prerogative."
- I'll buy that.
"Boy, I can't wait to tell Sam."
I was tempted to tell her myself but I knew that you wanted that pleasure.
"Oh, yeah."
When...
When did you see Samantha?
"Oh, just now."
Down in the parking lot.
There's a great little wife you've got there.
Has your every interest at heart.
She sure has.
Why did he stab him under there?
"Well, according to Shrimpton, Lorton stabs the kid here."
Shrimpton then heroically runs for help.
Lorton then drags the now dead body over to here.
Makes no sense.
It's closer to the street.
Why would you put it in a place that's lit up like the SCG?
"Now, your father was in the diplomatic service, is that right?"
David's told us all about you.
Very proud of his wife's exotic background.
We're not married.
Where exactly was he stationed?
All over.
"Italy, Spain, we ended up in Peru."
"Bloody hell, no way."
Peru?
That's where my brother-in-law was stationed.
Bob!
"Oh, this was many years ago."
"Yeah, ten years ago he was there."
"Bob, you great deaf bastard."
Come here!
"Oh, my phone."
"Oh, excuse me."
"If I was Joe Average instead of Joe Sandilands,"
I wouldn't be voting for us.
"I'd be buying a gun before Davo here bans them,"
I'd be putting a fucking bullet in my head.
"I think you've had enough there, Joe."
"No, Wal, Wal, I've only just begun, brother."
This man here is exactly what this party needs and we need 20 of 'em and we need 'em bloody quickly.
(Mobile phone rings)
Do you want to?
You see him?
You...
"Anyway, Mitchell, I have in my hand a piece of paper."
Phase two of Find Mitchell AJob Campaign.
"Oh, Annie, Annie, it doesn't matter."
I'm considering other options anyway.
"Mitchell, you're not a quitter."
It says so here in the reference that I wrote.
Check this out.
"""John Mitchell is the finest employee I ever had."
"""He is loyal and dependable and valued by all his co-workers."
"""I recall he did not give the best interview..."""
- Whoa!
"- ""...but I put that down to nerves."""
"What, so I make a habit of screwing up interviews?"
"""But how glad am I that I took a chance on him?"
Very.
"""Because I was rewarded with a pleasant and reliable worker,"
"""who would be an asset to any company."
"""Plus, let's face it, he's easy on the eye."""
I'm just covering all my bases.
Yeah.
You know what?
Maybe I just don't want to be a hospital cleaner any more.
"No, of course you don't."
"This is just the beginning, Mitchell."
"With me in your corner, next year you could be in the canteen."
I'm going to type this up.
What's up?
- Where's Adam?
- He's in the kitchen.
Cavemen are less primitive than you.
I'm not a flight attendant.
"You're not like that, you just got swept away."
I hope you're not back together.
"Shut up, both of you."
I haven't slept a wink in four days.
I'm going to shower and then I have to talk to you.
- About what?
- You can't shower.
- Why not?
- You're in mourning.
It's forbidden!
You can stink as much as you want.
I'm going to shower.
"Give her a break, okay?"
"Why don't you shower, too?"
I promise I won't tell Raziya.
And Dad knew all these years?
"I told you, they only just got tested, he just found out-."
How can that be?
What did...
Mom...
How?
What did she do when...
"I don't know, and it won't help to ask."
I never cease to be amazed at how little I know that loser who calls himself Dad.
And you believe his crap?
"He makes up bullshit to get us off his back forever, blood tests, my ass."
He should get an Oscar for his performances.
"A Pulitzer Prize for a sick mind, the scumbag."
We have to get the house ready tor tomorrow's guests.
I need pictures of Mom.
"So... I mean, I heard you were having a conversation... so I just basically tuned it out."
"I'm able to do that, like not hear things, so..."
Comparing instruments?
She is such an idiot.
You wouldn't believe some of the things that girl has said to me.
That was so stupid of me.
Crying.
"No, that's okay. I mean..."
"Well, see you later."
See you on the bus.
- You're taking my bus?
"- Yes, because I'm staying at Angela's."
What?
I heard about your dad.
Tough break.
"So, a girl in distress hurls herself on a guy with no life."
"It's probably just a figure of speech,""See you on the bus""."
She probably didn't mean she would actually see me.
"She just means... yes, we'll be on the same bus."
But not like together.
Right?
So you are staying at Angela's house?
- Yes.
What do you care?
- l don't.
So is her dad cooking you all kinds of good food or something?
What about Kyle?
"I mean, they've been umbilically attached for a month."
Kyle was probably her popular- jock phase.
Now she's moving into her awkward but sensitive guy phase.
- Are you saying I'm someone's phase?
- l wish I was.
Give me a break.
You told me to get in deep.
I'm in all the way.
"They didn't teach us this one in the academy, thinks I'm Batman or something."
"Yeah, well we found Robin floating in the bay with a third eye."
What do you mean?
The guy who was the manager at the ware house you were working was undercover too.
"Okasake, okasake?"
"Yeah, they thought he was campanela's man."
"Hey, thank god they didn't suspect the FBI."
"Hey, thank god they didn't suspect the FBI."
Well neither did I. Am I the next on the line?
I don't know that.
I thought we were supposed to look out for each other.
Okasake used to be yakuza.
He pissed off his elders in Honolulu.
"They down his lower teeth, so we made him a deal."
Loyalty.
You know they understand that word.
So do we.
The important thing is you didn't blow your cover.
"Yeah, no thanks to you."
We never had anyone this deep before.
We never had anyone this deep before.
"So you gotta do whatever it takes to stay in, David."
You hear me?
Whatever it takes.
"Ok, OK."
You take care of yourself.
Who sent you?
Who the fuck sent you?
Geahh!
Please don't turn me into one of those things that make it harder.
Mr.Cole?
South from downstairs.
"I'm not the ""War""."
"I'm not the ""Committee""."
I would it better.
Mrs.Cole?
Hello Alf.
Heavy rescue.
They want to know how many number in cellar 12.
Alright.
"When the twins got to Dunkirk, they did whatever every other small boats did."
Ferry troops off the beach and onto the big ships waiting in the deeper water.
"They were shelling' and drafin', but they honestly didn't talk about that."
What really seems to have stuck with them are the details.
The little authentic details...
There's a soul Joe with the dog in his kit-bag.
"Umm, the Frenchman that tried to kiss Lilly."
"I wish I could make you understand, how awfully brave they were..."
"Their father's a bully, I think."
A bit of a drunk.
"They're terrified of him, but, they took his boat anyway."
"""The Nancy""."
The Nancy?
"""The Nancy Starling""...after their mother."
The nail on the head!
Hm?
Wonderful.
"Authenticity, optimism and a dog!"
"I imagine, call ups left quite a hole in the ranks."
"So, in the interests of a quick turn around, we'll let you have some of our people."
"Mrs.Cole, Ms.Moore, hmm-umm,"
"Ah, I don't really want to do it, but."
"The one who brought back the Bonheur chocolates, was this boyfriend."
The guy you're spending tomorrow's Valentine's Day with is him.
"That guy smokes, right?"
"What, so you had noticed."
"If that was the case, you should have said something earlier."
This girl.
This girl is...
It's okay!
It's fine to go on like this!
What?
Two-timing is fine.
"If that boyfriend takes off for some place again,"
I'll help Saeko-san pass the time.
It's fine like that.
What's wrong with it?
- What?
I'm totally fine with it.
"Or rather, I don't mind it much."
"If I can be with Saeko-san, and one day, be loved properly, then I'm fine with that."
It's fine even if that's far out in the future.
"So, okay?"
I'm sorry.
"Saeko-san, wait."
"If you feel even a little sorry for me, at least accept this."
But...
- It's fine if you throw it out somewhere nearby.
It's pretty harsh to personally throw out something you made for someone.
"So, if Saeko-san could do it,"
I would be a little saved.
Akamiso is excited to present...
Shitsuren Chocolatier 1
With a knife.
"All right, I'm gonna tell you something, kiddo."
I woke up last night thinking about it.
I couldn't sleep at all.
"First I thought, ""Who am I gonna talk to?"""
"And then I thought, ""Michelangelo."""
Because you're a good listener.
"I mean that, really."
But it's not an easy thing to talk about.
Because...
Well...
Maybe...
Maybe it was my fault what happened to Bonnie.
And Dorothy.
"Because you see, in a way, Minx wanted them dead."
"But a girl can't help her feelings, can she?"
That's all they were.
Private feelings.
Private thoughts.
I didn't really want it to...
You know.
"What do you think, Michelangelo, honestly?"
Do you think I made a mistake with my career?
"You see when I was born mother decided I was to be something respectable, reliable."
"So you can imagine, when I started playing with dolls, mother started crying day and night."
It was a nightmare.
And that's when I began to dream of being a psychiatrist.
To stop mother from crying.
"And then one day, a man told me I was beautiful, asked me if I wanted to be in a commercial."
"Big hair, big eyelashes, big fur."
Vodka.
It was a big success.
You must be Danny.
"- Killer pipes, man."
Thank you.
Yes.
I went through a choral camp every summer as a kid and I was the first male Annie.
"We are a real odd couple, you and me."
I bet that we're just gonna end up arguing and apologizing to each other over and over again every week.
"In my flashbacks, I let the boys speak for themselves."
Yep.
Feels like it was just yesterday.
"What a crazy, crazy wild time."
"We became room-mates after that, but you know the story."
What does that have to do with anything?
"The reason he needed a new room-mate is because his old room-mate got married and left, and they were never really friends ever again."
Yeah.
And now it's happening to Danny all over.
"Oh, okay..."
You're a mess.
"The poor guy, he feels abandoned, dude."
"Well, I guess I have to make this..."
I'm sorry.
I guess I...
You know what?
Enough monkeying around.
I gotta make this right.
Good luck kiss.
"Now you get out there and you git him, soldier!"
Of course Trent works here.
Candace used to see all this for free.
Now people gotta pay me a buck for it.
Bam!
Capitalism.
You've made a new friend.
- Are you the new volunteer?
- He's a lawyer.
He and I are gonna throw a doctor's ass in the slammer.
"Oh, well... see you later."
Bye.
You smell that stink?
Like something's rotting?
Behind the stink of detergent... can't you smell that?
It reeks of death around here.
Why do you think she puts up with it?
She had a kid who died.
That's why.
"All of us in here are going out in body bags, and she knows that."
She thinks that when we see her little darling up there we'll tell him how mommy's doing.
And we'll take care of him.
Make sure he eats his dinner and goes to the potty up in Heaven.
"Volunteer, my ass."
What about you?
"You got a message to send, too?"
"Who you got up there, huh?"
"I'm going soon, so make the most of it."
"Some ""dearly beloved?"""
- Or maybe...
- Excuse me.
Hey!
"Hey, come back."
I didn't mean it like that.
I don't know how to die.
None of us know how to die.
But maybe... somewhere deep inside of us a part of us does know how.
Maybe it's not as terrible as it seems.
I hear you got a hold of Kuya?
The two are around here.
150 km north of Marshall Islands.
"Well, then..."
"Yes, as soon as repairs to your arm are completed, we want you to go rescue them."
We need to act sooner than that.
We must hurry so that I can pick up where I left off with...
Left off?
"Yes, that is..."
But if that enemy comes back again...
Don't worry!
Dangaioh can take care of that Mohawk dude!
That's not going be easy.
"Judging from the data sent from Flail, it's in no condition to transform into Dangaioh."
"But we just can't sit here and do nothing, right?"
"Yes, you're right..."
Kuya...
Kuya...
Thanks.
"If you didn't come, they would've taken me away."
"No, I should have been more..."
You should have?
I was no match for them at all...
Sorry...
"If I weren't so slow, we could've transformed."
"I'm the weak link, aren't I?"
No way!
Not once have I thought of you that way.
It's just that...
This is a dangerous mission and it's not for everyone.
If there's a way you could step down...
"Don't get me wrong, that's not what I mean."
- Tonight?
"- Oh, no, I can't."
I've got to meet my mom at the hospital.
- Want company?
"- No, I'm good."
'Cause we're here for you if you need us.
"He knows that, Brian."
Good.
"I can't count the times I wished you dead, miserable son of a bitch."
Literally can't count the times.
"Let me tell you, I always thought you'd outlive me."
You were always so full of damn life.
Used to piss me off.
"Goddamn sparkle in your eye just like the day I met you, like you were still 21."
I used to imagine you outliving me.
"Standing over my grave, getting cigar ashes on my headstone."
Terrible.
But here we are.
Looks like I'm outliving you.
I spent the last 25 years of my life hating you.
25?
"No, at least 27."
Do I regret it?
Not for a second.
"You and I weren't always nice to each other, but we never, ever lied to each other."
Now who am I supposed to hate?
Probably my mom.
"Can you believe she's still alive, making everybody miserable?"
"God, who sent you these ugly carnations?"
"Stink hands, yeah, figures."
"I'm sorry it didn't work out between us, Frank."
You weren't a bad guy.
Which really is quite bloody strange.
But I'll take a shaving and test it later.
Come here.
I'm glad you're uh... moving on from Anna.
It's about time.
"Whoa, whoa."
That's not what's happening.
I still love her.
But does she still love you?
Course she bloody does.
OK.
"Look, I'm just saying."
Sometimes a broken Rolex is just a watch which won't work anymore.
"Right, Confucius."
MAN:
I am aware that my arrival has been the subject of speculation.
"It's no secret that in this department, in this police force, there have been sins committed."
And that's why I'm here.
And why my predecessor's enjoying an early retirement.
- Now I'm sure I come with a...
- (DOOR OPENS)
With a certain reputation.
But I like to think I'm fighting on the side of the angels.
It's just that I tend to hold a very big stick while I'm doing it.
I want London to be proud of its police force.
And I'll do anything to help make that happen.
(DOOR OPENS)
This is Kayleigh Fenchurch.
Former dancer at the Pleasure Palace.
"Yeah, I know who she is, Doug."
"Why's she next to my victim, Freddie Lau?"
Because she was strangled too.
This is really weird for me.
"I'm used to having sex with whoever I want whenever I want, not settling down with one guy."
"But sometimes your instincts change, and you just have to go with it."
"Oh, my God."
Gabriel?
!
New York has a way of changing you...
Sometimes in ways you don't expect.
♪ Darken the city
♪ night is a wire
♪ steam in the subway
♪ earth is afire
"♪ do do do, do do do it's just a loan, you know?"
- I'll pay you back.
"- Sure, dad."
"♪ Woman, you want me"
♪ give me a sign
But it doesn't just harden you or bring out the animal in you.
It can also bring out the humanity.
"♪ Do do do do do do, do do do, do do do, do do ♪"
"Oh, Gabriel."
Wait here.
Let me get my wallet.
No.
That's okay.
Oh.
"And as our instincts change, so do our actions."
And sometimes the city simply brings out what's already inside of you...
"A killer instinct... which may be scary, or may just be about survival."
But sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
It's a bigger desk.
"No one's using it, and you would have your own computer."
His skin.
Was your hair always like this?
Do you know Gary Coleman?
But I found out they were just scared of me.
She didn't come out of that classroom for a whole week.
Can you tell me what's going on?
There's rumor about the fight.
"I had a fight with Caruso, the school bully."
"He beat me so bad,"
I had to take the Underground Railroad home.
Fight!
Fight!
But somehow that story turned into this story.
"Chris hit him in the jaw so hard, my tooth fell out."
"Chris knocked Caruso's eye out, put it back, and then knocked it out again."
Chris beat the snot out of him.
You can check his nose-- no snot!
"Chris chased him home, knocked out his family, then took their house."
"Now, when a rumor like this gets started, you never know where it's going to end up."
Are you sure about this?
"Yes, sir."
"After Chris kicked his teeth out, he said,"
"""And I better not see you trying to smile, cracker."""
Cracker...
"Yes, sir."
Cracker.
"Dr. Raymond was the school principal, and the last thing I needed was for him to think I was making trouble."
Thanks kid.
"That kid snitched so much, he made more money than the teachers."
Raise it up.
Higher.
Higher!
"- I'm going to get a farm, maybe something simple,"
"I'm going to start a practice, a fertility clinic"
"Dr. Conner, helping bring light into the world."
The only thing I need is Natasha.
Ah!
"I remember where it is, it's this way!"
Let's get a drink.
I'm so totally weirded out right now.
- It was so weird!
"- Oh, come on, it happens."
- Peter was defending him!
- Who?
- The jackass.
"- Oh, the jackass."
"He said it was an ""accident""."
"Well, that's a way of looking at it, or it's criminal negligence causing death."
Exactly.
Why didn't I say that?
"Well, my guess is that there's plenty of weirdness to come."
What?
You're moving to Dallas with a man you barely know.
"It's going to be a voyage of discovery, that's for sure."
I gotta get downstairs.
I'm going to try to get your brother's job back for him.
Anybody hear from him?
"Sandy hasn't heard from him, neither has Zoe."
"OK, it's just been a couple of days, give him some time to cool off,"
- then if I can just...
"- He's not cooling off, Dad."
He's in a crack den somewhere.
You don't know that.
None of us know that.
"""...that killed the rat."""
And then I have to go all the way to Denmark to shake somebody's hand.
He'll take a photo of me and show all his rich friends he's done good.
This is not up for discussion.
- I have to think about it.
"- No, you won't think about it."
"You will go, wear a suit, get a haircut, behave nice and smile."
"Please, Jacob."
You know as well as I do that this is our last chance.
Otherwise we'll have to close down.
Then these children will have nowhere to go.
They'll be on the streets.
Please.
You owe the children that much.
This is our last chance.
Are there only rich people where you are going?
- Yes.
- No one is poor?
- No.
Some have more than others.
"- If I was rich, I'd be happy."
"- I know, but people there are idiots."
"- You hate all the rich, Mr. Jacob."
Is it because the houses are far apart that people are far apart?
"I'll tell you all about it when I get back, right?"
What's wrong?
Pramod?
You're not coming back.
I know it.
I promise that I'll be back for your birthday.
I told you so.
"Pramod, come on."
- Trouble?
- You don't have to worry.
I'm actually just a normal person.
"I work hard, I take showers, I turn the radio down after 10:00."
I won't tell jokes to the neighbors.
The building is equipped for change.
"For instance, if you're in a westerly room and you're exposed to the setting sun, our computers increase the flow of air-conditioned air."
So your temperature is always perfect.
There's no comparable building anywhere.
How about that one?
"Oh, you know, that building doesn't look as tall."
Probably doesn't even have one computer.
"Honestly, I love it."
It'll be like living in the top drawer of a glass box.
I'll take it.
"Hello, little Cyclops."
Welcome to your new home.
"Don't forget, you're supposed to take the curse off the lonely nights."
Lonely nights and lonely days coming your way.
"Cut it out, Michaels."
"Hello, L.A."
This could be the start of a meaningful relationship.
Mr. Frimkin?
"Hello, I'm Leigh Michaels."
"Fine, thank you."
And you?
Yes.
"I worked at WXN, New York, for five years."
Uh-huh.
"I was born in Carthage, New York."
I'm 29 and I'm single.
"I hope that's not going to be a problem, Mr. Frimkin."
That may help you at the bottom end.
"But at the top end, it means earlier, you know, David."
So I wish we could do better for you.
Your patience is gonna be tried.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"There is, but it ain't-- the movies-- at least,"
"In our movies, the shooting schedule, it means very little,"
Because things happen.
"Shit happens, you know."
So you got to let me know if there's some problem.
You know what I mean?
"Hopefully, things will be better as we go on with this thing."
"But there are gonna be unexpected things, and--"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
It won't happen.
I'd love it.
"No one would like it more than I,"
But I don't think we will get it.
I just am afraid we will not get it.
"This stuff, we had a lot of actors."
"So maybe, you know-- maybe tomorrow"
Will be a little easier.
I don't know.
[Laughs] He cant' leave.
I told him to dye his hair.
"I told you I needed to make his hair black,"
Because otherwise it looked like-- people
Was saying it's Tromaville.
But now I don't know where he is.
We're late again.
"Every day, it's late."
"It's fucking-- we're shooting exteriors, right?"
So you're saying that you can't tell the difference between the highlight reel...
I can tell the difference.
"...and physically, really cheating on somebody?"
Don't say it to me like I can't tell the difference.
"Well, that's what you're saying!"
"You're saying that they,re related, then they're somehow in the same family."
"No, no."
"I'm saying you own a Jack Russell, I own a Bull Terrier."
They're both dogs.
They're both terriers.
Mine's just a little more aggressive than yours.
"I own a zebra, you own a goat."
What the hell's that have to do with cheating on your wife?
"Right, they're both animals."
Are you out of your mind?
How would you feel if your wife cheated?
Guys?
Listen to me.
Trudy's gone.
What?
What do you mean?
What?
I went to the room and all her stuff was gone.
Where do...
Where do you think she went?
Like she...
I don't know.
We had a argument at therapy.
She said she was sick of my senior citizen bullshit.
"I've been trying to keep up with her, but I'm a old ass!"
"Shane, honey, it's not your fault."
"No, it's bullshit."
"Stenz worked for the CIA, right?"
Right.
If we can track the way that Walker contacted..
"these guys, we can figure out how to stop them."
How do you propose we do that?
Keep an eye on Caulfield.
"Wait, what?"
Hi.
I'm Carol.
I'm not supposed to talk to you right now.
Run a database search on the guys in that building.
"CIA, NSA, everything you've got."
"Okay, listen, Walker's not doing this for the money, trust me."
There is something else going on.
"I can't do that, ma'am."
On the worst day that our country has ever had..
you could be the key to figuring all of this out.
Couldotherwisenotaccomplishthat  is take back the White House.
I'm gonna have to get that out.
When did you become a doctor all of a sudden?
"Look, just talk to me, get my mind off it."
Talk to me about your daughter.
Emily?
She's completely in love with you.
She even tried to get me to vote for you.
You didn't vote for me?
Your daughter's smart.
You should listen to her.
She was like 3 when I enlisted.
And to be honest with you..
I was probably just running from my marriage.
"Right after I deployed, Emily was watching TV.."
He shut me down.
Boom!
Gone.
See ya.
It was cold.
Yet you found it hot.
"No,I mean,he was hot while he happened to be shutting me down, but it's not like the shutting down itself was hot."
I really think he's changed.
"Yeah,he's changed into a guy that doesn't like you anymore."
And it happened the same exact time he became more appealing.
Weird.
"Dude,he totally still likes me."
I don't know what you're getting so indignant about.
You won't even kiss me when I get my sideburns trimmed like a quarter of an inch too short.
"When they're too short,your chin looks huge."
I warn you about that before every haircut.
- Bella.
"- Oh,jeez."
didn't Vivian almost break up with me one time for wearing Crocs?
"I'm kind of still kind of asleep,Aug."
You're supposed to love me no matter what.
Anything I do.
Whatever.
That's ridiculous.
"So,if you put on 200 pounds and become a serial killer,"
I'm supposed to just roll with that?
"Like normal things,Augie."
"Like,what if I suddenly grew a disgusting mole out of my back,like Bella."
Ew.
You grew something.
Let me see.
- No.
Do you know why?
- (MOUTHS)
"No, why don't you tell me why?"
We are so indifferent that we don't care.
- It's like we're medicated.
- How are you going to make us wake up?
I'm going to remind people what it's like to be really scared.
Have you ever heard of Spring-Heeled jack?
(LAUGHS) Spring-Heeled jack?
I've heard of Spring-Heeled jack.
Victorian bogeyman.
"Mask, red eyes."
Are you cribbing your ideas from penny-dreadfuls?
"They called him the Terror of London, and do you know what made him terrifying?"
"He could do whatever he liked to whomever he chose, wherever he chose, whenever he chose, and he was never caught."
"He just disappeared, passed into folklore."
"Oh, yeah?"
"- Is that what you want to do, eh?"
- I've already done it.
You just don't know it yet.
Are you sure about that?
Because the last time we spoke you were pretty scared that I was gonna ruin it.
"- Nice one, mate."
"- Yeah, I was, but not any more."
Why should I be scared?
I can take anyone I choose.
You can watch.
- Later tonight.
- What do you mean?
"I hope you're excited, because I am."
"Watch what, Cameron?"
"Hey, Cameron, what do you mean?"
I took my petition to Cowell and you know what he did?
"He didn't listen, because he don't care about people, he don't care about the town."
I think we'd be better off without him!
This smells rotten to me.
"Exactly, Dermot."
This looks fucking weird!
"Save it for the county jail, sister."
Right...
Exactly.
"Wheel me out of here, Dermot."
"Get out of here, come on!"
We've got Scrabble class.
"I'm going to open the door for you, because I feel sorry for you, because this is so Goddamn pathetic!"
I don't want your pity!
Just try and...
I just want your answers.
Don't you cross me!
Don't you cross me!
You're both embarrassing.
"The rope's too tight, I can't feel my feet, I need to go to the toilet."
Let's just come to some kind of amicable agreement.
I'm a very influential man.
Here we are.
This is Jessie J's place.
Wow!
"Yeah, she was my sensei growing up, she taught me everything I know."
Back in the day?
"Way back in the day, O'Leary."
You must remember one thing...
Mm-hmm?
"A relationship with a sensei is based on truth, honour and power."
I need to see you perform a power stance.
"- I'm going to stand up for our rights, at least, in the matter of the fence."
Wouldn't it be easier just to mend it?
"I mean-- no, I'm making a stand on principle, James."
"You will back me up, won't you?"
- Leave me out of it.
"For one thing, I'm not up to it."
For another-- all right.
Be like that.
Wallow in defeatism.
What is that disgusting smell?
Helen swears it's a sovereign remedy for flu.
It smells like old socks.
"- Don't insult old socks, this stuff's in a class of its own."
"- What is, darling?"
I was just praising the remarkable qualities of your flu remedy.
"Oh, were you?"
"Come along, drink it up while it's hot."
Got to get you fit again.
"'Night, tris."
"Next, please!"
"Come on, digger."
"- Andrew, come on in."
"James, you don't sound too good."
"No, I'm fine."
"Spot of flu, but Helen's specific knocked it on the head."
"Let's have a look at him, shall we?"
Come on.
"Come, digger."
Mr. herriot just wants to look.
When did you first notice this problem?
"He's had eye trouble on and off since he was a pup, really."
"Could you hold his head, please?"
This yours?
He's a weather wrangler.

Hi!
My dad's cooking tonight so I was thinking burgers at Bernie's instead.
- I'm there.
- 5:30-ish?
Yeah.
Great.
"- We'll be there, won't we, Rhydian?"
- Where else would we be?
Help!
Fredo!
"-I can't control her, Mikey."
"-You're my brother, don't apologize."
Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers three territories after he died.
You took over and didn't give it to them.

"Well, with burns like that, he's probably sensitive to light."
And his own skin.
"I mean, look around."
There's not a mirror in sight.
This guy doesn't want any reminder of what he looks like.
There is nothing personal in here.
"Well, we said he didn't have nothing to live for."
"For a planner like Kaman, tonight's abduction was irrational."
He went on private property and took Chris Edwards with a witness present.
"Maybe he's finally starting to feel the pressure, and he's reactive."
"More than that, he's meticulous."
He'd have a plan if he got cornered.
He'd have an endgame.
"Well, he already killed the man he blames for his accident."
The other victims were slights compared to that.
And now he needs to hurt the person that hurt him the most.
The one who drives all of this.
The one who broke his heart.
"Yeah, but who the hell is that?"
I swear I won't tell anybody about this.
"Oh, God!"
Son of a bitch!
"Oh, God!"
[Sobbing]
"I'm sorry, man."
I'm so sorry.
What if the next missile that he launches is aimed at Chicago or New York?
We're talking about millions of lives.
Your first act as president..
is going to be bombing the White House?
"Believe me, I know, I know."
But our country is stronger than one house.
This is Mission Control.
"Raptor Alpha 1, clear to initiate Operation Free Castle."
"Copy that, Raptor Alpha 1 beginning approach."
We've lost two commanders in chief in one day.
"Look, Mark, if I'm a foreign head of state, and the United States of America.."
has become a rogue nuclear power..
at what point do I take action and step in..
perhaps even with a preemptive nuclear strike?
Brought you a present.
It's the tourist's daughter.
"Well, hello, hello."
"Good morning, Mr. Cale."
I'm sitting here with someone who would like to say hello to you.
"Say hello, sweetie."
"Say hello, sweetie."
"All right, then, would you like to tell your father.."
what Mr. Stenz here is holding in his hand?
Agun.
"Now, Mr. Cale.."
I'm gonna start counting here..
and if you don't give the president to my men by the time I've reached three..
Mr. Stenz here is gonna shoot your little girl in the stomach.
One.
Two.
No.
No.
"That interests me, he's my son."
Please come in!
"This is the gate, you know."
"If I made an ordinary gate, everyone could get in."
But here the gate is at the back.
"Please, you can get in this way."
Through here?
"If it was an ordinary gate, anyone could open it."
I'm Marcel's father.
We are the Hladkys.
If it is inconvenient... I'm the mother.
The name reminds me of someone.
He was my supervisor.
From Bratislava.
"Ladies and gentlemen, dear students!"
"We are meeting for the last time, in order to say goodbye to you."
On behalf of the school I wish to thank you for your hard work your teacher and Pioneer leader for everything they have done.
This moment is not suitable for long speeches...
Quite so.
And you don't need them.
So I wish you a pleasant party and much success in the future.
"- Katka, aren't you dancing?"
- l don't know anyone here.
Didn't you dance at your party either?
"I did, I know the people there."
Come and dance at least with me.
"- Marcel, dance!"
- l don't know how to.
Then I'm going to dance.
Why don't you dance?
"I would, if I knew how to."
You must know something.
"Yes, this afternoon there was a documentary on TV about it."
Really?
Good afternoon.
Isn't he creepy?
What does he get up to?
"Whatever he gets up to, it can't be anything good."
He's always hanging around here at this time of the day.
Do you think he's the one who steals the underwear?
It's very possible.
Look at his face.
He looks very dubious.
- Can you keep an eye on him?
- OK.
I'm close by at the moment.
A driving license?
I don't have one.
I understand.
A man nods busily and wipes off his sweat.
When he first came here.
He'd never worked before and still had a smile just like a shining apple.
He no longer has that smile and he's worn out because he can't sleep.
"By the end of this month, from the time he came here."
An ear of rice could have grown to his chest.
Above the top button of his shirt...
Aren't you the model in this magazine?
Please sign your autograph.
"Ah, I can't."
Excuse me.
Please excuse us.
RED PORNO
Are you really sure about it?
Don't you know you could make one or two million yen easily with this job.
Sister Marie.
Please show this young lady out.
You're sure about this?
We've got a U-boat Commander at Bowmanville.
"Now, any intel Klaus can get from him"
- will help with the big Push.
- Eyes and ears inside.
You think he'll turn just because your family took a holiday years ago?
"Well, I'm counting on your legendary powers of persuasion, Tom."
Does he even remember you?
He was a kid.
"If anything, he'll remember my boys."
What else can you tell me?
He's a good soldier.
He's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder due to the fact that his father's got him some privileges.
So he's got integrity?
"Well, that doesn't help us."
He's a pilot.
That could help.
Guys who work alone are more likely to turn.
Start there while you're still on my payroll.
You heard.
The Yanks had to go through me.
I said it was your call.
Good luck with Klaus.
Why are you following me?
"Open your mouth,"
- or I'll open it for you.
- I don't speak unless I need to.
Why are you following me?
I wanted to make sure you are who you say you are.
I can help your men.
- That was you!
"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
I'm sorry.
"To-To hook up with a girl, I have to connect with her at least a little."
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
"Nothing about weird poets or buildings... or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me... with the subject line ""Food for Thought."""
"Please, Ted."
I need this.
Fine.
You win.
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
It's gonna be awesome.
Now turn off the lights and go.
Not all the way!
Hello.
"Yeah, three..."
"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
- Guys?
"- Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
"Oh, tell her, baby."
Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
They won't be.
- What is going on with you guys?
- It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction... and a beat-up van I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
Just go to the concert alone.
- Zach.
- See Seth.
"No bickering, no bantering, just talk."
"As much as I like you, Summer, you need to figure this out with him."
I need you to figure this out.
Holy mack.
"You are, like, such an adult."
"I mean, you're not insecure, you're not jealous."
Are you a robot?
Huh?
"We had a great time over break, right?"
"But if that's all it was supposed to be, and we've taken this as far as possible, just let me know."
Okay?
Okay.
Do you think champagne is really necessary?
Ooh.
Absolutely.
"We need to toast to quitting, slash, getting fired."
To independence.
- You mean unemployment.
"- Oh, Dad, just think how much time Sandy will have to spend on your case."
- Padding around the house in his black socks and his robe.
I can't wait.
"- Cal, don't you have a toast to make, too?"
- No.
"Uh, it's all right."
"Um, too much champagne, I get giggly."
- When have you ever been giggly?
"- Dad, what is it?"
"Julie and I have been talking, and, uh, I've come to a decision."
"Tomorrow morning, I'm calling a press conference to announce that I'll be stepping down from The Newport Group and appointing"
"Klinger, Colonel Potter tells me you're going down to Seoul for him."
Son of a gun.
Now that you mention it--
- You were planning on going to Seoul the whole time!
- It's only an inch from Inchon.
You sneak!
You stole three days from us.
"""Stole"" is such an ugly word."
"Shall we say, ""creatively acquired""?"
"Klinger, this is a list of pieces of music."
The military library in Seoul should have at least some of them.
"Please get them for me, will you?"
Thank you.
Gentlemen.
- That's the most fun he's been in two days.
- Get back as fast as you can.
We want a few minutes before the party to beat the daylights out of you.
Hey!
"Hey, Captain Cook, what about the big dinner party?"
"- You better be quick, or your goose is cooked."
"- Yeah, you bums, you!"
You guys are all talk and no food!
The natives are hungry tonight.
Listen to the pounding of those gums.
"If Klinger doesn't get here soon, we're gonna be the featured danglers at a lynching."
"What do you say we go see Colonel Potter, find out if he's heard from him?"
"- Yeah, let's keep low."
Maybe they won't notice us.
- Yeah.
[ All Clamoring ]
- Coast is clear.
- Good.
"Just go in the bedroom, that's all."
(angry grunt)
That animal is getting out of here immediately!
"- Wait, wait, wait, don't."
-Don't tell me to wait!
Alice knows she can't have a dog!
And she knows why she can't have a dog!
"Who's gonna take him out, huh?"
Me.
"Me, that's who!"
And when do dogs have to get taken out?
Five minutes before I have to go to bed!
That is around midnight!
"And if you think that I'm gonna walk up and down the street in the snow and the sleet and the rain, walking some mutt back and forth, you're nuts!"
Alice is taking that dog back!
- Right back to the pound!
"-Wait a minute, wait a minute."
She ain't taking it back.
Didn't cost you anything or anything.
She's in love with that puppy.
"If you make her take it back to the pound, it'll-it'll break her heart, and it'll cause a big fight, too."
You're absolutely right.
It will cause a fight.
So therefore I'm not gonna have her take it back.
I'll take it back!
- Back you go.
"-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Just-just wait a minute.
Wait.
- Wait...
-Don't wait...
Get out of my way!
They're a bit embarassed about their deficiency.
So we give them a safe place to practice.
That was the best party ever.
Girls!
"I'm ashamed of you, all of you."
"And you, most of all."
I'm sorry.
We snap.
We don't clap.
"And Casey Cartwright, you have earned yourself a grand round of snaps, right, girls?"
This was truly a magical evening.
You see how much fun you can have when you play by the rules and help other.
Come here.
I can't remember the last time I stayed up past 11.
- Good night!
- Good night.
I had an amazing evening.
"Thanks, big sis."
"OK, was Rebecca just being nice to you?"
I'm too tired to worry about that now
"OK, that was the most stressful, exhausting evening of my entire life."
We pulled it off.
And it's been almost a full 48h since I last thought about Evan.
"And tomorrow you'll think about him even less,"
And the next day even less.
"And eventually, it'll just be ""What's his name""."
I hope so.
I wish you were a boy and we could be together forever.
That's weird.
Why do I have to be the boy?
'Cause you're taller!
We want you to come back.
Thank you.
you killed him?
You killed dad?
"Not that I want to speak ill of the dead, but lionel luthor left a lot of damage in his wake, clark."
Remember he locked you in a kryptonite box?
"Lionel did a lot of things, chloe, but he'd never commit suicide."
"I don't know about that, clark."
He was beyond disturbed
- when he came to the daily planet today.
- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.
"He was pretty rattled the last time I saw him, too."
He was desperate to give me something... a locket.
What does a locket have to do with lionel luthor falling 40 stories from his office window?
Mr. Luthor...
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your father.
When I was a boy...
- Or a CD.
You didn't know what to do.
"No, in homeschool club, you get tapes only."
- So you never had a locker?
- No.
Or I got...
I felt embarrassed.
That's kind of the best part of high school.
- Having a locker?
- Yeah.
- I never used my locker.
- You see it on Saved by the Bell.
"I don't know if they can clear that, can they?"
- Can I say Saved by the...?
- Saved by the:
"Yeah, you could say that."
"""Entrepreneur rises from the ashes."""
"Now, I'm just going to be in The Times, looking like a stupid ash."
"Shoot, girl, just push on through."
"I'm pushing, girl."
I am pushing.
(both) Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
"Just go, girl."
I don't want anybody else to get those two yellow dresses.
"Max, did you hear that?"
Someone has worst taste than Sophie.
Now we just have to hang back here and let them get to those dresses first.
Yay!
My life is good again.
"Max, Caroline, up here."
"What was that, like, a second?"
I saved you a space upfront.
Come on.
"Well, it's over."
"As soon as they cut that ribbon,"
Sophie's going to Marshawn Lynch everyone who gets in the way of us and those dresses.
There's only one way out of this.
And you called it earlier.
You have to let them trample you.
I'm serious.
I'm not about to be trampled on purpose.
See if you still feel that way after I say these next few words:
"""Pictured from left, Caroline Channing."""
Try to fend off any heels you see heading for my eyes.
"Attention, ladies."
"As you see, I have the big scissors, which can only mean it's time... to trim some nose hairs!"
So we headed downtown.
On a bus.
Almost fresh.
I got 'em on the plane yesterday.
"Thank goodness I saved 'em, huh?"
Barbara.
Mm-hmm?
I understand about Roger being a great pool player...
Fantastic player!
His life's dream is to play competition on TV.
But what I don't understand is the part about the gold teeth.
Ah.
"Well, um, his gardening truck."
Did I mention that Roger is terrific with tropical flowers?
And therefore I know he's gonna be doin' real well over here.
"Anyway, his gardening truck was rear-ended, and his mouth..."
Steering wheel.
"So, he had this friend whose cousin was a dentist..."
"Some friend, right?"
And he gave him a deal on these new front teeth.
The problem with tailing a bus is that it can be pretty humiliating.
"See, a bus creeps along while the rest of the traffic moves around it."
"Well, all the, uh, enamel fell off, leaving just the gold casings."
Yeah.
So that's why you don't have a photo of Roger.
He's embarrassed to get his picture taken.
Come on.
The next pool hall is right up the street.
Okay.
"Barbara, does anyone know that you've come here looking for Roger?"
Ha.!
Only half of Bayonne.
"Yeah, nobody knows that better than I do."
Trust me.
But I also know that she knows stuff about people.
She's got a real gift for that.
"So, I'm gonna ask you."
Once.
What was she talking about?
"[inhales, exhales]"
Remember that little ditty I told you about looking for something new in Mexico?
"- Yeah, I remember not buying it."
- I was running.
His name's Clayton.
Met him on the rodeo circuit in Waco.
We were gonna swipe the main till at the stock show.
"Night before the show, he got good and drunk, he beat the shit out of me."
"Jitters, I guess."
"And the next day, we pulled the job."
"And when it came time to run, I left him holding' the bag in a tunnel with a six-pack of good ol' boys."
- So that's who you did the deal with.
- Yeah.
- But how that bitch knew about it...
- Forget it.
- She's like the plague.
- [laughs]
"The longer she's around, the more damage she does, which is why we're skipping this job."
"What are you, crazy?"
"Come on, it's... because of her!"
"Trust me, all right?"
She's bad for business.
- I don't want it.
- That's bullshit.
"- Okay, there's more to it."
We can't leave anything to chance.
We can't let the girl cancel the broadcasts.
She's the only one who can undo what's been done.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Go fuck yourself.
"Look, your bosses won't let her live."
She knows too much.
Either you or me or the Agency pulls the trigger.
"No matter what, she doesn't make it out alive."
You know a lot about this business.
What's the problem?
What do you care?
Like you haven't done it a hundred times before.
We've almost drilled through your door anyways.
Might as well save your own life.
What's she worth to you?
She's nobody.
DAVID:
"Fuck. lf anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air... (david panting) I couldn't take the shot."
I couldn't do it.
How could I do it?
katherine:
He said he couldn't take the shot.
"-No, he couldn't."
"-What does that mean, Emerson?"
What do you think it means?
It means that there are no other safety measures.
That David was the safety measure.
Yeah.
Means that you're the safety measure.
And all this time I thought you were protecting me.
I knew you looked at me funny.
"Fair and square, is it not?"
"Look Johnny, my room shouldn't go vacant even for a day."
Your house is like my own!
I wouldn't be able to bear it.
If you were to incur any loss on my account!
May I take one?
Get lost!
Are you a moron?
Rushing to pay the advance when the house isn't even vacant yet!
You haven't understood this city at all.
"Johnny bhai, thank you."
Oye!
What do you think you are doing?
Hey!
I am talking to you!
That is my drawer.
It was my drawer till you stuffed your things in.
Your mother has given me the key.
If my mother gave you the house keys someday..
..would the house be yours too?
I pay my share of the rent every month.
You eat worth much more in a single day!
I will leave your house...
and your drawer as well!
Quit talking about it.
Why don't you actually do it for a change.
I told you not to come here!
What was so important?
You should not trust me so much!
Where else can I keep it?
All the banks are asking for an income proof.
I will come and take it in a couple of weeks.
That was my first job interview ever.
"I mean, I haven't gone anywhere with my life, and this is my second one."
All I have is a fake résumé filled with things that I've never even done.
"I mean, I've never even lived alone."
- How long did you live alone?
- Long enough.
Don't you think that's odd?
My entire life.
My aunts swept in the moment my dad died and you the moment I died.
You're thinking about living here.
Aren't you?
Yeah.
"Well, you hate corduroy and sleighbell slippers."
I'll stop walking in on you doing things you don't want me to know about.
Would never have happened if you wore your slippers.
- It'll be romantic.
- I'm confused.
More.
- More?
- More explanation.
How is it romantic?
You've got a job and now you're moving out?
But I didn't get a job.
I'm undercover Kitty.
"And I'm not moving out, I'm just moving next door."
It's French.
It's very first-class Parisian living.
His-and-her suites and coy midnight knocks on the door to share a lover's boudoir.
- You'll be knocking?
You can knock too.
This was not romantic for the Pie-Maker.
Yay.
Enunciate and energy.
I have nothing to offer you but my love.
"I specifically said ""no geeks."""
But my mom says I'm cool.

I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy.
In this phallocentric society of ours--
"I don't know what ""phallocentric"" means, but no girls!"
So much for Plan B.
"That's it, boy."
You're our last hope.
Ohh.
"I just don't want to be here, Dad."
"Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on."
"Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea... but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns."
You'd just get all of his money someday.
This could provide for your entire future.
- [ Applause ]
- Congratulations.
"You've just graduated from the most expensive and, therefore, best school there is."
And your discovery of the cure for the common cold--
"Hello, Marge."
"Oh, my God, this can't be happening."
[Crying] Next week was our anniversary.
I'm so sorry.
Are you married?
"No, I'm not, and I can't imagine what you're going through."
But everything you tell us can help us find the person who did this to Tony.
"I know this is hard, but I want you to try to remember that when you're talking to Agent Rossi."
Ahem.
"Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and relax."
I want to walk you through an exercise that's going to help you recall everything that happened last night.
"- What, like hypnosis?"
"- No, no, no."
Not at all.
"Now, just close your eyes and do the best that you can, okay?"
All right.
Think about last night.
"You and Tony, you went to the Halloween festival in Greektown."
What time was it?
"[Kiersten] Uh, around 9:30."
[Rossi] Crowded?
- [Muted chattering] - [Muted music]
Yeah.
Uh... there were drums and loud music.
"Uh, some people wore costumes."
Tony and I went to the festival every year.
We actually met there when we were in high school.
But this year we decided not to dress up.
- Boo!
- [Gasps]
What is it?
"A kid dressed in a mask jumped out, scared me."
Made Tony laugh.
Watch for him.
We will.
Thank you.
"I'd wish you luck, but what you'll need is a miracle."
He's more than three hours late.
We have to consider the possibility that he's been arrested.
You mustn't believe what he told you about me.
I don't believe it.
You're not a coward.
I had to keep my little girl safe.
It was just too dangerous to get involved.
Can you understand?
Your mother wouldn't listen.
She wanted to fight.
She was always...so passionate about what she believed in.
She didn't care about the risk.
You were proud of her.
I didn't want to lose her.
I didn't want you to grow up without a mother.
I tried so hard to change her mind and finally she changed mine.
She convinced me to go with her.
I said I would meet her...
by the river.
She was leading a raid against a Mokra supply center.
I said I would meet her... but I didn't...
I couldn't.
I was too afraid.
She was still waiting for me when they arrested her.
I could never tell you about this.
I knew you would hate me.
I couldn't bear that.
"Please, Ralkana, if you can ever forgive me..."
I know.
But thank you.
It's a joy to have you.
Richard Whiteley!
You've ruined my life!
Thanks very much.
"Earlier on I was told to go and break the world caravan speed record, which stands at 128mph."
And I failed.
So I had another go.
"With the window repaired to Aerospace standards, caravan glory is within Lee's grasp."
This time the cross winds have built up.
The caravan starts to fishtail.
Lee keeps his nerve and keeps his foot to the floor.
He hits 125.2mph. That looks great for a new record.
Just 5mph more.
There's plenty of runway left.
"But then, oil and smoke everywhere."
This doesn't look good.
"I'm not an engineer, but I'd say it was mullered."
"I think the piston's gone, or low on fuel,"
I'm not sure.
We can't have another go then?
Not with this car.
There you go.
"BBC Top Gear, the world's anti-caravan organisation defeated by a 20-year-old Abbey GT214."
It's pathetic.
I wonder if James May realises.
We don't tolerate failure on Top Gear.
It's not an option.
Maybe he doesn't know about the tank of piranhas.
He'll be in it if he doesn't get it right.
Right.
Please use it to continue your education.
Your mother would've wanted that too.
Don't worry about the dead men in the bathtub.
It's not what it looks like.
And a long story to tell right now.
"Sometimes, for no particular reason,"
I think of you and smile.
"Seriously about that day, that... we drove out to the mall, for your birthday."
"Your mom had the flu, and she said to go on without her."
I remember you wandered off.
Got lost.
"And two hours later, we finally found each other."
We hugged...
You didn't wanna let go.
"Then we went for ice cream, and we talked..."
all the way home.
I think that was the happiest day I've had.
"I know I probably wasn't the best father in the world,"
but I tried the best I could.
Anyway...
I loved you all that I possibly can.
"Love, Dad."""
"""PS:"
"This isn't in my handwriting, because friend of mine wrote it out for me."""
"If you just leave that in the... apartment when you go, make sure to get to her."
Glad you girls came by.
I wouldn't have written that otherwise.
Daze...
"We gotta go now, Daze."
"We never even said his name, Vi."
Come on.
The bike is gone.
- You've always despised the Wu-tang.
And you're afraid that someday we'll overtake you.
You...
So you used your medicine to poison my master.
Nonsense!
You're scared that our power will surpass yours.
"Nonsense, don't flatter yourself."
Our Wu-tang...
Someone is trying to pin the blame on us.
Then where did His Highness get your medicine?
Where is your proof that the medicine is ours?
His Highness said so.
His Highness?
Then why did he lock you up with the crazy women?
Because I'm guilty of killing my master.
Your master threw himself onto your sword.
And now His Highness wants to learn your secrets.
I won't tell him!
Master told me before he died not to let the Tartars have the secrets of Wu-tang.
The Shaolin would never reveal our secrets either.
"You want to see the Wu-tang destroyed, hence your trickery."
Brother!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Mr. Chao!
Mr. Hong!
"Fung-wu, even if we were to learn your 8-divine sword, she already knows Chin Kang Fist."
Chin Kang Fist?
"Jun-kit, you taught her the Chin Kang Fist to help me, but you still haven't taught me."
You haven't learned it?
Did you teach him?
- I!
I don't know why he's missing but he's alive for sure.
The Commander told me to report his death... so I could save my family Prince Daeso was holding hostage.
My family is safe now.
I'll go to Jolbon sometime soon and serve the Commander.
I'll think of a way to get you out.
Please look after yourself.
Hope you had a nice trip.
Have a seat.
I received your letter but I still can't believe it.
Is Jumong really dead?
He is.
What a pity.
I wanted to kill him myself.
Once I take overJolbon...
I'll offer his head to the Emperor and win back his trust.
Do whatever you want.
Thanks.
"The ministers wanted to attack Jolbon without your help... but instead, I shared a secret."
"Since we're in it together, you must do something for me."
What is it?
Feed my soldiers during the entire war.
You can't expect us to feed them all.
"Prince Daeso killed Jumong, which weakened Jolbon."
It's your turn to do something.
The war will be short and you won't lose any men.
You have nothing to lose.
Very well.
We'll provide your provisions.
Governor.
What is it?
Mr. Hwang is here.
Who's Mr. Hwang?
I want her!
I want her in my life.
She is amazing.
She's not that amazing.
"Hey, help me analyze this."
"We've been out a couple times, but when I call her, she just texts me back."
"And short ones, like, ""Hey, Everett."""
"I mean, you know her really well."
Does that mean she's brushing me off?
"Hmm, what to say, what to say."
"If you ever get the opportunity to talk me up, you know, if the subject of Nobel Prizes comes up, maybe you could drop something about my nomination."
"Listen, I hear you, okay?"
But I don't think I should get involved in this.
"I really admire you, and it doesn't feel right..."
Have you ever separated twins in the womb?
No.
- Would you like to?
- Would I like to?
"I mean, it would be the opportunity of a lifetime."
Are you bribing me?
"12-hour surgery, right by my side."
"Afterwards, an interview with CNN's Sanjay Gupta."
Fine.
I'll do it.
But just so you know...
This is very wrong.
Great!
"Listen, I need you to help me compose a funny tweet to Riley."
"I want it to be clever, but not like I'm trying too hard."
Okay.
You're a horrible person.
You're a horrible person.
You always were the one to show me how.
"Back then, I couldn't do the things that i can do now."
This thing is slowly take me apart.
"Grey would be the color, if i had a heart."
Come on tell me.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just one thing,"
I'm starting to scare myself.
"You make this all go away, you make it all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
I can never have...
I can...
"Whoever threw that, fuck you Allright ?"
In this place it seems like such a same.
"Though it all looks different now,"
I know it's still the same.
Everywhere i look you're all i see.
Just a fading fucking reminder of... who i used to be.
Come on tell me.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just one thing,"
I'm starting to scare myself.
"You make this all go away, you make it all go away."
I just want something...

"Mrs. Quick, no!"
"Mrs. Quick, we've got to get you out of here."
"Now don't get too upset, okay?"
There's got to be a simple explanation.
"It's a bee sting, isn't it?"
Okay.
"I thought I heard buzzing earlier, but I attributed it to my tinnitus."
P.A. ANNOUNCER:
"The next dance is for our King and Queen nominees, and then it's time for everyone to vote."
"Mrs. Quick, don't panic, okay?"
We're going to rush you to the hospital.
The doctors are going to take care of you.
Everything will be fine.
I just need one minute.
Got him.
I knew he couldn't resist that thumbnail- sized Toblerone.
Thank goodness.
Zap him back so we can go home.
Right.
But first a little good-natured torture.
Hilda.
Where am I?
Um... we found you wandering out in the street.
I-I think you may have hit your head.
Do you feel all right?
Do you perhaps feel like you now understand what it's like to be the little guy in constant fear of unfeeling giants?
No.
I feel strong.
"In fact,"
I feel like I could withstand a nuclear holocaust.
I suppose this means you're going to go ahead and build your Everything Emporium now.
What?
I put you a cold plate on ice.
I'm gonna try to keep blanche out until the party breaks up...
-...because I don't know how she'II take it.
-Isn't that just dandy?
So you'd better give me some money.
"Hey, where is she now?"
She's soaking in a hot tub to quiet her nerves.
She's terribly upset.
Over what?
She's been through such an ordeal.
We lost belle Reve.
"What, the place in the country?"
"-well, how?"
-It had to be sacrificed or something.
"Honey, look."
"When she comes in, be sure and say something nice about her appearance."
"And, oh, don't mention the baby."
I haven't said anything yet.
I'm waiting until she gets in a quieter condition.
-Try to understand her and be nice to her.
-AII right.
She wasn't expecting to find us in such a place.
-AII right.
-I tried to gloss things over a little in my letters.
Admire her dress.
tell her she's looking wonderful.
It's important to blanche.
Her little weakness.
"Okay, honey, I get the idea, but...."
"Now, Iet's just skip back a little, the way you said the place was disposed of."
"Oh, yeah."
"well, how about a few more details on that subject?"
"Yeah, Molly's mom gave it to me."
"I know, it's a sweet deal."
"Sure, come on over."
"Ladder's around back, and I'll try and save you some pie."
Would you girls knock it off?
It's your squabbling that kept me a single mother all those years.
"Oh, don't play that card."
You've had more boyfriends than she's had.
Are you calling me a slut?
Are you calling me a slut?
"Just stay away from my fiancé, and yes, I am!"
I think all the idiots in the world should send us chocolates and liquor baskets.
I just want to touch things.
Why?
We immortalize their stupidity.
You guys stink worse than my diapers!
Like the agro chick who went ballistic over a parking spot.
Get off of me!
And the campaign manager who was nothing to sneeze at.
[Sneezes]
- Electrodes.
- We got a bad guy who shocked the world...
[Groans]
"A news reporter who tried to mail it in, a campfire sing-a-long that was too much to swallow..."
[Coughs]
And finally...
I created the Wall of Sound.
"A mean, old record producer who made one last hit."
"♪ Help, I've fallen, and I can't get up ♪"
They're singing our song.
[Crying and screaming]
You...think you'll be okay by yourself?
You were in a big accident today...
And your situation isn't normal either.
I'm sure you've been really shocked...
You really think you'll be okay to stay by yourself?
You seem to want to stay here by pretending to care for me...
But forget it.
Leave.
I'll make sure to get lots of sleep for you.
All he has is frozen food and carbonated drinks.
I wonder if he only eats food like this?
His build is really large.
Too big!
I don't have to go to school.
Yes...!
Oops.
I see she brought everything over for her precious body.
'Please treat it preciously'.
I won't eat it!
"You're in there, right?"
Right?
Are you really cold?
Your hand is very warm!
It must be because I was holding the coffee with that hand.
They say the temperature of the hand is the same as the temperature of the heart.
I think your hand is this warm because your heart is so warm!
I bet you're the only one who has hands this warm.
So warm.
The person who has hands this warm in this world...
There was just one person.
And here they are.
Da Ran just came home.
- Yeah.
Don't you think?
"I mean, honestly, are you ever angry at him?"
No.
Really?
You're not angry at him?
"Well, I did get angry sometimes, but not... but just..."
I just felt...
I don't know.
"Kind of a tragedy that he didn't work it out, isn't it?"
"You know, it seems almost too much he was on the way home to maybe come live with us."
- Yes.
- Who knows?
- You still believe that?
- I do believe it.
Do you think he crossed off his passport on his way home to...
to show something?
"Yes, to indicate... yes."
Why else would he have done it?
Why else would he have done that?
Can you give me an explanation?
It's a good myth to have.
I don't think it's a myth.
I don't think it's a myth at all.
"I mean, I have very strong conviction about that, because I know what... what Lou said to me, you know, when we... when we parted."
What did he say?
He said he would do it.
"I mean, he said..."
I said that I can't...
"I can't bear it any longer, and you have to... you have to do something, and you have to live with us."
And he said he would.
- Really?
- Me!
Oh.
"Okay, I'm heading out there."
"If you need anything, if there's a crisis, if you have a question-"
"Jack, you're 1 1 feet away."
Don't worry.
I can handle these animals.
- That's what she thinks.
- I heard that!
[ Laughing ] Girl is like a flipping bat.
"- Now go be pretty, okay?"
- Okay.
"Go, go."
"We're fine, really."
[ Sighs ] Waste of time.
Let's get this over with quickly.
- Where do I start?
"- Actually, table eight just sent compliments to the chef."
- [ No Audible Dialogue ]
- Gotta do what I gotta do.
Everyone enjoying themselves tonight?
[Jack Narrating ] Every chef will tell you that he feels out of place... ifhe's not sweating over a hot stove.
But the truth is you can get used to the sweet life out front pretty damn quickly.
I just always had this real need to please people with food.
"I just think it's, like, uh, a gift that I have, as God made me."
"Hey, uh, if your father calls... tell him that I'm working the floor like he asked, okay?"
"-Yeah, you're really taking one for the team."
"-Actually, I'm shooting for two."
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
"No, I'm not."
This table needs a complimentary everything.
I'm unholdable.
It was just too scary.
"Like you're a Bruce Willis movie, Unholdable."
This is...
I think it's terrific.
Try and get as close to my hands as you can without touching them.
- It's so good.
- But this is my favorite.
- This is one of my favorite moments.
- We did a lot of versions of this.
- What's that?
What?
- This.
Look at us go.
I don't remember any of this.
It's one of the few times in the movie where you were improvising.
- And I...
"- Yeah, I guess so."
I don't think you know where it's going.
"Usually, when you improvise, you have a sense of where you're gonna land."
Yeah.
"But in this case you didn't, and I think that the way you were feeling that really makes that special."
"It makes it what it is, because it's so in the moment."
And it's really cute.
I'm not gonna lie.
Baruchel.
Slow down the sexy bus.
It was really fun.
It was good having Jay around.
I would like to...
I would like to also tell people that Jay didn't smoke cigarettes this day and put candy in his mouth because I'm not a smoker.
And it was very sweet of him.
"- um, i know, but..."
i kind of have to.
thi-- this is like the whole check.
- yeah.
"let me take -  no. no, uncle bob."
i... [sighs] i need to take care of us.
- all right.
you endorse it right here and sign it right to the dwp.
"- well, i guess that's why the power didn't get turned off last month."
[chuckles weakly] hey.
"- i'm proud of you, champ."
you're becoming quite the little man.
"uh, i-i mean big man."
"- thanks, uncle bob."
- all right.
let's get out of here.
it's christmas eve.
- so that how the electric bill was paid last month.
"- cindy, where did you come from?"
- i was just here.
i was shopping around.
so why'd you -- uh... why'd you get a job?
[chuckles]
"- i mean, the bills had to get paid somehow."
"- well, you shouldn't have to worry about that."
"- well, what's good having a big-screen tv if you can't watch it?"
- come here. [sighs] all right.
"i'm -- uh, i have to go now, so [sighs]"
- phew.
i thought for a second that maybe you actually cared about somebody other than yourself.
"- where are you going, mama?"
- [scoffs] i made a promise to someone that i-i want to keep.
Okay.
"Oh, Dad's here."
I gotta go.
"I love you, Mommy."
[Karen] I love you too.
- Hey.
- You set to go?
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.
"You can call the Romans a lot of things, but stupid isn't one of them."
"Okay, well, not really stupid, but, all right, they built roads, and they had a million armies, but all they did was enslave and conquer people."
- What about their system of law?
"- Oh, great."
"They introduced law to barbarians, but how did the barbarians feel about that?"
"All their art was copied from the Greeks, all their philosophies were stolen from the Greeks."
The gods were stolen from the Greeks.
They just gave them different names.
Think of one thing that they did that was original.
They didn't even invent Christianity.
"If I was a Roman, I would be so ashamed of myself, I couldn't show my face in the Coliseum."
[Lily] Pasta's ready!
"Eli, you have to save me from Dad!"
I'll set the table.
Don't worry.
"Thank you, Jessie."
"We're gonna get through this, whatever happens."
"Rick, whatever happens."
Did she actually cook for us?
That's pretty cool.
- [knock on door] - l got it.
Cook County Sheriff's Department.
We have a warrant to search.
I knew that I belonged... someplace.
"You know what I mean, Tillie?"
I don't think that...
I don't think there's anything in the world that's more important than that.
- Hey!
What are you doing that for?
- Because I care about you.
Put that down.
You can't make it dragging me.
- You look like a jerk.
- You know me.
I'll do what I say.
"What is this, your mother talking to you or something?"
My mother's dead and we're here.
You'll never make it if you have to take me.
You don't want me anyway.
Is that what you think?
"If you think that, then just do it."
What the hell.
Don't try to rattle me.
"Your father gave me 20 bucks to keep you from running, but if you wanna do that, that's fine."
Blow your guts out all over the mountain.
See if I care.
"Tillie, don't move!"
I won't get any further alone.
"If you hadn't been with me, I wouldn't have got this far."
I would've sat down on that first night by the fire and waited for the snow to cover me over.
Tillie...
I don't wanna go back there without you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Edgar.
Vanderbilt is a sporting gentleman.
I'll bet right now he'd be willing to settle for half of those millions of his you got tucked away in that safe.
That's a righteous thought!
I ain't greedy.

I'll give you a guard to keep you here.

What good is $10 million if i can't see josie's show open next week?
"Oh, josie will be all right."
"Besides, a trip to europe wouldn't do us any harm."
There'd be plenty of girls over there glad to see us.
Yeah.
And there'll be plenty of fellas in new york glad to see josie.
And i'm not turning my preferred stock over to anybody-you know that.
"Very clever, very careful, and then...a bomb hit the building where he was working and everyone was killed."
We thought...
But he wasn't dead.
He was buried in the rubble under a stairwell.
"He survived, you see... for three days in the dark until they dug him out."
"And there was a girl in there, too."
But she was dead.
- They were trapped.
- For three days?
We sent him to a psychiatrist... because he was...different afterwards.
Still good at his job...
"almost too good, but different."
I often feared what might have happened down there.
"But the psychiatrist said he was fit to work and I needed him, so..."
Where is he now?
(Sighs)
There was a fire.
We found his body.
"His signet ring, his keys."
"No face, of course."
"I chose not to pursue it, not to question it."
I was almost relieved when I heard.
I'll let you have all the paperwork I've got on him.
"There's not much, I'm afraid."
There's been some sort of accident.

But we didn't even pass go.
"But from what you've told me, you've gone far enough."
Why did you drop all your work to go see her?
You even asked me to play badminton to exercise.
Right?
I was sick.
So I went to see a doctor.
I exercised to get better.
You did it so she would give you props.
You did it for her.
You wanted her to see you doing good things.

It's over.
I got mine.
"Of course, tomorrow you'll have to make up the deliveries you missed today and do your regular route."
Oh.

You guys have a good time.
I'm gonna curl up in an afghan and slowly cry myself into a nap.
"No, no."
Uh-uh.
You are going to leave this house and enjoy the day with your family.
I can't.

"Frank, I'm your biggest cheerleader, but it's been three weeks and Bob Pogo has not called yet."

All right.
So.
How was your trip?
"Not easy, as you can imagine."

"It was supposed to be sedated, but it was awake."

"Check on the, uh, Thanksgiving."
Just leave it.

"Why, you're scared to death thinking that your husband is in some way mixed up with Lita Krail or even--"
I don't know anything about it!
"So please just get out, Perry."
We-- we don't need you.
Please just get out.
"[door opens, closes]"
Any luck yet on the guy with the strawberries?
"No, not so far."
I'm checking out the license number
- and my men are checking the markets.
- What about the necktie?
"Well, there was a cleaning tab on the label and we're running it down as fast as we can."
I gave my men a head start before I reported what I had to the police.
"All right, Paul."
I want one of your men to watch that house.
- Don't leave till he gets here.
- All right.
"Oh, you heard about the Lita Krail thing."
"Shocking, isn't it?"
Very shocking.
Such a pretty creature.
"How did you hear about it, Mr. Banks?"
"Oh, the police just called a few moments ago."

"I wasn't in town when Jess Devro died last year, Mr. Banks."

"Best friend, you know?"

"It happened here in the office, didn't it?"
"He was alone, working late."
–Okay.
"If someone were trying to keep her alive, how long could she survive?"
"With a tourniquet and basic medical knowledge, indefinitely."

I'd rather it stay that way.
I'm happy to help you if you're helping me.
–Are you?
–I have been.
But I'm just about through.
I guess I'll have to figure this out on my own.
What the hell was that all about?
Nothing.
Why didn't you just leave it here and call 911?
–This dog was sniffing around it.
–So?
It's a bone.
The arm probably fell out of the Dumpster when the truck picked it up.
Call city services.
Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.
The rest of her might still be in that truck.
Come on.
- Get your hands off of me!
- Come on.
- No.
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me!
I'm going.
I'm going.

- My coworker had it.
Sorry about that.
Now... you know I can't be letting a ten-year-old boy go unsupervised like you've been doing.
"And trust me, a 13-year-old kid on probation is not our idea of a good caretaker."
Now...
The judge has allowed you to keep Jacob.
"But you've got to go to the court-appointed counselor once a week, make every single court date..."
And stop drinking.
We'll give it a month and revisit the situation.
You're just lucky that
Judge Bradley's a big baseball fan.
Said he went to all your games.
"Look, I know that you and your family have been through a hard time."
And seems to me that you could use a little help.
"So you look to me and your sister-in-law, because we're just trying to help you out."
You understand?
Hollis?
- This is just temporary.
You know that.
"It's not like last time, okay?"
"If anyone deserves tonight's Grocey, it's you."
"Oh, thank you, honey, but it's really no big deal."
You don't mean that.
Do you?
"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews."
Is Cory home yet?
Nope.
"But soon, though."
I know.
"According to tape 56, he should be home tonight."
Late tonight.
So is it okay if we wait?
"Well, actually, we were on our way out."
"That's okay, it's okay."
I'm just going to take a hot bath.
What?
There's seepage at the trailer park.
"Shawn, I'd prefer that my son's friends didn't bathe in my home when I wasn't here."
Or ever.
"Still in a bad mood, huh, Mr. M?"
What bad mood?
"Well, me and my dad noticed it when we were last at the market."
"You know, we were eating our free samples, like we always do..."
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sticking your own toothpicks in our turkey and steak does not make them free samples.
Fine!
We'll just take our business elsewhere.
"Now, Mr. Eric from the city, uh,"
"I'm flattered and everything, but why would a guy who's traveled back and forth across the state line be so keen on chatting up a small-town girl like me?"
She's a killer.
Yeah.
Garthe?
No.
"No, name's Michael."
Does that surprise you?
"Uh, no, no."
"It's, uh, just that you look so much like somebody I-I know."
"Uh, place your bet."
"Hi, Rita, name's Michael Knight."
Devon Miles from The Foundation sent me.
I said not to send anybody here.
I can't talk here.
"Okay, where?"
"Uh, I get off at midnight."
"Okay, thank you."
"And so I did everything the magazines say a wealthy, attractive divorcee does."
And more.
"Thank you, Roger."
That will be all tonight.
"Although I don't suppose there was anything that would unduly shock a man, who appreciates life as much as you do."
And I gave up being shocked years ago.
I must tell you that I'm having a wonderful time.
"In spite of a nagging suspicion that somewhere, you have an ulterior motive hidden between the entree and dessert."
"No, no, no, no, no."
No ulterior motives.
"No, I gave that up long ago."
"When I want something from a man, he knows it."
"Devon, would you be a dear and open a window?"
"It's a bit stuffy in here, don't you think?"
"Yes, of course."
I was gonna be a singer and Ron played piano.
"- If he keeps giving us hundred dollars bills,"
- he can have all the vanilla milkshake he want!
- Ow!
I just don't understand why we have to do any of this.
"Well, if you want him to sign off, these are his terms."
"Yes, but it makes no sense."
It's not like she's asking him for anything.
"Sit down, love."
"So, Callie, we heard back from Robert Quinn's lawyer."
- Ok.
"- And he won't sign anything until there's a DNA test, to prove that you're his daughter."
So...
I seriously can't handle sharing the gym with the wrestlers anymore.
- The gym smells like feet.
"- Well, that's appetizing."
And all the boys ever do is stare at us.
Pervs.
"Well, it's not awesome for me either, hearing guys talk about how hot my sister is."
- Which guys?
"- Besides, I see the dance team checking us out too."
"That Hayley girl, can't take her eyes off me."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Hayley, the one with the college boyfriend Hayley?"
She dates boys in college?
None of the girls on the dance team date boys in high school.
- Oh.
We'll see about that.
- Better not let Emma hear you.
"Please, I can handle Emma."
What?
I pretty sure no one handles Emma but Emma.
"Hey, Brandon!"
Are you saying that this invisibility thing means I might not be able to get beer?
I was just getting used to the idea of having to pay for coffee and bagels and rent.
Rent?
But not being able to get a beer?
Unacceptable.
Excuse me.
Hot girl coming through.
Huh.
"Three beers, please."
♪ Take the...
"Damn it, ring!"
"Oh, yeah, baby."
Mm-hmm.
Later you should totally go out and buy a switchblade.
Mm.
Sure.
"While I'm out, maybe Daddy picks up some diapers and a little mild salsa because we're low."
"Well, you're right--"
I'm invisible.
"That night, the only person in worse shape than Robin was her fiancé."
"Ted, I'm desperate."
"Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff and I got a partial for Marshall."
Did you bang that girl yet?
"Don't get your hopes, or anything else, up."
"I tried to connect with her, but everything just comes back to her weird fetish about how old I am."
"Well, j-just go simple-- does she like TV?"
No.
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you as loud and as long as you want.
Sports?
No.
"But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard, just... slathered in Bengay."
"Well, does she like books?"
"The minute they walk out that door, they walk into a dog-eat-dog world."
"It's crawl in front of the big dogs if you want to eat, get a job."
I won't do it.
I won't do it!
"That's why I'm washing windows, scrubbing walls, emptying ashes."
I never had nothing I ever wanted.
Shakespeare did me no more good than Washington did crossing the Delaware.
You didn't help yourself.
"Elsie, I'd like to have you meet Mike Rossi."
Ms. Thornton.
"- Hello, Ms. Thornton."
- Mr. Rossi.
- Welcome to Peyton Place.
- Thank you.
"This is our utility man, Lucas Cross."
"- Hello, Lucas."
- My hand's too dirty.
I'll start on another room.
Does he always drink?
He's disappointed for me.
Loyalty is always more passionate than reason.
I guess that's why I came to see you first.
There was sentiment for making you principal.
"Please don't feel uncomfortable, Mr. Rossi."
My time came too late.
- I hope we can work together.
- Of course we can.
"I suppose you have a lot of new, progressive ideas."
"No, not really."
"I'm rather old-fashioned, as a matter of fact."
I have just two rules:
"First, I want this school to teach the truth as far as we know it."
"Last time I was up here, it was with some soccer player named Eli."
Is something bothering you?
Am I that obvious?
"The one thing you're not is obvious, Chad."
I got the pages for tomorrow's shoot.
I have three lines.
Three.
I was nominated for a Daytime Emmy and now they're treating me like some day player.
"OK, we've parked at inspiration point so you can bitch about your job?"
- I thought we were friends.
"- I don't know what we are, Chad."
You give me shoes.
You admire my body and...
"You know, I'm sorry."
"Taking a drive to a beautiful location is, regardless of categories, a date."
"Come on, man."
"Driving me all the way up here, you're either gonna hack me into pieces or you're gonna kiss me."
"Well, I'm not a serial killer, so..."
Wait.
Wait.
So you are gay.
"No, man."
But it doesn't mean I don't think you're hot.
Wait.
What about your girlfriend?
She doesn't mind.
I've seen her make out with tons of girls.
"Well, who am I to judge?"
"He shows up for his interview and I swear to you, his face did not move."
- No.
"- No, not an inch."
- Botox?
-What's ridiculous about it?
"Come on, don't jerk me off."
This is me you're talking to.
"You've caused much suffering yourself, haven't you?"
My wife prays to God.
What kind of God does this shit?
How about Carmine Lupertazzi?
Christopher ever talk about a dinner with him and Tony last July?
"What's the matter, Adriana?"
You and Christopher arguing?
"It's a stressful time, right before a wedding."
A lot of guys get cold feet.
"He's fucking stoned on H all the time, Okay?"
"There, you happy?"
We put you guys on the mailing list for Hazelden.
That rehab shit?
That's where all the brochures are coming from?
From you?
"Convince him he needs help, that he should be in rehab."
"Look at you, with that little face."
"These flat screens, I'll tell you, no glare, high definition."
I was watching On the Waterfront down at Sears.
Karl Malden's nose hairs looked like fucking BX cables.
Voice mail again.
"Chrissy, we're down here waiting for the TVs."
Let me ask you something.
"The other day, T with that picture... he looked like he was going to cry."
Still no word from Ralph.
Where the fuck is this kid?
What you want around here?
-Can you do an eighth of scag?
-$500.
Braiding each other's hair and having heart-to-hearts.
Then why are we still here?
we've already paid the check.
Serena.
- So we'll meet afterwards for the party. - will do.
"- Good luck up there, son. i'm proud of you."
- Thanks.
It's like getting a smile from the president.
And how are you?
I'm good. and you?
"Good, good. i start my internship"
At the mayor's office next week.so that's the big news.
As for today i got my mom and my grandpa
To agree to sit together so that's something.
- And things with you and
- Blair?
"Yeah, it's over. but it's okay."
"It turns out,we just had to go through something to be sure."
Ever since it ended i can't stop thinking
About how horribly i handled everything between us.
So i just wanted to say i'm sorry.
Thanks.
It means a lot. and thanks for what you did last year.
If i hadn't taken the s.a.t.s i'd never be going to n.y.u.
Right after i get back from my
"Backpacking trip through europe, of course."
Look at us--so civilized.
Hey stop by my party tonight.
Party?
what party?
After-grad party.
I figured i'd at least do something
"What God has joined together, let no man pull asunder."
What are you doing here?
We were to meet at the hotel.
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.
Weren't you to see your sister before the fight?
"I called her, she'll be at the hotel."
I had to promise we'd have supper at her bar tonight.
Whatever you say.
"A lovely ceremony, isn't it?"
Beautiful.
Ididn't think she was so young.
I guess you came because you didn't trust me.
I came because we can't go another day without talking.
You needn't worry.
It's over with Angela.
I've got proof.
During the ceremony I didn't cry.
But you did.
That's true.
And you needn't.
Don't you believe me?
It isn't that.
"It took me ten years to get over it, but I swear it's over."
Marco...
"Believe me, it's over."
Angela and I traveled a lot.
"The excuse was to write a travel guide on some exotic place, but really it was to keep her away from drugs, to escape from Madrid."
Life in Madrid was hell.
Our relationship only worked when we got away.
"After trying for five years and seven travel guides,"
"I brought her here to Lucena, to her parents."
Time drew it...
This rainbow of desires...
"What happened, uncle?"
Smile once.
"Today, Tony's dream will come true."
He likes to play with me.
Silence heard by the heart.
Doctor told me that I can play now.
He must be very happy.
"Do you have any dreams, uncle?"
It's alright.
What's the fun if each one fulfills his own dream?
The fun lies in fulfilling others' dreams.
Are you the meaning of life?
It's said that God lives in children.
It seems to be true on seeing them.
Each one of them has a disease.
They forget all the sorrows and feel very happy since one of them has defied death.
Some of them will not survive inspite of good medication.
But some will survive.
But there is no money.
Look at him.
He will not survive for more than 4 days.
He too knows that.
But he forgot that  is happy that she has survived  he can play with her.
Who has disease?
We or they?
So many of them?
"If there are so many of them in our orphanage alone, think about the entire city, state  the country."
How many are there?
I need a list of all those children.
We went pillar to post to save one child.
"Good luck, sweetheart."
"We were just messengered the photos from the shooting... including the Polaroids of you and Paul, they are adorable!"
I'm just dissapointed that Paul missed my cue.
I gotta get the guy out of my head.
- I need some mental floss.
"- Sweetie, take a thought shower."
The important is that Editor Chief knows your triumph...
- and put you on staff.
- I guess...
You're going with me to pick up stationery from the colleaguer.
I've got to get this down to the messenger center by 6.
I'm totally going.
I'll just do a quick e-mail and we're off.
"We'll go to ""II Cantenore"" and... and celebrate the end of your life as an intern slash slave."
"Hold on, I got another call waiting..."
"- Cornelia, have you seen Jocelyn?"
- Who is Jocelyn?
Pink!
The beauty is that he got a bony campaign with Calvin Klein...
- She was swallowing everything...
"- I'm sorry, have you seen Jocelyn?"
- The intern?
Absolutely not!
- Thank you.
"Jocelyn, I hear you got to do the Las Vegas shoot... com Roxanne."
Am I green or what?
"Oh, yeah!"
I'm so excited.
I see Resin found herself a new boyfriend.
Get a room!
- What about Paul?
- He's over Sabrina's heels.
what's it really about?
I want to become the person my mother can be proud of...
The person I can be proud of.
"Well, for the record, you made a believer out of me."
"You know, this would make one hell of a story."
"No, no."
I am a private detective.
"No, thanks."
Thank you.
"- Hey, you."
- Hey.
Just came to make sure you were okay.
I get it now.
"By rescuing Amanda, you were saving a part of yourself."
"I guess if you want to have a future, you have to make amends with your past, right?"
And you're off to a flying start.
You want to get something to eat?
"Uh, thanks, but I have to take my mother to dinner."
I told her I needed to clear the air.
I predict a complete success.
You don't know my mother.
But I know you...
And I am always in your corner.
"Am I moving your stuff to my place all alone, or are you gonna help me?"
I'm helping.
I'm packing memories.
You know I actually five pounds lighter than I was in high school?
Do you know that none of your glasses actually match?
I don't even know how a person does that.
"Hey, same haircut, you ask?"
"Same barber, I say."
You must really suffer from the terrifying clarity of your vision.
Thank you.
I do suffer.
Thank you.
Take a look at this screenplay.
I kind of dashed it off.
It's about the New York poet Frank O'Hara.
He had a beautiful nose like a boxer.
"Yeah, I know."
I love his nose.
He got run over by a dune buggy on Fire Island.
"Anyway, I'd like you to think about doing a rewrite on this."
- George has my number.
- Thank you for this opportunity.
I love your work and I can't wait to read this.
Thanks.
Did you have this script made for me?
My name's on the cover.
Now when you give someone a script to read it's kind of standard practice to laser print their name on every page.
I see.
"This is not a big deal, but my name is misspelled."
"There's no ""O"" at the end."
"It's ""Jonathan"", not ""Jonathon""."
"Yeah, man, I don't know."
It's not really important.
But call me tomorrow and it's really great to meet you.
Great to meet you.
"Thank you, Jim Jarmusch."
Do you know Jim Jarmusch?
He's my favorite director of all time.
His films are like poems that come to life.
It's really interesting.
"Hey, Janice."
-You and your boyfriend got me.
-l don't know what you mean.
"Well, I got a hot flash for you."
You don't got dick.
I'm gonna ace the drug test and take the results...
... andshovethemupyour  chicken-hearted boyfriend's ass.
What did Dee Dee's mother want?
"Look, let's talk in the interview room, all right?"
I hope you're not paying attention to what she says.
According to her...
... DeeDeestillhad her cherry.
A stone junkie.
She still thought her daughter ran around in a convent school uniform.
I wish you didn't leave messages at my house.
Connie's worried.
You were down to work.
We tried reaching you.
What are you gonna do?
"More ""rub Mike's nose in it""?"
"""How could Roberts mess up on procedure?"""
-Procedure?
-l got overinvolved with a snitch.
"It's not a hanging offense, is it, guys?"
"Hey, do I need a PBA rep or a lawyer?"
I thought seven years working together counted for something. lt doesn't.
"In her diary, you threaten her life."
"Said you'd kill her if she calls your wife, which we heard her threaten."
KELLY:
Tell us what happened between you two before she died.
What are you saying?
You think I killed her?
"Are you fooling me, Brother Foon?"
"Master, if she bites me, what'll I do then?"
"If you switch her on by your tongue, she won't bit you, right?"
"Master, you are so nice to me."
"I am so nice to you, right?"
Yes.
Brother Yan.
Master.
Come here...
Ask her to stay in this room and don't leave.
"Later, water will come through this hole and aim at your face."
Stuff this pig's tongue into this hole.
Understand?
Yes.
Repeat once please.
Damn it!
"Later, a water-column will flush in through this hole."
"When you are damn wet, you stuff this damn pig's tongue into... this bloody hole."
You should have said in this way.
What a creep!
Let me have a second thought.
When Foon is kissing the pig's tongue which Yan's holding.
I'll be here to kiss Lotus.
"If she accused us,"
Foon will admit all the blames!
"Lotus will slap Foon severely, again and again and I'll go forward and kick him severely too."
"Lotus will lean on my chest, and I'll comfort her."
"I'll make her drunk, then I will..."
Who else can be the King of Brain-truster in this world except me?
No one else!
Why are you carrying luggage?
Moving?
"So, what, you thought you-you'd handle it yourself, threaten him?"
"Well, I did what needed to be done."
I've seen you go off-book...
Not about me.
"This isn't you, Christopher."
"Maybe who you used to be, but this is not who you've become."
"Emotional situation, I get it, but you can't just go running off hotheaded to solve problems, not anymore."
I know.
I know.
You got to think about what it is you want.
You hoping to keep...
Tucker in your life some way?
I don't know.
I know I want what's best for him.
But there's one thing I can do and that's protect them from Darrell.
Then figure out how to do that.
"There's a right way to handle this, Christopher."
Find it.
"What about this financial manager, Simon Delaney?"
(phone ringing and buzzing)
(cell phone beeps)
Okay.
Anything?
"Yeah, here it is."
Simon Delaney.
"Apparently, he's also an officer of three other LLCs connected to Garcia."
Which means three more possible drug-laundering companies.
Is Garcia's name on the title?
"I'll have to find out, but if so..."
We might have enough for an indictment.
Mm-hmm.
There's a Special Agent Pride on the phone for you.
Do you think you have any enemies on the city council?
"Well, there is that rich jerk, Roger Frank, who hates me and wants to destroy me."
"Wait, you don't think he turned the council against me?"
"It did seem weird that you were impeached just days after you were fired, so I called your old company, and it turns out they just signed a new, huge client-- Dustybear Financial."
Guess who owns Dustybear Financial.
Roger Frank?
!
He's behind every bad thing that's happened to me!
"Well, except for Bobby leaving."
"Well, it may be a coincidence, but you know that golf club in Georgia that hired Bobby?"
Guess who their wealthiest member is.
[ Groans ]
Aah!
I like what I'm seeing here.
[ Chuckles ]
You.
You remind me of me at your age.
"I'm gonna call you ""the little lady-killer."""
- [ Clicks tongue ] - [ Chuckles ]
And you seem nice.
And dangerous.
"[ Chuckles ] Play on, playboy."
"And I'm gonna call you ""Prius,"""
because your style is electric.
[ Chuckles ]
"Hear you guys got a little music recital coming up, huh?"
"Let's, uh, check out the playlist."
"""Hot Cross Buns,"""
"uh, Snoozeville."
[ Chuckles ]
"I thought you guys were gonna drop some funky beats, you know?"
Like C+C Music Factory?
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.
Weren't you to see your sister before the fight?
"I called her, she'll be at the hotel."
I had to promise we'd have supper at her bar tonight.
Whatever you say.

- That's true.

- Marco...
"- Believe me, it's over."

"The excuse was to write a travel guide on some exotic place, but really it was to keep her away from drugs, to escape from Madrid."
Life in Madrid was hell.
Our relationship only worked when we got away.
"After trying for five years and seven travel guides,"
"I brought her here to Lucena, to her parents."
They kept her away from drugs and from me.
- You still loved her?
- Yes.
How did it go?
It went over really well.
Ballet is really something out in the country.
Did you dance well?
"Yes, but I wanted you to see it."
Waiter Are you ready for your meal?
"Yes, we are."
Is Father back yet?
Not yet.
I heard something unpleasant about father.
What was it?
During the war he put out an obscure book called
The Literature of the Yoshino Court.
Who told you that?
NMzu-san.
Your NMzu-san?
Yes.
"But even if he put out a book like that, they treat him as if he was a collaborator."
Let's not talk about your father.
"Ah, you came together!"
When did Shinako get here?
She got back today.
"Oh, she must be tired."
Ballet is popular these days.
They must really like it when they see it for the first time.
"But have you made up your mind, Mrs.?"
"It's going to be the studio that you use, so shall we take out those briars and put up a prefab building?"
That would be too much for us.
Leave it all to me.
I'll make a two story concrete building and put in some big windows.
"If we're going to put something up, we'll build it ourselves."
Be serious!
"""Care""?"
He looks like a cross between my childhood Saint Bernards and a Cuban eeyore.
He even bailed on teaching Stan's music class this week.
Andy teaches music?
He used to shake maracas in his stand-up act to punctuate any joke that didn't work.
He shook them quite a lot.
"Okay, look, buddy, so, you lost Bobby, and you lost your job, okay, but you're still the mayor of Gulfhaven."
No one can take that away.
[ Cellphone rings ]
[ Beep ]
This is Mayor Torres.
"What do you mean, ""Former Mayor Torres""?"
I see.
[ Thud ]
"Remember how I always thought you were crazy for how you loved Travis so much, you wanted to shrink down and live inside his blood?"
I am so sorry.
I totally get that now!
I'm so glad.
"You know, sometimes I still sneak in Travis' room and watch him sleep."
Travis and I live together.
I've said too much.
Can you believe my boss almost tossed out these old aprons?
"Luckily, I rescued them for us to use."
- For what?
- We could swaddle little baby Bobby with them.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ] Okay.
Trav is so resourceful.
It's basically one step above dumpster diving.
Exactly-- a step above.
That's even better.
"Jules, it reminds me of..."
LAUGHTER
"Ellie, what do you get jealous of?"
"I think I get quite jealous, like, if I hear my husband on the phone to another woman and just hear her being like, ""Press 4 for customer service""."
LAUGHTER
Whore!
LAUGHTER
What do you guys get jealous of?
I get career jealous.
Mm.
Career jealousy.
"Yeah, I get jealous of North Korea."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
Is that the nice one?
I think so.
You get jealous of people's careers?
Yeah.
I found that one of the highest-paid actresses in England is the Witch of Wookey Hole.
The kids' show?
"No, she's actually in Wookey Hole, which is a cave, and she just pops out at people and she's just a witch."
LAUGHTER
"And that's a proper job that she's on, like, 40 grand a year for that."
"Sorry, you're jealous of a witch that lives in a cave?"
LAUGHTER
"I mean all right, I think we can probably get you that."
"The bar's pretty low, Jimmy."
"David, do you ever do anything..."
Have you ever made anyone very jealous?
Ugh.
"Well, my friend Mike and I, he lives near a cafe where I drink very strong coffee, and I go to his house and do shits sometimes."
And...
LAUGHTER
"This isn't about you, Gary."
"Jesus, nothing here is ever about you."
"I didn't hear any of this 'cause I have a really bad case of tinnitus, especially when discussing morally dubious things."
So it's kind of like sinnitus.
But I'm implicated.
I'm the linchpin.
- I could go to jail!
- Shut up!
"No, you shut up."
You shut up.
And I will also shut up first.
Sue!
"Sue, I need to see the president."
"She's in with the joint chiefs, Gary."
Is it that important?
"Listen, Sue, I'm involved with some stuff here."
Scary stuff like take it to your grave kind of stuff.
And that's the... that's the way I like it.
"Okay, well, she'll be out in five."
Can it wait?
"Yeah, no problem."
No problem.
What if he checks our cover story?
"Like, what if he informs Congress?"
"Dan, he's a congressman."
Congressmen never do anything they say they're gonna do.
How are you not freaking out about this?
I'm kind of having fun.
I like having a cover story.
Makes me feel like a Charlie's Angel.
"God, it was a rush!"
"Yeah, but you're a control freak and this whole thing is out of control, so why aren't you freaking?"
Mom finding out now will destroy her.
You're in a relationship with Holly.
How long can that last if this whole thing blows up?
"We all have things at stake, Sarah."
If it's out in the open we have a chance to diffuse it.
"Saul, Rebecca's lived in this city most of her life."
It hasn't affected any of us.
Justin and Kitty don't know she exists.
That's another thing.
Justin's out of rehab.
Are we going to throw this at him?
Right.
If your mother found out we were keeping this from her...
- We've been keeping it from her.
- Before Rebecca moved back home.
Our chances of keeping this a secret from her are...
Nobody will find out if we don't tell them.
Holly's lied to Rebecca her whole life.
I don't think she's going to risk telling her now.
Come on.
Haven't we learned anything this year?
"- Tommy, you're with us, right?"
- Yeah.
Good.
Apparently you've all made up your minds.
It's settled then.
He had this one lone hair.
Like this Fu Manchu thing.
And he had this little fuzz on his upper lip.
He was so proud of it.
You're kidding.
And he called it a mustache?
"Well, you see, the thing is..."
I've got to go to prison.
"-No, seriously."
-I'm being serious.
"God, you think I'd make jokes about a thing like this?"
I'm out of my head with worry.
"Look, we're none of us perfect, okay?"
And I won't bore you with all the financial irregularities.
I knew it was wrong what I was doing.
Just thought I'd get away with it.
My mistake.
"They're coming down so hard now, the regulating bodies, on any kind of fraud."
"Fraud, my God!"
Phillipa.
"So, what are you saying?"
You're being taken to court?
I've been to court.
I've been found guilty.
I go back tomorrow morning for sentencing.
My lawyer reckons twelve months.
Nine if I'm lucky.
"I mean, I'll cope."
I've got to cope.
It's Stephen and Julie.
They've both taken it very badly.
I can imagine.
He'll be like a fish out of water without me around.
And she's just at that age where the hormones are all exploding and she's confused about boys.
"I mean, she desperately needs a woman there... with a wise head on her shoulders."
Who can steer her through the quagmire of sexual relations.
I'll bet.
Oh!
Aren't you just a peach?
There you go.
Where is he?
Tick-tick-tick.
How about we just cut the cop to psychopath chitchat and you tell me what you want?
I want my bombs back.
The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery?
Your friend is dead.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened to me.
A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now.
"The next thing I know, it's what, 2012?"
And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb.
"Tell me how that's possible, and I'll tell you anything you want to know."
Hey.
"Hey, don't walk away from me."
All right.
Stay here and talk to him.
About what?
About what happened.
I don't know what happened.
"You have, like, 50 theories."
Just pick one.
"""Emerson Hauser."""
This was his case.
I think it's a quantum thing.
Imagine a water bug on the surface of a pond.
And he sees this twig sticking out of the water.
"When it rains, the water level rises."
"He thinks the twig is moving, when, in reality, the one dimension he's capable of perceiving is moving."
Not the twig.
"You don't know what happened, do you?"
Right.
"Well, now, the way I got it figured... the girl probably"
Feels a lot of unconscious hostility
Toward that brother of hers.
"I mean, after all, he's the one having a good time."
And she's been shackled with her mom in the funny farm.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
It's not enough to kill her own brother.
"Ah, maybe yes, when you consider"
That now she's the only one that stands to
Inherit the whole Ramsey estate.
"Otis, I think you're the one that's crazy."
Maybe I am for listening to you.
It just doesn't make any sense.
"Well, anyway."
Wait a minute.
What about that Hester woman?
"I mean, hell, she's the one that's got all the money."
And she's still alive.
Yeah she sure is.
Hester is still alive.
And she's got no kinfolk.
Except that Audrey girl.
You know something?
"Maybe we ought to go after her, talk to Hester Ramsey."
Might give us some background information.
My god.
"That college education wasn't a total waste, was it?"
Why don't you give her a ring?
"Hell, I've been dying to see the inside of that house"
Ever since I was a kid and used to steal
"Well, we had a nice, long talk"
"- this afternoon, didn't we?"
- Yeah.
"Oh, my God, this is an intervention!"
"Yeah, you could kind of call it that."
"Listen, Gray, you're meant for more than sitting around answering trivia questions about history."
"Me, you, Firestorm."
We're made for changing history.
- This is my life.
- And your life will be waiting for you when you get back.
You really want me to do this?
"I could never forgive myself if I kept you from it, my husband the superhero."
Why are you looking at me like that?
Wasn't sure you'd make it.
"You left me a message, I came."
What of it?
I just wanted to talk.
"You and I, we've done a lot of thieving, a lot of cool stuff, a lot of fun."
"Anyway, I, uh..."
I just wanted to make sure
I said something important that wasn't left unsaid.
"Mick, I don't do touchy-feely."
"If you got something to say, say it."
This wasn't a good idea.
You're the best guy I ever knew.
"You may not think you're a hero, but you're a hero to me."
You got that?
"Yeah, I got it."
See you around.
You okay?
Fine.
- So did you tell him?
"- He died, Dad."
"Well, he should have spoke up!"
Squeaky wheel!
You're my squeaky wheel.
And you were magnificent.
Sometimes a man's got to do what a man does.
And a man feeds his family!
I'm taking you all to dinner!
- Yeah!
- All right!
"Frank, a restaurant?"
Isn't that a little extravagant right now?
"Oh, we're fine, Sue."
"This might be the adrenaline shot to the heart speaking, but I feel great again!"
"- Ooh, can we eat there?"
"- No, that's a titty bar now, Bill."
Your old man is gonna take you to the fanciest place in town.
"And so, you know, I had nothing better to do,"
"TV was on the fritz, so I figured, yeah, why not?"
I might as well get married.
It's funny when you pretend you hate each other.
Tell us the real story.
- It was such a lovely summer day...
- I'll take this whenever you're ready.
- Thank you.
- Your father looked so handsome.
"Grampa Joe walked me down the aisle and I wore my mother's dress, little Cindy was the flower girl, Monsignor Kreger married us."
- Who?
- He's Father Pat's father.
Long story.
And of course I didn't know then that you three angels were coming.
But I looked at your father
I will threaten to go to the cops.
"She'll lose her license, her business, maybe does some time."
Or she signs the farm over to me.
"If Audrey signs the farm over to you, the other grandchildren will all have grounds for suit once the value of the land is discovered."
We'll fight them.
And you'd be tied up in legal battles for years.
"Legally, the better play would be to sign the quick claim over to the only surviving child."
- What?
- Your mother.
Maybe we can make a deal with her.
"Although shit, no."
[sigh] Julia told me she's somewhere on the West Coast.
No.
She's not.
She's here in Bridgeport.
She came back a few years ago.
She's just never contacted anybody.
I think she's just waiting for Otto and Audrey to... to die.
"Well, call her up."
I...
She doesn't have a phone.
I...
"If it's a long story, then let's go see her."
I don't know where she is.
"I have to look for her, okay?"
Okay.
Call me when you've found her.
Cheers for the drink.
That went well.
We didn't have time to prep for a rollover.
What did you always tell me?
Work the problem.
Not one of us.
"Lawford, let me see him."
Lieutenant Sharpe.
Don't be stupid.
"Lieutenant Sharpe, sir."
"Where did you get the uniform, Sharpe?"
"Major Hogan, sir."
"What's that, Sharpe?"
"- It's a shilling, sir."
"- The king's shilling, Sharpe."
Our last shilling.
"London's late, the army's broke, and we owe the lads two months' wages."
"Next week, it'll be three."
Bad for the morale.
And more of our Spanish irregular support will melt away without cash.
- What do you do when you're short of cash?
"- Do without, sir."
"You borrow, Richard."
From a bank.
Our banker is Nathan Rothschild of London.
Nathan's brother James runs a banking service from Viennna to Lisbon under Boney's nose
"Ten weeks ago,"
James set out from Vienna with the bank draft.
"He was to travel across France, across the Pyrénées, and into Spain and make a rendezvous at a place called Casa Antigua."
James Rothschild never turned up.
- But...
- Don't!
Don't tell me James is a banker travelling across a country at war.
James is no clerk.
He's done this before.
"We know he got safely to Torrecastro, and from there headed south and is somewhere in these mountains."
So we're going to send out a search party led by...
We're under attack!
Fight!
(Buwiyum's hideout in Eupru)
Follow me.
You come this way.
Sail south for hundreds of miles?
It's the only way to get food to survive the embargo.
I thank you for saving my life but I can't go on a suicide mission.
No one sets sail now because of the wind.
"(Buwiyum, pirate captain) We'll die before we reach the south."
I know it'll be difficult... but you've sailed the sea for decades.
I risked my life to come here.
Jolbon will collapse if I return with nothing.
I can't let them down when all they want is to fight the Han.
Help me.
Very well.
"I'll sail south as you want, but... make me an offer we can't refuse."
We have to do whatever we can to convince him.
He knows the situation we're in.
He won't go for just anything.
What more does he want from us?
It's hard to say.
He holds the key to the deal.
Take it away.
Your Highness.
If the King won't let me go...
I'll join Jumong in death.
He'll let you and Yuri go if I die.
Your Highness.
Your Majesty.
You must stop Lady Yuhwa.
She hasn't eaten for days.
Our whole fucking lives.
- Tito:
"Okay, good night."
- Eddie:
Good night.
Show me the safe.
- I take the money every afternoon--
- Show me the safe or I'll shoot.
- I don't have a safe.
- Show me the safe!
"Don't shoot me, because it's gonna be worse for you."
- Show me the fucking safe!
- The rest of your fucking life...
See here?
The bullet shattered your father's vertebrae right there.
It severed the spinal cord.
And my guess... is that the gun was fired at close range.
- He's lucky to be alive.
- So...?
He'll never walk again.
He's paralyzed from the waist down.
Viejo?
Viejo?
Soy yo.
"Soy yo, Carlos."
"When you're working in a bodega, there's this unwritten rule that when some crazy motheftucker walks into the store to rob you, you treat him like he's king,"
like he has God-given permission to own that fucking bodega.
"You chill and you smile and you hand him the money, then you throw in a pack of Camels, for the road, on the house."
- What are you saying?
- I'll bet you that the old man-- talked trash with the asshole who shot him.
"- Baby, that guy was a nutcase!"
"- He never saw the safe, babe."
"You play my wife, you bastard, I'll kill you and all of you..."
Do you have permission to have this Noid mutated?
Delicious breast milk for your cookies!
"It's no noid, it's Sara."
"Do not waste it, I'm too old for the way I like it."
- I know where the rebel Noids are.
- Where are they!
"I traded with them, thinking I would trade enough."
Trade with fugitive humanoids?
Maybe you get only 30 years.
"And old Sara, she should be more than happy to return to the local palaces of pleasure."
"""And give milk... for cookies!"""
- It's okay!
I'll help you!
We have to wait for them at the meeting place.
They always arrive at eight.
There are only a few kilometers.
"Okay, biscuit."
Daddy's here now.
Is Dad.
I will protect you.
"Have you no manners, son of a bitch?"
- Do you have any more weapons?
- Pissing ice balls on the icebergs?
"This is all my team, long before your time."
"Sergeant Ulysses H. Cage, Spartan-3."
Retired after 30 years of service in the field.
Be my butt.
The Spartans do not retreat.
They die like a hero.
Or they pee like cowards.
Put this piece of gun away and I'll show you exactly how cowardly I am.
All of my internal organs are women.
"Listen, I have an early surprise birthday present for you."
"- When is your birthday, by the way?"
- In about six months.
Then this is very early.
You know the director Jim Jarmusch...
"Down by Law, Broken Flowers?"
"- Yeah, I love his movies."
"- Well, I saw Jarmusch the other night."
"He has very good hair, just..."
"Anyway, he wants to meet with you, give you a script to read."
- Why does he want me to read?
- He loves your first novel and he wants you to do a revision of one of his screenplays.
You're gonna meet him at a film society party tomorrow sometime and I've set the whole thing up for you.
I don't know.
I really should be working on my book.
"And look, I don't know how to write screenplays."
You need a computer program or something.
- It's crazy.
- Don't be a milquetoast.
This is a very big opportunity for you.
It could be a life changer.
Can one screenplay really change a life?
Sometimes.
Do I want my life to change?
"Most people do, Jonathan."
"Oh, shit, there's Antrem and Priscilla."
Don't turn around.
Don't draw attention.
Just sit...
Just sit there.
Who are they?
Sam?
So you still think I'm a thief.
A thief?
A thief who stole my heart!
We can go whenever you want. um...
Please stay
"Until the accusation thing,"
We were having such a good time!
"no, I think I should go."
I think I need to date people I haven't robbed.
And still no apology for that.
You two have shamed me in front of the chicago art world.
I bought eight of todd's photos
Out of pure embarrassment.
I hope you like silhouettes of trees.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"A pretty humiliating night for both of us, huh?"
"No, just you."
It's a naked picture of your ex-girlfriend.
"Look, i-i only put it in the show to sell it..."
To make money to--to buy you a present.
"Shut up, todd. you still want her."
-Why can't you just admit it?
-because it's not true.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, if you love me so much, where's my naked picture?"
"I mean, am I not a fitting enough subject for your art?"
Are these babies not good enough for you?
You brought a mugger to my show?
"Yeah, well, I was, uh, gonna bring a serial killer,"
But his van broke down.
"I mean, you can date whoever you want."
Cripes.
You think he got enough film?
Hmm.
WOMAN:
What?
Do I even want to know?
When did we knock over the coat rack?
Maybe it was that night we played drunk charades.
You remember.
"No, he doesn't remember 'cause he passed out on the couch."
"Well, I guess this explains the green light we see over here sometimes."
"Yeah, but why is this thing bolted to the ﬂoor?"
"I don't know, but I don't like it."
I don't like the sound it's making either.
"Uh, or how about the half-naked photos of me on the wall?"
That's the one thing I do like about this situation.
(SIGHS)
I knew something wasn't right about that old man.
"Hi, Mr. Kendall, this is Finn from Sycamore Apartments."
I'm calling you back about Mr. Bezzerides.
"If you can please ring me when you get a chance, that would be great."
Thank you.
What did the landlord say?
I just left a voice mail.
Okay.
I'm off to work.
"I counted the cookies, so if any go missing, there will be murder in this apartment."
I'll guard 'em.
"Well, who's going to guard 'em from you?"
(GASPS)
(SCOFFS) it's a perfect match.
It's got to be a coincidence.
How did he manage to hide a twin brother from us?
"Sir, Mikhail never communicated with him."
"If he had, we'd have known."
All right.
"Well, in less than 56 hours that bank in Nice opens the safe deposit box... and we all read about ourselves in the ""New York Times""."
If that happens... we'll be spending the rest of our lives wondering how we screwed up so badly.
Washington doesn't like federal agents... working for the Russian mob.
Our names are on that list.
Get the brother.
Convince him to work with us in Nice.
We don't have any options.
We'll get him.
"And, guys, keep this one alive."
I doubt if they were triplets.
Triplets.
"Alex, what are you doing?"
Look at this mess.
"Maybe if you told me what you're looking for, I could help you find it."
I wouldn't know what to tell you.
I'm just looking.
What'd you find?
He knew about me.
What'd you do in the war?
Sniper.
Why wait five years to find me?
Jimmy!
You in there?
"Open up, you shithead!"
This stuff's hot!
This is not your lucky day.
Tell your boss to leave me the fuck alone!
"Lvan, you look like your parrot died."
So I had to give you some sympathy points.
Can you stand up?
Do you need me to help you up?
I must learn well.
"Someday, I must possess acting skills comparable to this guy's."
"- When I said laughable,"
- Everyone together...
I didn't really mean it's funny.
I meant it's an embarrassment.
Do you understand?
Embarrassment?
Is it as bad as that?
It is.
"To me, it is!"
You're not allowed to leave!
I want you to wear the Love Me Dept uniform with me and be my nice partner.
"Gong Xi, I have run out of other options now, so I'd like to ask you to help me."
See if you can completely undo the knot in Mary's heart.
Don't rehearse anymore!
No one wants to watch such an idiotic show!
"Mary, how can you be so disruptive?"
I also think that the jie jie's response isn't very rational.
Let's see you act it out.
Show us how you'd interpret this Lola who resents her little sister.
Daddy will not forgive me.
Mommy's death was an accident.
It wasn't your fault.
Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
"For you, I want to..."
Solo.
Maybe we can take that walk afterall.
Sounds great.
Aren't they amazing?
Aren't they the best French fries you've ever tasted?
I'd give them a silver medal.
Silver medal?
"- What are you, a German judge?"
"- No, but I've had better."
- We're gonna do a taste test.
"- Fine, if you go by the Printer's."
- Where is this place?
"- In Bruges, in Flanders..."
- it's probable in Belgium.
"- Yes, I know."
I see someone with you or with a bunch of girl friends.
- I went by myself.
- Did you?
- How many countries did you visit?
- I traveled the world.
I graduated early and got a grant from my college... to do a photo essay... as part of my thesis and that was incredible!
That is amazing.
I can't believe you did all that by yourself.
I'm so impressed!
So... were you scared?
They tried to stripsearch me in Indonesia.
"I got a little heat from my bubblelicious probe but in... other letters, smooth sailing."
And did you make...
Did you make any disposable friends?
"A couple, but no crazy night with Ethan Hawke in Vienna... but I still have this Moroccan family who writes to me."
- I have the best pictures of them.
- Really?
Then I'd love to see them.
"If I just tell them once,"
You shall not find a place even in the market.
Brother!
Very good!
"Brother, very good."
Good to see this part of you today.
"You have educated yourself to grow so big that,"
You raised your hand on your elder brother.
That too for the sake of this girl?
Be happy in your world.
Before I go I shall give you a word.
"You shall not come for my burial, after I die."
When you need your brother... you may even ask for my life.
Your brother will lay down his life for you.
I can't even ask you for forgiveness.
My brothers have left me worthless in my own view.
"Come, I shall drop you home."
"""Be it love or god, it goes away like this""."
"""It feels as though every prayer have become worthless""."

"""Love is off the target at times""."
Drink it.
Fine.
"God, you're so bossy."
Force of habit.
I'm a nurse.
"Wait, you're that Annie?"
I'm calling my lawyer.
This is ridiculous.
I already told you everything.
"Well, You didn't tell us that your husband withdrew $10,000 three days before his death."
"Yeah, that's right, we have access to his financial records as well."
Maybe you do need to call your lawyer.
You didn't tell us about this either.
I did...
I didn't do anything.
You withheld information.
I can only think of one reason why you'd do that.
Because Troy had help ending his life.
You were there.
"Yeah, well, I wasn't there."
My husband needed me and I wasn't there.
"A few weeks before he died, he came apart."
He said he couldn't take it anymore.
He wanted it to end.
So he asked you to help him die.
"And instead of listening to what he wanted, I got angry."
And we had this huge fight.
I told him he was selfish.
Why didn't you tell us about it?
"Because I realized that he'd found someone to help him do what he wanted, someone to help him die."
And I was grateful.
I'm sorry.
I was a friend of his and... that he talked about you a lot.
He wanted me to give something to you too.
What is it?
It's the new Barbie Sunday dress.
- For real?
- Yea.
I think it should fit.
There's something else in there too.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
"Your father was a good guy, April."
He told me how you two got lost in the mall one day and then had ice cream.
Well...
See ya.
Barbie Sunday show cancelled
What are we going to do now ?
I'll think of something.
Cold Pizza And A Warm Puppy
What's funny?
Russ didn't tell you ?
"Tell me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny."
He didn't tell you about Pete ?
No .
Who is Pete ?
"Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day."
He felt terrible because he did some stuff he just couldn't get over.
What did he do ?
He slept with five of his patients.
"But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't."
The guilt and the sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming.
"But every once in a while, he heard a voice inside that said:"
"Let me see, let me see."
"Ah, the groaning board, the teeming table, the endless variety of God's bounty."
"Cheffing is a truly perfect art, far above mere painting or sculpture."
You can't eat a sheet of canvas or a lump of rock.
I don't know.
You could if you were drunk and had enough ketchup.
"- Morning, Richie."
- Do my senses deceive me?
Has Eddie Catflap emerged from the arms of Morpheus or perhaps an elephant has blown off?
No.
Right first time.
"It is I, smelly Eddie."
To whiff him is to love him.
"Ready for anything, as long as it's alcoholic."
"- Morning, Richie."
- Where's my shopping list?
Gas mask.
"Now then, shall we have seven courses or eight?"
Don't want do look ostentatious.
But don't want to look like a bloody pauper.
Better make it 12.
We could be like the Romans and throw up between courses.
Why should they get the credit for that idea?
I've been doing it for years.
"Morning, Richie."
"Twelve gas masks, clothes peg for nose, smelling salts and a ticket to Australia to get away from Eddie's whiff."
"- I said, morning, Richie!"
- Ah!
"I got you, then, didn't I?"
I got you.
"Morning, Eddie."
I trust you slept well?
- Is this a trick?
"- Nope, just, you know, wanted to do something nice for someone other than myself for a change."
"So hopefully, I don't know, we can all hang out, we can be friends."
Friends.
If you want.
"Anyways, enjoy the show."
"- Do you want this closed, or...?"
- Yeah.
"Thanks for letting me stay over, and thanks for breakfast."
"You finally learned how to make French toast, huh?"
"Mm, anytime."
Happy to have the company.
- I know what you mean.
"- Yeah, what do you know about being lonely?"
Hmm.
"Well, let's see."
My stepfather blackmailed me into living with my mom.
"My mom shipped my little sister off to boarding school, oh, and my boyfriend spent the entire summer with a girl, who may or may not have been pregnant with his child,"
- and now that he is back he won't talk to me thanks to D.J.
- Who's D.J.?
"Doesn't even matter since he's not talking to me, either."
"Mariss, honey?"
You ready to go?
I'm gonna go get my stuff.
Back to the gulag.
She knows I heard that.
It's a little game we play.
Mm-hmm.
So how's Caleb?
"Fantastic, never better."
"- Facing prison, we could lose everything."
- So you gonna divorce him and take his kids?
"- I cannot do that, Miss."
Everything must be in order.
Does the letter weigh too much?
You may want to come back to the counter again!
Here's another letter for him.
Maybe they know his address.
"Wait, I'll write it down for you."
"Again, I'm so sorry."
"Don't strain yourself, Karl!"
"If I were to wait for Bruno, I wouldn't get going today."
He's still on his lunch break.
Just once I'd like to see that you did not make any excuses for your brother.
How long will you be gone?
"Well, Anna, I really don't know."
The stuff here must go to Frankfurt and Essen.
And I won't return empty-handed.
That doesn't pay.
"And I'd also like to do some sightseeing in the West, you know."
"Middelmann  Co., starting anew over there."
"What, from Berlin?"
That's out of the question!
"But Anna, it can't go on like this;"
that you're always assisting.
But that doesn't bother me.
It does me!
I want my kid to inherit something of value!
Has he stirred again?
- Are you Mr John?
"- Yes, what is it?"
I just want to enquire about an address.
My husband needs to go.
You wait in the office meanwhile.
- Mm...
"Not a big chance, no."
"- Sarah, please."
In the name of all that's holy.
I am the one who bought you your first bra.
I'm not above playing the guilt card.
"Sorry, Mom."
- Who'd you tell?
"- Come on, Mom!"
You spent a night in jail for smoking pot.
This family should have a Bat-Signal for things that good.
Don't worry about it.
"If I were you, I would be trying to live great stories."
You've had too much responsibility for too long.
Yeah.
I know.
Being good for this family has been my sole purpose of existence for as long as I can remember.
I don't know.
"Maybe it's the residual cannabis talking, but what is the meaning of life supposed to be the rest of my life?"
To enjoy it.
However you want.
"Mom, you don't have to worry about being good."
You should just be worried about having fun.
You might want to draw the line at things that get you arrested.
Yeah.
"Well, if it's all right with you,"
I am gonna take a shower for about an hour.
- Here.
- Thank you for picking me up.
"Of course, Mom."
I know you'd do the same for me.
Sorry.
"All we know is he's got a gun, maybe worse."
Gibbs says he's got a backup unit on the way.
We don't make any moves until they get here.
I'm gonna let McGee know.
I can't believe you do this every day.
"Well, not every day, and not like this."
You sure we're not too conspicuous?
Not if we stand here like we're just talking to each other.
We are talking to each other.
You two with NCIS?
I am.
Special Agent Ellie Bishop.
Special Agent DiNozzo.
And I'm Jake Malloy.
Lieutenant Janet Lewis.
"Now, where is this alleged imposter?"
He just went into the men's room.
Calm and cool.
Secure this whole area.
No one enters until I say.
Not quite the cavalry we were expecting.
"Yeah, well, I expected to be home right now getting my cranberries started, but we can't have everything."
You have your service weapons?
"Oh, not me."
"I'm a-an attorney, with NSA."
"Attorneys stand over there, please."
Be careful.
I will be.
Adorable.
"Okay, now, let's keep our weapons out of sight until we get in there."
Last thing we want to do is panic this crowd.
Can't we just evacuate this terminal?
Well you can have me.
I don't wanna have you.
I wanna make love to you.
I'm telling this for your own good...
I think you should go home.
You've spent all your energy trying to get me excited and then...
Want to throw me out?
Please leave...
Come here.
Ok I'd like two orders of shrimp fried rice.
An order of shrimp and pea pods.
An order of shrimp with lobster sauce.
And an order of jumbo shrimp.
Owen...get up.
-What I'm working on.
-That's what I'm working on.
Are you...a researcher?
"No I'm a TV producer, do you think that they exist?"
So you're looking for heroin and you don't want the police to know about it.
"Listen, this really has nothing to do with drug traffic."
What can I do?
Nobody really knows the true nature of these aliens.
You're from Germany?
"Yes, Berlin."
I'm jewish...
So what connections do you think there can possibly be between UFO's and...heroin?
What the fuck is going on in here?
Have you ever seen a UFO ?
"Yes, this morning, that's why I'm here."
Well that's very interesting.
Would you like a drink?
You can see it as well.
- How'd you know I'd be at this one?
- Istanbul wasn't that long ago.
"You like rooftops over windows... you like angles with the target on your right-hand side, 'cause you're left-handed."
That's right.
I knew I liked you.
Put it on.
"Michael... is this what you really want, huh?"
Helping out civilians with their little problems... trying to get your government job back?
It's pathetic.
You're better than that.
Let's go.
We have a big day ahead of us.
I gotta turn you in.
There'll be questions.
It'll be past lunch before we're done.
Turn me in?
"Sure feels good not to be the gayest guy in the room, for once."
"No, you're still the gayest."
Louis!
Go kiss Eugene!
So funny I forgot to laugh.
Meanwhile... our plan is down the poopster.
- Not necessarily.
"- What are you thinking, Gourishankar?"
"You said Ralph's boss had a guy fired for being a homosex, right?"
We send these photos to Ralph's boss.
He get Ralph fired for being a homosex.
That create an opening with Mick Jagger.
"They fill that opening with their only floater,"
Mr. Rockefeller Butt.
"But wait a second, we can't just out this guy."
Why can't we out a homosex?
"No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!"
"- Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission."
- Really?
Then what is this?
"- Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake."
"- All right, bad news."
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
"- Left, right, left, right, both, both, both."
That's so cool!
"I still can't let you go to Florida, though."
- Terry feels like a whore.
"He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences."
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
"Great, Hitchcock's in."
Who else?
- I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
"- Shut up, Hitchcock."
"Obviously, we're all going."
"- What's up, squadron?"
"I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies."
"- Yeah, about that."
"Um, there were no tickets left."
"But I brought my minivan, so..."
- Road trip!
- I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
"Needles, needles, need-- whoa!"
And then--
"- So wait a minute, wait."
The Homicide gang were chasing them.
"- Thank Christ, at least from our point of view."
"So these ill-fated Jolly Stompers run past us and we're standing there frozen, can't move, and this running mob runs around us like a herd of buffalo and we're just standing there and then ten seconds, just standing around us yelling."
"Homicides, Homicides, and running after these poor souls, who are probably dead by now, by the way."
And--
"And ten seconds later, they're gone."
"Just me and my daughter, standing there, my 13-year-old daughter and me, and we still have nothing to talk about."
(women laughing)
"- Hey, Pete."
Give me another one?
- Cash first.
- What?
"- Horace, come on."
What is this shit?
- Hey.
You ain't paid for the last three I poured you.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
- Cash first.
- So Iâm broke.
I've got...
I've got a quarter.
You know what?
What if I could make a one dollar bill that you gave me change into a twenty.
"- Ooh, I wanna see it."
- I wanna go dancing.
- Then you'll give me a free drink?
- What are you talking about?
- If I can make your one into a twenty.
Can I-
- Can I borrow this?
"Fine, but just for the record, you cannot be more wrong."
Spies are supposed to be better liers.
Enjoy your walk.
Come by the house this afternoon.
I'll show you around.
I guess I could check it out.
"Normal fellows, right?"
"From the beginning, you were stuck at OC because of your dad."
- Now you're not stuck with those guys.
- They're were not all bad.
A cappucino for Evan.
- How's it going?
- Good...
Just drinking coffee.
We're gonna have a special meeting this week on you coming back.
Just hang it tight.
You guys are losing a great pledge.
I don't think we're losing anybody.
You have a history of letting great people get away from you.
You know what?
I've tried to be nice to you by not kicking your ass.
"Last semester, I've put up with the digs, with the insults out of respect for Casey."
She and I are not together anymore.
You do the maths.
- He's just sticking up versus...
- I can do maths.
I'm good at it.
"I hear a lot of buzzing, but no actual words."
That's what insects do.
"They buzz around, try to sting you."
"Be careful, insect!"
Some insects are quite deadly.
There you--go.
[Spits out drink]
Warm.
You can't do anything right.
- Help me up.
- Where are you gonna go?
"- Shut up, nurse!"
- And don't bump it.
Fat bitch.
Why do you put up with that guy?
I've had it.
"Arthur was famous for two things, bad wigs and carrying a gun."
You've owed me money for 30 years!
Musicians!
Ah!
They're the scum of the earth.
"He raised his palsied hand, and took aim."
"Every one of you, you'll all die!"
Arthur!
"Put the gun down, Arthur!"
I'm the genius.
I made you!
[Screaming]
"By him shooting down at his own bottle, he hit the weakest part of the bottle, which is where the valve is connected, 'cause there's a hole in the bottle."
"That would've forced the valve up, the bottle would've opened up like a--a flower, instantly, blown all the oxygen out of it."
"It would have been a catastrophic, uh, explosion, and he was as close as you can get to it, so it would've taken him out."
Who are you?
Arthur screwed everyone he ever worked with.
I'm the genius!
I made you!
[Screaming]
"But in the end, he gave Jerry and the Atrics an ending to their song."
These stories don't have a long shelf life.
"If we don't give him more ammunition, this Silk will move on to somebody else."
- Then...
- Then what?
Daylight again?
- Definitely.
- Good.
And I could totally take that guy.
"You just worry too much, Nora."
You always have.
I know Sarah and Joe are going through a rough time.
Are you sure that's all?
I really think Tommy's decision to buy this winery with Holly is bothering her more than she's letting on.
Tommy and Sarah have a very strong bond.
William never would've brought Sarah to Ojai Foods if he thought she and Tommy couldn't survive sibling rivalry.
You're right.
You're right.
"I mean, look at us."
- What do you mean?
"- Our family wasn't exactly a picnic, yet here we are, after all these years, still speaking to one another."
- You want a green bean?
- Thank you.
"- It's a small miracle, isn't it?"
"- Yes, it is."
I don't know.
I think maybe I was wrong about her.
- About who?
- Holly.
- What do you mean?
- You're seeing her.
Tommy is starting a company with her.
"As much as I hate to admit it, maybe William was a good judge of character."
"-Yes, I did some writing."
-Did you get any of it published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't by any chance publish those books with the... the plain wrappers, do you remember?"
"Yes, you do."
Remember?
"You were always afraid, and everything frightened you."
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
"-Really, you look great."
-Thanks.
Though you never said good-bye to me when you left Peyton Place.
-Never even said good-bye.
-I'll never forget that Labor Day.
-I won't either.
-I see you have 2 Purple Hearts.
-What brings you home?
Vacation?
-Haven't you heard about Selena?
"-No, what?"
"-She killed her stepfather, Lucas."
The trial starts in two days for murder.
"Lucas was always a bad Joe, but she always seemed to put up with him."
Who ever knows what anyone's able to put up with in this world?
"Well, that's true."
"It sure took me a lot enough time... to know a little about myself, understand Peyton Place."
-Cigarette?
-Thanks.
I'm going to go back and try to work things out with my mother.
Maybe we'll both be happier.
"If not, maybe at least I've made the effort."
You know?
I always wondered why you enlisted.
"David, my wife Sally."
"David, hi."
Pleasure.
Pleased to meet you.
Shall we get you home?
(Door opens)
Just passing.
Mm-hm.
Am I correct in remembering you handled a drug case two years ago with a key witness who's a guy called Shrimpton?
Stanley Shrimpton?
You got a conviction on the basis of his testimony.
That's what you've come here to talk about?
"Yeah, I think I might be defending a genuinely innocent guy."
"I mean, an actually innocent guy."
Why did you go to bed with me if you didn't want me?
Hmm?
Was it just about landing me?
"Once I'm flapping about on the deck, I'm just a dead fish."
"What are you talking about landing you, Red?"
We'd already done it before.
"So you tell me, then."
Why did you want me?
"Because at that precise moment, there was no-one more beautiful on Earth and I had to have you."
"No, no, no, you're so full of shit!"
OK.
"Because I was drowning, and because you were a lifebuoy and you were in the same wet place."
Stanley Shrimpton.
A piece of vermin who got off child abuse charges by becoming a police informant.
"Now, go, will you?"
"Thanks, Red."
"OK, I'm sorry."
I was bored stupid.
"- Yo, Graff."
Why don't you come driving with us tonight?
That would be exciting.
If I were in a coma.
You'll be excited.
Later.
- l could have handled that.
- Yeah.
You're doing great.
"No, no. I'm asking a particular question. ls it fair?"
- What does fair have to do with it?
- Fair has to do with what?
Anybody?
Fair has to do with the right to come to school...
"and be able to do your work, and not be terrified."
Not have your heart beating fast.
Not jump every time there is a loud noise.
The right to come in and be left alone.
No?
Maybe not everybody is left alone anyway.
Meaning what?
"You don't know what goes on around here, okay?"
Maybe some people have guns to protect yourself.
"Maybe some people who have guns are like victims, too."
And they're like forced to carry.
You think kids with guns are like gangsters or dealers.
Your saying that if someone is threatened it's okay for them to carry...
a gun in school?
You don't think the school authorities can protect them?
"Man, you don't know what goes on around here."
Yes. lf l was--
"Say I was threatened, and I'm not saying that I am..."
Please.
"Thank you, Sister."
"And you, Mother, for agreeing to see me."
"I'm sorry, but this is a personal matter."
"Don't worry, there are no secrets here."
"And, anyway, Sister Marie has taken a vow of silence, so there is nothing to worry about."
Please speak freely.
I may need your help soon.
"And I apologize if I'm being presumptuous, but... this is a place of God, and..."
Yes?
"If there were any other place my friends could turn, believe me..."
You need us to hide some people who may or may not be in trouble with the authorities?
I'm not sure that they will be free to come.
- A very small number of them.
- Men?
"Yes, but only for a short time."
I'm so sorry.
But I can't.
"Mother, please!"
They'll be recaptured in the woods or killed.
The Germans are very thorough.
Every inch will be searched.
These men will be found.
"When the sisters of the Abbey St. Germain were caught trying to hide refugees, only four Sisters were left alive that night."
Barely.
I'm so sorry.
I will pray for them.
"For you, in this fight."
But I cannot let anything happen to the Sisters in my care.
I understand.
Thank you.
You are very brave.
So now I'm gonna take care of it!
"No, you will not."
You will have your boys sweep every room in this place.
"And you will come with me, as planned."
Find him.
You don't talk to me like that in front of my men.
"- I don't, huh?"
"- No, you don't!"
Ten years I've known Bobby!
Twice the guy saved my life.
This doesn't go unanswered!
"Drop the tough-guy shit with me, junior."
"Now, I know your story, Emil."
I know what this country did to you.
We're in this together.
So be calm.
- I'm calm.
- Good.
- I'm still gonna kill him.
- I don't have a problem with that.
But I need the president alive.
Don't forget that.
You promised me the leader of the free world.
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
We'll get him back.
"But without him, what kind of time frame we looking at?"
"We have 15 minutes to load in, then maybe another 3O or so to crack the protocols without his code."
"After that, it's on you."
- What about securing the basement?
- I brought a party favour for that.
- Good.
- Do you know you've got a bit of something right...
"Don't mess with the clever, quiet one."
"Why are you so negative about it all, John?"
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
Why have you got your eyes closed?
"Cos when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice, cosy cell and you won't be with me."
I'm still here.
"- What do you do for them, Calum?"
- You know...
Pretty much what I've always done.
"Multi-tasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins."
"Not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?"
What do they want us to do?
Do the stuff the law can't do.
Dealing with people the law can't reach.
"Come on, John, you're the clever one."
Have you not worked it out yet?
Check out the CVs.
Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
Doof!
You're the specialist.
You're the killer.
"# Oh, know how I love you"
# As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
# And the rosebuds... #
"Morning, flatmate."
Did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you but that was the last of the bacon.
- As they always this noisy upstairs?
- Mm.
I like it.
- Unless maybe that's what you want... - Cohen!
- What?
Come on!
Just wait a second.
- I believed you.
"How you were changing, that you just wanted to be friends."
- I do!
That's...
Maybe I just...
I can't be just friends with you.
"Well, then, I guess maybe this is it for us."
I'm so tired right now.
I
- I didn't even sleep at all.
"- Oh, dude, the only thing holding my head up is my lungs. - Sorry, man."
- I handled that Summer situation so wrong...
I just...
- I really shouldn't have returned her phone calls.
- She never called you.
- I should've dated other girls.
- What other girls?
"Maybe if I'd played her hot and cold, right, mess with her mind a little bit, then I don't know."
I think it potentially could
"- Look, man, I'm sorry, really, I am, and I would love to rehash the evening second by second one more time, but I'm late."
-
- Uh...
I'm meeting my lab partner.
I've got this physics assignment.
- On a Saturday?
"- Ryan, the whole geek routine... it was really amusing at first, but I think you're taking things a little bit too far."
- Thi
"- I just need to talk about me for, like, several more hours at least."
Ministry of War Transport.
Seems they've had wind of your proposed filmic scenario.
"Apparently, they're concerned that ""the Nancy Starling's engine failure may cast morale-sapping doubt on the quality of British engineering."""
It was her.
Bloody Ministry spy.
What if it's not the engine?
What if it's the propeller?
"It gets snarled up with flotsam,"
"Uncle Frank goes in the water to free it, gets shot, and the girls have to finish the job under fire."
- Not the girls.
- Not the girls?
- No.
"Uh, Johnnie."
- Johnnie?
- Is there an echo in here?
- Why him?
- Because he's the hero.
- So?
"Well, how do we know he's the hero if he never does anything heroic?"
"Well, he's called Johnnie."
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
Johnnie can't go in the water.
"He's injured, badly injured."
"A manly slash on the bicep, for Christ's sake."
He's not gonna be leaking spleen through his trousers.
"This is Rose and Lily's story, and you won't let them do anything."
- They go to Dunkirk.
- And Johnnie pilots them home.
They're girls.
Girls don't want to be the hero.
They want to have the hero.
They want to be had by him.
"Yes, Pauline."
It'll all be fine.
Have a seat first...
- I won't go back!
"- Now come, first sit down."
It's so hot...
- Won't you take off your coat!
- Yes.
Do you see that?
"What should I see, Mrs John?"
"Well, take a closer look!"
Where is the child that I'm having?
Mrs John!
"Well, it just happens that one loses a child before it's born."
But for me it's the second time and it'll always be that way...
But you were seven months pregnant!
Was I?
"No, it happened in the fourth month... quite suddenly..."
My husband had just gone on tour.
Thank God he didn't notice anything.
"Yes, and..."
"Then I wanted to adopt a child, but... the girl left..."
And since then I've played a part.
No one has noticed anything.
But why haven't you told the truth?
"Because he is a man, Pauline!"
"A handsome, strong man..."
"Because there are plenty of young things that can have a baby, like yourself!"
Because our greatest happiness would be if we were to have one...
I've always wished for one and so has he... to raise someone...
small for the future...
"Well, why do you think he's so long on the road?"
I don't know how long its been since I've seen that.
You're like a miracle worker.
It's all a part of the process.
"But for now, your chest only, okay?"
It feels so good.
Could you maybe...
Not on the first visit.
It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.
"I know, but--"
What if this is the only erection I ever get?
I may not have another chance.
You will.
I promise.
Please.
"I wouldn't ask, except... it would mean a lot to me."
"I-I'm not a young man anymore, and..."
Please?
I do not understand it when we've gone over and over this time and time again!
I'm so sorry.
I-I--
You risked compromising his entire treatment!
And for what?
I felt he was so distracted by his need.
- I thought that if I just--
- You crossed a line that cannot be crossed.
And if the surrogate doesn't understand the boundaries--
"But I do know the boundaries, and-- and he did end up feeling--"
Do not tell me that it's okay because it worked.
You cannot play fast and loose with my patients that way.
I am sorry.
You're right.
I-I really apologize.
Now shut your trap.
- You mean you won't go?
- No!
And if you mention gold temples again to me...
I'll tear the back right off you with a shovel.
"Very well, MacChesney, you made your choice."
I offered you the chance to be a millionaire... and you turned it down.
"All right, I'm going alone."
Wait a minute!
"Cutter, you ain't leaving this village without my permission."
Give me that bottle.
I've been a soldier for 14 years.
I know my duties as well as you do.
"But you're not talking to a soldier now, you're talking to an expedition."
I'm an expedition.
Out of my way.
"Cutter, sit down before I throw you down."
"Make way for the expedition, if you know what's good for you."
Goodbye forever.
Stand back.
I'll throw you in the clink if you make a move.
Out of my way before I split your jaw.
"- Cutter, I'm warning you."
"- Come on, put 'em up."
"Come on, out of my way."
"I'll bash your ugly face in, that's what I'll do."
"Come on, put 'em up."
I'm afraid I have to do it.
Sgt. Ballantine.
- What?
- Come here.
Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell.
- I'm clean.
You?
- I'm clean.
I had my tubes tied.
- Fuck the condoms.
- Great.
"This isn't all some scheme to get back control of Isabelle's money, is it?"
"This isn't some hostile way for you to get back at Dean, is it?"
- I'm not sure what it is.
"- Me, neither."
- I'm not sure I care right now.
"- Me, either."
My cousin live in a village where all the babies born one year look like those Oompa Loompas.
"Then they stop the crop-dusting, and the next year, all fine."
Do they dance and sing morality songs?
"No, but a lot of them are tossed in bars to make a living."
I used to have nightmares about the boat scene.
I remember that.
I used to have to crawl in bed with you and read to you from the real-estate section to get you to fall asleep.
Which got me into trouble at school.
"When we were starting Roosevelt,"
"I proudly announced to the entire class that FDR stood for ""Formal Dining Room."""
I like this part!
"Oh, can we say chicken parmesan?"
No.
"Oh, no."
I promise I won't yell.
No ultimatums.
- I just want to talk.
Can I come in?
- Bad timing.
What's going on?
I'm home!
Welcome back.
"Good evening, sensei."
Good to see you Tomoko.
came to see me.
"She seemed very lonely, so I invited her to come see the ocean."
Oh.
Did you eat?
Yes.
Then you should take a bath.
"Alright, we'll practice more later."
Take your positions now.
Take a fan.
"You can hear the waves, can't you?"
"Tomoko, the time I've spent as your teacher will fade into the distant past."
"Since I was a child, I think I've been too dependent on the love and good will of others."
I think I got too dependent on the goodness of your heart.
I think that I hurt your chances of being happy and finding someone to marry.
"No, that's not true."
It wasn't a sacrifice.
It was I who was dependent on you and Shinako.
I didn't do anything.
"There's something worrying you, isn't there Tomoko?"
There's something I've been keeping a secret from you two.
What is it?
Do you have some problem?
"If there's something bothering you that you can't tell me about, please talk to Shinako about it."
I'll leave you two alone.
What's going on?
I'm drunk.
Oh.
"Mother, Takehara is over there."
Did you make the milk?
What the hell is going on here?
You're a humanoid!
Why do you have hair?
"My husband told me that I am the first blonde but unfortunately I am brunette, so"
"Where are you from, Sara?"
- I was born in this cabin.
"- No, that's impossible!"
Tell me the truth.
- Where are you from?
"- You're far from home, Spartan!"
"""Do you want to tell me what you do in my cabin?"""
"- He's a friend, Cage."
There is no reason for the weapon.
"With her, I'll blow your face away!"
I'm looking for a girl.
She was kidnapped by a Humanoid.
My partner said that maybe you could help me.
This is no help for the Spartans.
I do not like to waste time with Federation slag.
"Spartan, my ass!"
As I said...
I would appreciate any information you or Sara may have about the girl.
You must be five now.
"If you can not help, let's go our way again."
And we do not ask questions.
"A gun does not want to help you, son."
What if I do not want to help you?
What happens then?
Question answered?
"Rat, piece of Spartan garbage!"
You and your Indian slut can kiss me in the ass!
Let's go home.
"A peaceful, stay-at-home kind of day in a town  very much like your own."
"But then, suddenly, without warning atomic holocaust!"
But how does one survive an atomic attack?
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?
He says his boat ran into a sea monster.
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.
It was a metal meteor.
It ate his boat.
My dad says--
It wasn't any of those.
"What would you know about it, Poindexter?"
Don't make me come over there.
Hands over your head Keep low to the ground
Time to duck and cover The bombs are coming down
Duck and cover
It's about 50 or 60 feet high and it only eats metal.
"Shut up, you little spaz!"
It's been sent by foreigners to take over the country.
We should bomb it to smithereens before it does.
'Cause all the kids who don 't Will cease to be around
Thanks for the scrap.
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this...
... thislargebiteout ofit.
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a Iarge bite out of it.
-What could've done this?
-I told you what.
Strange invaders.
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.
Good night.
Lita.
[sighs] [elevator humming] [sobbing]
Lita.
[Sandover's voice] The perfect embezzlement.
It may be said that Rome was not built in a day.
"Well, neither was Fort Knox;"
neither was the treasure of the Incas.
"The undiscoverable acquisition of $201,000, bill by bill, month after month, year after year, is a financial feat worthy of Clem P. Sandover... [jazz playing] [clock ticking]"
- Having trouble?
- Oh no.
I do this for exercise.
It helps my strawberries get ripe.
Anybody home over there?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Why?
"Oh, I'm looking for real estate."
"Well, you can have any of mine, this truck included."
You know this is the second time in three weeks that I've missed the early market?
You know how long I've been asleep in that cab waiting for it to be light enough to fix this thing?
[jazz playing]
[song repeating] [engine revving]
Lita Krail murdered?
She-- she can't be.
She just can't be.
"Beth, why are you so frightened?"
"Last night you told me that you didn't like her, that you didn't trust her."
It's just that I can't believe it.
I'd like to talk to your husband.
He's-- he's gone out already.
I-
- I don't know where.
While behind the wheel of a car with headlights on.
So?
"- Marisa, how long have you smoked?"
None of your business.
- Just humor me.
"I don't know, since, like, 10th grade."
When I was 15.
- You've always smoked Camels?
"Pretty much, except for when I've bummed from friends."
You've seen that pack of Camels thousands of times.
Think real hard about the man on the package.
Was he sitting on the camel or is he leading him with a rope?
"Oh, come on, Marisa, this is a fastball right down the middle."
This is ridiculous.
"- Ah-ah-ah, no cheating."
Come on.
"Okay, fine."
I am 99 percent sure that the man is leading the camel by a rope.
Shit.
There is no man.
"Wow, that's crazy."
What people see and what they think they see are often two different things.
How can we put so much weight on what a witness saw in a flash in the middle of the night?
"Trick question or whatever, the fact is you don't admit to murder if you didn't do it."
They wore him down until he believed what they told him to believe.
- I want another vote.
Judd?
Okay.
All those favoring guilty?
"Hey, Jean."
Yeah?
- Did you clear out my messages?
"-Rick,you don't have to... -jody,I'm your husband."
So why didn't you tell us you knew lance corporal finn?
I s afraid that my husband would find out.
That you killed him?
I didn't kill james.
It was an accident.
"Fell,he hit his head;"
I did not kill him.
I loved him.
Swear to god.
Do you have any idea how many murderers swear to god they didn't do it?
I come from a good catholic family.
"When we swear to god,we mean it."
Room for one more?
"I haven't seen you in observation for a while,ducky."
I've learned as much as I can from the dead.
It's time to listen to theiving.
You met in a bar.
Yes.How did yoknow that?
When?
Nine months ago.
You sleep with him that night?
No!
That's right--
I forgot you're from a good catholic family.
Did you sleep with him the second night?
Your husband never knew.
"I would tell him that I had a late showing, and I'd meet james at the house on larson lane."
"I know that that sounds immoral, but it is not what you think."
"Well,let me guess."
You had a deep spiritual connection.
Exactly.
And I think one of these men either has the coins or knows where they are.
Our deal was for me to find Marquesa.
"Well, I did that."
"These coins, however, present a whole new business opportunity."
So you want to be my partner?
This is the guy Marquesa went after.
That's him coming out of his condo.
I got names and addresses on all of them.
You need me.
Not anymore.
[Snarls]
[Growling]
[Beeps]
"So, Mr. Adams, you must have found something that wasn't good for you."
Adalind?
"Hi, Juliette."
I'm glad you remember me.
Of course I remember you.
"Well, I just wasn't sure if I should come by since things didn't work out with Hank, you know."
"Oh, stop."
I don't take my patients based on their owners' social lives.
"I'm glad you came in, and I'm glad you brought your cat."
"Well, I am relieved to hear that because Majique"
- seems to be pretty sick.
"- Oh, no."
What seems to be the problem with miss Majique?
She's just not herself.
She's sluggish.
She won't eat.
I'm pretty worried.
Do you think it's serious?
"Well, I hope not, but I'm probably going to want to keep her overnight to run some tests."
The midwife was Joanne Braxton.
She stole the dead woman's child?
It's the only birth she attended that fits with Roland's age.
And then she and her husband left the area shortly after.
What about Roland's father?
Is he still alive?
He is.
He was working out of the province at the time of his wife's death.
He never questioned the official report.
My God!
No one knows the baby exists.
No one misses him.
No one mourns him.
"He is yours, Julia."
Is this good news or bad?
What would William say?
He still doesn't know.
Keeping a secret this profound from him would be a betrayal of the trust between us.
But if I tell him...
He will feel duty-bound to return Roland to his father.
So leaving him in blissful ignorance could be the better path.
If you think you can do that.
Sir?
I found a missing persons' report that matches our victim.
- Who is it?
- A Hugo de Jaager.
Left his family home in Peterborough for Toronto a week ago.
Hasn't been heard from since.
- What's all this?
"- Sir, this is his research."
He told his mother before he left he was sure he was going to find her this time.
"- ""Her""?"
The plan worked.
I did it once.
I can do it again because I believe in myself.
"- No, granddad, my point is..."
"- Less talk, more training!"
Let's go!
"The more you fight, the more he fights."
"It's your ego, granddad."
You're the problem.
"I'm rising to the challenge, redeeming my honor!"
That's a nice way to say you want payback.
What's the opposite of a nigga?
- I don't know.
- Think about it.
- Mr. Rogers?
- Perfect.
Can you imagine Mr. Rogers in a nigga moment?
Of course not!
"So to end a nigga moment, you have to be Mr. Rogers, and what would Mr. Rogers do?"
He would follow normal white-people rules.
So if Stinkmeaner confronted Mr. Rogers in a parking lot...
"Oh, yeah, he wouldn't fight."
He would walk away and call the police.
And if he keeps coming back?
"File a complaint, get a restraining order."
"Eventually, they would put Stinkmeaner in jail."
"But then he has to snitch, and then I got to live with that shame!"
"Yes, dumb idea, Huey."
Stinkmeaner get away with beating me in front of everyone!
I never get redemption!
But it ends.
You're saying that I should just let him get away with beating me in front of the whole world?
It won't happen again.
You're damn right it won't!
Next time something like that happens the little girl is coming out of the window with a bullet in her head.
ERIC:
Mary.
"Oh, what the hell, Ray?"
Leave the little girl alone.
You stay right there.
You sad little man.
Who do you think you are?
God?
You shut up.
"He's not God, Dorothy."
He's just a poor excuse for a man.
A man without any faith.
Faith?
You're gonna talk to me about faith?
"God comes down and, pluck, there goes your son, no more Luke."
Bye-bye.
Why?
"Dale, why?"
Because He's up in His Heaven and all's right with the world?
Or because we live in a stinking sewer where nothing makes one bit of sense?
RAY:
But you have faith.
"Your son dies for no reason, but you have faith."
"You get taken and tortured, but you have faith."
( Ray laughs )
"If I didn't, then I wouldn't have any reason to go on living."
"Then you crawl away and you die, because this right here-- this is as much sense as the world will ever make."
What are you doing?
I told you I didn't want anyone killed.
"- mom, i told uncle bob -- - i don't care."
please don't leave me alone here with her.
"- these bullies are hassling tim again, and just because someone had him kick them in the nuts."
"- well, that's not my fault!"
it's his dingdong haircut and his silly eyeglasses that make him get in trouble!
- mom!
"- oh, you know what i mean."
come on.
"i'm your mother, and you're staying right here."
damn kids!
- dang kids.
- da-- dang kids.
"[chuckles] yeah, they're always listening to their friends and not their parent."
"- it, um, appears the only items you have in your refrigerator are two cans of cheese-please and a liter of pop?"
"- yeah, it's -- it's grocery day."
- it's grocery day!
it's grocery day.
"look, i know these kids."
"they -- they eat a full balanced diet 'cause they're still growing and crap, so..."
- oh.
so you do have a job?
- no!
working's for suckers!
- [chuckles] - skoal!
"- i'm, actually -- um, i'm, like, in this transitional phase right now."
- i've seen enough.
"[door creaks] uh, who is she?"
i-i don't have her on my list.
- oh.
"um, she ain't really mine."
"see, her daddy is my friend with benefits."
so she just comes around here sometimes.
"All right, off to bed."
It's late.
Smells like a giant jock strap.
Maybe 30 years ago it would've been fine.
"Oh, my Lord."
"Okay listen, honey, try not to touch anything or breathe deeply."
There he is.
Should have worn a hazmat suit.
Those are some extremely nice skates for rentals.
We don't open till 10:00.
"You're Shayne Baker, right?"
Girl's league MVP?
I hear you're pretty good.
"What do you say, maybe sometime, you and me, we could go scrimmage."
I am good for girl's league.
Maybe you should just go scrimmage yourself.
Okay.
It's a very generous offer!
More than this place is worth.
This ice has decades of history for the town.
I'm not going to just sell it off because you wanna put some office building here.
"Well, actually, I was thinking more of a boutique mall and day-spa."
"Rick, history only matters if people care, and no one does around here any more."
This town belongs to me.
"And one way or another this ancient scrap heap you call an ice rink will be mine, too."
So think about my offer.
"Let's go, Kain."
Stay away from her.
"- Now, Kain!"
- All right.
"Well, Dad?"
- I said no.
"Fortunately, this yet to be completed formula... was stolen by a Jewish Scientist, who intended to sell it to the Americans."
"Since the Jew's nanny taught him Mandarin, and to evade attention, the deal was carried out in H.K."
"They cold named the formula the ""Beast""."
"On knowing this, Hitler sent 2 Gastapos to H.K."
"To catch the ""Beast""."
Nothing can stop the world from rotating.
But there are always exceptions.
"You're always so fast, only takes you less than a minute."
"That's simple enough, even a dog can do it."
Someone's at the door!
- Who's turn?
"- Yours, of course!"
Give me a hand!
Hold on!
- O.K?
- O.K.!
"Hello, this is Yoyo Private Eye's, I'm Super..."
No...
I'm the Great Super Yoyo?
What?
Your No.8 concubine has walked out on you?
"Such a simple case, why bother me?"
Wait till all 8 of them walk out on you!
What?
The Mayor inviting me to dinner?
Haven't got time!
I wouldn't be Yoyo if I can be so easily invited.
"Old man, what can I do for you?"
I've come to connect the telephone.
"Oh yes, you haven't paid the bill for 6 mouths."
I spent all my savings yesterday to pay for it.
Smart girl.
How did you get to do this?
Writing I mean.
Parfitt.
He's making comedies for Baker.
Used to click gangs of heard into me sung in the pub.
Many a time.
He'll think you were born into purpose.
Certainly spent enough time in 'em as a kid.
He was a soldier.
In and in the last one.
"The thing about men who get sent away to war, Mrs.Cole, is that some of them don't come back at all... some come back as heroes... and some of them come back drunk squalid bullies."
I was better off it this way.
In the pub?
Or the pictures.
I liked the pictures best.
Once in a while you just need to make one that's worth it.
Worth...the hour and a half of someones life that's gonna see it.
Ah!
I really thought this one would be.
Bloody Yanks.
Hm.
Would be alright if all we had to do is look at him.
We strip him down to the essentials and use a voice-over.
"I wasn't there at the beginning of the story, but it all began in a little fishing village in Englo..."
Yes.
Yes.
"Inarticulacy, authenticity."
He's too cut out.
Nah!
No.
He really can't.
But Hilliard can.
Get rid of him.
John!
What are you doing?
"Well, this way you can have the flat all to yourself."
"John mate, please."
I've changed a lot since then.
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please!"
John!
Please!
What you've got to ask yourself is do you think I won't do it?
That's the only thing that should be on your mind just now.
Do you think that I won't do it?
All right.
"Next time we play chicken, I'll make sure the stakes are worth it."
There's some goodie bags in your room and other essentials.
"Are you gonna tell me who you are, then?"
"No, you'll have to wait until tomorrow now."
ATT:
JOHN MERCER
That one.
I've always thought scarlet suited you best.
It's red and don't be so cheeky.
I thought you'd be bursting with curiosity about the new recruit.
When do I get to meet him?
"Oh, wait, when you decide the time is right."
You know me so well.
You're not scared he'll do a runner?
"No, he's not that stupid."
"So, when do you put him to work?"
Fortunately I do happen to have a case for him.
Good.
Dear little Buttercup
Though I could never tell why
A little louder.
But still I'm called Buttercup
Pool little Buttercup
"Sweet little Buttercup, I"
Robin?
What's happening?
"Batman, I want you to come with me later today and rob a bank."
"Robin, don't even joke about such a thing."
Have you lost all your sense of judgment?
"Holy reverse polarity, I did it!"
I got you out of Black Widow's clutches!
"Of course, I knew what I was doing but with my cerebrum short circuited I couldn't stop myself."
"You sit down here, Robin."
I'll retie your hands and pretend that my brain is still short circuited.
"Sure and it's a dark hour in Gotham City, commissioner."
Yes.
But I was faced with the decision and I had to make it.
How will we be breaking the news to the people?
We'll tell them the truth.
Batman was shot and killed when he and Robin...
Robin?
No doubt he's gone into hiding.
Most likely in the Batcave.
Maybe I can talk to him.
Get him to surrender.
So no more of the Dynamic Duo's blood will be spilled on the streets of our fair city.
"I'm sorry, sir."
Batman is not here.
I know that.
- We've lost the Caped Crusader.
Long distance?
Chicago?
"See here, Mr. Norstaad."
I've been your leading representative in the Midwest for the past ten years now.
You can't do this to me.
Do?
I do something?
"You, Somers, who's ever running things--"
He's got a salesman in Chicago trying to saturate the market.
"Why, he's taking orders at prices so low the furniture bearing your trademark could be sold retail for less than I paid you."
"Oh, no."
"No, that's impossible."
Is it?
"Well, I've seen signed duplicates of the orders with my own eyes."
I call you back.
Parker.
I told you I wanted you to bring me some pieces to show to salesmen.
These pieces ready to show to anybody.
- I've told you I want production--
- But he's not in today.
If you'll call for an appointment--
"So now I need an appointment, huh?"
What's the matter?
You are hiding from somebody?
"No, no, of course not."
"Come on into my office where we can talk, Norstaad."
Aha.
"Ramsey from Chicago, he calls me."
He tells me that you sell furniture under my trademark cheaper than I can make it.
I want to know how can you do that?
"That's my business, I'm afraid."
"No, mine."
I am Yang Siu of the Ming Cult and am begging your pardon on behalf of the kids
Yang Siu
Let's go quickly
You are Yang Siu of the Ming Cult?
That's right
"Sister Bu Huei, he's your father"
My father?
How did you know I am here?
"As in every past year, I went to your home and see what had happened in there"
So I knew something must have gone wrong then I came here
where's your mother?
She's dead
Okay...
I have at last delivered you to your father
I can go to wu Dong myself
"Little brother, you..."
Never mind who I am you'll never see me again
Brother wu Ji what is it?
I hope to see you again
"Okay, if my wounds are healed"
I'll look for you
Farewell
It's so cold
Damn the Freezing Poison
"Grand teacher, I fear I won't be able to return to wu Dong to see you"
Don't run
"Bitch, see where you can run to?"
Don't kill me...
I ain't responsible for Gold  Silver Serpent's poison who else could it be?
"Madam, let her go"
She has been hit by the Deadly Dart of our Kwun Lun School
She is doomed
Tie it to Steve's leg.
"Now, I want everybody out of here."
We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
I'll get the men from the barracks.
You think you can snatch Dunbar?
Not from the S.S.
We're sure gonna make a stab at it.
"Duke, Price, Stosh, Harry, meet at the north latrine."
You'll all get your posts.
"Now, everybody start drifting out, one by one."
"Easy, boys, easy."
Disperse out there nicely.
"Remember, just because the Krauts are dumb that doesn't mean they're stupid."
- Ready?
-Roger.
"Okay, move out."
I don't know what your scheme is.
it sounds crazy.
"It may be, but it's better than having Dunbar dead."
I guess you're right.
How about me going out and keeping Schulz off balance?
- Good.
- I wouldn't worry about Schulz.
I'd worry about Sefton.
Remember me?
I'm the stoolie.
"You ain't gonna squeal this one, brother."
No?
Aren't you afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound?
"For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?"
"You're gonna stay here in the barracks, and not a peep out of you."
"Okay then, put a guard on me."
-You don't talk much.
-Neither do you.
You've figured it out haven't you?
"The less you say, the more people will reveal about themselves."
"Until little by little, they have divulged every last bit of who they are."
Because what people want most...
Is to be known.
"So, do you use that knowledge for good or for evil?"
I use it for myself.
Kiss me.
Where?
"Well, put your hands here, like that, and then"
I go like this.
"And you pull me in like that, and close your eyes."
-You wanna smoke a J?
"-No, that's not really my thing."
"You said you had a headache, though."
This is perfect for that.
"Honey, I'm already on so many painkillers;"
I don't need anything else.
"See, that's where you're wrong - marijuana is the safe alternative to that."
"Plus, you inhale it, so it works faster."
What the hell?
"Live dangerously, right?"
Ugh... it tastes like shit.
"No, no - it tastes good."
Actually I got it from my friend and he got it from a friend from another friend off the coast of Madagascar.
I guess it came up on a piece of driftwood.
I do feel better.
Is that- is that normal?
"Oh yeah, that's normal."
"Well, in that case."
What I will say is when we finished filming and I drove to the hotel
I always found myself getting into the Subaru.
I prefer the Impreza.
No idea why.
"It's like I prefer dark to milk chocolate,"
I prefer Bedford to Bruce Forsyth.
"Right, let's see if we can find out if there's any real difference between them on our test track."
Please say mushi mushi to Stig-San.
So first up the Impreza STi.
"This is the tweet one, remember."
And...
Oh dear.
"An emotional Stig this week, round Chicago."
This car does understeer so will that slow him down?
It is looking good so far.
Ooh.
He is...
He IS running wide there.
Into the penultimate corner.
"Come on, Stig, keep it tight."
There's loads of understeer and he goes round the finishing line!
Now what about the Evo VIII?
In the interests of fairness
I should say this isn't the car Jeremy drove in Scotland.
It's the 301bhp FQ version.
Very tidy round Chicago.
No trace of understeer as it smoothly powers through that hammer head.
TYRES SCREECH Good Lord!
"Screaming at the follow-through, a second faster than the Subaru."
Will it beat it?
Over the finish line.
I have the times here.
"They called me Minx, sent me to New York, and I sent money home to mother and she stopped crying."
That's when I learned that the best medicine is money.
Money.
I still dream of being a psychiatrist.
Because I think I could help people with their problems.
Really I do.
Do you?
"I've been developing my ideas, Michelangelo."
And I'm here to make a proposal to you.
I've seen your site.
"Yes, I have."
"I know my way around the web, all right."
"Now if you put your mind to it, you could become one of our brand-awareness operators, Michelangelo."
You could become... an influencer.
Do you know what that is?
That is a kid who sets a trend.
And we employ a lot of them.
"Now tell me, OK, honestly."
How many hits did your site have yesterday?
Wow!
Really?
"You see, I knew that the youth market was the niche to explore."
It is just where the numbers are...
"Except for the ageing population, of course."
Wow!
That just came to me.
Geriatrics!
"They sure need fragrance, right?"
"See, Michelangelo, you have to think ahead in the world of the new."
That's a pity it's not called N.
"""N is for new."""
But then that wouldn't work for the old.
You know that.
"Does it really matter, Jamal?"
It don't matter if it matters.
It's corporate.
Take it to go.
Can I have my check?
Wipe that down before you leave.
Is this both weeks?
Jamal:
Same as always.
"You don't know me, but this is not me."
I don't suffer complicated women.
"But Laura, you know, she's got me..."
She's got me making exceptions.
So this chick lives in the same house she lived in with her ex?
Yes.
- And he owns the house.
- Correct.
- And they're not fucking?
- Nope.
"So he's giving her a dope house for free, taking her to all these high-end events, and she's not giving it up?"
"Yo, I got to find me a guy like this."
You think she's full of shit?
"Look, I don't know her."
"No, but I'm asking for your opinion 'cause my instincts are askew."
"No dude's ever given me anything for free, period."
"If she's fucking him, I don't know when she's doing it because I'm with her all the fucking time."
"Well, she's not with you now."
"What, you don't think people fuck during the daytime?"
[Blender whirring]
Of course.
"I mean, people fuck at all times."
"You see,"
I'm here to discuss the Box Tunnel 20.
Come on.
Home sweet home.
It's a shit-hole.
"Yes, but it's our shit-hole, so show some manners."
"I could tell you many stories about cheap BB's like this, George, many stories."
And I don't want to hear any of them.
"- Well, hello."
"- Oh, I thought I heard the door."
"Well, did you hear my heart begin to beat a little faster?"
"No, no."
"No, definitely the door."
You sure it wasn't the buttons on my fly pinging off one by one?
"You know, because of... my lob-on?"
"Oh, you filthy little..."
"- Annie, this is Adam."
- Hello.
Adam is a vampire.
- Isn't that fantastic
- Yeah.
Adam is going to be staying with us for as short a time as possible.
Upstairs.
You can find a room to sit and think about the way you've just behaved.
"- Catch you later, sweet cheeks."
- Go.
- Don't ask.
- OK.
Have you any idea of the trouble your little escapade has caused?
"I mean, have you seen a newspaper in the last four weeks?"
"This is the biggest manhunt for a century, and you're strutting around in broad daylight."
What happens when the police catch up with you?
That's why it's Yiddish.
I didn't know you'd taken up the language.
Abe laid it on me.
Abe's a good man.
"You're a good man, Pappy."
Underneath that Louisiana cane syrup plain red dirt.
"Not that different from the pavements of Astoria, where I'm from."
You and me are sticking by Judge Walter Stern.
"Man, thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return."
If there's anything I can do please feel free to call.
- Thank you.
- It's the least we can do.
Good morning.
Where's the mayor?
He had to go Washington on convention business.
This rates an inspector's funeral and that includes the mayor.
The mayor's absence in no way diminishes his concern for Mrs. Santos and her children.
Where'd they get all that stuff from in the newspapers?
At school they tell my girl her daddy was a drug dealer.
We'll get our press people right on it.
What about Internal Affairs?
What are those clowns doing?
Where you going?
- City.
- I thought we were in the city.
Not if you're from Queens.
Let's start over.
Where you going?
Manhattan.
Hop in.
Go fuck yourself.
"Not to be disrespectful but the Transportation Department wasn't prepared for 1,000 people."
Her and my grandpa own a bunch of them.
"This is supposed to be the model home, but it never got finished."
Why?
"Did someone die here, and now it's haunted?"
"Yes, that's exactly what happened."
What did happen?
I don't know.
How do contractors just disappear?
"If we don't have a model home, we don't have a new development."
It's been a month.
I'm not waiting for you guys anymore.
You know where to reach me.
No luck with the contractors?
Vanished.
My father's never gonna let me hear the end of this.
Did you talk to Seth?
I think so.
But don't blame yourself.
I'm not blaming myself.
But how can I allow a strange boy to live in this house?
Seth needs to know it's what any mother would do.
I was talking about the contractors.
So you want him to stay here?
"Well, I mean, I know the place needs some sprucing up, but..."
"God, did I just say ""sprucing""?"
"So, Ryan, what do you think?"
I haven't really had time to think.
But how much better is this place than some group home?
And wait till you see the best part.
It's an empty pool.
To some people.
"So, your mom."
These people can make putting on your pants seem like a criminal conspiracy.
Forget it.
You had to be in the room to understand.
Okay.
Sorry.
- Did something happen in this room?
- l just told you what happened.
"I know, but you sounded like you were afraid, like something happened."
I don't know if you're afraid you can't tell me or that you have to protect me.
"I mean, I just..."
- l don't know what I'm saying.
"- You know that I'm with you, right?"
"I mean, God forbid you were to get indicted or, worst-case scenario..."
"- l don't know, that..."
- Say it.
- Say what?
- Go ahead.
Say it.
"Worst-case scenario, I go to prison."
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That is what you were saying.
- Am I going to prison?
- You're not.
"If I am, then how does that affect you and your kids"
- and whether you marry me or not?
- No.
I would think about it too.
"You should be, because I sure am."
You're scaring me now.
I don't want to talk to you when you're like this.
"It's okay. I... I feel like I should go home, anyway."
- l don't think you should.
I'm too small for Twister.
And roller coasters.
And sitting with my feet on the floor.
"Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom."
"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine."
"Hey, look, I have peach schnapps."
Thank God.
"Guys, something happened."
What's wrong?
I think a boy likes me.
"""Hi."
It's Stuart.
"""We met at the comic book store."
"""I was wondering if you'd like"
"""to get coffee sometime."
"""It's okay if you say no."
"""It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft."""
"Amy, little vixen."
Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.
What are you going to do?
Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?
"Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend;"
she has a Sheldon.
So do you like Stuart?
I don't know.
He's nice.
He's funny.
"He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland."
That's kind of hot.
"Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you've been with him over a year now."
"If it's not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
"Well, yeah, I guess they're not engaged like me and Howie."
I was afraid of people walking in the streets.
"The more movement I saw around me, the more I wanted to be still."
I'm sure things weren't as bad as I remember them now.
Are you coming to the rehearsal?
-Well...
One of the songs is going to amaze you.
Then I'll go for sure.
Even now I can't understand everything that happened back then.
I felt such panic I wanted to go back to the madhouse.
Stop thinking about it.
The funniest thing was when Laura left that guy...
She almost reproached me for my apathy.
Are you writing in your diary?
How do you know I have a diary?
You told me.
I'm sure I didn't tell you anything.
But are you writing it?
Yes.
And what is it about?
About what happens to me.
Some stuff.
You're not very talkative today.
I'm upset.
With me?
With mom.
Don't tell her about the diary.
I won't.
You always end up telling her everything.
- I won't say a word.
She'd start asking... and as I won't say anything she'd look for it everywhere.
Did you hide it?
Don't think I'm gonna tell you where it is.
"Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear old princie to fall in love with you."
"That is, he's got to kiss you."
"Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love."
"If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently."
"But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid... and... you belong to me!"
"No, Ariel!"
[muffled]
Have we got a deal?
"If I become human,"
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
That's right!
But you'll have your man.
"[Chuckles] Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?"
[Cackles]
Oh!
And there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing.
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.
"Just a token really, a trifle."
You'll never even miss it.
What I want from you is... your voice.
- My voice?
"- You've got it, sweetcakes."
"No more talking, singing."
Zip!
"But without my voice, how can I..."
"You'll have your looks, your pretty face."
And don't underestimate the importance of body language!
Ha!
♪ The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
Be my guest.
"I'm not sure if Kai will let you be his, but you might as well try."
Hold on a second!
Hold on a second!
"Yeah, what?"
It's funny.
I think was expecting someone more...
Charming.
"You know, for a rock star."
May I come in?
Who are you?
"Dr. Tom, Erica's therapist."
Thanks.
"So, what, are you tag-teaming me now?"
Huh?
"So, Dr. Fred sent you in here to talk me back on the straight and narrow, convince me I'm destroying my life?"
Erica ever mention to you that she had a brother?
No.
"Well, he died 10 years ago in a tragic accident, one that Erica tried to go back and prevent by twisting this therapy into something that it's not."
Did it work?
What do you think?
So...
"Well, explain to me, Kai... what is it that you want, exactly?"
To disappear.
Why?
"I mean, what is it that you figure that's gonna do?"
"It's gonna make things better for everybody, including me."
"Well, it seems to me you've tried that already, though,"
Haven't you?
"I mean, you ran away from your whole life."
"And yet, here you are again... running."
"Um, I'm just wondering where it ends."
He's like...
"I guess like all treasure hunters, I mean, a little bit on the secretive side, you know."
"Youknow, I don't know how Dan reallyseesFred'spassing."
"But, look, they both persevered intheface of all kinds of adversity."
"Theyrisked,theysweated, they worked, they labored towards the common goal."
You don't get any closer than that.
"So,tothatend ,Iguess, theywerecloser than they thought."
"You know, whenever Rick would talk about this place, it was always about, well,"
Blankenship's doing this and Nolan's doing that.
"But we always thought, or it was our hope,"
- that we could work together.
- Yeah.
- It was my belief that we could.
"- Well, we did."
We did work together.
"Sounds like, to me, that you see it, and I think we all do really, we see Oak Island as a big giant puzzle."
"I know that Fred told me once that that's how he saw it,"
-a big giant puzzle.
-That's why they call it
- the Oak Island mystery.
-Exactly.
"So, you know, we got to get busy and start putting pieces into the right places."
- Amen.
- Amen.
- All right.
"- Okay, Dan."
"Okay, off we go."
We'll get back to work.
Yeah.
"Hey, remember, you're not going anywhere."
Okay.
"See you, Daniel."
"- Uh, yeah."
We got rid of that.
Okay?
- Yeah.
"Anyway, speaking of engaged, check out what got back from being resized."
"Oh, my God."
Look at the size of that rock.
"Barney, you don't start with the ""I got caught cheating"" diamond."
You give yourself room to grow.
- It's a family heirloom.
- Yeah.
I got a few dirty looks from Barney's half sister over Christmas.
So I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully that she can suck it.
Okay.
I gotta bounce.
- Stop saying that.
- This deejay from Dubai... is spinning at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.
So what if my friends thought it was doomed?
I was still young.
And I knew that a night of partying with a girl over a decade younger than me...
- would be a total...
- Disaster.
"I mean, she's like an entirely different species."
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.
"To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs."
Didn't you check your phone?
"I just ""means of contacting"" you on ""currently hot social networking site."""
"The show's been moved to ""New York neighborhood you've never heard of."""
Oh.
Wow.
She was a blackmailer.
And I killed her.
"And up to now, I'm glad I killed her."
And I believe that in this killing the murderer has the sympathetic part.
Does that satisfy you?
"Yes, sir."
That satisfies me.
"Lieutenant, you would do me an enormous favor if you stopped calling me sir."
Are you tired of living?
Yes?
What do you want?
Who is it?
Let me look at it
Don't you recognize me?
I am Man Si Sun
You sent me your photo and I sent you mine
Look at it I know you
"I know you're coming today, Uncle Chow called earlier"
"You've got guts, it's different here now"
The law has been changed
Both you and I will be in trouble if someone sees you
"Besides, Hong Kong is not as good as they say"
You'd better go
Mrs. Lee
Good morning
Your daughter is going to school at such a young age?
She's almost three
Kindergarten education costs a lot
One thousand five hundred dollars a month lt's much more expensive than hiring a Filipino maid ls she your relative?
No...she's got the wrong place I won't be bothering you
Let's do it this way I've got a hundred dollars here
What's the deputy head like?
"Teaches natural history, very good teacher."
He kicked up a bit of a fuss and then said:
Can't you hold on for the last few days?
Do you like any of the girls in the class?
I've only been in this class for a year.
- Only a year?
- l was in another class.
And in that class?
Do you like going to the cinema?
Not really.
"They're showing the BlackTulip, everyone's been... lt's excellent."
Aren't you going to see it?
I don't know.
Would you like to go?
"Well, I... I'd like to."
Today it's on at half past three.
"Calmly, that's the Reverie."
That's a strange Reverie.
Will you ask your parents or shall we go without permission?
I can say I'm going to the cinema.
They'll let me go.
Won't they object to you going with a girl?
"I'll say we're going with the class, after all, we do that."
So we'll meet and go.
Where shall we meet?
I don't know.
That'll do...
That's the Reverie.
Won't it be awkward if we go to the cinema?
Won't some girl be jealous?
It'd be my first time like that.
Trevor Nigel.
And you must be Richard Castle.
- Yes.
- We've only ever talked on the phone.
Yeah.
Nice to finally put a face to all those notes.
Thank you so much for seeing us without an appointment.
Are you kidding me?
This is fate.
"I'm serious, Rick."
Your name literally just came up in our last story-development meeting.
It did?
"Now, look, I know this studio did a poor job producing Heatwave, but believe me, I fought for your vision."
"And now that I am running the studio, it is time to get back in the Richard Castle business."
"Oh, uh, well, thank you."
I'm flattered.
[Cellphone chiming] But we're not actually here about my books.
We're actually looking into the murder of Phillip Harris.
"Yes, I heard about that."
It was shocking.
Phil was a great guy.
He saved my ass a couple of years ago.
Got photos of my ex having an affair with our personal psychic.
- Oh.
- Saved me millions.
"[Chiming continues] So, Phillip's sister told us that you gave him permission to go undercover here at the studio."
Yes.
Phil said he was working a new case.
He asked for a favor.
"I owed him one, so I said okay."
Who was he investigating?
He wanted access to Austin Elektra.
"Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair."
But I can barely see without these.
- Come on.
"- Well, these were expensive."
Let's start the bidding.
So you didn't think this was a date?
"No, not really."
Why?
Is it a date?
I thought it was a date.
"No, it's not a date."
- What about the regards?
- Regards don't mean anything.
"I mean, it's not like I said hi."
"I mean, the fact is I shouldn't say anything."
"- No, tell me."
- Can you keep a secret?
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick.
But he was so brave and gained such a wonderful perspective on life.
I fell in love with him.
"Yeah, he's got some perspective there."
"- Hey, you know what the whip does?"
- What whip?
The whip in the Senate and the House.
"Well, in the old days when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted them to, they whipped them."
"""You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble."""
"She won't talk to anyone, huh?"
"Oh, no, she won't say a word to anybody."
"Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack."
"Well, well, the white whale."
Miss!
The two days are up.
"Still no news of him, something bad must have happened."
What should we do now?
"Miss, it's best if we return to BuYeo first."
It doesn't help if we stay here all day.
I... am going to the bandit's hideout myself.
Miss!
"This is not like you, what's wrong?"
What was I like last time?
You were fast and precise.
Sometimes you outshine even the Chief himself.
"Now, you can't even get your priorities right."
You think I'm taking a blind risk?
It's no different from suicide.
What plans do you have?
!
Don't worry.
"After I heard Prince Ju-Mong went to their hideout,"
I regretted not thinking of it earlier.
"As long as I can get Bae-Mang to drop his grudge against me,"
Then we wouldn't have to go back to BuYeo.
"When I was little,"
I remember Father used to tell me this...
"As a merchant,"
One must learn to make business even with an enemy.
I had forgotten the fact that I was a merchant.
You're saying you want to trade with the bandits?
Why not?
"Uncle,"
Please look after the fleet.
Sa-Yong and I will go to the bandit's hideout.
-How's it going?
"I'm okay, thank you, ish."
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
Yeah.
"So is that right, your mum's been sent to prison?"
"Like, what was it?"
Charges of fraud and gross malfeasance.
-Sounds as if you know all about it.
"-And so she's, like, banged up in there with all those slags and ratbags, like in Bad Girls?"
-It's not quite like that actually in real life.
"-I know, but...."
"Well, she's a pretty major criminal though, yeah?"
-She have to wear one of those uniforms?
"-Yeah, with all the arrows all over it."
Yeah!
"So, what are you doing this afternoon 'cause we're just hanging out?"
"Yeah, I mean, do you fancy coffee?"
"Yeah, of course."
"No, of course I want you to."
It's just I can't make tomorrow or Saturday.
That's all.
How about Sunday?
No.
"No, that would be perfect."
"Oh, my gosh, you'll never guess...."
"There's no question it's been the making of her, this whole business with her mother."
Seems to have turned her into a major celebrity overnight.
I know.
She's got five dates so far on the strength of it to my certain knowledge.
"Kids, I don't know."
Another world.
Almost never happens.
You know that almost never happens.
"- Hey, where's garrity?"
- He's got the flu.'
"Missing black shawn, now we're missing white shawn."
We're 2 shawns down.
We had to take him to the hospital.White shawn.
- For the flu?
"- He was pissing blood, dude."
"Nah, nah, you don't piss blood when you got the flu."
You piss blood when you got something like gonorrhea.
You do?
Me?
"No.No, no, no."
I never have.
"That's what I heard happens to people who have gonorrhea, which I've never had.Obviously."
I think he had gonorrhea.
"Once, ok."
"Jesus, just once."
One and a half times.
The second time doesn't count because I was just a carrier.
"- Dude, that was awesome."
"- Ahh, we did all right."
"The engine had a dry hydrant which delayed our primary searches, which is why the chief had to call a second alarm.but, most of the apartments above were vacant, which is why we didn't find any roasts."
- Roasts?
- Dead guys.
"Oh, yeah, roasts."
"Hey, let me get in there, you know, check out the damage."
"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, come on, mike."
Let me in there.
"I mean, the stimulator at school, it's for pussies."
What we get is just the leftovers.
"If we don't get even that now, should we beg?"
Look!
I'm the one who gets directly involved.
I'm the one who takes the maximum risk.
You and him...
You will not get caught for sure.
If I get caught...
I'm done.
Don't cry like a kid.
Go and see what needs to be done.
"If Vasundhara gets to know, we will get into trouble."
The chances of her knowing are very low.
She is with Manoj now.
She will not search for us.
This is the only opportunity we will get.
If we continue like this...
She will treat us like dogs forever.
We can't gain anything from being like that.
Don't think too much.
I have planned everything.
"Talk your girl, Divya."
She has to come.
She must not disclose these details to anyone.
Got it?
Where were you?
You weren't in Kanyakumari for the past 2 days...
"Since we had no work here, we had gone to Kerala."
What is your Manoj saying?
"You left me alone with him, and went on a vacation?"
"You said that if we lure Manoj with money and wealth, we can easily trap him."
He is least bothered about it.
"I'm sorry, Mike."
ROBERTS:
"I'll get hurt in vesting, at least I'll get partial pension."
Maybe it's for the best.
Wife's coming up.
Got the middle daughter in a ballet recital.
"You know, used to come a time if I went to this recital..."
"... I'dhavemyselfpaged,find  an excuse to go over to Dee Dee's."
"Now I get to see the whole dance of the Enchanted Field Mice, whatever it is."
You want to see me?
You get those test results back?
"Close the door, Larson."
Let me have your gun and your shield.
What for?
Your tests came back with multiple positives.
Steroids--
Hold it.
"Now, steroids are not on the banned-substances list."
Methamphetamines are.
There is no way I tested positive for meth.
That's gotta be wrong.
Testing's sophisticated now.
Can't cover your tracks with sudafedrin.
You're terminated as of tomorrow.
You report to 1 Police Plaza...
... forout-processingin themorning.
Your gun and your shield.
This is a setup.
"If you think that I am gonna sit still for this, you are crazy."
"I am gonna get a lawyer, and I'm gonna sue your asses."
You have two guns listed.
Give the other one to the sergeant before you leave.
"they keep asking about you, what you know."
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
I know where the Ark is Marion.
The Ark is here?
Well I'm coming with you Jones!
"Get me out of here, Cut me loose!"
You can't leave me here!
If I take you out of here now they will start combing the place for us.
Jones you got to get me out of here!
Are you crazy?
You know that I hate to do this.
"You just Sit still, keep quiet."
This whole thing is going to be shut.
I'll be back to get you.
That's it.
"Who knows, perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some anti chamber for us to discover."
Perhaps it's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
"She was in possession of the original piece for years, she may know much if properly motivated."
I tell you the girl knows nothing.
I'm surprised to find you squeamish that is not your reputation.
"But it needn't concern you, I have the perfect man for this kind of work."
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We hit stone!
Clear it off.
Come on find the edges.
"Good, good, good."
You see Indy?
What do you expect?
Freakin' animals.
"Like ""Apocalypse Now"" down there."
Like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
"Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?"
"You don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards, you send him home."
"I was, you know, ""He's out getting an evidence bag, and so ends up without a scratch on him."
"So must be something wrong with that picture""."
So are you home for good?
"No, no."
Playing it by ear.
"""To be determined."""
Think you might want to
- talk it through with somebody?
- What?
A shrink?
"No, no."
I can't.
"Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye."
Or Marie.
"Or me, if you like."
"You know,"
I don't know how to say this.
"You know, the things I deal with, you and me don't have much of a... what you might call an experiential overlap."
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
"Frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen."
50 years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis...
- And the goods are still in the safe?
- Oh yes!
"Don't fret, if anything goes wrong, we'll do the fire brigade!"
"Don't get any funny ideas, you leach!"
"""Story by:"""
"See, you bunch of jerks?"
"Oh, shit!"
Tell me again how you pull these things off?
"I've put the luggage in coach 15, compartment 21!"
"And for the first time in history, even the train from Hungary is on time!"
"If I had wheels, I'd always be on time."
Hey cornflake!
Do you breathe at night?
"In Budapest, we hoped that everything was better here - even sleep."
Is that why you're wearing your best pajamas?
These are all I have.
I'm not rich.
"But, my mother was French."
Is French all you speak?
"He speaks lingo with his mouth, Yugoslav with his hands,"
"Japanese with his feet, Arabic with the ladies, and French with his..."
Fuck!
Drop it!
Drop what?
"It means, crawl off, like when you stamp on something creepy with your clog."
You dig clogs?
of course!
"Clogs, dig..."
Me... my father died a year back.
"My mother three months later, because she loved him."
We need foreign invitations to leave Hungary.
"The daughter of the sister of my mother who is a movie star - do you say ""star""?"
"Lost thousands in company stock, he was recently laid off, and if Wickes Steel goes under, he will likely lose his pension."
SECNAV's green plan ruined this guy.
Sounds like a motive to me.
McGEE:
"If Ridgeway did it, he had help."
There's no way he's got the skills to break through AUTEC's firewall.
I found a post of his on a PC forum asking what a cookie is.
(laughs) Old people.
Old people entertain me.
"I can tell you Wickes didn't have the know-how to pull off this AUTEC job, either."
I think we're looking at a team.
So you determined from the interview that Wickes is involved?
(clears throat)
My findings were inconclusive.
GIBBS:
Any contact between Wickes and Ridgeway?
Not a peep out of Wickes since we let him go.
Wickes is a chess player.
It doesn't surprise me that he's taking some time before he makes his next move.
"McGee, get me a location on Ridgeway."
On it.
"DiNozzo, Ziva, get going."
"Oh, um, instead of"
"Wink Martindale here,"
I think I'd like to send Elliott.
TONY:
Wink?
"Come on, at least go Chuck Woolery."
"No, let me at him."
I'm the king of non-verbal indicators.
"Yes, he is."
"Unless, of course, somebody blocks his view."
I just want a mate.
You just want to mate?
!
I just want a mate.
"You're not mating with me, sunshine!"
"A mate, I want a mate."
"Well, just as well, because I'm not having any of that nonsense."
"I mean, you're just a long streak of nothing, you know, alien nothing."
"There we are, then."
Okay.
I think the pair of them together were pretty amazing.
It proves that you don't need to have romantic tension to have a male and a female character with a dynamic relationship.
"Oh, ha ha!"
That's just -- car keys.
What?
I've still got my mum's car keys.
I won't be a minute.
"Donna's end, as a companion, broke my house."
My wife and I were just inconsolable.
"She basically becomes a Time Lord herself, but, because she's physically human, she can't handle it and her brain's going to burn and the Doctor has to wipe her memory of everything they've done together."
Don't make me go back.
"Doctor, please, please, don't make me go back!"
Donna.
"Oh, Donna Noble, I am so sorry."
But we had the best of times.
The best.
Goodbye.
"No, no, no, please."
"Please, no, no."
No!
No!
She was a receptionist.
Well...
I get that.
It's an important case.
I gotta go.
"Nice to meet you, Ms. Lee."
"Hey, tell everyone I said hi, okay?"
"Yeah, you bet."
Bye.
Let's get back to work.
(siren wailing)
"The victim is Corporal Jared Connors, 28,"
Fourth Marine Division.
"Drove here regularly when he was on leave, he even raced in the amateur circuit a few times."
Experienced driver.
Apparently.
"Him and the girlfriend, Dana Wells, were the only drivers on the track when he crashed."
Lost control of his car?
"Yeah, except his father thinks he was murdered."
Russ Connors is a mechanic on one of the racing teams.
Told the sheriffs he's convinced the car was sabotaged.
Sabotage?
Why does he think that?
"Well, I didn't get to talk to him."
"He got cut pretty bad taking his son out of the wreck, so..."
Paramedics took and the girlfriend to the hospital.
Think that's case-related?
More like trouble in paradise.
I don't think he and Melody are getting along right now.
"Well, it can't be easy..."
"Woman pops into his life, surprises him with a baby."
At least Lasalle's trying to do the right thing.
"Just wish it didn't affect his work so much, undermanned as it is."
Hurry Up!
One more!
"Oh, thank you all!"
I've got a copy!
Have a good trip!
-Sissy boy.
-Sissy boy !
"Oh, awesome!"
Awesome!
Eh Robbie?
Just when I thought it was over!
"...in a concert, it said the show included foul language and obscene gestures but the band calls the cancellation unfair..."
"I saw a kid with lipstick on I dont know if it was for me, but it was weird."
Twiggy brought this!
Dont bring that here!
-Dude you can make love to that.
-Danny?
"That smell, where did it come from?"
good (?
) in a drink.
"Im so good looking, I can put a rubber on and still get laid."
"From the look of the sores of your lips, you might want to put 2 on."
I still recall the taste of my tears.
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.
Scraping through my head 'till i don't want to sleep... anymore.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just to thing, and i'm starting to scare myself."
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
"[stammers] It really meant a lot to me to have a lot of you there, especially so soon after the loss of my other dog, Noir."
But that's not what I really wanna talk about this morning.
"No, I wanna talk about another best friend that I lost recently."
He went out.
And it was a surprise.
"And it hurt, you know, that it happened."
And that he didn't tell me.
And that he lied to me.
It just really shook me up.
He was my Eskimo.
He got me sober.
I just thought that we could tell each other the truth.
"But today, I'm trying to focus on the positives."
I have this new business venture that I'm really excited about.
And I'm just trying to be grateful.
So thank you.
I'm really happy to be here.
[applause]
"All right, I think that's all we got time for."
Unless someone has a burning desire?
No?
"All righty, let's do the prayer."
"Man, I'm sorry to hear about the dogs."
Really.
- Condolences.
- God... [all] ...grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.
"The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."
No.
Not the seat.
Motherfucking...
"Aw, fuck off."
[mutters] Motherfucking...
- They want your name off the bill.
They want your name off it.
They love this bill.
Helping the poor learn computers so they can lift themselves up by the bootstraps?
"It gets voted out of committee unanimously, but it's an election year."
When is it not an election year?
I like what Daniel Webster said when the Whig Party offered him vice president:
"""I do not propose to be buried until I am dead."""
I used to be every Republican's favorite Democrat.
"- Screw it, Sam."
"- Absolutely, Mr. Vice President."
Let's take my name off it.
"Yes, sir."
- Where's Secretary Fisher?
- He can't make it tonight.
- Excuse me?
- The secretary's at an NGA reception at the Willard Hotel.
She says he can see you tomorrow.
- She?
- His scheduler.
- You paged him.
- She called back.
Call Fisher or his scheduler and say:
"""I want the secretary here in half an hour to talk about moving his announcement to the briefing room because we have more TV cameras."""
- Because we have...
The most dangerous place in Washington is between Bill Fisher and a TV camera.
Clean as a whistle.
- Thank you.
- Molly Morello.
When was the last time I asked you for anything?
"- By the way, I found this."
- What?
"Come on, I'll drive you out there."
John?
"Oh, Vera!"
"Come in, my dear."
"Or come out, whichever it is."
I wasn't expecting you till next weekend.
Then you don't mind my surprising you?
Still the same Vera.
Just the same.
You might have caught me making up to one of the nurses.
"Here, sit down, my dear, sit down."
"How are you feeling, John?"
I've quite taken to this sort of life.
It's rather pleasant.
"Painting, talking, just taking it easy."
"You know, I never realized how uncomfortable a starched collar could be till I started wearing these."
"Of course, they'd..."
They'd never do in business.
"John, you haven't mentioned the business."
I'm sure Harold is doing excellently.
He's a very clever young man.
"A little erratic, but I dare say he's learning."
"Well, he's doing the best he can, but he needs help."
Maybe you could advise him.
I don't see how I could do that.
I've been out of touch too long.
"Nearly a year, isn't it?"
Just about.
Too many things change in that time.
I don't know what conditions are.
"No, no, Harold's right there."
He knows more about it than I do now.
"Now look, you listen to me."
I did not kill my wife.
"You want to know who took Sara Collins, don't waste your time talking to me."
Talk to the senator.
Why would I do that?
Because he knows who did.
You think you know what's going on.
You haven't even sucked one drop off the tip of that iceberg.
"Listen, your wife was alive for two months before they killed her."
"Now, either they wanted something from her... or they wanted something from you."
Best way to get to a man is through the woman he loves.
That's how they control you.
Who?
Do you know how she was killed?
We believe she was drowned.
Where?
"Oh, my God...!"
This is all my fault.
It won't end.
You give Jeff Collins a message from me.
He can fry in hell.
No!
It was a damn witness interview.
I did not see that coming.
"Graham, there was nothing you could've done."
I pushed him there.
You don't push someone to take their own life after a two-minute interview.
"If you keep beating yourself up, you're no good to this case and you know it."
All due respect.
Did you get a sense of what might have set them off.
Guilt.
Guilt?
Here we are.
Till death do us part.
Of course the security guard didn't see me.
I was asleep on the sofa.
"Are you sure that's where you were, Tom?"
You didn't go home instead?
Get into an argument?
No.
But she was angry with you?
We were happy.
Didn't stop you playing away though?
I wouldn't.
I loved her.
"You loved her so much, you had to change the bed sheets?"
You know where that bed sheet is now?
It's in our lab being tested.
"What are they gonna find, Tom?"
A loving fiance or a cheating liar?
Guv wants a word.
Interview suspended at 9:50.
Greenwich just called.
A woman's been attacked outside her flat by a minicab driver.
You think there's a link?
Victim is a temp at the forensic service lab where Kelly worked.
I was working late.
So I didn't want to risk the walk to the tube.
And there was this minicab parked up right near where I work.
He said he'd just dropped someone off.
Can you remember the name of the cab company?
"No, I'm sorry."
"He took you back to your place, yeah?"
I was halfway down the steps to my flat before I realised he was behind me.
And you're going to write down the stats that go on the window tomorrow.
Marcus is gonna come by and pick up the photo for safekeeping.
Wait-Wait a second.
I am not going to repeat myself!
"The three of you are going to sit right there, just like that on the couch so I know you're behaving."
And you tell no one about this.
"We wouldn't want anyone messing with our little golden goose here, huh?"
"Now, would we?"
I want 50%.
(CHUCKLES)
You take a zero off that number.
That still makes you a very lucky man.
"Yeah, I feel real lucky."
We didn't agree to this.
"(SIGHS) You should have talked to us, man."
"I did my best, okay?"
Don't sit on the car.
"Listen, this isn't the city."
They're a different breed of snob up here.
It's academia.
Academia nuts.
(LAUGHS)
I fail to understand the distinction.
"Yeah, I do, too, sometimes."
It's been really awful.
I consider you my good friend.
I appreciate that.
But you'll soon find how little that counts for.
I'm not referring to myself.
But there's a lot of assholes out there.
"Less up here than in the city, but it's all relative."
You say it yourself.
Sergeant Major Seo ended up going to his ex-girlfriend's wedding.
Together with Myeong Joo.
"If you're curious about what happened after, follow me."
Together?
Why did Yoon Myung Joo go?
What's wrong?
Congratulations on crashing your ex-girlfriend's wedding.
"Lucky for you, I'm also off duty."
Isn't that a relief?
I asked what was wrong.
Is my question hard to answer?
Is my answer hard?
If you keep on wrecking her wedding the Sergeant Seo way she'll probably be relieved for breaking up with you.
There's no way she'd regret it.
"But if you go with me, we can make her regret all night."
That was what my answer meant.
It's tempting.
But I have a condition.
"First, turn the rear mirror around."
She's an expert at breaking couples.
But what was the condition?
"From here, I appear."
The person that my father sees as husband material is coming in as a lieutenant.
My father said he was my upperclassman in the army.
He already came.
It's been two days since he came.
He came fast.
"Anyways, say that you're dating me."
You don't like Yoo Si Jin?
His appearance isn't my style.
He looks like a girl.
Cooperate?
Dr.Roncero. Psychiatrist.
7th Left.
Twenty three.
The day I spent waiting at the window was the day she wouldn't come.
But I knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist.
Dr.Roncero's office.
I'd like to make an appointment.
Does tomorrow at 5:00 suit you?
- Can't it be sooner?
"- No, tomorrow at 5:00."
All right.
Your name?
What's up?
- I've got an appointment at 5:00.
- Come in.
Don't stand there!
Excuse me.
- Benigno Martin?
- Yes.
I have to get some details.
"I just wanted to see Alicia again, but as I was there and her father was a psychiatrist"
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
"- The last fifteen years, you said?"
- Yes.
I started when I was very young.
And during those fifteen years you did nothing but look after your mother?
I never left her side.
"Well, I studied to be a nurse so I had to go out to attend classes."
"I also studied beauty therapy, make-up and hairdressing, but by mail."
You mean you did your mother's make-up and her hair?
"Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails and I scrubbed her down well, front and back."
"My mother wasn't disabled, or mad."
"demonstrations by workers, farmers, small business owners, to say nothing of ecologists, and the movement keeps growing."
The Ministry of the Future intends to delve into the problem by visiting the region in coming days to better understand the situation.
"Isn,t there... any toast or anything?"
Want me to make some?
shall I make some toast?
"No, don,t bother."
Are you nuts?
"What,s going on up there?"
"You,re not hurt, I hope."
What the heck -
"What,s going on?"
"It was a farmers,protest."
"They,re gone now."
"Who,II clean this up?"
"I,m all alone here today!"
Can I come out?
Can you believe it?
"They,re nuts!"
"It,s dramatic"
"What,s going on?"
"The minister,s coming, and nothing,s ready."
No one told us about it.
What do you mean?
You got a memo announcing his visit a month ago.
"There it is, on the wall."
- Right.
"The same one that says that in six months we,d get a raise and be promoted to level B-4 and never work over 40 hours a week."
"Where,s that replacement crew you promised?"
"We,re here 24 hours a day."
Listen.
"We,II discuss your demands later."
AII I can say is the minister arrives in five minutes.
With the wedding chapel on it.
Would you guys find it!
"I love you, Roger."
"I love you, Babs."
Barbara!
You creep!
Babs!
Coach!
Enough!
"Ah, Magnum."
There you are.
"You realize, of course, you have no chance of winning."
"Well, Buddy's not saying a word."
Catching him with a gun is enough.
The guy's a three-time loser.
You know they're gonna put him away for life... probably 300 years.
"And the money, they still haven't found it?"
Roger didn't exactly give them a pinpoint location.
They're liable to be digging up that place till the next Iron Man race.
He seemed sure it was in the Bougainvillea Priscilla.
They'll find it.
And then we'll get married and go back to Bayonne.
"And I'll open an exercise school, and he'll open a little tropical flower shop."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
And everybody will come out of this pile of bat guano smelling like a rose except me.
"Just think, man, I'm the one that put up the money to sponsor you."
"You forget, Robin Masters made a sizable contribution without expecting any publicity for it."
Robin?
What about me?
"I put up the food, the booze, the potato chips."
"Stop it, all of you."
Tom did his best.
It's Eskimo or something.
BELL:
All clear!
No one's home.
It's freezing in here.
Is there a window open somewhere?
"Yeah, in the bedroom."
Otolik's an Inuit name.
The address he registered with the front desk is well north of the Arctic Circle.
So you can imagine he likes things a little chilly.
"His companion, on the other hand, might've preferred things a bit warmer."
His companion?
"Yeah, long brown hair."
Looks like Tendu spent the night in someone's warm embrace.
Before they went out the window.
Hand and shoe prints.
HOLMES:
Male and female.
So I find people rarely exit rooms via windows when they're not fleeing for their lives.
"Perhaps Owen Tuchman's killer paid them a visit, too."
That's one possibility.
The other is that they were worried that someone would catch them with this.
Looks like the murder weapon.
BELL:
"If that's a garden tool, it's not like one I've ever seen."
That is a hakapik.
(camera clicks)
It's a seal-killing club favored by the Inuits.
"Judging by this inscription, it is a going-away present, a little memento from home."
This hook matches O.G.'s head wounds.
I'm gonna put out a Finest Message.
Looks like we got a suspect.
I'll have to go back to work soon.
This woman isn't well.
"Benigno, please."
You know what I mean.
Her skin's really dry.
Let's see.
Here it is.
Have you talked to her?
"No, and don't go on about it."
"Goodbye, Lydia."
You have to be patient with him.
Work hard.
"""Shrinking Lover""."
Rosa's got the flu.
I hope she didn't give it to you.
I'm glad you're feeling well.
"Even so, I'll give you a massage, and a rubdown with rosemary alcohol."
"No, I'm all right."
Last night I saw a film... that disturbed me.
"It was a love story, between Aif redo, who's a bit overweight, like me, but a nice guy, and Amparo, his girlfriend, who's a scientist."
Amparo is working on an experimental diet formula that will revolutionize the world of nutrition.
You're selfish.
You only think of yourself.
I've got it!
It could be dangerous.
I still haven't tested it on humans.
Do you still think I'm selfish?
It's done wonders for you!
"Don't worry, my love!"
I'll find the antidote!
But time went by.
"Despite her efforts, Amparo couldn't find the antidote and poor Aif redo was shrinking daily."
Just getting to know the city.
Is this a good spot?
"Well, you have to go where the darts are if you're in a darts league."
Big darts game tonight?
Match.
It's called a darts match.
Big darts match tonight?
"You know, the game of darts goes back to the Battle of Agincourt in the 15th century."
The first dartboard was actually the cross section of a tree.
Wow.
You're a real enthusiast.
I kind of like history in general.
I like the perspective on why things happen.
Never been my favorite subject.
"I do love old movies, like ""Casablanca."""
"That's kind of history, right?"
"Ms. Keyes, you are a breath of fresh air."
Call me Saffron.
We're not at work.
"Gary, more vodka shooters before I take your money."
"Your turn, big guy."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, my turn, my turn."
"And, um, when I come back, will you teach me how to shoot a dart?"
"Okay, but are you sure you don't want the reigning champ to teach you?"
Positive.
I imagine Gary knows what he's doing.
"Vodka, vodka, water."
Drink them under the table.
"Okay, okay, okay."
There's a lot of money on that table...
I'm nervous.
"No, no, I got your covered."
He is our Gyula's commander.
Wow!
Electric bed-warmer from Tomaji parson lord.
"Come on, no says my little girl."
A major?
- And onto a fortnight comes here?
-Imagine it!
.
Big thing this my little girl.
Very big thing.
Lajos uncle!
Mariska old lady!
Silence is needed!
He suffers from insomnia!
Insomnia!
"The leader of the bus had to explain it, why must not honk through 2 weeks in the bend."
"The leader of the bus had to explain it, why must not honk through 2 weeks in the bend."
And here has this godforsaken habit of Gyuri yet.
There is not a major who bears this.
Gyuri my son.
Promise not to annoy the dog until our Gyula's commander is here.
From our Gyula's life there is a word.
I make this for the Tót family.
That dog does not bark until 2 weeks.
I promise.
- Well...onto kind Gyula's health.
- Thank you.
"The last day Ágika an early morning started with a little game cart already and while the game cart filled with a borrowed thing,"
Ágika got into the centre of the interest and envy rather continually.
they made him relate the big event again and again.
They were offering everything good to it.
It was celebrated practically
It is called Nymphs And Shepherds.
Who knows what a nymph is?
"Yes, Brierley?"
"Please, Miss, they're pink and they live in the sea."
You eat them in little pots.
Well...
"That's not nymphs that's shrimps, you fat head."
Hey!
Sh!
"Have you been in a Berni before, Enid?"
No.
"What I like, there's no surprises."
Can I show you to your table?
"Thank you, Barry."
Thank you.
"Thanking you, Barry."
"This is lovely, very kind of you to invite us."
"Yes, very much appreciated."
"We know you're an insurance man, Tubby, and you're basically a secretary, Enid, but we thought you'd like to know a little bit about us."
Shall I launch in?
"# I'm a man, just a man I am happy and contented"
# I appreciate the finer things in life
# And my house is detached and it's obviously not rented
# I've a car and I've something else... # A wife!
# And my life's complete when I take her out to eat
# We have all that we possibly could want
# When we journey in to the Berni Inn
# Our very favourite restaurant
# Please don't panic when you see the Berni menu
# All uncharted waters to explore.. #
Lovely.
# No need to be Magellan... #
Because I'm a little kid; that's not fair.
"Okay, okay, fine."
"Okay, give it to me."
Isn't it a little early?
"No, what it is, is..."
A little cowardly.
"What it is, is selfish."
Your timing is impeccable.
I was a minute from making a clean getaway.
Your assistant told me where I could find you.
Sir...
We really need to talk.
So all I have to do to prevent this lunatic
From keeping his promise is step forward
And declare myself a criminal?
"He knows what you did, sir."
"I don't know how he knows, but he knows."
"And I know it, too."
"Look, I would never secon d-guess what you did."
I might have done the same thing.
And I know how much you stand to lose.
"But unless there's something I'm not seeing,"
I don't think you can keep this a secret much longer.
I think you need to start telling people what you did.
And not to give in to him...
But to keep him from doing something
That you would never recover from.
I mean...
If he hurt some girl...
I don't think you could live with that.
"There's a lot you're not seeing, allison."
But I appreciate your concern.
"Nah, I'm just kiddin'."
She just likes me for my body.
You look great.
You do something different with your side view mirrors?
"What do you want, Sally?"
"Come on, make this guy fix the road."
The town needs this.
No.
I know his type.
Racecar.
That's the last thing this town needs.
"OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice."
"Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history."
Here she goes again.
"Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road!"
It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers?
What travelers?
Ignore him.
"But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on?"
"- Luigi, what do you have at your store?"
- Tires.
And if no one can get to you?
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!
"- Flo, what do you have at your store?"
- I have gas.
- Lotsa gas!
"- OK boys, stay with me."
"And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?"
I'll go outta business and...
I hope you don't think what happened last night changes anything.
It changes everything.
You can't still be planning to go into business with that woman.
- I am.
- She won't be satisfied until she has destroyed everything we've created here.
"Don't be fooled, Tommy."
This whole nightmare is because of her.
"Sarah, there is enough blame to go around."
- Is that a dig at me?
- We lied.
Dad lied.
"In fact, right now, Holly's probably the most honest one of us all."
You can't be that naive.
I already told you!
I didn't start this winery for you or Mom.
All right?
I did this for me.
Building something for myself.
That was before the horror show landed on my lap!
"Look, it landed in our laps."
You want to control everything.
"God, you just thrive off of control."
- But this is out of your hands.
"- Spare me, Tommy, OK?"
"I already pay for therapy, I really don't need your amateur psychoanalysis."
Just let it go.
OK.
"Well, clearly I'm the only one who still gives a damn about Ojai, so you'll understand that I have work to do."
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Holly Harper.
She's not in her office.
I don't know where she...
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
"What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine."
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
"- There were other symptoms, Doc."
"He had hallucinations, heard voices."
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
"I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion."
- He's wrong.
"- No, that'd be fine."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wait.
Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong 'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear and he tells you you got a headache...
"Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news."
I wish I was sick.
Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
"What should I say, Denise?"
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.
"13 News is headed to the scene, and we'll have a live report in minutes."
"Again our top story, Domain Air flight 9 out of Denver has crashed."
- Nothing.
- Maybe we could go.
In what world would I want you to come along?
"- It's not for you, it's for us."
- It'd be funny to watch you fuck it up.
"Yeah, you might cry."
"Thanks for the vote of confidence, but you won't want to come."
I'm seeing her at this under-18s night she's working at.
"It will be uncool,"
- even for us.
- Sounds OK to me.
- At least we'll definitely get in.
"- No, no."
- You won't like it.
- We might even get some.
Won't they be a bit young?
- Grass on the pitch and it's OK for me.
"- Right, and what if there isn't?"
By the time you find out it'll be too late.
Surely you've got better things to do than watch me with Charlotte?
"Great, no, fine."
See you there then.
"So before my date with Charlotte, and it was a date,"
I had to endure one last day with the savages.
I was pleasantly surprised to find Jim and Wolfie engaged in serious debate.
"All right, Will?"
"You'll like this - we're just having ""a discussion""."
"- Oh, really?"
- Which titties would you spunk over?
"The little ones, or big and bouncy?"
"A handful, plenty to play with."
- They both look nice.
And now I'm a cheating scoundrel?
"As long as you're a do-yooder, everything's hunky dory... as long as I deny myself, as long as I give away millions... without a word!"
"Am I to apologise because I'm rich, moneyed?"
Mr Om is saying nothing of the sort.
Why are you getting upset?
I'm upset because I considered him my friend
He's more than a brother to me
And he says I have deceived him?
"Well all right, I have deceived you"
Why don't you return my money?
Why not prove that love is stronger than money?
"The three of you, Om, Jai and Jagadish"
"Come on, get together!"
Pay me back
"Else, vacate your house in 48 hours."
I'm going to get a court order
And don't come to work from tomorrow onwards
They will vacate the house.
"You told me, they're men of word"
"Papa, Uncle Jai is leaving"
Brother...
Yes Jai...?
I want to talk to you.
You are returning?
"Yes, I'm leaving"
"If I don't leave, there will be a big problem"
Do you have your green card?
I have it
But I might lose my job.
You got my go-ahead
"Besides, what can you achieve living in this country?"
Go away
Did you two get into my four-quadrant popcorn tin?
Relax.
We were just sniffing it.
Stand up and show me your fingers.
"If I see any cheese dust, you're both grounded."
Dust-free.
You happy?
"Dude, you're unbelievable."
Popcorn is the snack of the people.
No.
It's a snack for dads only.
I get one tin a year from my armoire dealer in Cincinnati.
It's the only thing that gets me through the season.
"There are so many sad things in that sentence, but I honestly think the winner is ""Cincinnati."""
"Well, just keep your hands off the tin."
That's it.
End of story.
And the same goes for the thermostat.
"Yeah, I see you two looking."
That's 'cause it's colder in this house
- than it is outside.
"- Yeah, man."
Can't you spare like two more degrees?
"If you two are so cold, go out and shovel the walkway."
That ought to work up a sweat but good.
"Murray Goldberg had a lot of dumb dad rules, but nothing equaled his hard line on snow."
And no monkeying around out there when you're done.
- This weather is treacherous.
"- Oh, here we go."
Another lecture on the dangers of cold weather.
I'm serious.
It's not safe out there.
You're thankful.
"If house would have pointed at you instead of me, you'd be the one in here."
"Look straight forward, tell me when you can see... it's your job to go back!"
You're a doctor!
You go where the disease is!
Say when you can see the light.
"I'm dying, and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?"
Tell me when you can see the light!
My vision's fine!
Your left-side periphery is reduced.
"It's fine, I'll prove it."
Ow!
Son of a bitch!
Now we're both exposed.
You got two choices.
"You can go tell house what just happened and get your own cot board in here, or you can go back to that apartment... you save me, the cop, and yourself."
It's not sspe.
I checked your past vaccinations against joe'S.
No batch matches.
Blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?
"Guys, could you please shut him up?"
He's over his limit on morphine.
Where's cameron?
She said she has some stuff to do.
Said she'd be back soon.
What are you doing?
Foreman!
Stop!
I can't take it!
Imagine being constantly reminded of the... pain you're about to be in.
I can't take it!
Stop it!
"Oh, thank you."
"I think you guys are talking about postpartum depression, and that totally makes sense."
One out of every seven new moms does suffer from it.
"Yeah, no, no, um..."
"You're saying, no, that's not true?"
"I'm worried that, uh..."
Our kid's just gonna have a shit vibe.
"- Sorry, come again?"
- Okay.
I-
"- I'm, like, ehh..."
You know?
"And he's, like, the worst, so I feel like, when we made a baby, so it'll just be like..."
- Her dad's my boss.
- Gotcha.
"So you're not talking about postpartum depression, you're just concerned that your baby's an asshole?"
"Okay, yeah, like, that's what I'm talking about, too."
"- And, like, off of what she said."
- Right.
"I think, just ultimately, we're mostly afraid that he won't be chill."
"Like, what if he can't hang?"
"Or he hangs too hard and has one too many drinks and does that, like, slow-blinking thing."
Let's open it up.
Any-
- Anybody else with some fears?
Bats.
"Yeah, yeah."
"Okay, I should have been more specific that I meant fears about the baby."
"Okay, I have a fear about my human baby."
"- Okay, great."
- Um...
I'm really scared that my baby's gonna be blind.
All right.
I got you.
Meth.
Right.
"Sorry, that was a little transpositional error."
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
"Yeah, and felony quantity."
- Just barely.
"- Yeah, just barely."
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm gonna get you a second phone call.
You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader and they're gonna deliver me a cheque for $4650.
I'm gonna write that down on the back of my business card.
Four-six-five-zero.
Okay?
"And I need that in a cashier's cheque or a money order, doesn't matter."
"Actually, I want it in a money order."
"And make it out to ""Ice Station Zebra Associates."""
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
"And after that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask."
All right?
Any questions?
"You're gonna get me off, right?"
"What do I look like, your high-school girlfriend?"
"Five fingers, no waiting?"
"That's a joke, Brandon."
Lighten up.
I knew Jess Mclntyre would help you.
"- They're helping us, ain't they?"
"- Yes, sir!"
"- Retha, give them boys more chicken."
"- Yes, ma'am."
"You're all very kind, kinder than we deserve."
That's right.
[Innkeeper] You won't have no trouble at all.
"Once folks find out what you're up to, they'll put the big pot in the little one."
"[Innkeeper] Well, look who's here!"
"[Retha] Land sakes, but you're wet!"
"You need some of Retha's cooking, Mr. Andrews."
Sounds mighty good.
Smells even better.
I think I'll get warm first.
Evening.
"[Innkeeper] Retha, fetch Mr. Andrews that peach brandy, you hear?"
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have great news."
"On the strength of it, I'd ask you all to have a glass with me... if I knew the color of your politics."
You needn't worry about these boys.
"They've been living amongst Yankees, but they're coming out on the right side."
Good.
We won a great victory at Shiloh.
- Did Beauregard lick that buzzard Grant?
- [Andrews] Cut him to ribbons.
What about the Yankee gunboats at Pittsburgh Landing?
"100 of them sunk, and thousands of prisoners taken."
"The whole Yankee force, gone up the spout."
[cheers]
Isn't that wonderful?
Ladies and gentlemen...
I don't know.
Perhaps a little.
"Dear, why don't you go up and change so we can have dinner?"
"Oh, that's a good idea."
I'll wash and then we'll eat.
"Oh, hey."
"Will you stay for dinner, Sam?"
"Well, I was."
"Thank you, John."
That'd be nice.
Didn't you tell him I was coming to dinner?
"Doctor, it was his idea to invite you tonight."
I reminded him just this morning.
I can hardly believe it.
"Why, his memory is phenomenal."
How long has he been like this?
It's been months.
"I kept trying to get him to see you, but he wouldn't."
"I begged him to take it easy, retire, but he just goes into a rage."
"What's wrong with him, Doctor?"
"Well, it certainly can't be anything physical."
I gave him a thorough checkup only a few weeks ago.
Would you object to having a specialist examine him?
A specialist?
What do you mean?
I mean a psychiatrist.
You don't think he's...
"Now, now, now, don't jump to conclusions."
It may be nothing more than just mental fatigue.
But I do think you should take him to see Dr. Croatman as soon as possible.
"Now, there, there, there."
Good morning.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy, with a hook, and he lived in a mirror."
"And if you even looked at him, you'd wake up in a bathtub full of ice, with your kidneys gone."
Whoa.
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- What?
"- You name the terms, I name the place."
"OK, fine!"
Where we gonna do this?
Castle Duloc?
"Ha, ha, very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived.
Ja!
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost.
"If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,"
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
"Now, wait a minute!"
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine.
Come on then.
"Hold up, Shrek."
"You can't just go barging into some creepy, spookyjoint like you own the place."
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
"I still don't know about this, man."
I'm getting a whole creepy House of wax vibe going on in here.
"Look, it's that little thingy you love so much, remember?"
Welcome to Duloc
It's a creepy town
What was once pristine Now is all rundown
He went to meet Mary.
"All right, let's go check out the Larimar."
"I already told Mary, that I don't want anything to do with your business or any of it."
"Okay, well, you did at one point."
Mary would never force anyone into this.
Why did you do it in the first place?
I work in the ICU.
I deal with the heaviest shit in the hospital...
"People at their worst, their most desperate."
"Before Mary, there was only so much I could do for them."
"Handing them that pamphlet, it gave them..."
- Comfort.
- Yeah.
Also I want a million dollars.
"Uh, what?"
I have financial goals.
How much do you have so far?
"Oh, come on, I'm not gonna rob you."
It's too much work.
- Not enough.
- Enough for what?
Freedom.
So you're breaking the law for freedom?
"The law is wrong, and it will change."
"Until then, there's no reason that I shouldn't supplement my income."
Then why stop?
I have this vision.
"Me, Mary, and now you, all of us in the woods somewhere, like a camp."
"No, a retreat."
A death retreat.
"People come from all over the world to experience the finest death possible, from the best of the best."
Sounds kind of nice.
- What a good idea.
"- This Friday, already."
- I think that's a wise decision.
- You can't cope with this.
"- No, it's pointless."
- You can help move her there.
- Of course.
"One wiener, one frankfurter and one with bacon."
- Why didn't you eat any lunch?
- Bodil turns me off food.
The mentally handicapped turn me off food.
One or two rolls?
Lots of people feel that way.
"When I have handicapped customers, they scare all the others away."
- They need to eat too.
- But does it have to be when we eat?
- She'll be fine there.
- The Gimp needs to get rid of her.
He can't bring girls home with her sitting there.
He had sex with her the other day and she just lay there.
He didn't know if she enjoyed it.
"Technically, he could be raping her."
Scary thought.
"It sure makes you appreciate what you've got, honey."
- Appreciate your own good sex life.
- We've got no complaints.
"Good God, no."
I think if we take all of Copenhagen   we're in the top five percent.
"Honestly, honey, is there anything I could do better?"
"Well, maybe just in the oral department."
- Do I give you bad oral sex?
- I didn't say that.
Leave that magazine here.
Hello?
"Ah, it's you."
Were you expecting someone more exciting?
Where have you been until this late hour?
The store will be closed tomorrow.
Do you want to meet me in the afternoon?
I've something I need to talk to you about.
It's very important.
"OK, have you bought that stuff I asked you to buy?"
What's that?
That stuff.
"Ah, condoms?"
"Yes, I bought them."
"Hey, what are you going to tell me tomorrow?"
"Oh, my wife is coming."
See you.
Your bath's ready.
Don't you have to get up early for a game of golf with your clients?
Early bed?
Yes.
Have you become one of those old men who read these kind of magazines?
You must be kidding.
One of my colleagues at work loves this kind of stuff and he gave me this one saying it was the best.
"Pornography in Japan is totally tasteless, isn't it?"
She's very pretty.
Doesn't she look just like those girls who work in your department store?
We haven't taken a bath together for so long.
Why don't we do that tonight?
"Are you going to wash me, then?"
That girl in the magazine.
That pretty girl. I've seen her.
Echizen Ryoma National champion for four years running never lost a single game in the championships.
"- No defeat, that's impressive."
- Ah that's more.
Ryuzaki-sensei.
What kinda guy is that Ryoma?
Playing with the world's top masters with 37 consecutive wins.
"People said that as long as he wasn't injured during the Grand Slam, he wouldn't lose."
Japan's greatest player.
It was also because I looked up to him when I was young that I began playing tennis.
Even now he's still my most respected senpai.
Nitouryu no Samurai Nanjiro.
Exactly.
That boy is Samurai Nanjiro's junior.
"Even if he's famous,"
I still won't give him preferential treatment.
I will treat him fairly.
Now it's just to ensure that we will achieve victory in the Nationals.
Only these.
"As expected, it's here."
We are the same group.
"Ah, o-xhibi."
Come to see the groupings?
About the tournament to decide the regulars...
First years aren't allowed to take part in the ranking matches.
Why would there be your name?
Saa because I am strong.
Don't be so arrogant.
Kaidou.
Give me your guidance.
Tennis is about hitting the ball back fast.
Let's have this practice first.
Don't want to.
- Nice.
"Good work, Bobbi."
- Of course it is.
"L""m the best."
We were wondering.
Could you be a little more explicit in your report?
"If we""re going to use this in court, we""re going to need more interaction."
You want any extra foam on that?
"- You mean, more touching?"
- Right.
"Just like that, right?"
"Like in the dressing room, could you say... my wife leaned over... and slid her hand between Lisa""s thighs?"
"You mean, like this?"
"Yeah, that""s good."
And maybe something like this?
"Mr. Caine, you do understand that men and women are different."
That women sometimes like to kiss and hug and carry on... and they have absolutely no intention of having sex.
Right.
"I take the cheating business very seriously, Mr. Caine."
"And it doesn""t take a private investigator that""s first class, like me... to know that y""all have an agenda."
"So whatever that is, you need to take it someplace else."
"Now, hold on."
"Blue Moon doesn""t play your dirty little games."
"If someone""s cheating in that marriage, it ain""t Pam Caine."
"L""m keeping the pictures."
"No, I will not be flexible on the issue."
"I gave up the house, he gave up the kids."
"What do you mean, legally?"
"Legally, I""m their mother."
"I got to go, okay?"
"L""ll call you back."
Hi.
"Instead of being caught here and get turned into fur coats, let's go back into the mountain, dad."
How could you say such a thing?
A spell has given us a temporary human form.
"But if we fail that day, we live as a fox forever."
Do you know that?
The pain of having to eat raw meat.
The pain of having to take a dump without toilet paper.
"Ouch, it's rough!"
Oh my God!
"Since we have only one life to live,"
I want to live on two human feet even if it's a short life.
- It's all your fault!
- Wait.
"All they need to do is stay alive until that day, right?"
How will you keep them alive?
We can't afford to pay the medical bills.
And the circus is doing bad.
How can we keep them alive?
Let me go.
"Hey, let him go."
"Okay, tell me."
Do you have any ideas?
Make money.
Make money?
There is nothing we can't do with money.
You mean cold-hard cash?
She's our new girl.
The tail dance is her specialty.
"Hello, I'm Miss Fox."
# We need money to live in this world
# You can't live without money # in the human world
# People want to make money
For $600?
For your daughter?
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved -- not by you, Tim... or your god."
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
I do.
Previously on The Americans
What is it that you do there at the church?
We talk.
They get them when they're children.
They indoctrinate them with friendship and songs.
I really like the people at work.
I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore.
"Not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so... this is how I fixed it."
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
We can expose U.S. Forces secretly training contra commanders on American soil.
It looks like the best way onto the camp is septic.
Which truck do you drive?
- Number nine.
- Where are the keys?
Inside the truck.
We can tie him up and gag him.
- What if he gets loose?
- He won't.
What if a hiker comes by and they call the police when we're in the camp?
A good night's sleep and you'd power an aircraft carrier.
"Remarkable technology, is it not?"
Not you.
My b0315-
I made the first few for revenge but then
I started exploring new aspects of myself.
Can I have a sip?
Mmm.
"I have lived these past years, Henry."
"My lads, they get speeding tickets, they walk barefoot through the grass, and boy, do they get laid."
You'll never guess what we do here sometimes alone.
Hit play.
Over there.
Go on.
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
I've got you Under my skin
I've got you deep In the heart of me
So deep in my heart That you're really A part of me
I've got you Under my skin
I 'd tried so Not to give in
"I said to myself ""This affair never Will go so well"""
"But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well"
I've got you under my skin?
(WARNING ALARM BEEPS)
What is all this?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
"Something's wrong with you, mate."
"Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing."
"Just gonna sit you down in this ohair and take a look at you, yeah?"
The scan says you're in terrible danger.
(LOCK CLICKS)
- Leon?
"- Leon, Maurice Leon."
- Leon?
But he made up the name.
I don't know what it was before.
Some people called him Moussa and that annoyed him.
You met him on the set?
"No, I met him at a little Algerian restaurant."
Maurice studied at the Sorbonne and at night he made couscous.
"Strange guy, anarchist, atheist, and an excellent cook."
We became friends and one day he told me his story.
I don't know how we suddenly found ourselves working on a script.
A sad love story.
"Like Romeo and Juliet, but in Algeria."
Why didn't you finish the movie?
It was a mistake to begin with.
It was my idea that he direct it.
"I financed it, I recruited all our friends from the Sorbonne."
You realize I was a little in love with him.
I was young and he had a poetic soul.
I thought if we made the film he'd love me as he loved your mother.
That's the story.
We barely managed to film two scenes-.
"Maurice became depressed, he didn't show up and everything stopped."
Want to see?
- See the film?
"- No, there's nothing left of it."
But I have a few photos.
Come.
This is all that remains.
"Pictures, moments."
If I'd known that 40 years later
Where?
At your company.
Isn't she a sales assistant?
So you think one of my staff members has become a porn model?
Never.
She's not my kind.
Are you going home?
Yeah.
Are you scared of your wife?
All wives are scary.
So are you going to put some mud on your golf clubs?
Oh!
You've become an expert.
Have you done this with anyone else before?
So what did you want to talk to me about?
Someone left this on my desk.
"The model is you, isn't it?"
Luckily he left it on my desk.
But what if someone left it on a managers' desk instead?
A friend of mine tricked me into this.
I don't care who tricked you.
"What I'm asking you is, what should I do?"
What should you do?
Should I show it to the manager or keep it secret?
Are you threatening me?
"No, I don't mean it like that."
I thought perhaps it would be better if I started seeing you at your home instead.
Is this a threat?
It's been quite costly.
What with the money I've been giving to you as well.
Isn't that natural because we love each other?
Why don't you show it to the manager or whoever you want?
I don't want to go home alone.
"All right, Johan, grab your passport."
The party's moving.
"All right, all right, I got our drinks."
And look what else I got.
"Michelle, here, works for Ticketron, and penny is currently suing a major airline."
"You guys should have plenty to talk about, because Neal here has bought tickets for an airplane."
What are you doing?
"I am sending you to ""pound town."""
I don't want to go there.
"Ladies, excuse us."
"Before you say anything,"
I'm comfortable with any combination.
"Look, Mark, I'm not in the mood to hook up with a random stranger."
They're not random.
I hand-picked them.
"Look, when you go through a break up, your body stops producing dopamine, and serotonin."
You know what it does not stop producing?
Sperm.
"Let the pain, and the sperm, out."
"Look, there is no pain, okay?"
"I mean, there should be, but there isn't."
I should be devastated.
"But, I'm not, I'm..."
I'm mostly just relieved.
And it's nothing.
That's not nothing.
Nothing is something.
Feeling nothing is what... it's what being a guy is all about.
Go with that.
Okay.
I feel a little ashamed that I feel relieved.
Come on.
THE END
Doomed.
"Doomed to a violent end, that Clara Nash was."
"I'm telling you, Sergeant."
Doomed to a violent end.
"I know, Mrs. Slocum, you told me."
"Three times, already."
"And I'm trying to find out, with your help, who murdered her."
The horror of it all.
[sighs]
And that wonderful Mr. Nash.
And that poor little boy.
Whatever is gonna become of him.
"Mom, please, mom."
Try to control yourself.
And to think that I was practically the last one to see her alive.
Me.
"Mrs. Slocum, if you could just give me a few minutes of your valuable time, l--"
My valuable time.
"Well, thank you very much, Sergeant."
"You hear that, Janie?"
The Sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time.
Just goes to show how a person's whole life can be changed... just by somebody getting murdered.
"First, there was the flowers from the women's club... with a very kind note of sympathy."
Plus an invitation... to tell about my experiences on the fatal night.
And now the Sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time.
"Well, let's face it, Janie."
"How much was my valuable time worth, yesterday?"
"85 cents an hour, plus carfare."
"I was just a plain, simple baby-sitter."
And he would be a lawyer and I would have his children.
And in the week ends we would barbecue.
And all the other princes and their princesses would come:
"and they would say delicious, delicious,"
"Or, how boring!"
"So I was taught, that I should come to New-York and become an independant model."
And my prince would come and he would be... an agent.
And he would get me a role.
And I would make my living waiting on tables.
I would wait till thirty...
till forty...till fifty.
And I was taught that to be an actress one should be fashionable.
And to befashionable is to be androgenous.
And I'm androgenous not less that David Bowie himself.
They call me beautiful.
And I kill with my cunt.
Isn't it fashionable?
Come on who's next?
I take lessons.
How to get into show business.
"Be nice to your professor,"
be nice to your agent.
Be nice to your audience.
Be nice.
How to be a woman?
Want them when they want you.
How to be free and equal.
Fuck women instead of men and you'll discover a whole kingdom of freedom.
Men won't step on you anymore.
Women will.
"So come on, who's next?"
Who wants to teach me?
And why so?
"You see, Miss Sheetal, there are many reasons for this."
"It so happened that... ltjust crossed my mind that, I thought you'd understand what I understood."
But you couldn't understand it either.
And you thought I understood what you were tying to make me understand.
This misunderstanding has created a bit of confusion.
"And ifyou see through, we are stuck in a strange whirlwind."
Whirlwind!
What whirlwind?
I don't get what you say.
Exactly.
This is the confusion.
And to get out of it we must meet rightaway.
"And ifwe put our heads together, Miss Sheetal we can easily get out ofthis confusion... gradually."
ARer that evemhing will be all right.
And then...
it will be all bed of roses!
But this outcome won't come byjust sitting at home.
"We must meet, and keep meeting."
But I don't want to meet you.
Since when have you started lying?
"An_ay, dump these odd talks."
They are unyielding.
I am free tomorrow.
Why don't we make it tomorrow then?
That's final. I'll see you at Golden Chariot tomorrow.
I don't want to meet you.
-See you at 4 in the evening.
Keep waiting.
I won't come.
No way.
I had said I wasn't coming.
Time is money!
You can't just wrap a gas hose around your neck every morning!
You need this fine little device.
"And if war reparations have left you with anything, it's that head on your shoulders that tells you that you need this!"
"Come out of the street, young man."
"If you get run over, who'll clean up the mess?"
"Buy my wares, ladies and gentlemen."
The price is right:
"One for 20, three for 50."
"It won't snap, split or break."
"Don't laugh, folks."
I just wanted to show you how sturdy and solid it is.
"Just 20 for one, 50 for three."
Here's your chance at a real deal!
"One for 20, three for 50."
Cilly!
So nice of you to come by!
I'll get my things and be right back.
I'll wait here.
"You know, Franz, you'd make a good family man:"
"Nightgown, felt slippers, the whole thing."
Something wrong with that?
You'll never get anywhere like that!
Wait and see.
Lots of guys are worse off.
They end up on the dole or get locked up out at Tegel.
What's gotten into you?
You're cozy here.
You can do anything you want.
Listen.
I have something for you.
What is it?
Stop the boat.
"The planes where intercepted at the clandestine airfield,"
I caught them like wasps in a nest!
you caught them...
"We caught them, Inspector."
"Eh...well, yeah, we caught them."
"Well then, no need to argue, I will treat you to a bottle of champagne at the bar, shall we?"
Lets.
The End

"NARRATOR""."
When last we saw the Caped Crusaders they were trapped in Black Widow's giant cobweb about to be bitten by two deadly Black Widow spiders.
Are the heroes headed for that great Batcave in the sky?
"In scant seconds, the answer will be yours."
"Batman, he's almost on me."
"He is a she, Robin."
Only the female of the species is venomous.
And mine is almost upon me also.
I've freed my right hand.
Now if I can just reach the mini charge in my utility belt.
I've got it.
"Brace yourself for a shock of 5000 volts, Robin."
We'll be stunned for a split second.
"But the cobweb will act as a conductor, and the spiders will be electrocuted."
"- Hurry, Batman."
She's ready to bite me.
-Now.
"Good going, Batman."
I thought we were dead ducks.
I'm sure Black Widow thinks we're dead bats about now.
What was that exit line of hers?
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
"Oh, well, no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me."
"I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah."
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They've hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous.
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It's as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one.
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.
What's his name?
"They call him ""Bellosh."""
Belloq.
Belloq.
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the Well of Souls.
"Well, they're not going to find it without this."
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy... there is something that troubles me.
What is it?
The Ark.
"If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb."
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
"Do we need the monkey, huh?"
"I'm surprised at you, Jones- talking that way about our baby."
You lost him?
!
"Forgive us, sir."
You are hired killers for heaven sakes!
How could you let him get away?
"Yi Soon-shin, that weasel slipped away..."
But there's only one place he could've gone.
Who is it?
Who is it?
What happened?
"My lady, we must quickly move him inside!"
Father...
"I do not know what happened, so I brought him here away from the eyes of the others."
You did the smart thing.
Gatekeeper!
"What brings you here at this late hour, Baron?"
"Forgive me, sir."
I have reasons to believe that a thief that broke into my house tonight is hiding in this house.
You've been misinformed.
No one entered my house tonight.
It's possible that he is hiding here without your knowledge.
"I hate to impose, but please allow me to take a look around."
This will be my last and only request.
Very well.
As you wish.
This is my daughter's room.
Please allow us to take a look.
Even the father is careful about entering a maiden's room.
Don't you know the customs of the nobility?
"But sir, I am acting on a testimony of a witness."
I must assume that the thief is in that room if you tell me to leave.
- Come in.
Gotta be freeway scavengers.
Headed south on the Golden State.
Attention all units.
The contaminated baby food dropped from the truck this morning was possibly picked up and carried off in a converted school bus.
The bus is described as pre-1960 still official yellow color.
The lettering has been painted over.
"When last seen, a canvas tarpaulin tied to its roof."
"Well, they could be anywhere."
It's late.
They gotta stop to camp for the night.
There aren't many places a vehicle like that can stop.
They usually can't afford the regular trailer camps.
"You know, they stop up in the Santa Monica canyons a lot."
Yeah.
They use the open areas alongside the road to camp.
"Okay, right."
You two take Topanga Canyon.
I'll send other units to help.
"Barkley, take Malibu Canyon, all right?"
Hold it.
There's an accident this side of the tunnel.
Took an hour to get a tow truck up.
Another one's hung up there.
It's a big mess.
Motor's the only way through.
"Okay, you go."
"And you two better go too, since you know what it looks like."
"- Make sure you hit the side roads, right?"
- Okay.
There's a rest area up ahead.
I'll take it.
I'll ask over here.
Hey!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Get out.
Get out now!
You want to sit around drinking and feeling sorry for yourself.
What is this?
You won't respect yourself until someone else does?
I respect you.
You've got a lot of courage.
The whole department is waiting to see you fall on your ass.
- You're giving them what they want.
- They want to keep me silent.
Stupid is almost as good.
"Will you go now, please?"
Just go home.
"No, I don't want to."
I don't want to go home.
What are you doing?
What made you decide to become a cop?
All the shit you've got to go through  being a woman and all.
"When I was in college, my roommate was raped."
The campus police were only interested in keeping it quiet.
I knew that the guy was white and very tall.
I started checking out basketball courts near the campus.
From the pictures I took of the white players she identified him.
- You caught the guy?
- Yeah.
This is the police.
Pull over and stop the engine.
Stop the car..!
Take the wheel.
"This is 9221 in pursuit of a murder suspect,   heading west on the railroad service road at mile 16."
"From the information I see, they already received money for food."
Why are they still saying they're starving?
How is it possible?
"They probably spent the money somewhere else, that's why they're saying they're hungry."
"The children say they do not want to be treated as beggars, so they don't want to take it."
Children these days really like to lie.
Don't be fooled.
"There are many children like this, who lie and instead spend their money at the internet café."
What if it is you?
"If it was you, would you choose to starve or to play games?"
What?
!
You!
Who are you?
What are you doing?
You... you!
Me?
I hate seeing children go hungry.
The people have paid so much taxes.
I want to know why children are still starving.
That... what is that?
Are you implying that I pocketed the money?
I'm not sure who is lying.
This is really strange.
I said that you're the one.
"No matter what, please get them corrected after your confirmation."
I need to use the restroom.
-=Next Episode Preview=-
"If you betray me, you must give up your political dream."
So you can't betray me.
You must properly punish Lee Kyeong Wan.
Who are you?
- I don't think we should talk about classes.
"Like, if-if you're taking playwriting with Sam Shepard,"
"It may hurt my heart,"
"But if you take intro to mime, I need to know everything."
I want to be with you when you buy your leotard and your beret.
Playwriting competitions-
"I think we can go out for the same ones,"
But we can't read each other's submissions.
"And looking forward, I guess it's the same thing"
With internships and jobs.
So the only things we can talk about openly
"Are-are politics,"
"""jersey shore""..."
And where we want to eat...
"Which reminds me, I actually,"
"Um, I need to get ready."
I'm gonna be late for breakfast at my dad's.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
"No, I'm sorry."
"I, uh, I have something."
"Oh, oh, is it something related to our list?"
"Actually, yeah."
"Well, thank you for not sharing."
See?
I can't believe how much easier that is.
Ooh!
Another sext session with your new b.F.?
"Okay, I'd hardly call Elliot a boyfriend."
Between me spending all my time with my mom
"And him being in every club in school,"
We haven't even been on a first date.
Hey.
"When I was inside, nothing happened."
When I was out it was all there to read on the front page.
"Yes, I read all the papers."
- You certainly make a good-looking priest.
- Thanks.
"Your mother always wanted you to do it, but what finally decided you?"
"Well, I was riding along on the top of a bus looking down, passing the cathedral."
"- That gave you the idea, huh?"
"That's funny, I got an idea on the top of a bus once."
Got me six years.
I was around while you were singing with the kids and I kept thinking of you and me 20 years ago.
- With Father Boyle.
- Yeah.
"Remember slipping ""Merry Oldsmobile"" into the hymnbook?"
- How could I forget it?
- How'd it go?
"Lead, kindly light Amid the encircling gloom"
"Lead thou me on, for the night is dark And I am far from..."
- Did a lot of crazy things in those days.
- Certainly did.
Certainly did.
Come in.
"Father, you're supposed to be down at the store."
The fellas are waiting for you.
You run and tell them I'll be right over.
Tell them to get the game started.
"- Okay, Father!"
- All right.
What's this store racket?
Got the kids shilling for the parish?
"That's not a bad idea, Rocky."
No.
"- The 21st century, no smoking... in office buildings, go out on the street with the rest of the junkies."
Spank me again!
I think there's a part-time position opening at the vault.
Let's look in here.
Maybe we'll find some naughty toys.
He doesn't exactly seem like the kiddie-porn type.
"He's such a sweetie, gorgeous!"
I wished he was into sausages...
I think I'll never be graced by his sweet ass.
- You mean Paul's no gay?
"- Your ""gaydar"" is failing."
Paul is as straight as Mark Jacob's pleat.
- Interesting!
- Every fashion magazine... needs their token hetero male.
It's like reverse feminine action.
Fuck!
I gotta dash.
I'm off that Palm press.
I think Judaism beats Buddhism... in the next century.
I really do.
And I've got the jump-start.
- I'm taking kabala classes.
- I'm sure I've seen sketches of a...
- Moses collection come cross my desk.
"- Wait a minute, haven't you seen..."
- at Skirt magazine?
"- Please, darling!"
Are they finally eclipsing Vogue in fashion for advance?
Skirt will only race clean when it shows the bat about one ways.
It's true!
They totally missed the ball on those princess skirts.
That's because Roxanne Rochett is Coco.
"That isn't the case here, is it, Mr. Morris?"
Or were you even aware it was going on?
"Uh, we live on a ranch, so Georgie does chores."
"In fact, we all do chores."
She happens to love being out with the horses before school in the morning.
It's part of her routine and we couldn't stop her if we tried.
So I would hardly call it hard labour.
That's insulting.
"No one's accusing you of anything, Mr. Morris."
These are standard questions for clarification.
"Right, well, I don't think you'd have to ask these questions if you'd done any homework and found out anything about us."
How can you take these complaints at face value like this?
Honestly.
It's ridiculous.
I've done everything that's required of me.
Let's get the next one ready for the shoot.
Whoa!
Settle down there.
Whoa...
- All right.
- That's it.
- How many is this?
- Five more to go.
Whoa... there.
Thanks for keeping him calm.
"You know, this is what I miss the most."
Us working together.
"It's what we always wanted, right?"
It was a dream.
Maybe we just keep it at that.
"Oh no, he's back."
Matt is gonna see him!
"I just saw the rest of my life, and there were no more surprises."
This was it.
"I mean, it was great..."
But it was it.
What makes you think this isn't gonna happen again?
- I know it won't.
"- Oh, right."
Come on!
Aren't we supposed to be able to learn from our mistakes?
"I did something horrible, but I learned from it."
I met this little brunette and I faltered.
Are you telling me that throughout your entire marriage you never faltered?
You haven't?
Never?
- Never.
"- Oh, that makes me feel great."
You think it's because I wasn't tempted?
You think that this woman is the last brunette that's ever gonna let you know that she wants you?
Look at me.
I haven't met my last brunette.
She's the last one I'm gonna kiss.
"I'm in love with your daughter, Stephen."
"And maybe that doesn't mean anything to you, but I'm standing here."
You're her father.
"I'm looking you in the eyes and I'm telling you,"
I will do anything in the world to get your daughter back.
- Really?
Anything?
- I'll do anything.
- People say that.
They don't mean it.
- But I mean it.
It was my workplace went sour.
I was leaving Betty's Bees.
Did you tell Dusty you were leaving?
"If I told him, he would worry and ask a lot of questions and then I'd have to lie about sabotaging Betty's Bees."
- Why did you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- Why?
Because Betty had it coming.
Intention was to quit before I got caught.
- Who caught you?
- I couldn't see his face.
Or her face.
All the lights went out one by one and then there was a terrible hum.
"Then, out of the darkness, it came for me."
"It spit something, and then a swarm of bees attacked."
I tried to get a good look at it but the bees were already stinging my eyes.
That's terrifying.
That's terrifying.
"Oh, sorry."
Five seconds.
- How'd you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- Any last wishes?
- Only that Dusty not be alone.
Yeah.
- How'd you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- With a lot of might...
That's nice.
"We don't know what she was doing, but we do know it took a lot of effort."
Do you hear something?
- Is she still breathing?
- That's not breathing.
I told you not to turn her over.
Could that have happened to me on the roof?
"Photographed in Aix-en-Provence, a man I really loved."
And a Corsica landcsape.
"Just like before, the sun through the tree."
"It's not the same tree as before, but it's the same man."
"The same garage in Montfort I'Amaury, close to Ravel's house."
I went on vacation there last year.
"That's done with a light pencil, and that's entirely imagined."
I like to do that...
Didn't you cover the negative?
"No, the negative ends here."
I actually printed this...
Then I prolonged the picture...
"With imaginary lines, on the top and the bottom."
"Then in the middle, all this black part."
All with the light pencil.
Do you recognize me?
Yes.
And my two friends?
"No, I don't know them..."
I'm sure you've seen them here before.
"The real version of this picture, is this one."
"""Eric's new boots"""
It's a guy who'd follow me around surprinsingly...
Without any warning...
"Without me wanting him to, in New York."
I didn't like him very much...
He'd come to New York all dressed in white...
With clothes he'd bought for the occasion...
And boots very...
Which he was proud of...
Which must've cost a great deal of money...
He photographed everything in New York.
I was thinking of re-upping.
Nothing else you'd rather do?
No.
I was recruited by a software company in college.
The kind that makes apps for phones.
What's wrong?
Pay is no good?
"No, it was great, actually."
"Obscene, to be honest with you."
"Why didn't you do it, then?"
I don't know.
"I don't know, I guess I just felt like it was silly, it wasn't really that important, you know?"
I guess I like the idea of serving my country.
Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
What about you?
You never wanted to do anything else?
"There comes a time when you do a thing long enough, you can't really imagine doing anything else, you know?"
"So, if I stay here, I'm stuck with you forever?"
Yes.
Be careful what you wish for.
(laughing)
katherine:
"You're doing it again, aren't you?"
What?
You have that look that you get.
What look?
You're squinting one eye as if you're taking aim with a gun.
-You're gonna be late.
-lt's horrifying.
I'm sure you're great fun at parties.
"Seriously, you don't have to think about killing everyone that you ever meet."
-l don't.
He's gonna abandon that car.
We'll find it.
It'll tell us where he's going.
Watch this.
Keep your eyes on the guard.
Look at his holster.
The safety strap's unfastened.
Wait a minute.
"What the hell is he doing with a gun, anyway?"
"Weapons are for towers, gates and transports only."
- Maybe it was a rookie mistake.
"- No, not a rookie mistake."
He's in on it.
He wanted Dawkins to have that gun.
What's in it for the guard?
"Whatever it is, it was worth putting an armed and dangerous fugitive back on the streets."
Hey.
"Billy Omana, right?"
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, put those on."
- Excuse me?
"- Oh, he said put them on."
Who the hell you guys think you are?
What did Dawkins offer you to help him escape from prison today?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Billy, if you answer incorrectly one more time, we're gonna put those scrubs on you, drop you in the general population."
- How long you think you'll last there?
"- Heh, you can't do that."
This here says I can.
"Dawkins said if I helped him, he'd give me 50 grand."
And you believed him?
"He arranged for $10,000 to be wired into my account."
My name is Brent Sodor.
I used to be on Schmidt's security team.
You work for Schmidt?
!
Do I look like I'm still on the payroll?
!
I was being tortured!
Please.
"Y-you're trying to find him, right?"
Right?
Am I right?
"Well, I can help you."
I'll tell you anything you want.
Just don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
Untie him.
We're taking him to Jabbar.
He lives for now.
"Most intelligence agencies lack the resources to set up safe houses all over the world, which is why they depend on expat civilians to lend their homes or businesses for missions abroad."
"If you're a former Syrian intelligence officer, the local Syrian restaurant can make a handy base of operations -- and save you a few bucks on lunch."
"Welcome, my friend."
Please -- please sit.
You know who I am?
I have an idea.
You're the guy that's...
trying to kill Schmidt.
Yeah.
My name is Jabbar Hamady.
Mr. Schmidt has taken something that belongs to me.
"So, my men told me a very interesting story about finding you in the warehouse."
Tell me about this.
"Yeah, my name's Brent Sodor, and, like I told your men, I'm on Schmidt's security team."
You must've really won her over.
She does not dig up those stories for just anyone.
You can get even tonight.
My parents will be happy to fill you in on all the gory details of my adolescence.
Meeting their daughter's recovering-addict boyfriend.
Senior prom doesn't strike me as the dinner topic of choice.
They're not like that.
They're going to love you.
I hope so.
- Check out this Web site.
"- ""The Skinny Minnie."""
- Do people really read this?
- Yeah.
Everything you've always wanted and not wanted to know about your celebrities.
Scroll down past the photo of Britney without underwear.
It's you.
And me!
"""Soap hunk shops for furniture in WeHo with a friend."""
- Wow.
I'm a friend?
- You're a friend in italics.
"""If that didn't sound the alarm check out the less-than-hetero lamp."""
I told you that lamp was gay.
And ugly.
- It gets worse.
"- ""It could just be wishful thinking, but we're getting a serious gay vibe from the daytime doctor."""
"I've spent the morning fielding calls from my agent, my manager, my mom."
Your mom checks Skinny Minnie?
She Googles my name once a week.
And that's not the point.
We need to lay low.
What?
- More of a fight.
She beat me senseless.
That must have taken at least ten seconds.
"15 seconds, actually."
"We're about to be sent to Devil's Island,"
Tarby's coming for an important dinner party and you're babbling on about your insane mother.
We're up plop creek with no loo brush.
- I'll telephone my agent.
"- Good idea, let's blame him."
Yeah.
"Hey, what if he won't take the rap?"
"Say we'll go to the papes about his ""children's catalogue""."
Nice thinking.
"Hello, Filthy?"
"God bless, look after Mum, drive safely."
"Listen, you filthy, evil porno merchant, me and Eddie are in trouble."
"Unless you take the blame, we'll tell the world the truth about your ""stage school""."
"Please, daughter, please."
Please.
"Listen, I am not a well man."
"This morning, I coughed so hard I sucked my trousers up my backside."
"Now, listen, Richie."
Nobody needs to take the rap for this.
What you have got to get yourself is an alibi.
"Don't shout, daughter."
There's only so much an agent can take after only one bottle of aspirin.
"Now, look, alibis are easy."
"You're a comic, right?"
"Well, loosely speaking, of course."
Yeah.
You were doing a show.
"No, no, that's easy."
"The dead are being dug from the rubble and in France, the German armies wait for this country to surrender."
But English troops are fighting back.
"In the skies, the young men of the RAF are struggling against the Nazi forces which only a year ago invaded Poland, swept through France, and left this country standing alone in a conflict which, if lost,"
could destroy the Free World.
"Sergeant Major, move the men in."
"All right, you lot, move."
Mind your backs.
Gangway.
I found the four extra carriages you need.
- Good.
- You'll have your thousand men.
- I'd rather be with them than here.
"- Finland appeals to you, does it?"
- Is it the country or the ladies?
- Just a brief surge of patriotism.
- Are you coming for a drink?
"- Thanks, no."
Perhaps tomorrow.
Hello?
- See you in the morning.
- Yes.
Three that I can see from here.
Cheers.
- Mr Faber?
"- Hello, Billy."
I've got another interview with the army.
You don't look any older than you did last week.
My mate Harry's got some cream that'll take the pimples off just like that.
There's no need to rush.
"There'll be plenty of war left, I can promise you."
But I want to fight now.
Everyone's in uniform except me.
"Your Honor, we call ready for trial."
[ click]
"Well, isn't this interesting?"
Call down the voir dire panel.
We're gonna pick us a jury.
What I don't understand is how you don't warn me.
"Well, you haven't been listening to me."
I wasn't sure I was going to do it when we went in.
I had to see if they were ready.
We're not ready!
- We're not ready.
"- They're not, either."
"If they were ready, they would have brought a whole crew and a bunch of video equipment, a bunch more files, all kind of shit."
So you in no way feel that this is rushed.
We have no choice.
"I mean, I could get arrested any time."
"- Oh, stop."
- Or maybe killed.
Jesus Christ.
Time's not exactly on our side here.
Tomorrow?
Hmm.
"The partners aren't happy, Donald."
"I wouldn't call it exactly a revolt, but there's definite rumbling-- mostly about the Borns Tech case and your relationship with Lucy."
"That's over, and the partners' doubts will pass."
"Well-- if... we win the Borns case, maybe."
Or what?
They'll replace me?
I'd like to meet the man they have in mind.
Or the woman.
Listen.
"Please listen to me, Donald."
I don't trust you in this hospital.
"And I certainly don't trust you with my patient of three years, who's extremely important."
I...
"If you want to stay on this case, you will stay out of my way."
"You will do what I tell you, and if you have something to say to or about my patient, you will raise your hand and wait to be called on."
You--you've got to be kidding me.
Yes.
"This is a joke, right?"
Do I look like I'm laughing?
You're upset.
I don't get upset with patients.
You're mad at me for killing those women.
I get that.
Would you feel differently if you knew that I was beaten as a child?
Every day.
It's how I learned to read.
I-I used to hide under the sink and sound out the letters on the detergent box.
Is that true?
Did it make you feel better?
"Whatever helps you sleep at night, dr."
Grey.
Did you do something bad?
Traffic violation.
"What's wrong with you, kid?"
I need a new liver and a new intestine.
Yeah?
You want mine?
Are you in the north terminal?
"Well, that's where she's supposed to be."
"No, no, do-don't go anywhere."
Just wait.
Never mind.
They like a good buzz.
- Are you just trying to set me up?
- Why would I do that?
'Cause you want to see me fail.
"I mean, why else would you come here tonight?"
I just had nothing else to do.
"- Vodka, huh?"
- Grey Goose.
Hey.
Go take the kids shopping.
Get supplies for Judah-Fest.
"Yeah, I can do that, with money for both provisions and my services as a nanny/assistant."
Oh.
"Oh, that's how it's gonna be?"
"Well, according to my calculations,"
I will have fully repaid my debt to you as of my next excursion to the dry cleaner's.
"I'd like to double-check those numbers, if you don't mind."
"They're rough estimates, really."
"They're more projections, taking inflation into account."
"I got another bill today from your old alma mater, Hamadash La blah blah blah?"
"Over $5,000."
"Hamidrash I'Torah, and that happens to be tax-deductible."
"I don't pay taxes, you idiot."
There's a big harvest coming up in a couple of weeks.
Why don't you come back and help?
I'll put you on the payroll.
- I want more than Sanjay.
- Forget it.
"Wait, wait, wait."
"- Yeah, I'll take it."
- Welcome back.
- Jelly beans for the piñata.
is this what we were missing?
What were we missing?
Why do you bang that bottle down on the piano?
That's my livelihood!
You shouldn't put it there!
I paid for it.
Isn't it undignified to take the bottle with you?
It's not undignified.
You ordered Martell.
"You left it there, you acted like noble ladies."
Miss didn't want to dance...
For heaven's sake!
For heaven's sake!
I only spoke to those boys on her behalf.
You only spoke on her behalf!
Why did you need to do that?
Why did you have to say that?
What good is that to us?
And what does the Martell matter!
Here we lost thousands...
"Heavens, you made such a fuss there, until now we haven't been anywhere, and when we do go, all you care about is one Martell... all you care about is one Martell..."
People were paying thousands!
But I have to watch the budget.
It's always only you!
Your budget!
Always only you!
We've had this for years.
"Years, and now you even... I told her I didn't need to go there."
She even made an expensive dress.
This is an expensive dress?
"The dressmaker laughed, she called it a rag."
So what kind of modern dress does she want?
But I felt like it was the right thing to do.
"Look, I know you and my father used to hate each other,"
But that was a long time ago.
You are the only one
Still having this fight.
He has moved on.
Is everything okay?
Rufus went to the board and blocked dad
From getting the apartment.
"Serena, that's absurd."
Rufus would never do something like that.
"I would, to protect my marriage."
"I don't trust William's intention,"
And I don't want him living under my roof.
"Rufus, you're being completely paranoid."
"At first he tried he tried to isolate you from your family,"
And now he's moving into the building
To get closer to you.
"I told you, he's moving in to be close to the children."
All I see here is jealousy run amok.
"Mom, come on."
We should go.
"Lil Rufus, it's probably best if you don't come tonight."
What are you two doing here?
This is an alumni event.
Columbia puts aside a bunch of tickets for students.
"We'd invite you to join, but they were very explicit-"
No fake students allowed.
"Hey, doctor."
"If you'll excuse me a moment,"
I should go say hello to a few old colleagues.
I'll be right back.
Back off!
Meredith.
This is between you and I.
"The rest of these guys, they don't matter."
This is just you and me.
And a choice.
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.
You're letting your emotions get the better of the situation.
The adrenaline is really kicking in.
"But what I know, the reason that I'm not shaking is because this is a choice not dictated by emotion."
This is logic.
"Pure, simple."
My boy over there is rated 4th in the world on the Glock 30.
You know what that means?
What's it mean?
It means I could shoot you from Texas.
"Now, that's, of course, an exaggeration but the point stands."
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.
And you're you.
You've already dropped the gun.
Because this is a choice within a very strict set of parameters.
Right now you're in control.
What you don't wanna do is put him in control.
Don't give him the choice.
That way is death.
That way is the unconditional end to future choice.
That's it.
Good girl.
"I know, I know."
"It's always a tough lesson to learn, to realize that you don't have the stomach to do what's needed."
That they took what looks like the most boring words in the English language and made them into a sentence?
"Well, I've always been fascinated by this stuff."
It's just the beast took up most of my brain.
Now you're free to really get your nerd on?
Exactly.
I wasted all that time on the beast when I could have been charting the development of metallurgy during the 19th century.
Is Shannon Kelly here?
Kyle Weathers.
I've come a long way to find you.
Thanks.
This is Tom.
Tom.
Good to meet you.
Hi.
"We're short on daylight, so I'll come straight to the point."
The beast is in my sights and you're the girl to help me find it.
- Excuse me?
- I've been monitoring your blog for the last six months.
Your findings are pretty compelling.
Why didn't you leave any comments?
Open up myself to replies from fools with no brains and even less imagination?
I know exactly what you mean.
Right.
I'm searching the woods tonight and I need an expert.
- What do you say?
- She's into metalgy...
"Metal...metallurgy now, you see."
Old news.
Tell me more.
Don't worry.
No-one can get in.
And we're not getting out.
It's not so bad.
The Gagnon Nursery is full of Kings just like it.
Kings just like it?
She loved dogs...
especially coIIies.
They were all named King.
"When the Iast one died in the spring, she didn't replace him."
"She said, she could go anytime, and the family would have enough to care for polo never mind a dog."
So she bought a little plaster negro.
"Her "" little King""."
Poor old lady.
She was totally lost.
She kept asking:
"What do we do, Bertrand?"
We can't call the cops just for that.
I Iooked at him:
"maybe not call the cops... but still, you can't smash everything you find ugly."
"while we were wondering,"
polo decided to taste the nigger.
He does that with strangers.
"He goes up to them, he smells them, and sometimes even licks them."
And how did the kid react?
Of course we all feel weird the first time.
He was no different.
He started smiling.
It was the only time we saw him smile.
She went to get him and said:
"Forgive him, he means no wrong."
It always upset her when it happened.
She would always say the same thing:
"polo, come on, we don't do that."
"You can look at them, you can smell them."
I'll take care of the old woman.
Mom!
Dad!
Time's up.
Mommy!
Isn't it amazing?
"Not only one, but three foxes were found in Seoul's Nam Mountain."
"According to witnesses, these foxes walked around Nam Mountain as if it were their home."
"The Animal Protection Association said those foxes are known to be extinct, and asked special protection and affection from citizens."
The foxes will add another attraction to Nam Mountain's scenery.
I hope they live happily in these parts.
This is Kang Yoo-mi from Nam Mountain.
"Honey, what are you doing?"
Hurry or we'll be late!
Okay!
"I told you not to do somersaults, didn't I?"
Carry your bag first and go.
Isn't it great to run on two legs?
"Oh, look at your pretty cheeks!"
"Honey, hurry up."
Tell your father not to go around.
He went out again.
It's because he feels stuffy at home.
And tell your brother not to piss everywhere.
"Don't worry, I'll clean up."
"Yeah, like you ever did."
"From today on, don't do somersaults or eat anything like you just did at school."
Why not?
Because you're different from others.
You're a 0.5 breed.
What's that?
"Well, something happened between me and daddy long time ago."
God forgives.
Pray for him to teach you how.
I don't pray any more.
I used to.
"I used to pray for answers - a clue, a sign of what I should do, how to find something precious in this life."
"There was a time when I thought it was my job, but is it?"
Nothing in this world changes because of what I do.
The hurt goes on and on.
God has...
God has given up on us.
"He doesn't hear us any more, sister."
Do you have a family?
"Yes, a wife, yes."
Do you love your wife?
"Yes, very much."
Is she precious to you?
Yes.
Then I'd say God is listening.
Nice place.
Classy and clean is the goal.
That's our goal.
"Keep it clean, sanitary, immaculate, so you'd be able to eat off the floor."
You wouldn't find food on the floor.
Not that you'd eat it if you did.
That's how clean it is.
This desirous establishment is one that'll attract
- nothing but the best clientele.
- Not to mean that we'll be elitist.
"No, sir."
"No back room VIP lounge just for the likes of Devo, Sabo and Bull."
This bar is for the working class guy.
"Like us, like you."
I will leave you in peace.
"Oh, no. (GIGGLES)"
It's very bad.
"No, don't!"
Ooh!
That's really quite good.
"One, two."
"(PIANO TRANSCRIPTION OF BEETHOVEN'S ""SYMPHONY NO.6 IN F"")"

I can see you're not one of those perfumed prancers in there.
- What do you say to a little hunting?
- I am standing guard on my mistress.
That one?
"She doesn't need your protection, by God."
Fascinating creature.
I'm sure she'd rather come hunting with us than sit around arranging her flounces.
"""One warm word from you and I live."
"One brutal word and I die."""

- Will you take it to him?
- Why don't you take it to him yourself?
I've been avoiding him all morning.
"He's had a poor first impression of me, I fear."
"Before I meet him again, I want him to be convinced of my complete sincerity."
Well?
What do you think?
"Look, you know him."
How will he respond?
I can't imagine any man resisting this prose.
It would melt the Alps.
"But tell me, why do you pounce on our poor Chopin?"
"Phan, where you been hiding?"
"Over in Maui, chilling."
Bought a piece of golf course.
Get out of here.
What?
You get a couple of holes.
"- Come over, I'll take care of you."
- I'm coming at Christmas.
"I saw you were in the shooting in Seattle, so I thought I better get back, keep an eye on business."
"There's something going on, we don't know what."
Bob's got a theory.
Will you stop it with that!
You create this atmosphere of paranoia.
It's ridiculous.
"If it's real, it ain't paranoia."
"Get hip to what's in the air, it's called atmosphere."
You can smell it.
You can taste it.
"Come on, you can see it."
You're scaring me.
We're just talking about this American crew trying to make a push.
- I'm hearing the same thing.
"- So, what about these Americans?"
Couple of guys were round my place when I was gone.
Americans trying to buy whatever weed I had available.
I heard that maybe you were gonna get out of the business.
"Yeah, we've been talking about it."
"So, do I get a chance to buy a piece of it?"
- Make an offer?
- Maybe.
- What piece do you want?
- The contacts out of the East.
Laura's fingerprints were all over the section on sexual harassment.
She was thinking of suing him?
"Well, he might have tried to trade a promotion for sexual favors."
"She balked, and he withdrew the promotion."
"""Fearsome Phil""."
The guy's already got a reputation.
Lawsuit might have cost him big time.
So he killed her.
Guy's seen too many operas.
Every union in building's got grievances against Fearsome Phil.
He's a rage-a-holic.
Thinks he's the only artist in the building.
Can't imagine working with someone like that.
"Long as he keeps filling the seats, management won't touch him."
But an harassment complaint...
- Who we talking about?
- Laura Booth.
Laura?
You're kidding me.
"Yeah, he promised to make her first violin."
You're her union rep.
We thought she might have talked to you. / No.
Laura was pretty single-minded about getting where she wanted to go.
But I was sure she was off-limits to Reinhardt.
- Because of her age?
- No.
Reinhardt's had an on-and-off thing with Laura's mother.
With Gillian Booth?
Really?
"If she knew he was harassing her daughter, could she hurt him?"
"Well, singers talk to other singers."
She could make it very hard for him to get hired somewhere else.
There comes a time in every man's life when he wants to be left alone.
"Now, go away."
"All right, who wants the queen of the may?"
"How about you, handsome?"
You look like Cary Grant.
You want to dance with me?
"I'd love to, Queenie but, well, one of the other girls asked me first."
"Bye, darling."
Bye.
"Any cigars left, Cookie?"
"Come on, Cookie, get me a cigar."
What's the matter?
You on their team now?
You think I'm the guy?
I don't know what to think anymore.
I understand how you feel.
It's sort of rough one American squealing on other Americans.
"Then again, Cookie maybe that stoolie's not an American at all."
Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks.
They do that sometimes.
"Just put an agent in with us, a trained specialist."
Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp.
Not just whether somebody's trying to escape.
"What outfit we were with where we were stationed, how our radar operates."
"Could be, couldn't it?"
In this barracks?
Why not?
Just one of the boys.
"Sharing our bunks, eating our chow."
Right in amongst the ones that beat me up.
Except he beat hardest.
Who is it?
"When John McGarrett was investigating his wife's murder, he found a lot of evidence, bits and pieces."
Not all of it made sense to him at the time.
You recognize those numbers?
Can't say that I do.
It's an offshore account.
CIA used it to fund black ops.
"If I gave those numbers to a reporter friend of mine and he started digging, who knows what he might come up with."
Or how high it goes.
What do you want?
Doris McGarrett.
I need a location and a phone number.
"Take my advice, Joe, and just walk away."
This one's too hot.
"Steve McGarrett wants answers, Sam."
He's not gonna quit till he gets them.
I'll tell you what.
Because we're friends...
I'll give you the information you want on Doris.
You can decide how much of it you want to share with her persistent son.
It may be the better part of valor to keep him in the dark... once you hear what I have to say.

"Eternal rest grant unto Billy, oh, Lord."
And let perpetual light shine upon him.

"We need to verify what he's saying, though."

We're just trying to set a baseline for Jind Allah's truthfulness.
- I need to know if it happened at all.
"- When I know, you'll know."
- Thank you.
- When the rubble was cleared... half... of my family was dead.
It was on that day that I swore my life to vengeance for Allah.
"And for that very reason, those holding you here can never let you leave."
Your only hope is to tell me so I can hopefully one day share your struggle with the world.
Your government won't even admit that I exist.
How possibly can you tell my side of the story?
"Hey, guys, we want silence tonight."
No coms.
Let's be careful.
We don't know what to expect.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Let's do it.
Clear!
This place is completely empty.
We missed them again.
"You got Gideon, Prentiss, and me."
It's Hotch.
We're at cell location number 2.
"I should have died, but you..."
"You didn't want to be alone, and that's what all this boils down to."
You can't stand the thought of being alone.
All right.
I'll give you this much.
You are certainly willing to do the sacrificing as long as you're not the one being hurt.
"All right, you want to be honest?"
"If the situation were reversed and I was dying, you'd do the same thing."
"No, Dean."
I wouldn't.
Same circumstances...
I wouldn't.
I'm gonna get to bed.

"Even though I couldn't do it myself,"

Where have you been?
- Had a busy night.
- I'm sure you did.
Read this morning's operations printout?
What about it?
I was with Vinnie Zapatti last night.
He's dead because of Tino Zapatti's probation report.
Now there's four deaths.
They're connected.
- That's all I know...
- That's all I want to know.
Just trying to circle the wagons.
Circle the wagons?
Who do you think you are?
Some gumshoe in a dime novel loose-cannoning around the city?
Consorting with known mobsters!
"Kevin, for God's sakes!"
You're the mayor's right hand!
What are you fucking around for?
You see this desk?
"It belonged to Fiorello LaGuardia, ""the little flower."""
He was about five-foot tall.
Used to read the funny papers to children over the radio and was about the best mayor the city ever had.
Know what LaGuardia said?
"""Why is it every time you can do some good the nice people come in and mess you up?"""
Be nice.
Don't mess me up.

It's pretty safe to say that Jill's obsession with aging and getting married in due time started back in Catholic school and specifically our first communion.
We got to walk down the isle like mini brides to be.
Comparing prettiest dresses...
and fanciest bows.
This is where Jill got programmed to plan for the next time... she would walk down the aisle...
dressed in white.
You are getting married
A little toy here or there never hurt anyone.
Plus it comes with a carrying case.
Oh!
That is such an inappropriate gift.
What you're saying you don't masturbate?
No personally I don't masturbate.
I find it to be a little bit... un-holy.
Wouldn't you agree?
Jillian thank you I love this!
Dale have you talked to JP?
No.
I mean he called twice but...
"Hey, I heard you saw Zach."
Oh yeah.
I saw his video on TV the other day he looks so good.
Did you guys make plans to hang out?
No we just caught up for a second.
He was with a girlfriend.
Hmmm...
Ok what is up?
What?
You look like either have to pee or you're about to explode with gossip.
Do I?
- Which is it?
Congratulations!
You're marrying my sister!
"And you spared no expense, ya big crazy."
You know what?
"I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
"And I think he really, really meant it."
"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers... but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
It's true.
"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see."
And I see her brighter and more clearly... than anything else in this world.
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol mixed... with some very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's how you see Barney.
Stay back or I'll shoot him!
"Appreciate what you're trying to do, son."
"Did the same job myself, and proudly."
"I have no quarrel with you, but I do have a deadline."
So put the gun down..
Pull the pin.
Because you're not gonna shoot the president.
You're right.
"Where does that leave us, boys?"
That leaves us with this.
Come on!
"Go, go, go!"
What are you doing?
!
"Oh, no."
"Come on, go!"
No!
You fucking roadkill.
Who... who kept wide eyes... when she jaws?
What?
We're on a deadline and there's a shortage of interns.
Bullshit.
I have appointments and I need someone to carry my Polaroid.
"- But we need her, darling."
- Get Foofy.
- I don't know where Foofy is.
- Filing cards for upcoming shoots.
You know we only use 5 models anyway.
Are you an idiot?
No!
So don't act like one.
So here is the trick for getting free stuff:
"You call Louis Vuitton, call in 4 bags and send back 3."
"The next day, call in 2 and send back 1..."
Then call in 5 and send back 4.
When they ask you to cough up... this luggage you delay and tell them it's on a shoot in Barbados.
"Until you find somebody over there quit, which is weekly."
And say you just sent it back to Sheila and fake surprise... when they say she left the company.
- No way.
- Lf they keep questioning you... tell them you messengered it over to Vogue.
An editor requested it.
- That's hilarious!
- Works every time.
"Hello, Louis V."
This soup is delicious.
It beats throwing an acceptable layout away.
It's such a chaos over there.
This whole Yuri hassle journey... is insane.
"No, not really, I suppose."
But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.
You would want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
It might be best to have a man with experience.
Someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
"I understand, Your Excellency."
Let's see who's around.
"In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Well, he does know the background."
I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist.
"There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
What about the exorcist?
Have you any ideas?
How about Lankester Merrin?
I had a notion he was in Iraq.
I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh.
"You're right, but he's finished."
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.
"What's he doing there, teaching?"
He's working on another book.
"Don't you think he's too old, Tom?"
How's his health?
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.
"-Besides, he's had experience."
-I didn't know that.
"Ten, 1 2 years ago, I think, in Africa."
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.
You can ask him yourself
But he is blind!
What?
Blind?
He told your fortune in darkness?
I think you should get into your room first
I'll get money from Master to get you medicine
"Hey, Gao!"
What?
Jin Tianyun is dead?
"Y es, I heard he was killed by the Three Devils"
These Three Devils are pure evils
Ever since they killed him their morale is boosted
Don't know why they have stayed here the past few months?
"What's more, a few days ago they have beaten up"
Master Qin's apprentices for no reason at all!
Nonsense!
If they keep on causing trouble
I'll teach them a good lesson!
That's why we are here
We hope you could ensure that justice is done
Y es!
The three of them are very skillful
"Master, what should we do?"
Should we hire some more men to help?
In order to eradicate these kind of dregs
Maybe it's good to have some more men
Do you know where the three of them... used to stay?
"We're not sure about that, but we've heard..."

I was.
I did.

"If we're going to be working together,"
"Risking our lives together,"
Then I must be able to trust you.
"On my honor, you can."
Your honor is not enough.
Mr. Stark deemed me worthy of his trust.
I would hope that would suffice.
Mr. Stark would trust a shark to not bite him
If it was wearing a short enough skirt.
That's not entirely relevant.
Would it satisfy you to know
You know that?
What?
"What, babe, what's going on in that crazy head of yours?"
"I really want this to work, Stevie."
But?
You know so little about me.
What if I turned into a werewolf or something?
I'll buy you a flea collar.
I love you.
- Stevie?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
"I set out some clean clothes for you, your stuff is not dry yet."
You always keep men's clothes lying around?
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep a clean change clothes here.
"I'll probably just throw them out now though, right?"
"Hey, perfect fit."
"Yeah, well, Trevor..."
I don't have a size 26 waist here.
"Hey, how about that idea."
I can get a job selling man's wear.
Those chicks got paid vacations too.
I'll settle for that.
That's not a bad life.
Could be worse.
You know what else I want to do?
"I want to clean up this place, just get rid of all the fucking junk."
"Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper, which I sometimes am... but I can also be very very, you know, organised and neat."
And I wanna do more of that.

Churchill sends his congratulations.
"This is in Corsica, it's a man whom I loved very much."
I photographed him in a field...
Which he owned in a certain way...
It's land that...
That was his heritage from his uncle in Corsica.
It's a picture taken 5 or 6 years ago.
I particularly like the sun in the tree over here.
"And this man, standing straight in front of the tree."
I took it because that's kind of his empire.
"When seeing him there, I told myself that..."
"That this land is his own, and he's standing there..."
"I've always envied that - people who have a land, a place..."
A belonging.
I've never had that...
"I also loved him for this, actually..."
Therefore it's a sentimental picture.
"That's why you took it, because he was there..."
"Well no, there's no real explanation for this..."
It's just a sentimental picture...
All pictures are sentimental.
What do you think about it?
I don't know.
You never know.
Never mind.
It's in London.
That's more recent.
It's in a pub in London.
"In the day, we were having lunch."
A very British pub.
I really like pubs.
Their... sort of darkness...
At that time I didn't photograph myself yet...
Huh?
How 'bout Yale?
Collateral damage.
Acceptable losses when you consider that with interest there's over twenty million in Kozlenko's account right now.
"Aw, c'mon partner, just think what we could do with that money."
"You been planning this for a long time, huh?"
Nah.
"You know, you got out when you should."
I stayed too long.
"I got bounced around, passed over."
"You know, the last time I really enjoyed the game was Berlin."
Right before the wall came down.
"So, you started thinking about the money."
"Yeah, checked some records."
It was forgotten about.
"I mean, c'mon, it's all sitting there, right there."
"I think I'm gonna follow your example, bro, and not share."
You are gonna tell me your code numbers and Marta's code numbers.
Oh.
"Oh I know you way too well, partner."
Yeah?
Yeah.
You're not gonna shoot me.
You couldn't pull the trigger.
You're right.
The only thing I'm gonna regret is that you won't remember what an asshole you've become.
I wonder what two shots would do?
"So, how did it go?"
Couldn't have been smoother.
They didn't ask any questions?
Transferred all the funds to a new account in the Cayman Islands.
Oh baby.
I started going to the ballet on my days off.
And to the Cinematheque.
I try to see all the silent movies.
"German, American, everything."
Then I tell her all I've seen.
These last four years have been the richest in my life.
"Looking after Alicia, doing the things she liked to do, except traveling, of course."
"For me, it's the opposite with Lydia."
How come?
I can't even touch her.
I don't recognize her body.
I can't even help the nurses to turn her over in the bed.
And I feel so despicable.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
"I'd like to, but she can't hear me."
Why are you so sure about that?
Because her brain is turned off.
"A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so."
"You havetopayattention to women, talk to them, be thoughtful occasionally."
Caress them.
"Remember they exist, they're alive and they matter to us."
That's the only therapy.
I know from experience.
What experience have you had with women?
"Benigno, what experience have you had with women?"
What?
What experience have you had with women?
Me?
A lot.
I lived 20 years day and night with one and 4 years with this one.
I love the bullfighter's boyfriend.
""" Pete, don't worry about it. """
You weren't the first licensed practioner that sleeps with one of your patients and you won't be the last.
"Besides, you're single."
Let it go.
"But then , just when he was almost over with the guilt and all, another voice would bring him back down to reality and said, "" Oh Pete , but dude, you're a veterinarian! """
Vi !
Let's go !
What are you doing ?
I don't get it.
Don't get what ?
What's so funny about the vegetarians ?
I don't get it .
You mean the veterinarian man ?
"Yea, that guy."
I don't get it .
He sleeps with his patients .
His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff.
Why is that funny?
Back home we had puppy dogs and kitty cats
I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.
"Actually, don't worry about it , partner."
There're plenty of other jokes in the universe that we can share .
Let's just get ready for tonight.
Some well deserved vacation.
"I got a good one for you, Violet ."
Lay it on me!
Oh damn!
What?
I think I forgot it .
"But that's the good thing, Daze;"
I'll be here when it comes back to you .
"On a real diamond,it evaporates immediately."
"It's,uh,staying."
Because it's a fake.
"Give it one more try,just to make sure."
I'm not blowing on you again.
Question three.
"""Why buy a shovel?"""
-Oops.
-No.Sorry.
"""Why bury a shovel?"""
I have no answer to that.
"But here,how about this one?"
who is darkman?
that is thquestion.
Liam neeson in the 1990 cult classic directed by sam raimi about a mentally unstable scientist who seeks revenge.
"You left out ""who shot rebecca?"""
That was my next question.
Siri claims she was out walking at the time of the shooting.no witnesses.
Gsr tests came back negative.
"Even if siri shot rebecca, I don't think she killed finn."
I saw her face when she saw his body.
"If siri's innocent,she'd assume that rebca's guilty and she'd seek revenge."
Shting someone in broad daylight is just dumb.
"You're not thinking like a jealous woman, ziva."
They're keeping rebecca in the hospital overnight.
"She lost a lot of blood,but the wound was through and through."
Anything on the shooter?
Said she didn't get a good look at her.
How'd she know it was a her?
Rebeccsaid she heard a female voice at the door.
"When she opened it,bang."
Siri?
You remember the question 4?
"No, of course not."
Addons to the fourth question is:
"""With how many men you sleep"""
That's not your job.
Addons That's not my job?
Then you add the Addons test results in your public profile?
"Are you happy and Addons to believe that you Kinky,"
Addons but fear to tell the truth.
Addons
- With how many people are sleeping?
"- I say, it's none of your business."
I bet there are 10 in the record.
"Addons Well, Gwen."
Addons Let me help you to explain this.
Addons you have access to a lot of forums ...
"Addons But, you are active, from 5 to 15 times a week."
Virtual reality.
Addons Your avatar shows a white rose ...
"Addons And your screen name is ""Terry Bomb""."
Addons So Terry bomb ...
Addons How many people have you slept with?
- Nine
Not have to end like this
Addons you hide behind a user name behind the avatar
"Addons But wherever you go Apapunyang you download, upload, is Online locked and stored"
Addons A trail of information available for those who want it.
"Addons downloads fact, every website visited You've visited in the last 1 month"

Any financial support whatsoever.
How much is this gonna cost me?
We'll do it for free.
Free to her.
I didn't say we won't get paid.
"Book rights,movie rights--"
"Press like this, we're gonna get paid."
Trust me.
"I told you we'd handle it, but we've gotta move fast."

"News coverage means the chance of you getting a fair trial is going down by the second,"

You just need to answer one question.
I told you.
It was self-Defense.
That's not the question.
Don't guess!
Ron.
What did you do with the knife?
Threw it away?
That's not good.
"Plus,she's too calm to have just killed someone."
"She's not calm,alden."
She's numb.
Not too numb to come here instead of going to the cops.
You think she's lying to us?
A married man and a college girl go to a hotel room together--
"Someone's lying about something, and that's before anyone dies."
The d.A. Will argue that she ditched the knife

"- I'm sorry, I did not mean to."
- Pray do not apologise.
I did not know you were interested in literature.
You could not.
I do not believe the subject has ever arisen between us... until now.
"Miss Marianne, may I venture a proposal?"
A proposal?
Allow me to select a book for you from Mr Palmer's extensive library.
"It may help pass the time while you remain here, and it would give me great pleasure."
Thank you.
"Yes, I would be delighted."
And perhaps we might discuss it when I visit you at Barton.
You are to visit us at Barton?
Oh...
You did not know?
Your mother has invited me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"- Thank you, Mrs Wallis."
"- Thank you, miss."
I wish you a good journey.
"And you, Mrs Jennings."
What can I say to you?
"I'll have no thanks, my dear."
I've enjoyed every moment the two of you spent with me.
I'm grateful for the pleasure of the company of such lovely people.
"Now then, I wish you no more sorrows and much future happiness."
Bless you.
"Well, you're right."
I'm invisible.
"That night, the only person in worse shape than Robin... was her fiancé."
"Ted, I'm desperate."
"Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff, and I got a partial for Marshall."
Did you bang that girl yet?
Don't get your hopes or anything else up.
I tried to connect with her... but everything just comes back to her weird fetish about how old I am.
"Well, just go simple."
Does she like TV?
No.
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you as loud and as long as you want.
- Sports?
- No.
But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard... just slathered in Bengay.
"- Well, does she like books?"
- No.
- But I bet you do.
- Mm-hmm.
I bet you have a big...
thick... pair of bifocals.
She doesn't have daddy issues.
She has granddaddy issues.

"It means that Mother Kali, with all her arms outstretched... hugs us to her bosom, welcoming us back as Thugs..."
Thugs awakened from a sleep... of 50 years.

Give them their burial picks.
Swear by our Mother Kali... to be thrice faithful to her and to me and to our order... and to all of us.

Rise and kill.

Heaven knows when we shall be back.
Why do you suppose he turned up in an Arab outfit and wearing make-up?
What's more important:
why was he killed?
I bet he was a spy or something.
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?
I'll tell you later.
- (Siren Wailing)
- What is it?
l-l just feel kinda funny.
Why should he pick me out to tell?
After what we said about him last night.
"When we get in with the inspector, I'll do my best to cut the red tape."
- Fine.
Fine.

I'm afraid the questions will go till doomsday if you admit you knew him.
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.
"They're a cynical lot, these French."
They might refuse to believe that.

Are you gonna show them what you wrote?

Count to five.

Start with one.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Good.
"Now, stop counting."
Let's go.
"You're crazy, everybody knows to split eights."
My grandmother splits eights.
Not against a 10.
It's a sucker play.
"Look, you're choosing to play two hands against the highest up card a dealer can have, right?"
"Against a five or a six, it'd be fine."
"Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play."
"Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?"
Jill's right.
All right?
"Choi, why don't you explain to Ben how we do?"
"Oh, all right."
"So, our team is divided into two kinds of players, spotters and big players, right?"
"So if you think that this table is the casino floor, then salt and pepper shakers are your spotters."
Spotters are just sitting at the various blackjack tables and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.
"It depends on your definition of ""people,"""
and that's enough of a technicality to keep your lawyers dizzy for centuries.
"Take me to court, then, Doctor, and watch me smile and cry and flutter."
And creak?
And what?
"""Creak."" You're creaking."
What?
Ah!
I-I'm drying out.
"Oh, sweet heavens."
Moisturize me!
Moisturize me!
Where are my surgeons?
My lovely boys!
It's too hot!
You raised the temperature.
Have pity.
Moisturize me!
"Oh, oh, Doctor!"
Help her.
Everything has its time and everything dies.
I'm...too... young.
And I love how the Doctor's so callous with her.
"Like when Rose is like ""Aren't you going to save her?"""
"And he's just like ""Everything has an end."""
"Poof! ""Aah!"" Bits of liver flying out."
"Eccleston, as the Doctor, just kills her, you know?"
"Like, he doesn't have any problem with saying this is justice -- she has to die for being bad guy."
"The way that he deals with her, versus the way that the tenth Doctor will later deal with her really kind of speaks volumes about the difference between the two of them."
They just create fully grown human beings out of tissue samples.
"Hello, Dad."
You just get the sense that you shouldn't mess with her.
But let me tell you something.
I'd rather blow one in 100 than send 10 men away on mandatories who don't deserve them.
You sound like an enlightened man.
And you sound like you're fucking with me.
"You have anything to add, Abe?"
It's okay.
You're doing fine.
Everybody will want to know how these things happen.
How long have you been on this job?
Three years.
"Look, these things happen because we are awash here."
"In criminals, in half-baked social workers in a city that doesn't function, in a world that doesn't know right from wrong."
- Mr. Schwartz?
- Larry.
I owe you an apology.
No apologies.
I came in here with a big head of steam.
It was inappropriate.
"Look, it takes more than 3 years to get up to speed in this department."
Only one man would have made a good probation officer:
Kafka.
And he wasn't available.
"Thank you, Larry."
Call me if something opens up in the big building.
"You know, keep me in mind."
He'll be right with you.
South Brooklyn Democratic Club.
I don't think it makes any difference whatsoever.
Have your son stop by.
I'll be happy to take care of it.
"Gussie, come on in."
"Hello, Mr. Anselmo."
"No, never it would make a thing thus, but it is precise that it comes with me."
That it goes where?
-To accompany.
-Where?
It does not touch to me.
"-The request, comes with me."
-To where I must accompany to him.
I will explain it.
In the ambulance there is a young person of only 20 years... in touch between the life and the death...
And what I can do?
It watches in what state is.
It sees it?
Here he is.?
How it goes?
poor.
"Yes, poor, is in evil been."
He is on the verge of dying.
And it knows which are the words that continue repeating in their delirium?
I love a woman.
Before dying... it would want the incommensurable one to please to see a woman.
"It is right, poor"
"He hears, you you would only have to do this:"
"to enter there, to open themselves just a little bit, to embosom a little to him the legs..."
But...
"Do it, will make a good karma and tomorrow all the angels of the sky will sing your name."
-Which is her name?
-Brígida Bonazzi.
Brígida Bonazzi.
"Yes, all the angels of the sky they will sing: ""Brígida Bonazzi,..."""
"Salt of there, salt of there."
"It enters there, enters there..."
Brígida Bonnazzi.
All I wanted was to get the best film possible out of this.
We might not like how Kyle operates but the audience loves controversy.
"And if you don't have an audience, you're nothing."
"So the more immoral he is, the more you like him?"
Welcome to showbiz.
"Looks like you found your soul mate, after all."
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
If you're that desperate to save something go sponsor a panda.
Steve!
We're leaving.
Film makers observe they don't interfere.
That's just how it is.
That's pathetic.
You turn a blind eye to something you know isn't right.
"Hey, he's the bad guy, here, not me."
There's nothing I can do to stop him.
Maybe you're scared if you do stop him you won't get a film out of it.
Doesn't it occur to you that he might be using you the way he used us?
So?
I'm using him back.
We're even.
But it isn't right!
"OK, how about this?"
Don't audiences love an unexpected twist?
Are you sure this is an actual road?
Yeah.
"Not too many people know about it, but it's a good shortcut."
As long as you avoid the bog.
So...
"Yes, Miss Sheetal?"
What makes you remember me?
Did someone flirt with you again?
"No, nothing as such."
I read in the papers about your chase with the smugglers.
Did you read it?
They have glorified you.
I thought of congratulating you.
And I called you up.
Oh I see.
Now I get it.
I wondered why'd a pampered rich girl phone a pem police officer.
"But someone said it right, that today's girls are impressed by famous people."
You must've already boasted to eveyone that you know me vey well.
"You must be getting a lot of attention, don't you?"
What?
What do you think of me?
My mistake to call you up!
What do you think ofyourself?
A pem police officer.
What's the matter?
You seem to be short-tempered.
You think you've earned international fame with a piece ofyour exploits in the papers?
You think I called you because I am impressed by your fame?
Ifthis is not the reason...then there is only one reason leR.
And that reason you and I know vey well.
I'll definitely give it a thought.
Have seen yourself in the mirror?
I am afraid... yes.
While shaving today morning.
"Actually, my face is vey expressive."
Especially my eyes.
"So I figured someone cashes it in, you could look at the videotape."
There's our thief.
Yeah.
"Uh, could you excuse me for one moment?"
"Of course, there's no guarantee that the thief would turn it in himself."
You meeting us here is kind of a coincidence.
We were just discussing your case.
"That's a great detection idea, Howard, but I guess we feel like you've been inconvenienced enough."
"So, on behalf of the Montecito, allow me to pay you off on the bet."
- There you go.
There's eighteen hundred.
- Wow.
"And I'll just pull- 2,000."
Thanks.
I-I don't know what to say.
I will definitely recommend your hotel to everyone I know.
That's the guy I played poker with.
And our wallet thief.
And the guy who cost me 240 bucks.
Now it's personal.
Uh-oh.
Better tell the women and children to take cover.
Are you kidding me?
"Seriously, I.R.S. problems?"
Forget about it.
"The I.R.S. is like putty in my hands, honey."
"Really, no worry."
It's putty?
"Stan, what do you know about that guy Roger who played in your poker game the other night?"
"Uh, why don't you call me."
"Uh, not much, you know."
"And I'm really sorry about that whole situation, man, really."
But this money has been accruing interest?
How much money?
TONY:
$327 million and change.
"Boss, I'm seeing multiple attempts to hack into this account over the last week."
It's got to be Amanda Baylor.
Baylor was hired to steal the AUTEC file and this money?
Blackmail was a diversion.
It explains why they never really said anything that hurt us.
"We're watching the AUTEC files, they have a better shot getting in and out of the bank account undetected."
It's all about the Benjamins.
"Well, it looks like Baylor's taking another stab at the account right now."
"She's accessing remotely, and she didn't bother burying her IP so deep this time."
She did not expect us to look for her there.
"Right, I got her."
Getting a Wi-Fi ping.
"Ziva, DiNozzo, go..."
She's just off the I-95.
I'm texting you the coordinates.
Are you sure this is the place?
"Well, what happened?"
"You don't trust the, uh, authority of McMaps?"
(truck horn blows nearby)
(whispering):
All right.
It's like Silence of the Lambs meets Scooby-Doo.
Freeze!
Hands up!
Do I look like I'm running?
"Amanda Baylor, you have the right... (sniffs) to take a bath."
You smell like a wild goat.
I've been busy.
"Well, I haven't slept in days."
Maybe if you just let me get some rest.
I just got kidnapped by space aliens to conduct a freaking top secret science experiment.
You know what we need.
Accelerated regrowth of your native mantle.
I understand what you're asking but come on.

Do better.
Liana's under a lot of pressure.
"Don't worry, once you crack this, you'll be back home, safe and sound."
What if I can't?
I won't let her harm you.
You have my word.

Adíos.
Allison's in a play this weekend.
- Put the meeting off a couple days.
- You know I can't do that.
Going to school events is what normal parents do.
So you're behind schedule in your research because of PTA meetings?
There is no time to waste!
We've got to get the reversion procedure working!
Mommy?
Allison.
What are you still doing up?
"It's late, honey, you should be asleep by now."
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Fostering human tendencies only confuses her.
"- It's not fair, Ted."
- Let's get you back to bed.
"Making her think she's something she's not, it's not fair to her!"
Déjame verla.
Have you checked out their movement?
They're still at the inn.
Will they return to BuYeo?
"If they know who we are, they will not mobilize the fleet so easily."
We will ambush them the moment they are about to leave Heng-In.
We must capture that rascal So Seo-No alive and bring her to me.
Is that understood?
"Yes, Commander."
Miss!
Miss!
What else is there to mull over?
All the workers don't wish to die before they return home.
Please give us the order to withdraw.
"Sa-Yong,"
"Yes, Miss."
"If father were here, what would he do?"
Chief isn't a reckless person.
You think that my frustration is an act of recklessness?
"Judging from our strength, we can't possibly hope to take them on."
We should flee from a battle that we cannot win.
"Actually, I... would have liked to brave the danger to reach Go-San Nation."
Miss!
Father wants to test my competence... through this expedition.
This I am aware of.
That's why I want to give it all I've got.
Please continue.
"But like what Uncle Gye-Pil said,"
I will not put the workers in danger just because of my selfishness.
Prepare to withdraw.
"Miss, I'm glad you said that."
"Hey,"

After marrying Shadab... you may have handled life.
But won't be able to life.
"And, Faiz... shall be shattered."
Still... we did a lot of good... especially considering we're down a man.
I'm proud of you.
"Yeah, but I didn't feel like we were down a man, though, the way everybody was pitching in."
It was kind of cool.
"Didn't get Gregorio fired, either."
As far as we know.
(Lasalle laughs)
"Well, we'll finally get back up to speed once Sebastian gets through training."
In the meantime... let's take the day off.
"Now, that works for me."
(chuckles)
"Man, I can just hear that firing range calling my name."
(chuckling):
Geez.
What about you?
I think you know.
Hey.
Think we have enough for an indictment?
"I'll let you know when I get back, but I doubt it."
We are still looking for the smoking gun to directly link Garcia to NOLA businesses.
New Orleans.
New Orleans.
"You really have changed since you've been down here, haven't you?"
How so?
You seem happier... which is a good thing.
"Not for us, maybe, but for you, definitely."
Maybe... you finally have stopped running.
I think so.
"Still, what are you gonna do for work?"
NCIS slot's already filled.
I don't know.
I was thinking I'd try talking Isler into transferring me here.
For your signature.
"Yes, the pipeline deal."
"Well, I'll just have to look these over and then I'll sign them."
So you and Claudia got married.
Blake doesn't approve.
I hope you do.
"Oh, there's bound to be friction between you and your brother."
I feel no animosity toward Steven.
"If there are any problems, they won't be of my making."
"Adam, I want you to make this marriage work."
"And if that sounds like an order, it is."
Steven.
I heard you were here.
I thought you might like these copies I had made.
What are they?
Papers on the pipeline deal.
Mother signed them a little while ago.
Thanks.
"What else brings you here, Adam?"
Frankly?
"Something's been bothering me, Steven."
"A lack in you, let's say."
What kind of a lack?
You've never congratulated me on my marriage to Claudia.
What's the matter?
Don't you approve?
It's not for me to approve or disapprove.
"Well, surely, you must have some opinions, Steven."
"I mean, you did abandon Claudia to run off with your boyfriend."
"His name was Luke, and he's dead."
And I don't want you to talk to me about him with anything but respect.
You understand?
So.
"You're just here to help me get information about Gus Walker, huh?"
That's right.
"Glass of Chardonnay for the lady, please."
Thanks.
"Come on, Jack."
You don't have any new information for me.
You just want to get to Walker's files to see if there's anything in there about your friend Fredel.
Not gonna work.
Come on.
Can't a guy do two things at once?
I liked Gus.
"You know, he was a major talent."
Agreed.
"The tragedy of this thing is that he lived in fear because of how controversial his work was, but this last series wasn't political at all."
So you followed his career.
Even after you stopped working for him?
"I'm not nearly as... one-dimensional as you think I am,"
Special Agent Henson.
"Oh, is that right?"
"You know, that's what Walker was trying to say with these photos."
It was about the way we perceive one another.
An issue that you are sensitive about.
Maybe.
Are you?
"You're wasting my time, Jack."
"I mean, what'd you do?"
Run an Internet search on the guy or something?
I'm interested in his work.
Uh-huh.
[dialing cell phone]
"Let's talk about this latest series, right?"
- Officer.
- Come on.
"Let's go, will you?"
"No, wait a minute."
What seems to be the trouble?
"Good morning, sir."
"Officer, this man stole a quarter from my purse."
Make him give it back.
"Now, miss, does he look like a man who would steal quarters?"
- That's just what I said to the lady.
- Imagine...
I don't care what you think he looks like.
I know he stole my quarter.
"Now you run along, sister... before I run you in for disturbing the peace."
"But, Officer, he took my..."
That'll be enough.
"Run along now, you're obstructing traffic."
"Why, you Cossack."
"Officer, you had no right to speak to that little girl that way."
I suppose you're going to tell me what my duty is.
"Not at all, but..."
"Listen, guys like you pay me to protect them from screwy dames."
"That's fine, but in this instance I'm sure you were wrong."
So now I'm wrong.
You ought to thank me for what I've done.
"- All right, thank you."
- All right.
What did you say?
"I said, look out for the great big ditch."
"Pop, why didn't you tell me you had it?"
In front of the cop?
I would've been accused of stealing it.
- Gordi.
- And Toe.
"Guys, time to put on a foil."
"Play some old-time hockey, like Eddie Shore."
- Dit Clapper.
- And Toe Blake.
- And Gordie Howe.
- Gordie.
"- You all right, goalkeep?"
"- Riley, you okay?"
"Hell, no."
"Look here, you okay?"
- Yeah.
- You sure?
Great!
Good!
Get him again!
This is how you get the jersey over your opponent's head.
"Today, if they have the balls to show up, the Newman boys face the much-hated Scranton Night Hawks."
"Two-time runners up for the Hounds, the Hawks are reloaded and they are as tough as they got."
"Holy smoke, the Newman team takes to the ice in a manner that can only be termed tremendously tacky."
They have donned the sacred shrouds of the Chiefs.
This is a sacrilege.
"Yeah, tacky like that time when you got sloshed on communion wine."
"Well, yes, exactly like that."
"0-1, same old butt-whopping."
It is clear these Newman boys are decidedly doing disservice to the lasting legacy of the Chiefs.
"Hey, Riley, I think it's time."
"Toe, Dit, Gordi, let's do it!"
"Okay, boys, make your daddies proud."
"Talk about their family ties, sports fans."
It appears the offspring of the Hanson brothers are making their first appearance as part of this ragtag team.
"German, American, everything."
Then I tell her all I've seen.
These last four years have been the richest in my life.
"Looking after Alicia, doing the things she liked to do, except traveling, of course."
"For me, it's the opposite with Lydia."
How come?
I can't even touch her.
I don't recognize her body.
I can't even help the nurses to turn her over in the bed.
And I feel so despicable.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
"I'd like to, but she can't hear me."
Why are you so sure about that?
Because her brain is turned off.
"A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so."
"You have to pay attention to women, talk to them, be thoughtful occasionally."
Caress them.
"Remember they exist, they're alive and they matter to us."
That's the only therapy.
I know from experience.
What experience have you had with women?
"Benigno, what experience have you had with women?"
What?
What experience have you had with women?
Me?
A lot.
I lived 20 years day and night with one and 4 years with this one.
I love the bullfighter's boyfriend.
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
- They go quicker than The mail On Sunday.
- Any chance of using the little girls' room?
"Oh, er, top of the stairs, first right."
"Mind if I come, too, hilly, love?"
"- What are you doing here, Pam?"
- Just welcoming the new girl.
"Oh, I thought you had Weight Watchers on Tuesday morning."
"And to think, you were worried about making friends."
Oh!
Uh.
There just seems to be so much more community spirit here.
"- Everything OK up there, ladies?"
"- (Choking) Fine, thanks, Jerry."
- Joyce won't be joining you.
- CamiIIa says otherwise.
I don't give a fuck what your handler thinks.
So take your basket of shit and go back to your kennel.
- Likewise.
- Oh!
"Now, if any of your crew so much as fart in the same room as Joyce, we'II turn the lot of you into organic mince."
Nice big airing cupboard you've got up there.
Is Pam OK?
pelvic floor gave up the ghost after baby number five.
Didn't manage to make it to the bathroom.
- Oh.
- Sends her apologies.
"Oh, you poor love."
I know how fond you are of that trouser suit.
Margaret.
I thought I couId show you round little Stempington.
I haven't really started unpacking.
There's someone I'm dying for you to meet.
Don't get close to me!
"If you do, I'll jump!"
Miss.
Please move away from there.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let go of me.
Will you be responsible if she jumps?
Don't come close!
What's the problem this time?
No one loves an ugly girl like me.
I have to die!
I understand how you feel.
But how could you throw your beautiful body into such a sewage-infested river?
But you put me into a box and humiliated me.
I wanted to start a new life in the circus.
"All I do is eat and sleep, so I've gained weight."
"Look, do you know how many people envy you?"
Why?
Because you're human.
Being human is a special right.
You know how many things try so hard to be human?
A werewolf.
A vampire.
And that's not all.
Even foxes.
"Yes, even foxes."
"In order to be human, they've withstood other's mockery, being called a goblin or monster."
"They've endure so much for a long time, almost 1000 years."
But you're giving up your humanity merely because of your appearance?
You know how precious your life is?
And you have one thing you have left to do.
"You need to fall in love before you die, right?"
Forget it.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, how about a mini celebration?"
"All right, we'll just keep it simple, just the things that Judah loved, chicken parmesan, Willy Wonka, the original not the lame Johnny Depp piece of shit."
"A piñata, lap dance."
Celia.
"Hey, take it easy."
All right.
Enough.
I never should have done this!
They hate me!
They hate me!
This is all your fault!
"God, if you would have just put a fucking light in at the intersection!"
- I was going to.
"- Oh, right, you were?"
"But you were being this know-it-ally bitchface,"
- I couldn't resist fucking with you.
"- Yeah, and you still can't."
City Council is pretty much the only thing in my life
I didn't have to get baked to get through.
You took that away from me.
How did you know about Walter's boat garage?
"Celia, everything that happens in government is motivated by self-interest."
Someone's always trying to put one over on someone else so they can get something they want.
We're all just nothing but a bunch of selfish assholes.
"Remember that, and you won't go wrong."
Thank you.
Celia.
You should bring some vodka to the council.
- Vodka.
- That's what I used to do.
You think they like anyone?
Do not listen!
It might be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.
"So far, I'd say there seem to be three."
-She's convinced that--
-There is only one.
"What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil?"
Teresa.
What a lovely name.
"""I command you..."

I wonder how a skinny little boy could have carried Suzukichi all the way back here?
Because it was the water imp.
Water imp?
"Later on, the village people and my father talked about that."
But then they all came to the conclusion that it was the water imp.
"Those skinny, cucumber-Iike arms and legs."
"And his green face, Iike a leaf."
It couldn't possibly have been anything else but the water imp.
Grandma is pretty good at telling all those make-beIieve stories.
"Maybe it's our fault, listening to her so seriously."
"It's not make-beIieve, it's her dotage."
"After all, consider her age."
What happened?
The water imp was peeking in the window!
Stop talking nonsense!
Shinjiro!
"Why, you...."
Wait up!
"""Suzujiro confirmed the names of his brothers."
"""please come to a definite decision to come to Hawaii."
"Tadao."""
"What'II you do, Grandma?"
I'II go.
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death is coming pretty soon.
I will go after I hold a memorial service for him.
AII right?
What?
Grandma decided to go?
Yes.
You didn't see the telegram telling you that?
"No, I'm afraid the telegram was sent while we were on the way back."
I guess we didn't have to come back in such a hurry.
"He didn't believe in theater, he always used to mock my dreams, and I ended up not believing in them, either."
I lost courage!
"And then the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one."
"I was becoming petty, insignificant,"
"My acting was stupid, I didn't know what to do with my hands."
I couldn't control my voice.
"You don't know what it feels like,"
knowing that you act atrociously.
I am a seagull.
"Since I came here I've been walking a lot,"
"I walk, and I think intensely, and I can feel my soul strengthening."
"I know now,"
"I understand, Kostia,"
"That in our trade, artist or writer, the essential is neither the glory, nor the sparkles, all that I dreamt of."
The essential is to know how to endure.
Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith.
Here's the item.
It's intact.
"Now, let's talk details."
"Abhorrent, isn't it?"
"Are they plotting, or what?"
Our fiancées.
Here's a doll.
"Here's the head, here's the feet."
I turn her upside down.
"Close your eyes, close your eyes."
There!
Show me where the head is?
"Now, her feet."
And now her sex.
"That's a good one, huh?"
Isn't it?
"When it's done,"
- do you think you're gonna fly home or...
- I-I-I don't know.
"Look, you don't have a fear of flying."
"You're afraid of something else, but the thought of flying triggers that fear."
"Maybe you're not afraid of flying, you're afraid of going away."
- What do you mean?
I-I don't get that.
- Just...
Ace that presentation.
Ok.
Seniors...
How can we get them to use the Internet?
"In the past, we have simplified it, restricted access, dumbed it down."
But I think that's the wrong approach.
I don't think seniors are any more confused by the Internet than I am.
I think they're afraid of it.
"Watch this video, please."
My name's Al Jordan.
I'm 82 years old.
- Do you ever use the Internet?
- I wouldn't want to mess it up.
We created a mock form that's really a search engine.
"Each time you enter a term, it takes you to a related website, then you have to find your way back."
- The form has changed.
- Yes.
"Now I'm looking outside those,"
- put in Saskatchewan.
- Yes.
So I'm gonna leave you for about three hours
"Wait, wait."
What if I break it?
Looking for some cell service.
"Hey, why don't I sit in your lap and you can drive me around?"
"Two birds, one stone?"
I wasn't that attracted to you anyway.
I'm gonna go try to find some reception.
Seeing Randy miserable is the only thing that'll cheer me up right now.
Maybe he's crying.
"One vodka for the gentleman with the neck tattoo, and two vodkas for the lady who's into that sort of thing."
Thank you.
Your catfish tower's on its way.
It takes two to carry the cocktail sauce lagoon.
Everything on double-zero.
Which has to be the Yelp rating of this boat.
Excuse me?
Could I get a white wine spritzer?
"Oh, come on, Vera."
We share a locker.
"Oh, double-zero."
Winner.
"Yes, I'm a winner again!"
"Suck it, river people."
What is going on over here?
Employees are not allowed to gamble.
"Or, as of last week, sexually harass each other."
"Thanks a lot, Craig."
Ugh.
Poindexter in the radio room wouldn't let me use the satellite phone.
"Also, I broke your satellite phone."
That is it.
You're fired.
"That's the worst news I've heard since you said ""you're hired."""
There's a tug coming to swap out the toilet tanks.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Fandor!
Open up!
"Of course, the wires have been cut."
What has happened?
You're in such a mess!
It is impossible for Fantomas to leave this room.
I have the same opinion.
Who are you?
"Inspector Juve, police."
I thought you were dead!
"I was such a bore in the next world with my stories of Fantômas, that they sent me back to Earth."
You feel better?
"Okay, okay."
I tried to help.
And someone hit me on the head.
So it's you who entered first?
Obviously since my room is the closest to yours.
Why do you say that Fantômas has not come out of this room?
He was able to leave by the window.
The glass is broken.
And his mask is hooked.
I can assure you that Fantômas did not escape through this window.
Why try to deny the obvious?
The evidence?
"You know, sir, that you're in the fourth floor, that there is no ledge or balcony, that unless proven otherwise, nobody saw Fantomas fly."
He only smashed the glass to give the change and delude us.
If not by the window so how did he get out?
"In any case, not by the door either."
"Oh, no."
No way.
Things have gone too far already.
"Don't tell me, Samantha Josephine, you want to go to a lawyer, get the money and run, now."
That's exactly what I wanna do.
You have no sense of timing.
I have sense enough to know-
"You know nothing because if you did, you'd realise that that money cannot be transferred all at once."
It's gonna look overly suspicious.
How many times do I have to tell you?
The play must be performed one act at a time.
"How many times do I have to tell you that the longer we wait, the more chance we have of getting caught?"
"She's right, Joel."
"- I don't wanna hear from you, Rita."
- Why not?
Because any decisions to be made are mine to make.
Mine.
Is that clear enough?
Mommy.
Mommy.
"- Thank God, you're all right."
"- Oh, darling."
"Oh, yes, we're fine."
- You were extraordinary.
"- Oh, all in a day's work."
Welcome home.
"Well, I really must congratulate you, both of you."
"I guess the words ""brave"" and ""daring"" are appropriate."
"- Thank you, Blake, we appreciate that."
- Yes.
"Oh, Alexis, I'd like to talk to you for a moment, if I may."
- It's rather important.
Serve them!
I knew it was a fish from the beginning!
Thank you.
- Here.
"- Don't let anyone see, alright?"
"- Here, take it."
- We only got it today.
That's absurd!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Bastard!
Jean Louis!
My mother told me I'd find you in Capri.
So what are you doing in this corner of the world?
It's my duty to come here for the revolution.
"Ah, yes, I had forgotten about Count Marx."
And I had forgotten how deep your cynicism runs.
Yours and that of your entire generation.
"Come Jean Louis, you wouldn't be a student of Marx... if his blood wasn't much bluer than yours."
And where is it written that you have to be a proletariat in order to fight for justice?
You don't understand the youth of today... you can't imagine how different they are.
You wouldn't recognize the world that will come out of this world.
The imperialists and their lackeys will be defeated.
"Hey, Malaparte, Jimmy sends word that he can't come."
He was supposed to bring me a medic.
Did something happen?
"No, no."
He won't be able to come
He wants you to cover for him.
We have to go.
Ciao.
It's a marked trail.
It's a trail.
So we're going through The middle of bum.
The only trail there.
Those are a lot Of mights and maybes.
We might find a trail.
It may be marked.
There's supposed To be a path.
"When they find The access point to the claim,"
They'll have to Bring in a dredge.
"Built specifically To launch from riverbanks,"
One that brad's commandeered For the mission.
You know what?
We really should've came here One day of scouting.
Without the boat And everything.
It doesn't matter.
It's here now.
"We need it here, Regardless of what we do."
"I know a few miners around Town, And my buddy let me use."
His dredge.
"- Good, take it forward."
- There we go.
I bring a lot of Different things.
"You know, always trying to Inspire the other family Member."
That's what We try and do.
"You know, maybe we do it In an unorthodox way,"
But we're trying To inspire each other.
"To become better citizens, Better people overall."
And probably better Gold dredgers.
"Now, hopefully, The river claim."
Is only an atv ride away... find us the easiest Road down there.
Or the kellys' plan Could be washed away.
Give me your torch.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something."
I must apologize for their treatment of you.
Yeah.
Whose idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
They're not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
I'll bet you would.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you,"
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
Now let's go get some ice cream.
Well...
Just in a minute.
"Hey, Street, here comes your best friend."
"Oh, that's funny."
Somebody's got to talk to him.
"Low man on the totem pole, that would be you."
Hi there.
Interested in a Malibu.
"Afternoon, Gerald."
"Oh, hey."
How you doing today?
All right.
Just came to have a second look.
Yeah.
"Can I ask you something, Gerald?"
Yeah.
What's the problem exactly?
Sorry?
Why won't you let yourself have this car?
What do you mean?
What is it really?
Is it that you think if you buy this car you're gonna find another car you like better elsewhere immediately after buying it?
Or is it that you just think you don't deserve the car?
"Man, you don't know me."
"No, Gerald."
"Please, I'm not insulting you, so please don't take it like that, okay?"
I'm just trying to understand you.
"Because all these salespeople around here, take a look at them."
They sent me over here because they've given up on you.
All right?
"They sent me, wheelchair guy, rookie, low man on the totem pole to talk to you because none of them believe that you can pull the trigger on actually purchasing a vehicle."
-Pizza Planet!
Yeah!
Andy!
Wh...
Doesn't he realise that I'm not there?
I'm lost!
"Oh, I'm a lost toy!"
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The local sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refuelling station of some sort.
You!
"-According to my navi-computer, the..."
-Shut up!
"-Just shut up, you idiot!"
"-Sheriff, this is no time to panic."
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost.
Andy is gone.
"They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!"
My...
My fault?
If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me..."
Don't talk to me about importance!
Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What?
What are you talkin' about?
"Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet!"
I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.
"And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!"
You... are... a... toy!
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear!
"Be damned to you and your rag, sir."
My Rifles march at dawn.
"South, sir."
"Good night, Miss."
Lieutenant Sharpe!
Surprised to see me Richard?
Oh you've done a grand job a grand job
"But now, at dawn tomorrow, with the help of my agent,"
Comandante Teresa whom believe you've already met
I want you to seize the chapel of Torrecastro and hold it against all-comers until Major Vivar has raised the gonfalon of Sant'lago over the chapel roof.
Seize Torrecastro?
With six men and a straggle of Spaniards?
It can't be done.
"May I remind you of our main mission, sir?"
- To find a missing gentleman
"- Not now, Richard."
Our mission is Torrecastro.
Spain is a sleeping tiger.
"If the people of Torrecastro rise up, even for an hour, the shock will shake the whole of Spain."
"- Carry on, sir."
- Rise p?
"Do you really believe men will fight and die for a rag on a pole, sir?"
"You do, Richard."
You do.
Richard!
I knew you would not march to Torrecastro for a superstition.
I'm like you.
"I don't believe in virgins or holy candles, but I believe in Spain."
I had to choose between Spain and Richard Sharpe.
- I had no choice!
- You did your duty.
Now I must do mine.
Just try and understand.
Excuse me!
I'll just come.
I can't kill her.
And when she return Bhai's diamond then why?
"I think electricity has gone, Papa."
Shits!
"It's will be back tomorrow, Papa."
Don't you have Inverter?
What?
Don't you have Inverter?
"Papa, he's challenging you, I'll turn on the inverter."
"Papa, forget about electricity and kill him with bomb."
"I am not that Laxminarayan, It must some another Laxmi."
Have you gone mad?
That Laxminarayan lives in my hotel.
"I saw him, you leave me Sir."
It's about my job.
No.
Not at all.
"There's another Laxminarayan, May be he lives in Room No. 504"
"I am not that Laxminarayan, He must be that under garments dealer."
If you lied to me then...
You're saying like I'll say something and you will follow me.
"Sir, do what you want,"
"Marveles Idea,"
"Come, show me, where is that another Laxminarayan?"
"Papa, You take the tie, who will take the tie man?"
"Don't worry,"
"If you want stuff then you have to show your stuff, and business happens like this, I think you don't know about business."
"I am in business from 40 years,"
"I will stop if you show me the stuff, Yes or No."
Where are you going?
- Carlos:
Out.
- But--
"Carlos, wait!"
What's up with you?
"I'll catch you tomorrow, all right?"
If you told me a month ago
"I'd be running my pop's bodega, I'd say you were smoking crack."
If you had told me when we were in high school that I'd be the super of our building...
I'd told you that you were having some kind of psychotic episode.
"That shit is not even funny, man."
And you know what the thing of it is?
- What?
- I'm a pretty good super.
"Don't take this the wrong way, but it ain't that hard, man."
"It can be hard, you dumb fuck!"
"You've got to have all sorts of different management skills, you've got to know how to deal with all sorts of different people, you got to know your accounting, and I recycle."
Don't forget:

"Green goes with paper."""
Don't mix it with the fucking plastic.
Don't forget.
"- Oh, shit!"
- My ball!
- Carlos:
Come here.
"- Oh, thank you."
Carlos:
"Oh, you stupid fucker!"
"On weekends, me and Daisy got this thing, where she calls me-- to fix stuff in her apartment, and I go up, and we have sex."
(CHATTERING)
"Ok, Sally, then we'll get back to your tests."
"Well, excuse me, Doctor,"
Sally have you ever seen those two clowns before?
"So help me, Judy, you've seen the last banana in your life, you two-timing little rat!"
"When we get you back to Wameru, you'll get solitary confinement in a cage."
The second I get my hands free
I'm gonna wallop the daylights outta you.
(SCREECHING)
Sally!
"Captain, Sergeant, quick, before she gets lost."
"Hey, Captain, get these ropes off us."
We'll help you find her.
After what you threatened?
You'd probably kill her.
"Hey, there she is."
Judy.
Come here.
(CHATTERING)
- Come on.
"- Come on, Judy."
That's a good girl.
Now come on.
Untie these ropes.
"Come on, Judy, get these ropes off."
"No, Judy, you're not the world-famous astro-chimp."
"You're just plain, old-fashioned, smart-aleck Judy from Wameru."
"For Pete's sake, Judy, you're not Sally."
"Sally is obviously an intelligent, superior, well-behaved animal, and you're just a spoiled little brat."
"Jack, do you suppose something has happened to Judy and she really believes she's Sally?"
She could be suffering from some kind of nervous disorder.
The only thing she's suffering from is a sense of misplaced grandeur.
Then do you want me to put some boiling water into the thermos?
You should wait for me.
How far away are you from the office to here?
Here.
Stamp it.
"You take the stamp, I'll keep the book."
"Everytime I run an errand, you stamp one."
It'll be completed after 200 stamps.
"You won't simply alter it, won't you?"
But what if you also have exact same stamp?
Then how about you hold onto the book as well?
I've already set up all the pages.
You got the stamp so you can't back out now.
"If that stamp is that important,"
Why didn't you just accept the check yesterday?
"I'm telling you, do you think money can solve everything?"
About the kiss... don't you think you should apologize for that?
The kiss?
"Hey, its only a hello."
"If an apology is not enough, you'll get rid of me, right?"
"You're just using me, aren't you?"
"Thanks to you, I wouldn't have to sit on the floor as well."
What's wrong?
It's not like it was your first kiss?
You.
Could it be...
Is it really like that?
Really?
Ah... please get it stamped quickly.
Really very unlucky.
Overarm throw.
From the side and below the armpit.
All right.
Easy.
I'm Jack Kang.
I'm leadership here.
"Yeah, we know who you are."
And we're not a threat to Candor.
That might be your truth.
It's not necessarily mine.
All I know for certain is you're both wanted for criminal insurgency and conspiring in the attack on Abnegation.
Those are lies.
"If you were Candor, I would take you at your word."
"Unfortunately, given the circumstances,"
I'm obliged to hand you over to the Council.
You can make your case there.
You might as well just kill us now.
"If Jeanine finds us, we're not gonna live to stand trial."
I doubt that very much.
She would never supersede the Council.
Sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her?
You?
Factional law must be upheld.
"All right, wait, wait, wait."
Can I ask you one question?
(GRUNTS)
Can I ask you one question?
Jeanine believes that Erudite are most fit to govern because they are the smartest.
Do you believe that Candor is most fit to judge because you're so honest?
I admit I do hold that belief.
Then would you say that a trial held here at Candor would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite?
Hmm.
The answer is yes.
"Until I touch their corpses with my own hands,"
I won't believe they are dead!
Where do you expect them to be?
"They're dead, I tell you."
It's as if I can see them.
I can feel them watching me.
Their spirit is searching my head to find me.
Their hatred won't leave me!
I know theywill return.
They can think of nothing else but me.
They're looking for me in order to take their revenge.
"Dead or alive, I know they will be back."
I know they will be back.
I saw them in the tavern!
They were covered in blood.
They were watching me.
"You don't care, do you?"
You weren't there.
You don't believe in ghosts!
You're nothing but a trollop.
No.
"No, you can't make me forget them."
They will kill us!
They came back from the dead... to tear us apart.
Good for them if they are alive!
I will kill them like wicked creatures.
I want to strangle them.
I want to feel their bones breaking between my fingers.
"I want to overpower them, drink their blood and wounds."
I'll smash them with my heels and you'll be there to see it.
There will be nothing left of them
Nothing!
Okay.
I'll get corroboration from another source.
Thank you.
"All right, Dad, what did we do wrong this time?"
Nothing. I just... I have something I have to tell you guys.
is somebody sick?
"No, sweetie, it's nothing like that."
"Something has happened at work, or because of work, and I don't know that it's bad yet."
"It's too soon to tell, but it might be bad."
- You're going broke?
"- No, but I suppose it could happen."
- There's an investigation of Atlantor.
- By the police?
"Sort of, yeah."
It's called a grand jury.
- [Eli] That's serious.
- [Jessie] Do you get arrested?
"No, honey."
"No, no."
It's not like that.
[Jessie] Then what's wrong?
"Well, I'm not exactly sure, and that's part of the problem."
"There are some people who could be arrested,"
- l guess.
- But not you.
"Well, there's nothing they would arrest me for."
We should not worry about this before anything...
You're saying you could be arrested?
"Well, anything's possible, E, but, no, I really don't think that that's what this is about."
"Jess, honey, listen, listen to me."
"I do not think anything bad is going to happen, okay?"
"I can't guarantee you that, and I'm sorry."
And another foot.
- Couple bits.
- And there we are.
When is TSA finally gonna realize that we all know the shoe thing?
You know what I mean?
"You get to the airport, they tell you to take your shoes off."
"It's like, ""Who doesn't know by now?"""
"Is someone getting to the airport, like, ""What?"
"I have to take my shoes off?"""
"If that happens, arrest and kill that person."
"They're probably not terrorists, but they're holding up the line."
And what is terrorism on a local level?
"On a local level, what is terrorism?"
Holding up the line?
We don't need those people.
"""When did this start?"" ""Kill him!"""
"And I'm way too far back. ""Kill him!"
In front of everybody!
Everybody watches!
Everyone.
"No, sweetie, everyone watches."
Everyone.
Everyone watches.
Everyone watches.
"Never become that."""
It's a fuckin' high-pressure situation the moment you start dealing with security.
"No one gets dressed and undressed while moving sideways at home, but goddamn it if you're not an Olympian when you get there."
Hurry up!
"People in tears, like, ""I just want to see my family again!"
Am I allowed to leave my pullover on?
"Oh, my God!"
I forgot to put my wallet in a bin!
[tense music]
His readings could triangulate when wind and sound
- make contact with an object.
- How does that help us?
"If we can pinpoint the precise point of impact every time wind hits that object,"
I think I can build a 3D outline of what the crime scene looked like.
You can get me a face?
"If his data's reliable,"
I'll be able to show you who killed Roger before you're done with dinner.
You just signed your new client.
Give him what he wants.
[computer beeping]
[footsteps approaching]
"Dad, what're you doing?"
I was thinking we might go camping.
Like in the backyard?
"Uh, no, a little further than that."
I thought we could head up north.
Thought we could sleep under the stars just for a while.
Doesn't that sound fun?
We'd go outside the wall?
"Well, yes."
Would we have to go through the Red Zone to get there?
Since when have you been worried about the Red Zone?
"My Spiga Scout leader says bad people live there, and they hate us."
That's why we have the wall.
"Hazel, your scout leader is a dummy."
"Now, come on."
We'd be together the whole time.
We'd share an adventure.
You and me.
"- I don't wanna go there, Dad."
You're nothing more than a killing machine.
"Long ago, you killed the Sun named Moon, and the Ruin began."
The world is already dead.
I know nothing.
Not even myself.
I only know that my enemies cry out the name Casshern.
Let's stop asking ourselves why the tears keep flowing
"As soon as the sky is filled with blue at daybreak, let's go ahead and row towards tomorrow"
"You can't get by on kindness alone, so you hurt someone"
"You can't get by naked to the world, so you hold someone"
Nobody knows the reason why
Why do we experience love if it hurts so?
Nobody knows the place to go
"We seek each other so fervently, because nothing goes on forever"
"There, robots who have accepted death reside."
"Ne't time: ""A World Replete with Death Throes."""
"This country, our country."
Rising country.
This is country's rising politician.
This is rising talent.
"This is rising gangster, Laxminarayan One."
Who's the king of Mumbai?
He's a Gangster-son.
"Gangster-son, What is it?"
Like Star-son.
"Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol, Hrithik Roshan Sanjay Dutt, Abhishek Bachchan."
You're the Abhishek Bachchan of gangster community.
Your father Pappu MMS.
He was Amitabh Bachchan of the gangster community.
Today his Refugee is releasing.
Meaning 1st murder.
The part at the window that was my audition scene and I had freaked out.
It's scary.
"When you worked on a lot, that's when people are like, ""It's good."""
Then you do it and you're like...
"It's so great, though."
"It's such a sweet, sweet scene."
And I like what's going on with Jonny and Raf in the background there.
- I didn't see it.
- It's very sweet.
They're just kind of canoodling.
"That broccoli she just put in her mouth was saturated with, like, lard oil."
"- Oh, man."
- We were trying to...
"She was trying to pick the healthiest thing to eat off of there, but..."
"Yeah, it was pretty gross."
I feel bad.
Norah never had an orgasm.
I love that whole...
I love that whole shtick.
Norah never had an orgasm.
"See, look at this, I mean..."
We filmed about three minutes of them canoodling.
It was very sweet.
"I couldn't say ""cut"" because it was kind of adorable."
This is really cute too.
Was that a real couple?
- It's a couple of extras.
- A couple of extras.
They're good then.
I felt...
I felt really nervous doing this bit about orgasms.
"Didn't the guy there say something about getting, like, a pocket rocket?"
Are Claire and Alex natural?
"He wants me, Mother!"
I'm sure he wants you.
He wants you to cook and clean for him!
- He found you through an ad.
"- I already know, Mom."
Sorry.
"It's not your average proposal, but let's face it."
They're not standing in line for me.
And we like each other!
Then say yes!
I can live alone.
"If you think such a marriage is normal, then go ahead."
Why do you do that?
Why do you make it sound so pathetic?
You had a life.
A husband who adored you.
Can't I have some of that?
"I'm getting older, too."
Why can't you be happy for me?
"But you can't, can you?"
You're scared to death of being alone.
And you're jealous.
Jealous because a man wants me.
A good-looking man.
How ridiculous!
"Well, you know something, Mom?"
A man does.
"Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose Morgan have exchanged rings and agreed to recognize each other as equals."
They shall seek a life of kindness and understanding.
The ceremony of marriage is a means of establishing a home.
"And as you have exchanged vows before witnesses, by the authority vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife."
Mumbai suited me well.
If we look at the history of the Indian film industry..
..then we come to know that in every..
"..different generations, different.."
..actors have been superstars.
"The first generation was of DiIip sir, afterthat came.."
"..Rajendra, Dharmendra, Jeetendra.."
"..Amitabh Bachchan, and today.."
..Krishna is very popular amongst everyone.
hello.
"Mr. Krishna, firstly Id like to ask you that you have.."
..become a superstar in very less time.
How do you feel after attaining so much success?
The truth is that all this seems to be..
"..like a magic for me, Tabbassum."
"Ok, Mr. Krishna, it is said that behind.."
"..every successful man, there is someone."
Today you are shining like a star in the sky of prosperity.
Can I know who the one behind all this is?
"There are many people, but my sir is the most important one."
Sir!
"Mr. Krishna, our audience would.."
..definitely like to know..
"I would Iike to tell everyone, Tabbassum."
Sir.
This is the name I worship before worshipping God.
Because God gives and then takes it back..
..but my sir hasjust given me.
"Today, even though I am away from him.."
..but because of his blessings..
..today thousands of people and watching my show.
Even my sir might be watching this show.
With super-human courage that defies anything else he's done before he fights his way up out of the pit while the man-eating crocodiles gnash their teeth in rage at the escape of their victim.
"- Gee, crocodiles."
"Oh, boy."
- He'll get away from them like he did from those man-eating sharks.
Bet I could if I was Speed Foster.
- ready to strike.
Kadonka kill white devils.
Speed laughs at him in scorn and roars:
"Throw that spear at me and you die, Kadonka."
"Kadonka, he big warrior."
Hold poison...
"All right, lay one down there, boy."
I sure hope Frank gets to be foreman.
Hah.
"Boy, how we'll stall on him."
Or maybe you guys are too dumb to know how to stall.
"I guess everybody around here's pretty dumb, except you."
"That's telling him, Eddie, old boy."
That's telling him.
Ha-ha.
Frank will do all right on the job.
He's got lot of good practical experience in this shop.
"Every time I say anything, you always wanna start an argument."
- What is it?
- Don't be discouraged.
Keep trying.
Maybe someday you'll say something that makes sense.
"Hey, Joe, come here."
I need you.
"Sure, Tommy."
Anything wrong?
Nothing Dombrowski can't fix.
Kozlenko's require a Class A security clearance.
"And in 1988 there were only two people, other than the operatives themselves with that kind of clearance on that specific project."
"One of them Yale, is dead."
"Oh god, what the hell is this?"
You are the one that set up agent Kozlenko.
You told the Stazi about the defection.
And you helped set the trap that killed him.
You have no proof.
"Actually sir, I do, the money."
The ten million dollars marked for Kozlenko.
Once a year the bank needs a signature to renew the account.
I checked it out.
"It was your signature, sir."
The only thing
I can't figure out is whether Jared Clayton was working for you.
Or you were working for him?
"I knew you were ambitious, Henry."
I just didn't know how ambitious.
"Security is on its way up to you, sir."
You might want to call your lawyer.
I'm not going to be calling anybody.
"Sir, you were saying?"
Sounds good.
I'll release the statement in the morning.
"You should get some sleep, agent Davis."
You sound tired.
It's been a long week.
"Yeah, yeah, I"
- I can hear him.
"Uh, yapping in the background."
Is he house broken yet?
"Mm, sorta."
Yeah.
"You got a lot of heart, carnal."
Maybe too much.
"You've always gotta give it your best shot, you know?"
"Which one, ese?"
Don't matter.
"Fuck it, homes."
La Primera lives!
What is time?
"Time is when a man is tryin"" to make time with your woman, but you doin"" time behind bars and your time is standin' still."
"Yo, Frost, kick it to these people for real."

"Like just last night What happened, man?"
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
One of them was quick to pull a knife
He stabbed him in the heart
And now he's doin' life in prison at the age of 21
"Livin' on death row ""cause he couldn""t let go"
Caught in the web of violence
Row deep when they creep
And move in silence of the lambs
Yo.
A tattooed teardrop as the iron gates slam
Ain't no sunshine
"Any time, hey"
Ain't no sunshine
"Got to keep drawing their fire, all right?"
Got it.
Give me another mag.
Where are you going?
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill and shot on the gunner.
All right.
I got your back.
All right.
Cover him!
"Rob, why eliminate witnesses?"
"I mean,whoever's tracking you, they either... want to use the bomb for themselves or... they want to keep you from using it, but... either way, wh-what difference do witnesses make?"
"I mean, the bombs have fingerprints,don't they?"
Something that make them traceable.
I remember reading that.
It's the uranium.
"It has, uh..."
It has a specific signature.
It places the origin of the device where it was made.
"So there were dozens of these things used in the attacks,right?"
And now you have the last one.
Yeah.
"Robert, I don't, I don't think these people are looking at this thing as a weapon."
It's more than that.
It's...
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun behind the greatest crime in the history of the world.
Huh.
The bomb... it could expose the people who were responsible for the attacks.
That's why they need it back.
Yeah.
Did you see what I just did?
I just need you to help me look pretty enough to capture a nobleman.
No problem.
This is gonna be harder than writing the book.
The Earl of Cleveland is going to be here any second.
I hope you memorized the names of the dignitaries.
"Oh, don't worry."
I made a cheat sheet.
"- Oh, no."
- What?
These are my football picks.
"Elka, what were you thinking?"
I know.
Ravens plus three?
Here they come.
"- Oh, I'm screwed."
- Don't panic.
The Earl has to introduce his people to you.
Just pay attention and repeat what he says.
"Councilwoman Ostrovsky, a pleasure."
The members of my party:
"Chief magistrate Martin Portreeve, lieutenant colonel Rodson Heathcote-Drummond, the honorable Martin Gled-heweson, bishop of Lichfield, lord keeper of the privy seal Lemonde Oswolf-sticket."
"Everyone, please welcome the Earl of Cleveland."
"And with him plaidsy, war man, churchie, and..."
Lemony snicket.
I believe we're going to have great fun doing business together.
"Gentlemen, please."
"You did it, Elka."
You're a hero.
"Oh, save it for the real heroes, the ravens, if they cover the spread."
"Oh, you look so beautiful."
Your eye patch matches your gown.
"Your gown covers the wheels on your orthopedic boot, and the super glue is holding perfectly on your dead tooth."
"That's enough, dastard!"
Get out.
Get out
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Bashirou!
Get out!
"Take it, son!"
Come on.
"- Whatever I had, was 3 boats sunken - to the bottom of the sea."
"Hereafler they are not allowing wound, brickbat, it's incurable."
"Hanieh, Bashirou,"
You!
So you have loaded all of your things.
"My burden sank to the bottom of the sea, Zaer_"
These things I brought are imposing on you.
"- Then, what are you going to do?"
- The truth is that I came here to how can I tell you?
I came here to be the seaman of your boat.
"No, it's not possible."
What are you talking about?
As I do remember all your family members were chief or captain.
I am beholden to you and your father so much.
"Captain Zaer,"
- how many times I told you these Tangaki people
"- They are innocent, Zaer_"
I am wondering what a compassionate man you are.
"It's outside and inside of the house as you see, captain."
"If Bashirou's mommy can clean it up, it will become a wonderful place, you can even arrange a wedding party here!"
"Let me kiss your hand, Zaer_ Oh, captain, what are you doing?"
What are you saying?
"If anything is lacking ask the estate agent for it,"
He has wit.
Do you know why you cross your arms?
Feels like you're talking to two people right now.
"Crossing your arms, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, is a sign of defense."
You're protecting your vital organs.
Do you feel threatened by me?
"Well, I don't, but the other guy might."
He is hilarious.
Enough psychology for now.
"What do you know about feminism, Wayne?"
I know it's unsafe territory to discuss with a feminist.
- Why?
- Someone will start shouting'.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Feminism is the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities.
"So, are you a feminist, Wayne?"
"Well, I trust my sister with just about any job under the sun over a man."
"- But 'cept this one, I guess."
- Excuse me?
"Not to be impolite but you're not exposed to talk about sex, politics or religion at the supper table."
"(SIGHING) What do you want, Wayne?"
"- I'd have a Gus'n Bru, likely."
- Not what I'm asking.
What's a Gus'n Bru?
Ooh!
I'll Google it and find out.
I'm kiddin'.
I know exactly what it is.
But we don't have any.
"So, what can I get you to drink?"
I'll have a Caesar and he'll have a...
Bittu would have died and the other kid would have gone to jail.
This is the same thing that'll happen to Boss and Shiv.
I don't understand.
Boss will kill Shiv and will be executed for that.
But boss is our man!
I don't even trust my father.
"This an old habit of mine - first clear the garbage, then clear the record."
Why are you outside?
From today your outgoing and the phone's incoming are both out.
Go into your room and shut the door
And you can watch t.v
Untill I call you out...marriage must take place
Now go?
Ayushman boss arrive
Were is your boss?
My work is to release water.
Boss so much of power Your plant grew
This is what you call Power plant
So you are Ayushman Takur?
Arrange a meeting in the 5-star lobby.
Sir how can I assist you?
Will you kill Shiv in jail?
What are you saying Takur?
I know your story.
You clear garbage and then clean your record.
If I kill him in your jail won't you be investigated or not?
The media already has footage of you and that boy.
Why provoke more attention?
So what can we do boss
Kill Shiv not in jail but outside.
Superb!
"What do you say, Ayushman?"
- Before that.
- Charming locality?
- Afterthat.
NearNapIes.
naples?

"I know because when I was young, my motherused to screw a shitkicker."
"That's the problem, they're all shitkickers, even the animals: cats, dogs, cows, chickens, calves, all of them!"
They only talk shitkick and you can't understand a word.
"When you think you understand, you know they're fucking with you, they're nice to yourface, ""hospitality"", but they're all in the Camorra."
- And what heat down there!
- It's hot?
"Not in the winter, but in summerit hits 40°C."
"So, you think it's cooIerindoors, but it's 50°C there!"
It's hotterinside than out?
"Yeah, those shit houses are made with asbestos."
- What's life like there?
- It's pretty tough.
"The ones in the Camorra live well, all the others are wretches."
"Like they say, ""See naples and then die."""
It's the flies and beetles that feast upon us.
"I'm more interested in why someone did this, Doctor."
"Then I'll have to research the predatory, manipulative, grandiose nature of this behavior."
But my first impression is that we're dealing with a complete loon.

"I have seen a lot of things selling real estate, but can you imagine walking in, seeing that?"
When was the last time you were here?
Yesterday morning.
First showing.
And everything was normal?
"There was no rotting corpsein the living room, if that's what you mean."
Who else had access?
A couple of dozen real estate women.
The keys are in a lock box on the front door.
Who's the owner?
A local contractor and me.
"Uh, I buy and Bob fixes."
We split the profits.
Bob?
"Robert Whitehead, the contractor."
A number where he can be reached?
Yeah.
"So who put the body here, you or Bob?"
Neither of us.
Though it is an empty house.
"If you're looking to ditch a body, that's a real plus."
Jody.
I came as fast as I could.
You okay?
That's my husband I called him.
"Just  duck under the tape, Rick."
Which I don't really have.
"So, what I'm trying to say is that I really, really need this scholarship."
Did you rehearse that?
Yeah.
"Like, 14 times in front of the mirror."
"Unfortunately, desire doesn't figure into this much."
The Robinson is going to go to someone who dazzles.
Somebody who just jumps off the page.
"Oh, well, then, I'm also involved in a science competition."
We're building a robotic wheel that can navigate itself using a proprietary GPS system.
"Well, I'm designing the system."
So...
Right.
"Ben, last year, the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook, a Korean immigrant who has only one leg."
"Well, I have both my legs."
"Well, have you considered cutting one of them off?"
That was a joke.
"Ben, it's all about the essay."
You need to really explain to us what makes you special.
What life experience separates you from all the rest.
Life experience.
"What can you tell me, Ben, that's going to dazzle me?"
I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Where is your jacket?
"- Oh, I got it."
I got it.
It's right here.
This is no way for the new assistant manager to come to work.

Eight dollars?
Wow!
This is a high treason to the Federation!
Go to hell!
That gave me luck.

"We did it, Mara!"
Thank you my love.
I'll see you upstairs.
In a world invaded by cowards.
The only thing left for a man is to fight.
"Fight, until hell freezes."
Then fight them on the ice.

"Let's say that in a year, Episode 5 you'll die."
You're going to die in a year...
"You'd only have a year left, is there something you'd like to do or see?"
A year is too long.
Let's do just 3 months left.
Okay then.
Let's say you only have 3 months left.
"I'll live recklessly, and take care of people who backstabbed me."
I'll kill the bastards I don't like.
This is not the goal of this documentary.
- Thank you... for letting me sleep the night in jail.
"It was the most vile, most inhuman night of my life."
"Well, coming from the guy who married Julie Cooper, that's saying something."
"So, aside from coming up with your hilarious one-liners, what's our next move?"
My next move is to meet with the partners.
Make sure they agree to my taking you on as a client.
- Why wouldn't they?
- You're not exactly the ideal client.
"- What... rich, powerful?"
- Guilty.
- You missed the turn.
- I'm not taking you to the office.
Kirsten is meeting us at the house.
- I have a business to run.
- Who are you kidding?
"We both know, with the exception of the underhanded stuff, Kirsten does everything anyway."
Step down.
Put Kirsten in charge.
That's your next move.
Excuse me.
"- I'm new, um... is it all right to park here?"
"- Sure, if you're not embarrassed."
"- Ryan, what would you like?"
- You buying?
"No, but I'm letting you order first."
"I may be selfless, but I'm still pretty stingy."
"- Well, in that case,uh, let's see."
"Can I have a... what, what do you got?"
- Large coffee.
I just didn't want to keep him waiting.
That'd be selfish.
"Iced coffee for me,please."
You risk everything if you don't act now.

And you will wed
One of my sons tonight.
I will take my life in my own hands.
And I will not be bullied by you.
"Lady kenna requests a visit, your majesty."
No.
She requests that I inform you that she's naked under her robe.
Send her in.
It's nice to see you're still on your feet.
What does that mean?
I watched you
"Take it lying down for weeks now,"
From all the women in your life.
You don't like being bossed around
"By a girl, do you?"
Is this meant to arouse?
I was wrong to blame and demand things of you.
"I should have blamed you, absolutely."
I also should have offered you more of what you'd like
For what I'd like.
You're offering me sex for a husband?
I could get sex anywhere.
Not from me.
How little it would take for you
"That must have been a few million won, at least."
Where did you get the money?
You know that I'm working for Yong Moon Plan now.
You just started.
- Did you rob them?
- I didn't!
"Bro, you're hiding something from me, aren't you?"
Take off your uniform too.
It's a piece of evidence.
How is this evidence?
I got blood on me from trying to save him!
Son of a...
"Hello, sir."
I just got a call from the head of the Sung Jang Police Station.
"Do you remember Lawyer Jo Eun Jung, who was reported missing?"
"Yes, he's the last person to have seen Seo Jun Suk before his death."
"He has been discovered, as a corpse."
Is that so?
"But, the thing is..."
in his pants pocket... was Im Tae Ho's business card.
"For the time being, you won't be leaving this building."
Listen carefully!
If it becomes news that an active officer has been on a serial killing spree the entire country will be upside down.
Mr. President.
What are you talking about?
"What do you mean, a serial killing spree?"
Take extra precaution to make sure nothing leaks to reporters!
- Understand?
- Without even investigating...
How can you accuse me like this?
That's why...
I will... interrogate you myself.
But rather than boring you with my résumé...
I'd rather answer your questions on specific issues of foreign policy.
"I suppose I could ask you, Mr. Crenshaw, how you'd feel in the same situation."
Why would I answer that for you?
Sorry.
It's simply a privacy issue.
"Look, I won't address issues of sexuality in a hearing room... or on national television or anywhere else for that matter."
- Where's the control room for America Live?
I'm so proud of you.
I've been boasting to the forest fairies I'm marrying a devil who works and they're so envious they stopped talking to me.
"If you wanna get married, find somebody else."
I'm too busy for such tomfoolery.
Who?
There's no other young spook around!
"That one, that one at the mansion, marry the Duke, he's a fine spook."
The one from Netolice?
"No, wait..."
"Jean, bring me a window, I want to look in the garden."
Now you know?
"Come quickly, sit down."
Now watch!
"There we are, your Grace."
A fine red wine.
Delicious.
I can't see!
The mirror!
It's gone!
But there's plenty more where that came from.
Jean.
You licked off the cream!
"Your Grace, how can you..."
This is yummy.
His skull would have had to go right through the table.
The body is in the wrong position.
Was that tape torn?
I'm sure this is important.
But why?
"Because if I'm the killer and I want to get a dead body off my table,"
I'd cut the tape.
BRENNAN:
It was torn.
Which suggests Aldo tried to break free.
So perhaps he was killed somewhere else.
"They're at the sound studio, combing through the wreckage."
What's left?
"What's left is you could fit into a beer can, that's what's left."
So we're back where we started.
Who is this guy?
And why did he target Aldo Clemens?
Yeah. (phone ringing) Hold on.
(Booth groans)
(phone beeps) Yeah?
There's one possible explanation for how Aldo died.
"Well, look, does it get us any closer to finding out who killed him?"
"Well, let me show you what we have."
"All right, hold on."
What do you got?
(sighs)
BRENNAN:
"From the position of the body and the fractures, the killer couldn't have snapped Aldo's neck while he was restrained."
So what's left?
SAROYAN:
The most likely explanation is that Aldo killed himself.
"He was fastened to the table by duct tape, but he managed to loosen it."
The promise of the Chinese ambassador post is pulling you away like you no longer work here.

People think I murdered my own son?
Hey.
"For a week trip, you pack kind of light."
Please tell me you're not wearing this.
I'm going on a business trip to the Caribbean.
"Unless you're applying for a job at Sandals,"
I would lose this shirt.
What kind of business do you have in the Caribbean?
"Oh, I have my finger in a number of..."
Pies.
Pies.
"Yeah, I know."
"What kind of pies, specifically?"
"Apple, rhubarb... cherry, when I'm in the mood."
This is always the worst part.
The fashion tips?
The end.
"We're always saying good-bye, and we never know when we're gonna see each other again."
Come with me... on my trip-- a week together in paradise.
You have to work.
I don't want to interfere.
"Well, I've never had a problem mixing business and pleasure."
Have you?
I do have some vacation time saved up and... a bikini I've been dying to wear.
Or not wear.
"Where are you going-- Bahamas, Caymans?"
Cuba.
Still interested?
When do we leave?
Hey.
"Hey, look."
It's Yo-Yo.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
"Hey, Yo-Yo."
Don't you want to catch us?
I don't trust him.
He's probably using some psychology trick on us.
Come on.
"Hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us?"
It's not my job anymore.
They're coming down to fire me for destroying city property.
The only thing that works is the radio.
And it won't turn off.
"I was only trying to help you, kids."
"Mr. Yokomoto,"
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.
"All I ever wanted in life was all you kids that I put back in school, someday visit me and say,"
"""thanks Mr. Yo-Yo, Yokomoto."
"If it wasn't for you forcing us to get an education,"
"We would've been bums."""
That's all I wanted.
You see?
I told you he was gonna hit us with some of that heavy psychology.
"I mean, I feel guilty."

- The plant is being evacuated.
- That's where he is!
Saira...
You stay here.
No!
Why did you target my prey?
Because Saiba was confronting a tiger with a dagger.
"The tiger didn't even have a dagger, Kaabir."
It's my duty to protect Saiba.
Paathar belongs to me.
You have to either drown or fly to reach here.
I don't want anyone's help.
It's beautiful.
I fear someone might cast an evil eye.
Kaabir... there's news that Muraaki Jilaan has set his eyes on our Paathar.
Jilaan?
"Muwaqqit, we wish to conquer the world..."
Why this sudden move towards measly Paathar?
"A world unseen, unheard and unapproachable..."
Muraakis are the ones who conquer them all.
Muraakis have dared to set their eyes on our Paathar.
Whether he rips the sky apart or makes his way through water...
Jilaan is destined to die in Paathar's waters.
If he was born on a no moon night... then we are that dark night.
"The one who dares to confront us, is headed to his destruction."
"Water should stay blue, not turn red."
Jilaan has sent just one Muraaki to fight us?
Just one.
Muraaki!
Muraaki!
Either surrender before the full moon night or die.
Jilaan.
Saiba wishes to fight the war the warriors of Paathar couldn't?
"You don't just fight wars, you also strategize them."
The winters are brutal in Ithaca.
You'll be cold.
I'll buy a sweater.
You honestly believe that Jameses of this world can keep up with you?
Only in a classroom of overachievers like this can anyone possibly accuse him of being inadequate
Do you want me to skip college?
And stay in Jakarta?
Is that what you're asking me to do?
"There are some, outstanding universities in this city."
"Can you imagine, how good we'd be for each other?"
Yes.
But you do know that can't happen.
Of course I know.
"Do you know what ""apocalypse"" actually means?"
Tell me.
It's from the greek.
"""Apokalypsis"" meaning to uncover what you couldn't see before"
A way out of the dark.
You're sweet talk still needs work.
I'll get on that.
"You're a very good teacher, Eric."
I always forget stuff when I walk out the door.
If any of my ex-boyfriends had picked up on that perhaps things would have turned out differently... but probably not.
Zach was my first serious boyfriend and I was madly in love.
I thought he was the best.
You're the best!
You're the best!
Apparently so did my best friend Stephanie.
Baby!
I know this looks bad.
As well as Liz.
"- Well, who's bringin' it?"
- Who knows?
- Where do you want it?
- Huh?
- Where do you want it?
"- Oh, shit."
This side.
Beat it!
I'm gonna check on this address.
"Ifthey don't know you, it's your ass."
- I thought I told you to stand there!
- Get that hair down before Saturday.
We're goin' now.
Goodbye!
Move ass.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
"Great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood."
Why don't you detach us?
"Give us a shot, at least till we find out ifthere's anything here."
Everybody wants Weinstock.
Maybe here's the lead we're looking for.
We deserve this.
You couldn't burn a three-time loser with this garbage.
The man has done absolutely nothin'.
You'll wind up in an entrapment rap.
"Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs."
You put this hustler together with Weinstock and maybe we got a big score.
"Big score, my ass!"
At best he's sellin' nickel-and-dime bags.
I wouldn't be infringing' on your coffee break if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.
"Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle, or have you forgotten about that already?"
"Jesus Christ, Jimmy, what's happened to you guys?"

"If they see that you've been making a detailed record of all the fancy gifts you've been going them, even a fool would know your intended use for that journal."
"You may not end up in prison, but you would lose their trust at the very least."
What?
Release the criminal who stole government property!
One of them has already died in confinement.
I fear it will hurt your esteemed name if the other one dies as well.
Add glory to your name with display of mercy.
But what if that boy starts talking and causing trouble?
Don't worry.
I will make certain that he keeps his mouth shut.
Chun-su!
Chun-su!
Thank god you're all right!
What's wrong with you?
Do you know what he did to get you out?
I don't care.
Chun-su...
What's wrong with you?
Your friend risked his...
Don't even mention him.
He's no friend of mine.
"I told you, you're wrong about him!"
"Chun-su, Baron Huh would like to see you."
Go ahead and drink it.
"Me, sir?"
I had them brew the best herbs for your injury.
It will make moving around much easier.
Sir...
A good medicine is always bitter.
Go ahead an drink it.
I apologize.
- What?
About what?
That they're setting him up to laugh at him.
They're laughing with him now.
They think he's cool ever since he took up your cause.
- What cause?
"- ""Go, drugs!"""
He doesn't know what I do.
You keep clinging to that raft.
"Okay, this vote is on a motion by Walter Stringer to request a variance from zoning regulation 11.6, for a front yard setback."
- All in favor?
- Try 11.2.
- Excuse me?
"- It's zoning regulation 11.2, not 6."
And Walt is not adding a family room.
"He's adding a giant garage for his boat, which is gonna cut off all the light to his neighbor's dining room."
Read the plans.
A family room doesn't have concrete floors and a door that's operated by a remote.
That's complete bullshit.
"You're not in charge here anymore, Wilson."
Lucky for you or I'd throw your nautical ass right out of here.
Really.
"Buy a fucking slip in the marina, Captain Cheap-Ass."
Excuse me.
You're out of order.
"Now, all those in favor of granting the motion, raise your hand and say ""aye."""
Aye.
"All of those against, ""nay."""
- Nay.
- Motion is denied.
"- Fuck you, Wilson!"
- Go play with your dinghy!
Went to Armadillo's place to talk to him about Tio's murder.
- What'd he say?
- He wasn't there.
Signs of a struggle though.
"Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove."
- Pretty ugly stuff.
- That sounds like Armadillo's M.O.
Checked Tio's phone records.
You were the last call he made last night on his cell before he died.
Yeah.
He sounded kind of agitated.
- We got cut off.
- Too bad.
What are you asking me?
"Look, I don't like these questions any more than you do."
I was with my guys all last night while Tio was being killed.
Feel free to ask 'em.
"Okay, then."
"Single blow, a heavy blade."
"- An ax, maybe a machete."
- How long ago?
"Based on core temp, I'd say recently."
- Three to four hours.
- So she's been dead since around 6:00.
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting... indicate she was alive when this happened.
- Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
- Okay.
"If someone were trying to keep her alive, how long could she survive?"
"With a tourniquet and basic medical knowledge, indefinitely."
Until he tired of his domination and control Dr. Mengele experiments... and decided to squeeze the last breath out of her so he could watch.
"See, this is why you and me can't date."
"- Hi, I'm Dave."
"- Good to see you, man."
- How are you?
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm James.
- Nice to meet you.
- What do you play?
- Saxophone.
"- Oh, shit."

"When I think of New Orleans,"
"I don't think of recording studios, really."
I just think of hundreds of years of music.
Preservation Hall really took hold after the hurricane when people realized that there was something to lose.
Look at this guy.
Wow.
Yeah.
What a trip.
This is a trip.
It was a little tricky because Preservation Jazz Hall is not used to a blaring rock band.
"We moved the drums across the room from traditionally where they play, which opened up the sound a little bit."
Then we moved their amps...
Just baffled them enough so it wasn't completely collapsing the room with volume.
It's funny because you can hear people walking by on the street.
"You hear the horses clip-clop by and the carriages, and people peering in the windows and the street performers strolling by."
"Our microphones catch miscellaneous noises going on, and that's part of the charm."
Where's Ben Jaffe?
"Hey, Ben!"
Is it gonna be okay that we record here?
This is so cool!
This is like my childhood dream come true!
"Millington Associates are here to help."""
Not out of this office.
It could be worth your while.
I could cut you in.
No way.
"You need a Whizz, I need a Wii."
That's a perfect match.
Lovely melty car could be all yours.
All right.
But my cut comes off the top.
No more loud music and you make the coffee.
- Deal?
- Done!
Of course she's going to publish it herself.
"Well, she seemed very clear that she wasn't."
- And you believed her?
- That is neither here nor there.
"Legally, she can do what she likes."
Dr Goodyear's will leaves all the research to her.
Then we must contest the will.
"This is the curse of the ethical being, Peter."
The papers should be published.
They could be published if we had them.
Another man would simply take them and cut the Gordian knot in a moment.
- Uh...
"- And yet our own ethics, our code of conduct forces us to do nothing."
If only... if only there was another way!
There's the matter of you pulling your weight.
Time for Millington  Anderson to diversify.
"Anderson  Millington, and I've already had an idea, actually."
Free quotation on our will preparation service.
"This week only, no appointment necessary."
He is.
Best enjoy this while we can.
Hitler's got enough on his plate without picking a fight with us.
His appetite for territory seems rather insatiable.
Will you be there this evening?
If I can get away.
"- Oh, do try and make it, Miriam."
Turning out in force to oppose Joyce's proposition is the only way to get it thrown out.
"Will you be there, Alison?"
Of course.
Boxing gloves on.
Granite chin at the ready.
Excellent.
You may well need it.
I suspect it could get rather bloody.
How was the check-up?
Fine.
- Good.
"What can I get you, Alison?"
- Some tongue would be lovely.
"Oh, I was expecting you back half an hour ago, Claire."
"I'm sorry, Mrs Cameron."
Bit of a queue at Brindsley's.
"And then, in the grocer's, a few of us were talking about tonight's meeting."
"As my employee, you'll appreciate that I expect you to vote in favour of my proposition tonight."
Staff loyalty is a quality that I hold in very high regard.
It's essential for a harmonious household.
"Yes, Mrs Cameron."
There's a list of chores on the kitchen table.
I'd like them completed by the time I return.
I'll be out all afternoon.
"Yes, Mrs Cameron."
"I just heard some sounds, like animals, and was..."
"Oh, call it natural curiosity."
"That's what got me into this business, I guess."
I'm just naturally curious.
"Well, I assure you, there is nothing here"
Nor any place else on my property that could
Interest you in the slightest.
I realize it's been difficult for you
With all that's happened.
Look here.
I don't like to see anyone die.
But I didn't know this Jeff boy at all.
Were he and your niece engaged?
Not really.
There wasn't a ring or anything.
Did he stay at her house?
He had his own apartment.
Suppose she stayed with them?
That would hardly be the behavior
I'd expect from my niece.
Check up on her very often?
Lord no.
"Since her mother's death, I've look in on her"
Once in a while just to see if I could help.
"Ms. Ramsey, this is a question I have to ask."
Do you know of anyone who would want Jeff Ingram dead?
I don't know anyone who even knew who he was.
"Now... well, except Audrey."
Does that answer your question?
"I know it's crazy, but it's the only thing"
That makes any sense.
"No, it doesn't."
I just have to...
I just have to...
"Oh, God!"
-
- What have I done?
-
- What have you done?
It's time for a bit of advanced training.
I've got to get a bit of steel into you.
It's no good g--going through life laying back and letting things happen to you... like your mother used to!
"Oh, 'eck!"
I've been sweeping round these things for two years!
"Why don't you give up on these, eh?"
You're never gonna get rid of these.
Who's gonna buy these?
Don't worry about them.
They're too advanced for you.
Stick to basics like how the h--hell you're gonna pay for that ice cream.
"You know, you can't just drag people into the shop."
This is not dragging 'em in.
It's propelling 'em in this direction as if by accident.
-
"- All right, show me."
-
- You've seen me do it often enough.
I've always been too embarrassed to watch.
It's not a case of embarrassment.
It's a test of skill.
"Well, I hope this section never gets published in me biography."
"I'm warning you, if ever I become famous, well, one day, I want absolutely no reference to this."
I see.
"Ashamed of it, are you?"
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
"We allow Gould to stay in business, then we go after him."
"Now, what's that about?"
"Well, us allowing Gould some leeway for strategic reasons is information you might want to lose on your hard drive."
You're joking.
Knowledge is power in this game.
"Yeah, well, it does seem your boss had something of an ego."
Putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
It did seem that way to me at the time.
"Must have thought his name was Kevin Costner, not Simmonds."
- Have you seen that film?
- What film?
The Untouchables.
"Great film, it's a great film."
You should watch it.
Sean Connery.
"""They put one of ours in the hospital, we put one of theirs in the morgue. """
- Right.
- lain?
A light's just come on in the car.
It's like a green explanation mark.
- Probably needs a service.
- It's brand-new.
Thanks for your time.
Nice house.
You want a hand buttoning up?
One of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
What's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale?
He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
Pack him off to Magaluf.
He can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
I found it.
You'd better look your intern ass I found it!
And I found something along with it too:
"Errors, major ones."
Errors that we cannot afford to make.
- Like what?
"- Honey... we are not at ""Harper's Bazaar""."
The big boss down the hall would not be thrilled.
She'd be very glad that I had a spare moment... to oversee this...
"this ""work""."
"I delegated this project to you because I thought you could... handle it, unfortunately, I've learned you can't."
"Re-typing my rolodeck was just that difficult task for you, huh?"
For example:
Lann Wayner's card.
"Why is there only one ""n""on lann?"
"Did you know he added an extra ""n"" years ago?"
"Andy Warhol's card, did you even think to verify this number?"
"- No, because he's dead."
- Excuses!
"You just don't get it, do you?"
"Dead or alive, I still... need their phone numbers."
"This is for your own benefit, not mine, okay?"
No bad blood?
It's curse!
Dolly!
You're back from the couture show!
How is Lacroix?
"That is Dolly Bellows, she's an institution."
- Give me a tissue.
- That man is a genius!
The word genius is really in overuse
Lacroix transcends the English language.
"Hey, you think if I keep telling myself it's over,"
I'll actually believe it?
You'll be sorry if it's over.
No more running around crazy in the streets with roguishly handsome me.
Have you always found yourself so entertaining?
Come on.
Admit it.
I amuse the stuffing out of you.
My stuffing's perfectly in place.
You know what I'll miss?
Knowing what's gonna happen.
It made me feel... godlike.
That's nothing new for you.
"Well, I, guess I'll see you next time the universe decides to break all its rules on your behalf."
"Yeah, next time."
Goodbye.
Nico.
Yeah?
What did the guy do?
What guy?
"On the video, the one that got you kicked off the force?"
"In the modern world, there's nowhere to hide, is there?"
- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't...
- It was a meth factory... in a house in El Sobrante.
Guy just... escaped a cooking accident.
Place went up in a fireball.
Too bad his girlfriend and kid that he left behind did not survive the inferno.
Too bad for my career with the police department
I let my... my disapproval of his behavior get the better of me.
"If it were me, I wouldn't have been kicked off the force for assaulting him."
- No?
- That's the husband.
Get Psych down here.
- Can my wife go home now?
- Not yet.
"What, you moved Judy out of the trauma room."
I thought that meant she was good to go.
We needed to clear the room.
"We have to rule out a cardiac contusion, so we need to monitor her heart some more to make sure it's not bruised."
For how long?
I'm not sure.
It could be a while.
Mr. Anderson... does Judy drink alcohol?
No.
"I mean, she has a glass of wine now and then."
Why?
What about drugs?
What's this all about?
"Just routine questions for her chart to avoid any drug interaction, that sort of thing."
Have you noticed any change in her mood lately?
Like what?
She seem depressed?
Any loss of appetite or trouble sleeping?
"You're kidding, right?"
We have a three- month-old baby.
"When Gracie doesn't sleep, none of us do."
"Look, the sooner I can get them both home, the sooner they can start getting better."
I don't want to send her home until I'm sure there's no danger.
"No, of course, you're right."
Thank you.
"Dr. Kovac, could you help me clear some beds?"
I thought I was.
"Well, maybe if we work together."
And the boy a rose did see
Give it up!
That organ!
It gets worse as you try to fix it.
I will absolutely fix it.
I got into college.
Finally managed to get out of the examination hell.
Made up my mind.
Absolutely no studying during this summer vacation.
"I've got plenty of time to fix this organ, absolutely..."
"Here we go again with Tateo's ""absolutely. "" You said it three times already."
A letter from Hawaii.
Pictures are enclosed.
Let's see.
"""I hasten to inform you that we were met..."
"""by the family of Suzujiro's son at Honolulu Airport. """
Dad has a lei.
"""We knew that Suzujiro's deceased wife was an American..."
"""but were somewhat surprised to find..."
"""that all the family members were 100 percent Americans. """
Terrific!
This is a Cadillac limousine!
"His son Clark and wife, Natalie... and their children Michael and Emily."
This Michael and Emily look like they are just about our age.
"And Emily, she's a very beautiful girl."
"- Tateo, are you falling for her?"
- Stupid!
"""But all of them speak broken Japanese, which set our minds at ease. """
I understand how they felt.
Father is rather poor with English.
"""After a comfortable drive of about 20 minutes..."
"""we arrived at Suzujiro's residence."
"- I didn't get a chance to contribute a whole lot to that report, I mean anything"
- Is this true?
Lindsay?
"Look, guys, good science requires teamwork."
Part of the assignment is working together.
- If we had different partners.
"- I'm keeping you together, and giving you an additional assignment, which you'll do together"
"Or fail, together."
"Oh, yeah, you're not stupid at all."
"Uh, a little help here."
I think I'm going to have a hernia.
I had a hernia when I was little once.
I had to have an operation.
"Seth, can you...?"
!
"Oh, oh, sorry, sorry."
Okay.
My leg just went numb.
"My legs went numb, but we're cool."
"That's okay, right?"
That's normal?
- You are so out of your element.
"- No, I'm not."
- What are you even doing here?
- I need tickets.
I'll do anything to get them.
"- What are you, like, a huge fan?"
"- Yeah, of a certain prickly brunette named after my least favorite season."
- You're doing this for a girl?
"- Well, to be clear, I'm actually getting the tickets for her and her boyfrien..."
Her boy... her friend that's a boy.
- I'm showing her that I'm capable of thinking of somebody other than myself.
Because it's the first thing I move aside.
"Well, fuck you."
"Next month I am going to buy another pair, but in red."
Come with me tomorrow to the cemetery.
You know I can't.
I have to be with my family.
"And besides, your wife never liked me."
Do you know how hard it is for me?
I am leaving.
See you next week.
Why so fast?
- Let's go please.
Damn it!
Tamales!
- What do you have?
Red and green.
- How much?
Only ten pesos.
- Give me two red and two green.
Here.
Do you also want a sweet one?
- If you can give me credit until next time.
Thank you.
In Colombia a ten month old baby died... of an infection caused by rat bites.
The baby was malnourished and the mother informed... the authorities in her statement... that the baby's father committed suicide and left her alone with four kids.
The 10 year old was buried.
She was murdered by a neighbour who wanted to eat her
The victim 's family friends and classmates were at the ceremony.
The murderer was found guilty in the first degree.
The criminals have not been caught.
They decapitated two policemen in Mexico.
The heads were found at a site where police had killed drug dealers.
"man, all that conversation."
People writing notes.
"They look at you different, like, trying to figure out who you really are."
Like you're famous.
Admit it. lt's really great.
I don't know what you are talking about.
"Come in, gentlemen."
"So, M r."
Krakow?
I thought a lot about what you said.
And I decided that the main thing is really to protect the school.
"That's good, Brian."
I went to the bathroom.
I heard a scuffle.
Then a shot. I came out.
I saw two pairs of legs running in opposite directions.
Who those people were I can't say.
And if you or these men or anybody else threatens me anymore...
pressures me anymore--
Brian-- l will insist on having a lawyer...
and I will sue you for harassment and anything else I can.
And if you try to expel me in order to solve your public relations problems...
then I will reveal to anyone who will listen...
just who is destroying the spirit of this school.
"So, they still haven't found out who had the gun."
"Mom, it's really okay."
Let it go.
The school hasn't self destructed yet.
It's just so hard not being able to protect you.
"Yeah, but you can't."
"- Hey, what's up?"
- Hey everybody.
He tried to grab her in front of my old mother.
He was smelling of cheap liquor.
"So, Sarika pushed him away."
After that he just went mad.
Tried to kiss her..
Caught her arm so hard that he has left marks!
"Sir, let him return home my husband will take him to a task."
Do not let him return is what I came to say.
Your husband is due for a promotion it will be very unfortunate..
..if instead of a promotion he has to sit in front of some anti-corruption inquiry committee.
Mukesh... pack your things right away and leave the house!
"Where will I go, Buaji?"
I don't care.
Go to a friend!
Or rent a room!
Very independent you have become.
You make enough money giving tuitions to get drunk on.
Mr. Khanna is lying!
I had just gone over to meet Sarika.
Everybody is aware of Sarika's reputation.
"Why her husband is targeting you, I don't know."
"But if you stay here, you will land all of us in trouble..."
So for God's sake please spare us.
Oye!
Tuition master!
What happened?
And what's with all this luggage?
Come with me...
Come in.
Settle down.
Mauritius.
My aunt's son lives there...
How would the kts like to party with the ZBZs?
- What kind?
"- The biggest, baddest most rule-breaking party CRU will never see."
When you put it like that.
We're in.
Good!
Is you shirt on inside out and backwards?
It's just... joggging.
This is the common room.
"It looks like TV football, viewing party last night."
You guys surely know how to have a good time.
Welcome to our temple of good times and life-long brotherhood.
Our casa es su casa.
We're walkin'.
You got any question so far?
- What are your academic requirements?
- Every active member must take one course per semester or you get us skip talking to.
"But I mean, you have to take four course just to be in the Greek system?"
I'll look into that.
We're still walking.
Here are our lovely gardens.
Do you have any kind of mentorship program?
"The OC, they had a lot of connections."
"You know, CEO and like so."
"Last summer, bunch of the active did some paid internships."
That's a good point.
Jack Rabbit gives all the active and pledges 20% discount at his hut.
- Is that what you meant?
- Kind of.
It's good.
And here is the lovely recreation and relaxation room.
Excuse me.
Relax.
I'm finally having fun.
Let me.
"Jesus, you know, I always thought the old Amy was kind of an uptight bitch, but now I sort of miss her."
"You know, if I was uptight, I'd be offended by that."
"In fact, I am offended."
You shouldn't call people bitches.
You shouldn't do that anymore.
"Unless it's like ""bitch"" or something like that."
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.
Thank you for your service.
"How was the meeting, sir?"
Very productive.
It's like something out of a political cartoon.
"What, you mean not funny?"
"Oh, my God."
How the hell did Moyes end up on two lists?
I made it clear Ben should run all his list alterations past me.
"No, mine was the master list."
Your list was a sub-list.
"It was a sur-list, which means over-list."
"- Oh, fuck you."
- Your earwax could bring down a president.
And I didn't even want to see Dan and Amy.
And now they're expecting money.
- I didn't know that.
- Money?
Money?
"Gary, I said access only."
"Yeah, now we're gonna have to divert funds from the campaign and that's fraud."
And then we're gonna have to destroy the evidence and that's conspiracy to commit fraud.
No.
I'm staying here.
"Good night, Franz."
Why don't we all just go to bed?
"You don't know me, otherwise you wouldn't suggest that we all just go to bed."
"Have yourself a nice evening, and drink some cognac down at Tonis."
We'll see you tomorrow.
"My mother used to always say, the best guests are the ones who complain."
That way you can always improve yourself.
My mother worked in this restaurant for fifty years.
And I think...
There's far too little complaining here.
Can I finally get back to work boss?
I'm not done yet.
"Angie, there are problems."
What kind of problems?
We'll do a little demonstration for you.
Are you ready?
What kind of demonstration then?
Just say that your ready!
In that case I'm ready.
"What can I do for you, boss?"
A beer for me.
You want something too?
I'd like a soda please.
A beer and a soda.
Right away boss.
"What sort of demonstration is this supposed to be, boss?"
"We're not done yet, Angie."
"Angela, my name is Angela, and not Angie, boss."
"Angie, you are, generally speaking, if I may say  the problem that some people have with service industry."
But actually the problem isn't you.
From this moment on you're a lieutenant in the 95th
Major Hogan
- meet Mr Sharpe.
- Congratulations.
"Capital choice, sir."
The minute I saw him I looked.
"Hogan says ""Aye that fellow don't seem much but he's a natural-born officer """
"Of course, you know, Sir Arthur, he'll need a mentor."
"Hogan, you keep your hands off him."
Hogan is an officer on...
- Ahem!
- On my staff.
Your colonel will be informed.
I'll request light duties till his wound be healed
Good day to you both.
"Light duties, sir."
Light duties it is.
Absolutely.
"See here, Sharpe."
Light duties means staying at headquarters and being snubbed by snobs.
How would you like me to find you something else?
"As long as it's safe, sir."
That's my boy.
So the bankers won't budge?
"Afraid not, Sir Arthur."
We need to find Rothschild.
I'd like to suggest we add that fellow Sharpe to Dunnett's search party.
I make a man an officer today and you want me to send him into the mountains tomorrow.
"- Have you no heart, Hogan?"
"- No, sir."
"We need somebody to command Dunnett's sharpshooters, and Sharpe will be much happier up in the mountains than up in the mess."
"You know the problem, Sir Arthur."
Are we at war?
(low gurgling)
"Uh, you know I think it's that darn sophomore with the deviated septum."
He must have closed his mouth again.
"Sabrina, could you come up here?"
I think I might have an antacid.
What flavor?
Can I have two?
I always carry the essentials.
Let's see.
"No, that one's for leprosy."
"So, thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me."
"Hand me that towel, will you?"
(phone rings) What?
Fire him.
Your son?
He's not a closer.
"Anyway, I hoped if I could tell you what a wonderful place my clock shop is, you would find it in your heart to spare it."
(chuckling):
That's a good one.
Spare it!
"Oh, who sent you in here, huh?"
Artie?
"You're serious, aren't you?"
You really think there's anything you could tell me to keep me from squashing you like a bug?
We put a lot of effort into our selection of timepieces.
"Oh, well, in that case,"
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to count all the way to three before I call security.
"Before I go, could I just make one little point?"
"Oh, look who's been downsized."
This stinks.
"If we're the only beings that are conscious of this universe, us looking up and appreciating it is a very good thing, right?"
Are we the only ones?
"If so, yes."
I'm almost certain we're the only ones.
"So if we're not conscious of it, it's meaningless, isn't it?"
Yes.
"If we occasionally look into space and think about it, then the universe will not be lonely."
You're so beautiful.
Thank you.
But I've been repeating this ever since I was very young.
It's just some words of nostalgia.
- Am I being too honest?
- It's alright.
"This may sound simplistic, but the really real thing that I have absolute faith in is the stars."
Stars?
"I don't quite understand, but you must explain it to me later."
Thanks for listening.
- Aren't you cold?
- Cold?
Hold on.
- Yes?
- Where the hell are you?
Are you with Director Kim?
"Yeah, we're taking a walk on the beach."
This late?
"It's so dark, you can't see a thing."
Where are you?
And why did you leave me behind?
We're just taking a walk.
You took so long in the bathroom.
That's why we left without you.
- Come join us.
I always wanted the good of Marie.
Are you looking for the fate of his mother.
But do
Two days after the board against the merchants of flesh guns and ideas?
And we try again with horses crazy.
"Mickey, you ..."
"The reserve, a thousand chances against one."
And the luxury of a desperate gambler.
Could I returned to Hungary but I prefer to leave in our world.
"I'm going to take the deposition of Mr. André, democratic, as a papal bull."
But I want to continue to follow your tracks.
And those of Marie.
Sharpening their teeth and shaking the handcuffs.
Gladly send you sterile with your coffin in Hungary.
You do not like me.
Fault ... her.
Marie is poor and defenseless.
She goes too far.
"Just so, innocent."
Remember that I am too generous with you.
As the same from me.
And this is my foot.
You know my foot?
A nice Calcione a hog foot Parisian.
And this in addition.
"So, courage, the man on the street with his suitcase."
So that if the steps even worse.
You still have all two ears?
"It is my fault, I would not have never had to leave you alone."
I like when bleed ...
But I would much that bloody for me.
"Curse you, Mary, full of ice."
Isn't it true?
"Every time I see him I wonder, ""he should've washed, he hasn't again."""
"I know what you mean, he doesn't seem to be neat."
He's like the coal maker's daughter who doesn't wash her neck.
I like it.
Maybe he just looks that way because his neck is a bit long.
I know!
But it doesn't look like he cleans that long neck!
"But still, he's really popular."
I wonder about that.
"He's too plain, there's nothing interesting there."
An actor needs to have an aura or force about them.
For example?
So Ji Sup.
It's Mr. So again.
But why were you late?
"Right, it's the first time you've been late since I started working here."
Did you overdo it last night?
- I didn't order this.
- You ordered the curry.
"No, I ordered the pork cutlet."
"I ordered the pork cutlet, so why are you giving me the curry?"
- You ordered the curry.
"- No, no, you got it wrong."
You must've switched our orders with another table.
You ordered the curry.
"Yes, you did."
I did?
"Yes, you ordered the curry."
I heard it too.
What are you talking about?
I definitely ordered the pork cutlet.
"You know, force them to hand it over."
- We're not even sure if...
- One more round of betting and
- I'm cashing us out.
- You're the boss.
I was just trying to keep her distracted.
We're clear.
I want him.
- Sorry?
- You follow the girl.
I'll stay here and I'll call you if he comes out.
- Are you sure?
- I can handle him if there's trouble.
All right.
- I'll call you if I catch anything.
- Do that.
"Artie, I know you're not as sure about this as you're pretending."
I'm not pretending.
You know when you hold a mirror up to a second mirror and you get that sort of reflected infinity thing?
What happens if that mirror is reflected and it's something like the Studio 54 disco ball?
Is it possible to get some kind of artifact interaction?
Something completely unexpected?
I don't know.
What if the disco ball goes off and someone is standing in front of the Alice's mirror?
I think we know what happens.
Do we really?
- Could reflections switch places?
- Could people?
She pulls to the right.
Pardon?
I noticed it a couple months ago.
"When Myka's mad at me, she pulls to the right."
"Well, I don't think that the sky should be the limit."
But I do think that... magazines offer an escape in innovation and...
I hope to always hope to find fantasy and novelty...
- on the pages of Skirt.
"- Thank you, just as I thought."
"Thank you, but fantasy doesn't come cheap, sweetheart."
"Please, I don't wanna hear the ""c"" word."
"- Hello, darlings."
- Don't you dare throw that away.
Don't you know people are starving at Vogue?
- Take it.
"- Jocelyn, did you finish testing... all of the mousse in the closet?"
"I was almost done, I just wanted to grab a bite."
"Charmingly naive, but don't you think problems are so important... that you shouldn't take time for lunch?"
"Besides... if you haven't noticed, these are all editors."
"Take it easy, Antoniette."
Be nice to her She's the best intern you've ever had.
Over here!
I'm so glad you got my signal.
I really need your help.
You blew it.
They got you again.
"Cock-sucking, hussie, cocks'n pants..."
"I know, but I need your help."
Is there gonna be another leak?
"- And if so, what's story?"
"- Think deeper, think FDR."
"East River Drive, traffic jams..."
- squeegee boys.
- Think deeper...
- think tacky blond bombshell.
- Sharon Stone.
But if you deal with something else steadily meanwhile...
This is totally vainness.
Waste of time.
"I learned it on the front at my own crew, what the fact that somebody finds the time to think means."
"The one like this becomes the plaything of their own thought and they are due so then, than Tót lord."
The red one is spotted with a butterfly.
"I get true one in everything the respected for major lord, but I believe it so, it is not possible to prevent it if something wants to occur to the man."
But could be.
Why not could be.
It is necessary to modify the circumstances only.
And this our start goes by.
What there is an obstacle to this?
You understand it the thought procession?
I believe it yes.
Well...
I do not take something here and there yet.
"Me, too only here and there."
"Oh, be thinking now, Tót."
"Well, Tót?"
Did something occur to you already?
Yes.
Now.. something...
But no.
"You like thinking though, Tót."
It is an occasion here now.
"Here you go, Tót."
There is time now.
"You think onto our Gyula and strain the your sluggish brain, my good Lajos."
Do not whisper Ágika!
"I do not whisper, major lord."
"Unbutton your jacket, if some more comfortable."
- Maybe then now.
It's so strange.
We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them.
It's like his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.
"Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down."
Yeah.
- What're you doing?
- Thinking.
"Thinking about us in a different place, such as..."
Las Vegas with Tony.
"Seven or eleven every time, right?"
A day at the races.
All the long shots come in.
"You do have an imagination, after all."
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.
"For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them."
"If he can stack them, he can unstack them."
The gold is on display at the museum.
Protected by an impenetrable security system.
Just sitting there waiting for us to penetrate it.
Wait a minute.
Us?
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?
Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius.
"I own half the invention,"
"Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits."
"So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero."
What about security.
We'd need an army to pull it off.
We'll have an army with us!
Bend closer to each other!
"I can't, that paunch..."
"Mummy, look how she dances."
Dad's like a sea wolf.
So slow?
You could do one of those amorous dances.
I wouldn't have anyone to do it with.
So that's what you mean by an amorous dance?
"Yes, on the same spot."
You see!
Then this hand must go somewhere else.
Like this?
In my pocket?
"Yes, to get your purse."
They teach you to dance that?
Then show us how you think it should be.
"You must stand on the spot, just slowly moving and swaying..."
Then I'll be your boy.
I'm the boy and you must slowly sway...
Do you remember how we practised that polka with Mi?
ka?
I didn't like her then.
Then she wanted that tango.
"Goodness, she was encouraging me to get so close, so amorous, body to body."
Seriously!
Some shake-up dance like the tango suits her better than a polka.
"Goodness, what do you see in it?"
"There are emotions in the tango, the impression of being in love."
"Heavens, what emotions are you talking about?"
What do you know about being in love?
"Not me, but I think it applies to her."
"Goodness, you'd do better to buy her that material for a dress!"
We don't even know who she is.
Could she be a prostitute?
Whoa!
"Mrs. Stein isn't gonna like hearing that,suzanne."
"Neither is this woman, whoever she is."
"I mean hypothetically, if the woman is a hooker,"
She could have rolled stein for his money.
"What is this,aruba?"
We're just making theories up.
Americans have a right to a fair trial.
"Actually,ron's right."
"At this point,"
"We don't know what she is,"
And we don't know if she was involved in this.
She has to be involved.
Witnesses saw her with stein.
I hear stein had a terrible temper.
Did anyone else hear that or know anybody who was a victim of that?
Maybe the poor girl was defending herself.
I don't remember.
How long did you two date?
We didn't date.
I'd see him at parties and premieres and award shows.
Beats going to keggers at frat houses.
That's the great thing about going to college here
Is that you can go to all that hollywood stuff.
"I'd see stein at these things,"
"And he would flirt with me and ask me out,"
And i always said no.
"Until you said ""yes."""
We just went to dinner a couple times.
That's all.
A trauma brought on by my own father!
My life changed forever that day.
You sacrificed me for the traveler.
Why?
"Who is it, dad?"
Who is it?
!
"What if I told you now, that you are the traveler?"
You're right.
Your life truly changed that day.
I told you in the helicopter that you were destined for a great future.
"That's why I've been so hard on you, trained you so relentlessly."
"Think, Lex."
You have survived mortal injuries so many times.
How else can you explain it?
Because I was trained never to accept defeat.
"When I get my hands on that box in Zurich,"
I have a feeling all my questions will be answered.
I know how strong it is...
The attraction of the dark power.
But it will destroy you.
I can't let you go down that terrible path.
I can't open it... because I need a second key.
Give it to me.
I've swept every possible place you could have hidden it.
"And I finally realized, there's only person you would trust it with."
Yourself.
"If you open that box, if you get hold of that secret,"
there will be no redemption for you.
No redemption.
Ever.
I was raised in your shadow.
-We need money
"-Off course, Im sorry."
We leave on friday
-Friday?
What about the consert?
"-No, it...."
We were supposed to go together.
"Im going to check if we can pospone it, so that Lise get to go on the consert."
That would be nice.
"Sorry, im just beeing stupid."
Thanks.
It was a bit early!
Did you check about the friday?
Do you know anyone that make it be postponed?
"Have it done till tomorrow, Then we pospone until sunday"
-Sorry
-Tronstad?
-Have you got a minut?
"-Yes, what is it about?"
How sure are we?
How far are they with the bomb?
Any new information i have not got?
We're never sure.
We know that Werner Heisenberg gave Niels Bohr an schetch-
"-That we thought showed a bomb, This was likely an reactor"
"But if you have an reactor you can make plutonium, if you have plutonium you can make a bomb."
"We do not know if heisenberg did it as a warning, help - 69 00:09:57.200 -- 00:09:59.600 - or just to impress"
"Therefor we have to sink the shipment, Cause we just dont know"
"Heisenberg sees heavy water as essential for his research, that we know..."
"The case is, we are afraid."
Somethings wrong with the critical mass
We calculated an ton of uran.
"Right there, it's good."
All right.
"My brother Drew loved karate, and he didn't take lessons."
"All he had to do was see somebody do something, and then he could copy it."
"Today, you'd call that a ""music producer."""
Chris!
"Breathe, breathe!"
Ahhhh...
What are you doing?
Practicing karate.
What are you going to do with karate?
My father didn't see the reason of learning anything that didn't get you a job.
"So how's school, Chris?"
"You working on anthropology or paleontology, something complicated, I bet."
My mother thought I was learning all kinds of things 'cause I went to a white school.
"Nope, it's just regular arithmetic."
Y'all hear that?
White kids are working on arithmetic.
"Around here, they're still doing math."
My mother always thought bigger words meant something better.
"Okay, say the blessing, baby."
Where's the meat?
We don't have any.
Didn't you buy some porchops?
"No, that meat was too expensive."
I know we got some canned Spam or some Vienna sausage or bacon...
or beef jerky.
"Some... mean, what kind of meal is that without meat?"
It's a vegetarian meal.
Do I look like a vegetarian to you?
I work 60 hours a week.
I lift papers and boxes all night.
They can pilot the bloody boat.
"They can lead the damn fleet, for all I care."
But Johnnie frees the propeller.
Hmm.
You're late.
I took the liberty of ordering.
Sorry.
"We have guests staying, friends from Poland."
Things are very bad in Europe.
"It's not exactly a picnic here, if you hadn't noticed."
You can't find a decent waiter in SoHo since Italy joined the war.
"They were all rounded up as so-called enemies of the state, apart from Geppetto over there, who almost certainly is a spy."
Cerberus!
- Ugh!
"Christ, a dead sheep?"
- Ugh.
"- Not strictly ration book, but Cerberus can't live on crusts and scraps."
Ugh...
Sophie's going to boil it up and make him some broth.
Lucky fellow.
"Well, perhaps your sister would like to start feeding me, too, unless, of course, you've actually found me some work."
"So, Baker's outline for the Dunkirk film, you read it?"
It rattles along rather better than one might have expected.
Johnnie's escape from the steel thrust of the German war machine.
The rescue of the dog was very good.
"Here, boy."
Here.
"No, no."
"No, not you, Cerberus."
"Of course, it all depends on who they're planning to cast as Rose."
Uncle Frank?
"""A shipwreck of a man""?"
"They tell me you've broken the code, Dr. Sengupta."
Yes.
The words in each verse of Paxton Petty's lullaby correspond to the locations of his bombs.
"""Snow"" for the union square snow festival,"
"""Beard"" for beard beach, and ""Grace..."""
Was grace cathedral.
Genius.
There's a fourth verse.
Which means there's a fourth bomb.
"""Twin tree."" What's that?"
"I don't know, but I'm sure the good men of the San Francisco Police Department will."
I've already made a call on your behalf.
Excellent.
Lives will be saved.
Alcatraz proving itself to be once again the crown jewel of American penal sciences.
"Milton, don't skulk out there like a common ferret."
It wouldn't kill you to give a compliment to a colleague.
Genius.
Doctor.
I've been meaning to have a word with you about one of your patients.
Tommy Madsen's medical records...
There's no history of illness recorded.
Illnesses come in many shapes and sizes.
You of all people should know that.
"Yes, but why would you have a perfectly healthy man spend so much time in the infirmary?"
And what do you want with his blood?
"A word of advice, my Don't overstep."
"Rebecca, there he is."
Walk me to him.
"Doc, stay here."
Call Tanner.
You got it.
There's a couple of odd things about it.
Neither the parka nor the ski mask have any markings on them.
"No way to trace them and they were cut to ribbons, anyway."
"You certainly lock yourself in here, sir."
"And very smart to do it, too."
"Oh, here we go."
"No, that doesn't work either."
You think he mutilated the disguise because he was afraid someone might recognize it?
"Exactly, sir."
"Boy, do you and I think the same way."
It's amazing.
Isn't it?
"I wonder, sir."
"Is there a trick to unlocking this door, sir?"
I can't seem to manage it.
Everybody has trouble with this.
"Thank you very much, sir."
"Oh, did I mention the mask?"
That it was slashed?
No.
That it had makeup on it.
"The lab turned it up, sir."
Where would he find a mask that had makeup on it?
That's a very good question.
I believe you know the answer.
"I believe I do, sir."
We could be looking for a woman.
Precisely.
"We've assumed all along it was a man, but it's possible we were wrong."
Particularly in the light of this.
"Oh, I'm relieved to hear you say that, sir."
I thought you were going to say it was impossible because of Tony.
"Yeah, I mean, it's a top-flight policy."
So Preston is playing the savior.
And it looks like that monthly donation that Pamela makes to Preston's campaign is her disability check.
My guess is Trevor authorized that because he feels beholden to Preston.
He probably idolizes him.
So Prestons manipulating the Mills family to further his own agenda.
He's behind everything.
He took advantage of Trevor when he was weak and vulnerable.
"He gains his trust, then he brainwashes him."
Turn him into a killer.
"Uh, guys there's something else."
FBI!
Pamela Mills?
House is empty.
"He's not here, but I found this in his bedroom."
It's addressed to her.
"""The price of peace is sacrifice."
"""And I'm prepared to pay that price, no matter how high."
"I hope you'll still love me."""
This is a good-bye letter.
Or a suicide note.
He doesn't profile as suicidal.
"No, but he knows this could be his final mission."
He may want to go out in a blaze of glory.
It's all about the election.
He's only got one move left.
We need to secure Mayor Wennington.
Have the rest of the team find Hilary Ross.
Mmm.
Hello.
You have reached Hilary Ross.
Please leave a detailed message.

"This is Gordon, Sir."
Your wings.
"Thank you, Sir."
You're from Canada?
I'm very glad to see you here.
"Thank you, Sir."
Where do you come from?
"London, Sir."
"Yes, I suppose I should have known."
Your wings.
"Thank you, Sir."
"Company, eyes left!"
You've been rehearsing this for months on mock-ups of the terrain.
It should be as familiar to you as the back of your hand.
"Only, this is the real thing."
Operation Pegasus goes tonight.
You all know its purpose.
It's to bring back a piece of German radar equipment that's been helping to shoot down our bombers.
To recapitulate for the last time.
"Our first group will take the house and the radar post,"
"Meanwhile, we will hold off the Gerry garrison in the farmhouse."
Our second group will take and hold the beaches where we'll join them until the Navy can take us out.
Any questions?
Any suggestions?
Right.
"You men come from a lot of different places and a lot different units, but you have certain things in common."

I think you've been well trained.

Good hunting.
"New testimony will be provided by Harris' 17-year-old stepdaughter, Amy."
"... first-degree murder, which could result in a sentence..."
Such a nice couple.
"We really thought they""d make it."
I thought so.
We prayed for them.
Why did all of America become so obsessed with the Clara Harris story?
"Because it happened to a middle-class, dual-income, respectable family."
"Because it happened in the suburbs, where good people like you and me live."
Because if a sickness can grow inside the Harris family... are any of us really immune?
We all know...
Clara received the maximum sentence:
20 years in prison.
David's own parents forgave Clara.
They begged the judge for leniency.
The woman prosecutor used this argument to convict:
Why didn't Clara Harris do what every other woman in her situation does?
Take her husband to the cleaners.
Divorce David?
Take him to the cleaners?
"I'm sorry, but that woman missed the boat entirely."
Clara didn't want a divorce.
Clara Harris was in a life-and-death fight for her family.
Her survival instincts kicked in.
I want you to ask yourself:
Would you kill to save your family?
"Oh, my!"
You ready?
"Cassie, what is it?"
"I can""t do this."
"I can""t do it."
"We""ll be there in five minutes."
- No.
I misunderstood your behaviour.
But I would like this not to occur many times.
"This never happens more, respectable major lord."
Well this not something turned out nicely.
Not trouble.
It is not the important one.
The beauty arrives then.
It is necessary to wait its time out only.
It is the important one that we are here.
We are together.
Our hand moves.
The time goes by.
How do you feel?
"Very much, very much good."
"Really, very well."
Tót family did not get used to the night out however.
After 2-3 clocks the signs of the tiredness on they start appearing.
And this the tiredness showed on disciplined Tót mostly.
What it is possible to understand of course.
Since he slept in his bed already at this time another time
"Well you know, simply fascinating this work."
"Do not know to say, how much I enjoy it."
"I know that now, this work brings me into order then totally."
If only would be so.
"We would be glad the best, major lord."
Are you not tired?
"I hope so, you speak if you want to sleep."
To sleep.
Yet what no.
Very good one like that to do this with the major lord.
I am me so with him somehow.

"I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite display pair, but I suppose you want them back now."
Where are we?
Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of Gothos.
What happened?
Fill me in.
You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu.
We've been looking for you for four hours.
"You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here, but when I saw you passing by,"
I simply could not resist.
I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise.
"Ah, so you're the captain of these brave lads."
"My greetings and felicitations, Captain."
"So good ofyou and your officers to, uh... drop in."
Absolutely smashing.
Who are you?
Where do you come from?
"General Trelane, retired."
"At your service, sirs."
My home is your home.
"We've lost contact with the ship, Captain."
We're trapped here.
I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the very planet that I've made my hobby.
"Yes, but according to my observations,"
I didn't think you capable of such voyages.
"Notice the period, Captain."
900 light-years from Earth.
It's what might be seen through a viewing scope if it were powerful enough.
"Ah, yes."
- I don't know.
It's gonna take a little more yabba yabba.
Good.
Go help Ziva and McGee.
I gotta see a lady about a card game.
"Anything, Abbs?"
"Four decks scanned, two to go."
"Naturally, there's no shortage of fingerprints."
- I.D.'s?
- Mostly sailors.
And the blackjack dealer.
Of course.
He touched every card.
"You know, it would help to know if I was looking for someone specifically."
Yeah.
Just keep looking.
"That the best you got, McGee?"
"Well, the only surveillance of the pizzeria was from a rooftop across the street."
"Lucky us, all the video files were corrupted."
"But we believe this is Petty Officer Adams, based on the time he is seen leaving the pizzeria and the direction he is headed."
Anyone else?
There's this man.
Left a few frames before.
Who is he?
"Well, we still don't have a clear shot of his face yet, Director."
Wait-- in the window-- is that a reflection?
"Enhance it, McGee."
He appears to be a civilian.
Sailor said a guy bragged to him about winning money.
"A ton of it, only, he was too impaired to remember who it was."
"But the game was rigged, so no one could have won a ton of money."
And that would make that winner a shill.
I sent the acidity levels to Ducky.
I then inventoried Finn's personal items.
Got anything with a date on it?
Nope.
Sorry.
No credit card or purchase receipts.
I guess he was a cash guy.
I mean if you can call a guy with $31.71 a cash guy.
His clothes were Dockers from Sears.
No judgments.
"The shirt is a large, the shoes are off-brand."
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.
"Like you wear, Gibbs."
"You're fishin', Ab"
Are they regular boxers?
Trunks?
Bikinis?
Nothing?
"Mr. Palmer, have you finished the chromatographic analysis of his volatile fatty acid?"
"Yes, Doctor."
"Well, let's  plug the numbers into the computer and let's how long our friend has been leaking into the topsoil."
Agent Gibbs will be here soon and he will ask...
"How'd the lance corporal die, Doctor?"
"""How he died"" may take me a while."
"Try, ""When did he die?"""
That's my next question.
"That, I can answer."
It's....a......... ... tricky calculation.
"One has to factor in temperature, soil acidity, and the  variety and volume of insects who now call Lance Corporal Finn their home."
Give me a round number.
"92 days, with a three-percent margin of error."
It would appear you deserted before you died.
"- Tom, cab."
- Oh!
"And if that ginger viper so much as gets her nose through the office door while we're out, you're sacked."
And don't think I won't know.
I can smell her shaving cream on the wind.
Anything else?
"Since you're so keen to flex your femininity, you can tidy up!"
I heard furniture.
"""Angels of the Sea."
Across the Waves.
Two to Dunkirk.
Three to Dunkirk.
Dunkirk or Bust.
"Busts to Dunkirk."""
Somewhere in the world there is a bullet with that man's name on.
Why hasn't he been called up?
"I mean, Parfitt's too old, but Buckley--"
Baker persuaded someone that Buckley was more use to the war effort with a typewriter.
It won't last.
"He'll end up in uniform, like every other mother's son."
"That is, if he ever had a mother."
"More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub, spawning spontaneously in the sawdust."
"You know, a lot of men are scared we won't go back into our boxes when this is all over."
It makes them belligerent.
Something's changed.
I tidied.
What happened at the meeting?
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.
- What's this?
- Lunch.
"The girls can pilot the boat home, all right?"
- So what are we gonna do here?
- Should we drop the balloons?
"- No, no balloons."
- Maybe just drop half of them?
- No!
- Why do we even have balloons?
"Ma'am, I seriously overstepped the mark going out onstage."
That was a fuck-up.
"Yeah, I'll say."
You might want to watch that if you become president.
"If that does happen, want to be my veep?"
Why don't you go help them with the balloons?
Copy that.
[Woman] And now begins the ancient word.
"The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down."
"In the night, we make our feast."
"For centuries, I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls."
"I've brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones."
"Now, I am free, and the world turns upside down again."
"They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them."
"No boundaries, no borders."
"They will come for me, but I am coming for them."
"Their empire of blood will fall, and will not rest until it all burns."

My career will be gone.
She is dead
Bad destiny is not an easy task
She was still alive
Even after knowing this you buried him alive
Do you have any proof?
I dont like writing stories
Who was that girl?
She was my daughter
She was my and Malika's daughter
Malika came in my life 26 years ago
But I did not marry her
For forever
Then how do you she is your daughter?
3 years ago I got an letter
Malika wrote that letter to Sheja when I was left I came to know Malika was pregnant
Then she had 2 daughters
Twins.
Where is your 2nd daughter?
You are my 2nd daughter
Its true
I'm telling you I have my parents I know you have parents but do you have any childhood picture with them?
Do you know in which hospital you were born?
May be your blood group is different from them
You are my daughter
And She is your twin daughter
Her face is not like me
You are twins but not the same face
People say twin's children can never be twins
You do mistake and we get punishment
You all 3 will get punishment
Since 3 years I'm collecting proofs for you
Eh?
- Ah!
Talk to the manager.
- Eh?
"Say I'm your friend or something, anyway, do some negotiation."
"If you do, I'll give you this."
Also.
- What else?
Is that guy new?
"Ah, he's a recently joined apprentice."
I don't think the tempering is going well.
"No one seems to be checking it,"
I think it should be redone.
- You can tell by looking from here?
I can tell.
"Ah, he's here."
Eh?
"Wrapped up in the fragrance of chocolate, without good or bad feelings, she pops in my head."
"A chocolate that all the passion is poured into, like an extension of my own being,"
I want her to hold it in her mouth.
I want it to pour into her body.
"These kinds of dirty aspirations, brought me all the way here."
Saeko-san.
I will definitely become a chocolatier.
No matter how many years it takes.
I will become a chocolatier that everybody acknowledges.
"I will become famous enough to stay in your mind, to make you think ""I shouldn't have abandoned him back then""."
I will make you regret it.
"And then, after stealthily eating my chocolate, you will say ""C'est bon""."
That's my dream.
"Even if that voice,"
never reaches my ears.
"- l'm telling you, I hope he does."
"- No, don't be stupid."
You know it's weird.
I always think of you as Rayanne's friend.
"I mean like, you just think of me as..."
"as someone who's just, you know, around."
"It's weird how something has to happen sometimes, , , to see how you actually feel about something,"
"Sit down, M r."
"Krakow, we're just waiting for our friends..."

"I was doing a random check, found a counterfeit $100 chip."
Costs a lot of money to make a phony this good.
You guys found a fake chip?
How long has he been on duty?
He's been up 36 hours.
I told him to take a break-
You go home.
Get some sleep.
I'm fine.
"If it's such a good fake, how can you tell it's fake?"
"Felt a little heavy in my hand, so I weighed it."
"Ends up it's 34 centigrams over specs, which only allow for a seven centigram variance margin."
You could tell this was 34 centigrams heavy just by holding it?
So happens I could.
Why are you being such a hater?
You know how little 34 centigrams is?
Shut up.
Both of you shut up.
"You-You... go home, get some sleep or I will put you to sleep."
That is a king's caliber.
"Hey, lady."
You hurt?
You're the ringleader behind this revolt?
"You've gotten the better of me, Rear Admiral Klom."
I wasn't expecting you to reach here so quickly.
Answer the question!
Rear Admiral Klom?
"Then, this man is Crimson Fingered Claugh?"
- Depending on your answer...
"- You'll kill me, right?"
I never thought Sion needed you anyway.
You don't see the burden he bears.
You're the one who isn't qualified to serve him.
I don't need any qualifications to be at Sion's side!
"For the sake of the path he treads, I will kill Lady Noa Ehn and the hostages."
If you continue to stand in my way...
You think you can do it?
A simple matter.
No!
That power is...
"For the sake of the people of Estabul, we cannot lose this man..."
- Let there...
- We mustn't!
Froaude!
"Colonel Froaude, if you must kill the hostages to completely conquer Estabul then I'll persuade them."
"The people, the soldiers..."
I'll get them to follow Roland!
What are you saying?
I think that will be far more effective than killing the hostages and ruining Estabul's reputation.
Indeed.
You are quite popular with the people of Estabul.
Are you sorry for the payoffs?
Are you sorry for the bribes?
Or are you just sorry you got caught?
I'm sorry that my sepulchre may be too late.
Your sepulchre?
We may not have many opportunities to speak in the near future.
I owe you an explanation.
"- You're losing me, Miles."
"- No, you're losing me."
- Where the hell you going this time?
- Ha.
That is actually quite funny.
I'll send a report once I get there.
Are you telling me that you know the outcome of this investigation?
I know my outcome.
Fourth-stage pancreatic carcinoma.
"Amusing, isn't it, how we're all hostage to the politics of scale?"
- You have cancer?
- Look at this.
"For months, this has been the vessel of our ambition, yours and mine, and now in a day, it's nothing more than bits of cardboard and balsa wood held together with children's glue."
- ls there no cure?
- For ambition?
No.
"For my other disease, apparently not, either."
"Why did you come here, Miles?"
"To tell you that what you did was remarkable, even if no one ever sees it but me."
[Jessie laughing]
[Jessie] Yeah.
[Jessie and Karen talking]
"- [Karen] Oh, that is way too big."
"- No, it isn't. lt's fine."
Ow.
"What is your desire, master?"
"Okay, that is a long list, but for now, if you noticed anything unusual the other night, when the families viewed the evidence, that would be a great start."
"Come to think of it, there was this one thing."
The new haircut is dreamy.
"Look, there's not a single thing funny about this, so sit down and shut up."
"All right, what do you got?"
The jewelry went poof.
Never made it to the lockup.

Sorry.
"Long gone to eBay, bro."

Not for us.
You will be put to work on the harbor expansion project.
We will do anything you tell us.
We will find you a way to make a living after the pirates are suppressed.
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
"Head Chief, how could you do this to me?"
What have I done to deserve this?
Shut up!
"I know you tried to take your men, and surrender to Jang Bogo."
Slit his throat.
We also need to build a warehouse to store cargo.
Find a suitable place not far from the harbor.
Yes.
My lady.
I hear that many pirates are surrendering.
Why don't we hire them to work for us?
"Father, how can you trust them?"
What will you do if they steal from us?
No one was born a pirate.
They were forced into pirating to feed themselves.
"You should hate the crime, not the man."
They are skilled martial arts experts.
"With the right guidance, they will make good traveling merchants."
"Isn't that right, my lady?"
You are right.
- Find a way to hire them.
"- Yes, my lady."
Why are you so late?
I had to run some errands for Lady Chae-ryung.
Why did you wish to see me?
Why else?
Because I missed you...
"You not only ask the questions, you answer em too, don't you?"
Let me ask you a question.
"Assuming that Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, then I'd never reveal anything he said to me."
"Even Americans, I suppose, find it sometimes desirable to betray a confidence."
Let's get some things straight here.
I'm a tourist. I'm travelling for pleasure.
"I somehow got involved in this very unfortunate incident, and I came here to make a simple statement of fact and not be subjected to a police grilling."

"- No, you let me finish."
- (Knocking)
- Entrez.
(Both Speaking French)
Wait a minute.
Did he say I was wanted on the telephone?
I'll take that call now.
"- But, sir -"
- You just take it easy.
- Hello.
- (Man) Dr McKenna?
This is Dr McKenna.
Who's this?
If you tell even one word of what Louis Bernard whispered to you your little boy will be in serious danger.
"Remember, say nothing."
(Receiver Clicks)
Hello?
(Tapping Receiver Button)
Drayton?
Didn't you tell me your wife was going to take Hank back to the hotel?
"- l thought so, yes."
- Call her up.
"Somebody just called me, threatened me about Hank."
"Call her up, see if he's alright."
The harm's already done.
You behave... like a hooligan.
That's what I had in mind.
You might have warned me.
"Since you were there, it's all right."
You really have changed.
I thought you were a good citizen... like in the days we were studying.
You change according to your place.
"Because of your job... private companies,"
you work hard...
"Balla, you should never treat a friend so badly."
I've never been so serious.
"Private companies, then... you work hard... and make nothing."
Who told you that?
You've never worked... for the public sector.
You work very little and make ten times more... than in the private sector.
"If you don't believe me, then that's that..."
Listen!
You know very well... that while not in the public sector... my salary is more than enough... and I don't need more to get by.
You disappoint me.
"Hi, Tiekoura!"
"Hi, boss!"
How are you?
Any news?
The young ones came to tell me about a meeting.
Organized by the new engineer?
We have no confidence in him.
"With or without your confidence, let's listen to him."
We'll judge him by his actions.
He doesn't have to be like the ones before.
For sure.
Let's go and listen to him.
Babs.
Call me Babs.
Or Coach.
Or whatever makes you feel comfortable.
Never.
I will never call you Coach because I promise you I am never going to enter that contest.
"Well, what about T.C. and saving the Island Hoppers?"
What about Roger and me?
"I mean, this whole deal depends on your entering this contest."
- I mean...
- Good morning.
"I am sorry about all that, believe me, and I'd do anything for T.C..."
"anything else, I mean."
Oh.
And maybe we can work something out about finding Roger.
"Oh, no, I could never accept charity."
"Well, then pay me later, but just don't talk to me about this contest."
"Ah, the contest."
"The excitement, the anticipation, the agony."
"Now, here are the items you requested, courtesy of the household account."
"Protein powder, vitamins with an emphasis on """" B"" complex, tuna for tuna shakes."
"It sounds positively revolting, but I'm sure it's quite nourishing."
"Higgins, what is this?"
Paying out of the household account?
You never pay for anything for me out of...
Wait.
How'd you find out about this?
T.C. told me his plans when I let him in last night.
"For once I agreed with him, and so does Mr. Masters."
It's a capital idea.
Robin?
You talked to Robin?
"Oh, shit, I forgot about the car."
You haven't been moving it for street cleaning?
I've been gone for three weeks.
Do you know how many tickets I must have?
(TUTS)
I kind of would have thought this to be beneath you.
"You know, at one time I would have as well, but look at me now."
- You're a man of contradictions.
"- No, I'm not."
Who are all these assholes?
They're my friends.
"""They're my friends."""
Mostly.
"I got this job, this..."
"This national ad campaign, so..."
We're celebrating.
That's great.
NARRATOR: 'Philip wished Ashley had not reminded him 'of how great it felt to be proud of her.
'His own relationship with success had forced him 'to grow out of feeling resentful towards her accomplishments.
'He was not prepared to lose that constant stream of enthusiasm.'
You see?
You don't even need me.
"God, you really believe that, don't you?"
I'm not sure how to answer that without making things worse.
I supported you when nobody gave a shit about you.
I want you to know I regret that now.
Good.
ASHLEY:
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.
So you can just...
you can be somebody else's charity case.
- Maybe Zimmerman will take care of you.
It's Fan-Big-cup Fan!
"Now we know your name, if you're killed we can set up a spirit tablet for you!"
"I'm leaving, then"
Dame it!
This string will have to be paid for!
Who are you?
The bill collector!
Bill collector
Whose bill are you collecting?
You almost cost me my livelihood
How could I not settle accounts with you?
What do you mean by that!
?
You picked 28 strings of my grapes tonight!
"Each string contains 1 1 3 grapes making a total of 3,164 grapes in all"
"That means you owe 253, 700 coppers I won't take anymore or any less"
Pay and go or I'll take your eyes... to ferment into my Night-sweet Premium Wine
Trying to run away!
"Move another inch, and instead of hat... I'll have your eyeballs in my hand"
Want to run!
?
Help!
Help!
Don't shout-l've been hanging here all day
"What a ridiculous way to fail, Brother"
We're hung on the tip of a straw!
What damned rotten luck!
Hey!
You two were stealing my grapes together!
I have a mother 80 years old and 20-some dependents waiting to eat
Please find forgiveness in your heart!
Then from now on work to pay your debts
What if he comes to know that the girl is a lawyer?
You must be lucky that a beautiful girl resides with you.
Then why should you bother about her job?
-What are your blabbering man?
"-Oh no, he scolds me."
- You can not face competition at your house?
Just because she looks good we can't take such decisions.
- If only she is an advocate...
"- No, she is a software engineer."
He is going to puke over me after eating all this.
Look how he tears off the chicken leg!
- Have you got my phone number?
- It is good that you reminded me.
I can't harm myself more than this.
I should change my number immediately.
First..
"- Hey listen, first comes only once."
- May be he is utilizing me to taste all these different drinks.
- Hi dude - dude?
Why should we maintain decorum after we are drunk?
You are always a dude.
Can I ask you a question?
Please ask.
If you paying for your drinks how much would you drink?
- I never buy my drinks.
- Why?
If you buy your own drinks then you'll wipe out all your savings on booze.
"- But if some one like you buy me drinks, I shall oblige."
"- Me, you mean?"
Buying willingly?
- Boy
- Hey don't come.
I was looking to catch.
I didn't know it was human until I checked the snare this morning.
- God rest his soul.

(woman):
My detective agency is at your disposal.
"- I appreciate that, Miss Pink."
- How can I help?
I have just learned some distressing news about the baby William and I adopted.
"Well, about his deceased mother actually."
What is it?
She wasn't born with a complete reproductive system.
She couldn't have been Roland's natural mother.
"Well, that must have been a bolt out of the blue."
It never occurred to either of us to question his parentage.
And what do you want me to do?
Find out if his natural mother is alive.
- Can I ask for your discretion?
- Absolutely.
What do you know about the mother and her husband?
Not much.
Nigel Braxton was a safecracker from England.
"His wife, Joanne, was from Stratford, Ontario."
I think her maiden name was Perly.
And they have no surviving family.
- How old is the child?
- About 9 months.
Are you sure that you want to know the truth?
What do you mean?
It's a question that I ask all of my clients.
What I find out for them isn't always what they'd hoped for.
"I repeat, top secret."
KIRBY:
Colonel Cai.
- How was Saigon?
- Very interesting.
I attended a meeting with the premier and his staff.
The main subject was General Pham Son Ti.
He has assumed command of the entire Viet Cong forces in the south.
Which makes him Number One!
Affirmative.
And it could mean a major offensive.
I had my hands on him the last time I was out here.
"But because of political pressure, I had to turn him loose."
Like to get your hands on him again?
Who wouldn't?
"But if I know General Ti, he's surrounded by a regiment."
- My people think several.
- That brings us up to the plan.
He's somewhere in Hang Phau Valley.
"Surrounded by the regiments you mentioned, which makes a capture impossible."
Precisely.
Except for one woman and a certain hand-picked team.
"Go on, colonel."
This is the rat.
And this is the trap.
My father was a simple man.
"All he wanted was to be free his wife to love, and his children to raise."
He tried to remain neutral.
That was his mistake.
What he didn't realize was that man has to pay a price for that freedom.
"Therefore, he suffered the ultimate penalty."
Since that day I've lived but with one thought:
Thirty-six?
"Wake up, number 37."
Wake up
The definitive cause was never determined of the landslide of the Silver Bridge.
"Although the appearances have continued in the entire world, the Mothman was never seen in Point Pleasant again."
Previously on CSI:
I don't remember what happened.
You where framed.
Gedda has a mole on the department.
A cop?
Daniel Pritchard.
We're looking for somebody higher up than that.
I just need to know that you are through running the streets by you're own looking for bad guys.
This one son of a bitch is still out there and I promise you we're gonna get him.
That's what makes you a great CSI.
"Cetral dispatch, go ahead."
"Control, this is One-David-Two."
I have a 444.
Officer down in the alley north of the 800 block of Rayson Street.
Requesting three backup units and paramedics.
I am in pursuit of the suspect.
"Suspect is a white male, possibly armed, wearing dark clothing, traveling southbound toward Malpassat Road."
Officer down.
Repeat.
Officer down.
Alley north of 800 block of Rayson Street.
"Units four-five-one, four-five-six and four-five-seven, respond code three."
Officer down in the alley north of Rayson Street.
All officers respond.
Warrick...
"Oh, God!"
You are projecting.
Which is exactly what you said when Mr. Nose Hair maxed out your credit cards and took off with the gardener.
You swore on your father's grave that you would not bring that up again.
"Desperate times, desperate measures."
Is it that guy you're seeing?
Mystery man?
- Who else?
- You need to end it with this guy.
It's not gonna get any better.
"If I could do that, don't you think I would have?"
"Laura, you have no idea."
Did you terminate a pregnancy?
How did you know that?
I know.
Did the father pressure you to do it?
Out loud?
"No, he would never."
"But, he did make it clear that if I didn't,"
I would be twisting in the wind.
"I just keep thinking about this little munchkin that I'm never gonna see and who's never gonna skin her knee, who's never gonna have her first kiss..."
I believe in a just universe.
"One of these days, he is gonna pay."
- You deserve better.
- Excuse me.
Mara?
We just got the citizen video on the DeBray killing.
Will you come help me log it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'll stay and go through it with you.
- The video or my trauma?
- Both.
"For ten days in Paris, Aliki bought dresses hats and loads of other pretty things."
"For ten days in London, she picked up some gorgeous furs."
"And the last ten days in Rome, Dimitris, after finishing business, bought her a most elegant and most expensive bracelet."
"So honeymoon came to an end, and Aliki returned to Athens sadder than she was before leaving."
She inadvertently remembered another happier honeymoon she spent with Pavlos in a humble neighbourhood tavern.
"Where would you like to go tonight, my love?"
- Do you know what I feel nostalgic for?
- What?
Something nowhere to be found around Europe.
A small Athenian tavern.
Shall we dine at a Plaka tavern tonight?
"That's a splendid idea, Aliki!"
I'm so glad you show initiative for a change.
"To Plaka, Yannis!"
"What's more, I know a very nice, detached little tavern"
I'm sure you'll enjoy.
- Welcome!
Any preference?
- This table...
It's a nice little tavern!
"You were right, Aliki."
- What will you serve us?
- Old Yiannis will take your order.
"I hope the cuisine is good, too."
"- Oh, Dimitris!"
"- What is it, dear?"
My bracelet!
I must have dropped it in the car.
Your bracelet?
"- Will you, please, have a look?"
- Right away.
"- Good evening, dear Aliki!"
"That's the enemy's goal, no doubt."
He's right!
"Once they take Estabul, they'll take out their anger and hatred, and lengthen the fighting!"
We still have a way.
"You must not falter, Princess."
Rear Admiral Klom's army has surrounded the rebel army's main stronghold.
What is the meaning of this?
!
Withdraw the Roland army and release all war prisoners.
"If they do not heed our wishes, the people of Estabul will be beheaded on the spot."
We sent a letter with that content to the Roland army.
Roland's Hero King couldn't stand by and let commoners die.
How could you?
You're...
I know.
But this cannot be helped.
I wish to protect you...
Princess.
You would take our people hostage for my sake?
!
This is what the people want.
"If we lose now, what would happen to them?"
"How badly would the people of a defeated nation be oppressed, and be disgraced?"
And taking our people as hostages brings them no disgrace?
Can't this be stopped?
It cannot be.
I see.
I am naught but a puppet ruler propped up by others.
"In the end, I couldn't save anyone, could I?"
Princess!
The soldiers of Roland are!
Our army's soldiers are attacking the Estabul fortress!
What a relief.
I'm glad you're OK.
"[noah] You too, Tensou."
Mm.
Where are the others?
I'm here.
It's still rough out there.
Yeah.
There's squads of those xborgs everywhere.
I stopped by the school.
Kids are working to put things back in order.
We're not the only ones refusing to let these creeps beat us.
But we have to figure out a way to beat that armada.
The world has never seen an invasion like this.
[screaming and explosions] The villains you have fought against this past year were just the tip of the spear.
The armada is an overwhelming foe.
I can't believe the warstar aliens were just the opening act.
Shh.
[banging]
Listen.
[footsteps]
Are you sure you weren't followed? [all sigh]
Dude.
It's just like the first day of school.
"You're late, but you know how to make an entrance."
I've been searching for Robo Knight.
Can you locate him?
"[Gosei] I am sorry, Troy."
I cannot.
The armada has affected our communication systems.
But I know we will beat this new enemy because of your fighting spirits.
It is finally time for you to tap into the infinite power that lines the walls of this command center.
To inspect the same gift?
Two different...
I'm quite certain they will have the same question.
On the Q.T. is one thing.
"But you're tramping through my backyard,"
"Literally tripping over my agents,"
And you don't even give me a heads-up.
We have explicit instructions not to contact you any more.
Artie Nielsen.
"Look, it's not like we can't have coffee now and then."
We just can't have you on speed dial.
Look.
I get it.
For better or for worse-- and I happen to think worse--
You two are serving a new master.
This isn't your screw-up.
It was his.
It's just that he doesn't really...
Play well with others...
- Hmm.
- So much.
"So this security officer, Ogawa, Japanese embassy,"
Is waiting for my explanation of what you were doing
And if you had anything to do with whatever the hell that was.
Any suggestions what I'm supposed to tell him?
All right.
Do me one favor.
Get on a plane and leave D.C. while I can still let you.
Can I at least have that?
Be out of here as soon as possible.
I don't think this is what Dickinson had in mind.
"Well, what are we gonna do?"
It's laughable
--Laugh then!
"--Gera, don't pay attention to dad..."
She wasn't marrying you
--Who then?
--Me
--This is news --She thought this student's dad took bribes
--...she'd have a summer house and a car --pure nonsense!
And who asked me to set up a new apartment?
I asked!
What's wrong with it.
Every woman wants to have her own home to manage
Do you have your own premises?
"Go and manage them, then."
"--Have you seen those premises, Comrade Vasin?"
--I've seen all kinds of things.
"--Comrade Vasin, read me a fairy tale --You have a daddy, he can read to you"
Gera's busy with his diploma work
"Tell your mommy, if she doesn't like it here, the door is wide open."
--Excellent!
--I am not keeping anyone
"Dad, Lucy is actually no stranger here."
I forbid you to speak to her in that tone.
"Young man, you have no right to prohibit me in anything"
"--You are an absolute zero --Pavel, stop, it's unbearable!"
I'm in everyone's way
"Pavel, where are you going?"
Can you explain this?
"What, have you lost it?"
!
"I tell this overgrown boy for 3 years now that the tile is falling out, he won't life a finger!"
"Pavel, I feel so sorry for you"
Don't worry about it.
"There's, uh, one more thing."
"Garcia, she asked me about a week ago, who the godparents were gonna be, as in, hello, like I'm right here, like right in front of you."
"She'll be wonderful, but I have a few folks on my side of the aisle lobbying for the same position."
"Oh, Lord."
"So what are we doing, godparenting by committee?"
May have to be.
Derek!

Some men reach high peaks to leave an indelible memory.
Most of us are content to push forward.
And very few are born to become king.
"Small that camera, is not it?"
"- It's modern technology, Your Majesty."
It's amazing that you can make movies with such a small device.
How big is your team?
- I'm the team.
There's only me.
You're perfect.
"We'll have a nice portrait of you, do not worry."
But you're so tired.
"Sire, allow me, your speech."
Mr Moreau?
- Mr. Lloyd?
I should arrange the microphone at His Majesty.
Of course.
The documentary Our king must point out the king's competence
And his professional commitment.

And he must grasp his vitality and spontaneity.
Controlled spontaneity.

80 miles Northwest of nome... this is all Gonna be easy today.
Let's just get it over there And start making some money.
"Despite being knocked down Repeatedly this season,"
The kellys are off the mat...

And I'm not making a huge Amount Of gold for my family.

Not until we increase Our reputation in this town.
Hey-ho!
We got to show we can go Anywhere we need to.
And we're willing to do Anything we need to.
And that we're not Gonna give up.
- You ready?
- Go.

- Get the hose out.
"This is how it works, okay?"
"I tell you what to do, You do it."
I may have caused.
I really didn't come off professional
Or right the first time we met and i'm very sorry.
Michelle and i have had a long conversation about this
And we've got things straight between us.
We are a couple
And now i think it's time that you two get things straight.
Michelle is here to offer you your job back.
"Yes, regina, you can have your job back if you want it."
"- I mean, you two have worked so hard..."
- Regina: no no no no no.
Let's get this straight...
I have worked very hard.
"Oh, regina, right now the power"
Of life and death is in that tongue of yours.
Now don't choose death again.
"Choose life, dummy."
"I got this, mama."
Could we have just a minute?
- We'll be right back.
- Certainly.
"Regina, we're in a recession"
And your bank account is depleted to the point that it's inside out.
"Now if you won't listen to a bible verse,"
Will you please at least listen to a famous movie one?
"""Stupid is as stupid does,"""
And right now you're behaving very stupid.
Now get over there and get your job back
And save this house.
- Michelle.
- Michelle: yes?
Can i think about this?
[Siren chirping] It's Trevor Nigel.
What...
You're gonna have to move that.
"Trevor Nigel, you're under arrest."
Excuse me?
We found the knife that killed Phillip Harris.
Along with a rather ghastly collection of human body parts.
I admit nothing.
Neither did your partner before he was killed.
Jordan is dead?
"He gave me up, didn't he?"
I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.
"No, Trevor."
You gave yourself up.
"Back when your studio was doing Heatwave,"
I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned.
But you sent it back to me with a handwritten note detailing why my ideas were stupid.
"I never forget a bad review, especially one with such distinctive handwriting."
Hayley:
It's the same handwriting on your serial killer partner's screenplay.
"Richard, you're a pretty good writer, but you should really read Jordan's work, because it is inspiring."
"After I read his ""Gemini Killers"" screenplay,"
I knew that I had found a kindred spirit...
Someone with the same desires as I had.
And his script laid out...
[Handcuffs clicks] the perfect plan for us to kill...
Ow!
...
Without attracting suspicion.
"Sadly, he could never nail the end."
"Well, we did, and you've reached it."
Maybe you should do the rewrite.
Yes.
A reminder that shakpeare got it wrong.
We are not food for worms.
It's the flies and beetles that feast upon us.
"I'm more interested in why someone did this,doctor."
"Then I'll have to research the predatory, manipulative, grandiose nature of this behavior."

When was the last time you were here?
Yesterday morning.
First showing.
And everything was normal?
"There was no rotting corpse in the living room,if that's what you mean."
Who else had access?
A couple of dozen real este women.
The keys are in a lock box on the front door.
- Who's the owner?
- A local contractor... and me.
"Uh,I buy and bob fixes."
We split the profits.
Bob?
"Robert whitehead,the contractor."
A number where he can be reached?
Yeah.
"So who put the body here,you or bob?"
Neither of us.
Though it is an empty house.
"If you're looking to ditch a body,that's a real plus."

You were at the chateau de martin?
You know it?
Yes.
dirty your hands tearing my heart I'll get settled then.
into pieces so happy to be back.
"Yes, we're happy to have you back."
if this is the end then we whisper the wind and release it...
You heard about your mother.
I'm so sorry.
I'm back to plead with my father for her life.
I'll be gone from court once I have my answer
"And the matter is settled,"
And you and I will never see each other again.
I don't mean that to sound cruel or angry.
I understand.
You don't want to be seen as someone lying in wait
To reclaim your throne.
Or anything else that now belongs to my brother.
"They brought this back, after clarissa's death."
"I thought you might want to have it,"
As you were more parent to her than I.
They buried her in an unmarked grave
"Near the lake,"
Where the north road ends.
"I asked them to mark it with a cross,"
But it's unhallowed ground.
"What will become of her soul,"
I wonder?
Did she know any happiness in her miserable life?
When she was young.
The villagers who raised her for a time were kind.
"I know you're thinking about your next move, but there are things you don't know."
"Marcus, please just leave us alone."
Your mother didn't come back to Abnegation just to save you.
"She died trying to hide something from Jeanine, something that was entrusted to Abnegation"
- a long time ago.
- Marcus!
Stop!
"Whatever you want from us, you're not gonna get it."
I'm not the enemy here.
You found it.
"It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior, like you said."
You mind telling me what's inside?
A message from the Founders that will ensure the future our people deserve.
"Divergents will destroy our society, unless we destroy them."
And now we can.
"However, only a Divergent can open this box."
Find them!
Every last one of them.
Go with happiness.
Go with happiness.
- Go with happiness.
- Thank you.
Go with happiness.
I really don't know how much longer I can do this whole peace and love thing.
"It's the Amity way, just try to blend in."
"I'm trying to blend in, it's just not working."
"Coming through, on you right."
Okay here we go.
Oh look a rainbow.
It's pretty.
Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioning passifism.
I love this place.
"Right again, Jeeves!"
- This is a beautiful spot.
"- It was, sir."
"- What do you mean, ""It was""?"
- I regret to report that that woman is here.
- Woman?
What woman?
- Our visitor of last night.
"Oh, that one."
"Well, that is a coincidence."
"An extraordinary coincidence, sir."
May I suggest for your own good... that we motor on till we come to another hotel?
"Definitely not, Jeeves."
I refused to have my rest interfered by a mere female.
"Frankly, I'm afraid, sir, that we may get involved in another embarrassing situation."
This is different.
Remember what those Scotland Yard men told us about this girl?
It is our duty to remain here and watch her... in case the occasion arises to aid our country.
"Yes, sir."
"I find your patriotism most admirable, sir."
Then you haven't been able to find Mr. McDermott?
"No, not yet."
I'm sorry.
- I hope nothing's happened to him.
"- No, I don't think so."
If you tell me where you found him and about what time... it might help to clear things up.
It was quite late.
I was staying with my aunt in London.
"Oh, I— I see."
I'm beginning to think we should notify the police.
"No, no, no."
That won't be at all necessary.
You'd know it if you went into the kitchen and checked out those supposed violations.
Though you shouldn't have to check.
What's all this?
I just keep thinking about the Burkes.
There's something... something not right with these two.
"Just 'cause they say their suite is haunted, doesn't mean they're ""not right."""
"I had the development office pull the, uh, information from the sale of Monica's condo... just so we could run a more comprehensive background check."
What are you looking for?
"Ah, what are we looking for?"
That's the question.
I wanna run a complete search on these two.
"Previous addresses, former employers, whatever you can think of."
I want as much information as possible on those two.
Sorry I asked.
Hmm?
You busy?
No.
[Together] Hey.
What's wrong?
You first.
You mean you didn't hear about Mystique being shut down?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I did hear about that."
Health code violations.
I thought it must be some kind of mistake.
Hello.
"Everyone knows you're Montecito's official ""germophobe"" when it comes to Mystique."
Thank you.
It's just because I refused to go out with that crazy-ass health inspector.
So what's your problem?
Paul Logan.
I heard he was in town.
May I ask if you have any data on this?
"My colleague, he... he administered this drug to 18 volunteers, and 72% of them said that they had these profoundly spiritual experiences."
Where... where... where can we get these mushrooms?
It's not mushrooms.
We would be using medical-grade psilocybin.
When can I try this?
Good afternoon.
"So, we have some news."
Uh...
"We have all of Jacob's test results back, and, um, we can't find anything."
S-so this means everything is fine.
"Well, that's awful."
There's nothing you can fix?
- I'm afraid not.
"- We can't find anything, so we have to assume that this is Jerusalem syndrome."
Look at him.
He's had a spiritual conversion.
"- Ian, is that man sane?"
- ...
Fortify you.
Religious ecstasy isn't considered insanity.
"As much as we want to fix it, if Jacob's not ill..."
- ...she'asah il kol tzorki.
- There's nothing that we could do.
I have nowhere to go.
He gave away our house.
Barukh attah adonai melkh ha-olam she-asah il kol tzorki.
This is not what I signed up for!
You are supposed to take care of me!
Not me... you.
I gave up my career because of you.
I can't even get groceries.
In Hong Kong.
My crazy-ass brother went and got crazy-ass elective surgery in Hong Kong.
- Who does that?
- Short people.
Desperate short people.
I had my legs lengthened.
I couldn't find a surgeon who would do it here.
"Look, it's barbaric, okay?"
They--they broke his legs and they hooked him up to some sort of medieval torture device.
"Yeah, that's to pull the bones apart."
That's the lengthening process.
It's a controversial procedure.
I don't perform it myself.
- Could I take a look?
- Yeah.
They said it'd give me 2 whole inches.
Any word from UNOS?
Not yet.
Dr. Karev is staying in constant contact with them.
How much longer will we have to wait?
Are--are livers and intestines hard to find?
"Well, Jackson's blood type is O-positive."
It shouldn't be too difficult to match.
"But he's had blood transfusions, which means there could be extra antibodies that are hard to match, so we need to be patient, Melinda."
"In the meantime, um, I need to run some tests on Jackson to check his electrolytes."
"We're gonna do everything we can to help your son, mrs."
Prescott.
All of us.
You.
You're squirrelly.
I'm sorry?
I don't trust you.
Why can't it all be done on machinery?
"For many uses machinery is unsurpassed, but Logopolis is not interested in such uses."
Block transfer computation cannot be done with the computers.
-Why not?
-Our manipulation of numbers directly changes the physical world.
There is no other mathematics like ours.
You mean the computations themselves would affect a computer?
Of course.
"Change its nature, cause it to malfunction."
Only the living brain is immune.
"But you had a computer out there, you were using it."
"To record the code, yes, to prepare new algorithms, yes, but we must not use it to run our program."
"Now, we had reached 0-4, 0-7, A-0, 3-0, 3-8."
There are no errors in the registers.
We must search the streets.
-Sonic projectors.
-What are they for?
They must be creating a temporary zone of stasis around the Tardis.
-But I don't really understand their science.
-That goes double for me.
"Fourth block begins. ""A-3."
"-""F-8..."""
-E-8.
"-Sorry, E-8."
"-It is difficult, I know."
But accuracy is of a vital importance.
"""3-3."""
You can tell they're exploited.
-These people are scientists.
-So?
I've seen that look of dedication on my father's face.
"Well, it doesn't seem to be doing any good, does it?"
I brought you some company.
"Oh, he might be a little disoriented, after the way he came out of stasis."
- I know you.
"- Oh, you remember her?"
"Well, his mind isn't fully gone."
Hey!
Stay away from him!
I'm going to kill you.
"You've had 4,000 years to do so, with no success."
What are you doing?
Your blood is the key to unlocking the Thanagarian technology.
- Thanagarian?
- The alien species which gave the three of us our powers.
They sent three meteorites containing technology beyond human understanding.
"When they are activated by your blood,"
"I will be able to erase time itself, and travel us back to 1700 B.C."
- No.
No!
"- I will begin my immortal life anew, only this time"
I won't be content to whisper in the ears of powerful men.
This time I will be the one with the power.
I will be a god.
Please try very hard not to kill me.
Rip.
Please take me back.
I need your help.
I need to save my sister.
"And you know that I would do this for you, Sara, but I just can't."
I've not asked you for anything.
And you of all people should understand.
You have tried everything.
We... we have tried everything
all
- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
- Again.
All
- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
"- You got to something to say, son?"
We're all ears.
"This being your first week,"
"I'm gonna cut you some slack, all right?"
"'Cause, son, you got it easy on this side of the fence."
Do you understand?
"You get to go home at night, sleep in your warm, snuggly bed."
"But you best start giving a damn, or else you'll wind up over there, in juvie, playing with the big boys."
And you sure as hell ain't going home to your mommy and daddy.
"You will be locked up, crying and pissing yourself to sleep every night."
On the ground.
Give me 50.
Now!
Again.
All
- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
- Again.
All
- I will take ownership of my actions and the consequences of those actions.
- Devastation these furious storms are capable of unleashing.
"Living in southeast Texas, it's important we get prepared, because hurricane season is here."
What will the next one bring?
"It's not a matter of ""if"" but ""when."""
- Come on.
Let's go.
Get in your bed.
Okay.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that mr.
"Hill identified the defendant, James Conway."
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
Yes.
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record reflect that mr.
"Hill identified the defendant, Paul Cicero."
"Your Honor, I have a document..."
"See, the hardest thing was leaving the life."
I still love the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
"We had it all, just for the asking."
"Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along."
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because rats do anything to survive.
Isn't that right?
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about being a rat.
"Objection, Your Honor."
In view of the violence...
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
"I'd bet $20.000, $30.000 over a weekend then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies."
It didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
That's your third strike...
before you're 25 years old.
That makes you the goddamn rookie of the year.
I got a little baby at home.
"She need milk and books, man."
Only thing you got at home... is a wide-screen TV you haven't paid for yet!
–Ow!
–Here's your statement.
Sign it.
"Whoa, man."
"What the hell is this, man?"
This is all filled out.
You don't wanna sign?
I'll throw you in County right now on that third strike.
And if I sign this bullshit confession?
"Play ball with us, we'll let you play extra innings."
We know you've been selling stolen goods to Fleetwood Walker.
"Give us a hand, we'll lose this statement."
We'll forget we ever saw you.
Man!
"Oh, my God."
Why would someone do this to her?
Most likely trying to fill a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.
Why would someone fantasize about cutting a woman's arm off?
"Some people derive sexual pleasure... through inflicting physical, emotional abuse."
That's horrible.
"Yes, it is."
How old were you when you met Bob?
–Is he your first boyfriend?
–How did you know?
"He made you feel powerful, right?"
Did he tell you about the attempted kidnapping charges filed against him?
# Can we say we'll do desserts all round...?
#
"Oh, yes..."
# Ices in the chiller only got vanilla
# Or the sweet for which we are renowned
# In shit hole or in chateau
# They know Black Forest Gateau
# Though ours has never been too near Berlin
# It's wrong to brag
# It's just cake in drag
"# But it's ""gateau"" at the Berni Inn"
# On my grave will be chipped by a monumental mason
# There could never be a better life than Frank's
"# Had a wife had a child, had an avocado basin"
# Bath and lavatory from Armitage Shanks
# And it feels so sweet to have given you this treat
# And that is why we felt we must insist
# That we journey in to the Berni Inn
# To demonstrate the life you've missed... #
Sorry.
Can I just stop you a second?
We're leaving.
"We don't want to spend any more time with you this evening, or ever."
You're not staying for coffee?
It's Irish coffee.
After-dinner mints come with.
"No, we're going for a nice cup of tea."
Tea?
I just felt he was belittling me.
"Well, us."
"He was trying, but we shall not be belittled."
We shall fight them in the chip shop.
- Here we are.
"- Good-looking school, doc."
"That must be the new principal, you know?"
"They really give it to you, didn't they?"
"Like everybody else, they really give it to you."
Have you been drinking?
"Work yourself to death, then they bring in an outsider to pick the plum."
You have been drinking.
"I know you keep a bottle in the basement, but I won't have you bring it into the classroom, ever."
Don't forget.
It'd do your kids good to learn how to handle liquor instead of algebra.
- You're talking like a fool.
"- Oh, be I."
I sat in this classroom four years.
I sat right here.
Everything important was learned somewheres else.
You never applied yourself.
"If you had, you might've learned something in school."
"Tell my wife, a cleaning woman."
"- Tell me, a janitor, cleaning toilets."
- Stop it!
- Tell every mill worker behind on his bills.
"- I said, stop it."
"If you had applied yourself, you might have learned how to live intelligently."
There ain't nobody in this here town living intelligently.
Nobody.
- I don't believe that.
- All right.
Name me one important person graduated from this here school.
Name one.
You can't.
"I'm gonna tell you something, Ms. Thornton something you can teach your class someday."
Open this gate!
Goodness!
What's going on?
That conniving bastard!
What is the meaning of this?
!
We are looking for a criminal who not only embezzled government property but stole valuable goods intended for His Majesty's use.
Begin the search!
Don't be like that.
You can't do this to a friend.
Go to the tavern if you can move around.
He said he'd be there waiting for you.
I think you should listen to Master Bang.
What are you talking about?
We're not letting Soon-shin go anywhere.
I think Master Bang's concerns are valid.
I think he worries too much.
Kyun...
"You know what he went though to stay in the institute, and he doesn't have much time before the exam."
Who's out there?
"Soon-shin, this is you!"
What's wrong?
It's Baron Huh's doing.
I will go to the authorities at once and reveal the truth!
No.
This warrant with your sketch means that they have acquired solid evidence against you.
But still...
Haven't you seen what they have done to your friend?
They will make up a crime if you are innocent.
"But, Sung-ryong..."
You must flee for now and find a way to prove your innocence.
Darn this rotten government!
Time tames the strongest grief.
"My father's bitter grief, rage against the world that crushed me."
I put it all behind me and forgot about them.
And I had hoped that world would forget as well.
But the world was not so kind.
"The same shackles that tied me down have now tied you down, and I am powerless to free you from it."
Father...
That jerk.
I'm the fool for having thought of him as a friend!
What are you mumbling about?
"What are you doing here, Father?"
Didn't I tell you to stay home and rest?
I can rest when I'm dead.
I should work as much as I can when I can.
"If you keep that up, you will be dead!"
Don't worry.
It's sick men like me that live to be seventy!
I won't die until you're married-no.
I mean until your children are married!
What?
!
The people are refusing to pay their taxes?
"Sir, there are riotous protests."
Imposing another tax so soon after the last collection is...
Then are you going to pay for them?
They protest bee use they don't realize the severity of their crime.
Isn't that so?
"Yes, sir."
Then what should we do?
Pardon?
You're so dense!
Think!
"Obsolete brand, slight yellowing."
But the ink you used... the ink told us the rest.
"We extracted the ink from the note, Kevin."
"From 1969 to 1994, consumer ink was infused with a Coumarin compound."
It's a plant extract.
They're called chemical date tags.
Determine the compound and get the year the ink was manufactured.
"Once the ink's extracted, it's analyzed with thin layer chromatography."
The tags react to ultraviolet light.
"Which shows the ink on your note was made of compounds C, A, and B."
Which is unique to only one year : 1990.
"And the writing, unique to one person."
You.
Krystal Sneed's Class of '90 yearbook.
Which you signed.
We matched the handwriting to your note.
"""I know about the curve."
"You're a dead man. """
He stole the science midterm test.
Got a bogus 98.
Set the curve for the rest of us.
"Made my 91 look like a ""C""."
Kept me out of Vanderbilt.
And you waited 15 years for revenge.
What ?
I
- I didn't kill him.
Krystal told our homicide detective that she saw you and Patrick arguing right before he was killed.
Kevin.
Bro.
"Always expected you to show up at Vanderbilt, and, uh, follow through on your threat."
You kept that ?
"I got the report, but they're not some lowly weapons dealer at a local market."
No one knows how deeply connected they are with anyone.
"I know that you, Alpha team, have no fear, but... they have neither fear nor law."
You cannot pretend to be the UN to cross the border anymore.
"They know now, and have even dispatched the Korean army to patrol the border!"
We switched over.
Take it easy.
"If things go bad, there's only so much I can do."
"Well, you know"
I have my people in high positions.
Dead presidents.
Congratulations.
You just got promoted.
Don't forget your present.
They were smuggling arms (weaponry).
"In other words, merchants of death."
It's best not to run into them.
"Hey, you know better."
You and I both don't have much longer til we go back.
"If you go back, you will get promoted."
I will get promoted as well.
Let's avoid things that can be avoided.
Alright?
"Yes, I understand!"
Write the report with detail.
"Yes, I understand."
And take this.
There is an order for an urgent transfer.
For Master Sergeant Seo?
It's an order to report to the Special Forces by the Commander of the Special Forces.
I understand.
You may go.
"Thank you, brother Hung."
Don't mention it.
"As told by Chan Mon-gut,"
I will take good care of you.
Beat him severely!
Court.
My master is really great.
My master is really great.
Please ask the candidates for the jury to come for the election.
"Mr. Cheung Ti-sung, you are handicapped,"
I would like to dispense you from serving the jury.
Objection!
Why do you object?
It's against the spirit of law for despising handicapped people.
"Although I am blind,"
I am always a righteous and fair person.
My wish is to become a jury member.
"If you don't let me join the jury, I'll complain against you."
"Alright, I'll let you do it."
Thank you.
"We have jury and judge here, actually, who will be in-charge of the court?"
Yup.
"So, do you think that is an answer?"
Well.
Prosecutor.
Jury.
"In the coming few days,"
I'll disclose the most ugly face of human beings in front of you.
This is a terrifying and shameless homicide.
The accused Ho Foon had secret affair with the victim's wife Yuk.
"He seduced the victim's wife, and he was well-planned to possess Yuk too."
He asked Ho Chun to meet him and then killed him.
"Yes, to show what I imagined to be the essence of Britain..."
A sort of orthogonality which isn't british at all...
But which could be...
It could be...
With this wall containing these trees...
With this way of...
"This very british shyness, this very british grayness..."
"This calmness, this british distance..."
"This big distance, so gentle and british."
Eminently british.
I'm quite proud of this one.
It's a break-up picture.
"It was taken in Venice, in rather dramatic circumstances."
"It's the suit, tie and shoes of a man I loved."
In an apartment in Venice where we stayed.
"My shoes nearby, not at all aligned with his."
"That still aren't aligned, even less than before."
That are the only element of disorder in the picture.
And this colored shade...
It's a picture I sent him as a break-up letter in a way.
An ironic picture also.
Don't you think so?
Ironic?
I don't know.
This one is strange...
I don't like it very much...
It's a field in Corsica with...
A superimposed man in a bed in Aix-en-Provence...
The whole thing re-worked in Paris...
Already stained by humidity and weather.
It's a juxtaposition of a man...
Here below is a man in his bed...
You like scotch?
I do.
Here.
Cheers.
"We're both healers, you and me."
We help people end their suffering.
Give them a moment of euphoria and take away their pain.
"I thought he just wanted to sell them pain relief, you know?"
"Weed, morphine."
I guess he saw an opportunity.
To kill people?
Must be an entrepreneurial genius.
"Well, if you think about it, he... he is."
"I mean, apparently, people are willing to pay top dollar for a good death."
"You know, it's true, what you said."
You never forget your first injection.
Mine was Yvonne.
ALS.
You know what that is?
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
"You shouldn't underestimate me, Mary."
Yet you didn't... you didn't think to mention any of this when we were in this very room together.
"Okay, you see, the way I saw it, I had two options."
One was to tell the police...
tell you that I'm a drug addict.
"Two, wear the wire, and I could prove that"
Mary and I are just ordinary end-of-life counselors.
"You lose all control, limb by limb, organ by organ... until you can't breathe."
Is that where you come in?
To take back control?
Or else the monster wins.
You said that was saline.
They have wounded me in such a way..
..that I wont be able to forgive them in this life!
Dont be so harsh on them!
If you wont support them in their bad times..
..then who else will support them?
And did you forget what sister-in-Iaw used to say?
The one who doesnt know how to forgive..
..even God doesnt forgive that person.
"Jyoti, even if God sends me to hell for not.."
"..forgiving them, then III happily go, but I.."
..I will not give them a place in..
..my heaven-Iike house again.
"If.. if I forgive them today, then all those brothers.."
..who take care of their younger brothers..
..like theirfatherwiII neverforgive me!
"Jyoti, its very simple."
If today these people have cried in orderto improve..
"..their bad times, then can you assure me that.."
"..in future, if the time changes.."
..these people wont change themselves?
Can you assure me about this!
?
No!
You cant assure me about this.
"Krishna, get these people out of here!"
Im feeling suffocated!
"One day, you promised me that.."
..you will never let these children cry.
"And today, when these children are.."
"..in front of you, you are feeling suffocated!"
Did you forget your promise!
?
What is she thinking?
"What are you laughing about, Lola?"
"Based on the script, Lola should now say..."
Nothing.
I merely remembered something adults often say and I accidentally laughed.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
I merely remembered something adults often say and couldn't help laughing.
That line is exactly what's in the script...
But the tone is completely different.
This jie jie is different from the script.
She's not gentle at all.
I'm sorry.
Such a murderous aura.
"The dialogue didn't change, but the mood is completely different."
She has totally overturned the character's personality concept.
Gong Xi jie is amazing.
"Next, in the script, Lola gently says,"
"""Angel, you're a smart child."
"Before you hear what others say... """
"Angel, you're a smart child."
"Before you hear what others say, you already know the answer in your heart."
"Then Lola will gently say,"
"""Daddy is human too. """
"""Sometimes he's irrational. """
Daddy is human too.
Sometimes he is irrational and unintentionally says hurtful things.
"Angel, you ought to know that parents don't resent their children."
"Angel, you ought to know that parents... do resent their children."
She changed the dialogue.
What is she doing?
Jie Jie is supposed to make Mei Mei realize that their dad loves her.
Why are you...?
Why is she pointing at me?
Why you rolling toward me?
You're in front of the door.
Uh...
Oh.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.
What happened to you?
What happened was this:
The bee man was not composed of bees.
The drones nested around their queen  safe inside the bee man 's mouth.
But when he spat the queen  she signaled her drones to attack any perceived predator.
"Unlike Kentucky Fitz, Chuck kept a cool head and an open mouth."
She was not perceived as a predator  but a nest.
Look.
That's Betty Bee as a little girl.
"Well, either she was an unfortunately hairy child..."
Or Betty Bee is the terrifying bee man.
- Wasn't she with you?
- She didn't get off the elevator.
She must have come back up here to wiggity-whack you for being a spy.
Like she wiggity-whacked Kentucky.
"Well, my wiggity wasn't whacked."
And I got the bee key.
- That's a house key.
I know what house.
As Chuck followed the bee key that was key  Olive Snook followed her homesick heart to the confessional.
Is our solar ray still functional?
"In fact, it's operating at an efficiency rate of 12,000%."
Transfer all available power to the time drive.
"Get ready to eject the meteor, and pray that we have enough power for one last jump."
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Our time will remain intact.
"The world, not so much."
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We'd never get it
- far enough away.
- Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
where's Rip?
And the meteorite?
Will somebody please tell me what just happened?
Rip?
Sorry if I gave you all a fright.
What happened to the meteor?
"Uh, I flew it into the heart of the sun."
"Well, I angled the ship to eject the meteorite before impact, and then, uh... time jumped away."
- You could have been killed.
- Should have been.
You're a moron.
"Now, who fancies a return trip to 2016?"
- I can't believe it's over.
"- Well, for some of you, yes."
"My journey, it seems, is only just beginning."
How does that work?
Savage is three times dead.
"The Time Masters are no longer of growing concern, due to our destruction of the Oculus."
Someone needs to be responsible for protecting the timeline.
- For what?
For snatching bodies and selling the pieces.
"Look, I didn't steal anything."
I work in the mortuary as st.
Mark's medical center.
I oversee the anatomical procurement services.
"Yeah, they confirmed that."
Okay.
So we provide specimens to schools and researchers.
It's illegal to profit from the sale of body parts.
"Look, we only charge for their transportation, storage, and processing."
"It is a vital, legal service."
And it's all above board.
"As long as the bodies are donated, not paid for."
Who donated the body in the back of your van?
"I don't know, but I can get you the paperwork."
You have any paperwork on Manette Combs?
/ Who?
Manette wasn't an organ donor.
She never willed her body to science.
And you bought her corpse from Mark Mogan at the Brooklyn M.E.'s office.
"Chopped her up, sold her parts."
And then dumped what you couldn't sell.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not what you told me before.
Make sure he's discreet.
"You see something you think I'll like, give me a call."
"What, you set me up?"
Her face ring a bell?
"We found her head, her arm, and a leg."
Where's the rest of her?
Ask my lawyer.
Gocha told us to be alert and to shoot everyone and not let anyone escape.
It has only smelt only blood.
But this has smelt our sweat too.
Do you know what will happen if I hack you with this?
Come  hack us now.
Kill us.
Come.
Idiot.
You shot the groom.
Shot them all dead.
They are not your policemen.
"Very honest policemen, as a wonded man if you can do so many things,"
"I wounded you, I can do many things."
"The day I saw your laptop,"
I sent information through the net.
That's why top officers are here.
I know.
"Even if we had planned this operation, this would have been the end."
"In a war, people will die."
We can handle this in the inquiry.
Mind your business.
You go.
"Since your son sent information through the net, we were able to catch a big criminal."
He has done good.
Feel proud of him.
Great job.
I really appreciate you.
"C'mon boys, search the place."
Those who mined diamonds against the law were arrested  punished.
Velu who helped us in this operation was felicitated by the government.
"Moreover, his crimes were pardoned and freed by the court."
Nothing wrong in doing this for a son like you.
So much money here reminds me of that thief.
Shut up!
Don't remind me about that thief.
I'm getting shivers.
"Can I distribute it now, Swami?"
"Inauspicious time will elapse at 11 .59 am, after that it's auspicious time all the way."
"Take care of it till then, after that money won't be here even if you wish."
"You'll distribute it, right?"
- Got scared?
- You've a lighter?
"Just 2 minutes only, how will you steal it?"
120 seconds is more than enough for me.
"You're still here, I'm next to you, so many security people around, how will you do it?"
Are your men inside already?
If you don't steal by noon...
I will...
How...how...?
Still 80 seconds only.
Bad man?
Who are you?
A wonder is going to happen inside in 80 seconds.
An extraordinary man will steal all the money right under your nose.
This is confirmed intelligence report.
Who are you?
Go...go...go away...
What's all this?
An unknown man has donated billions of rupees for children's welfare.
He's still donating.
City school children have rallying to thank and wish him well.
The doors are still locked.
Tight security all around.
All our eyes are on money.
- An elderly man blowing his hands.
Fore!
It landed near hole 6.
- Did I hit that family?
- They shouldn't bring the pram here.
"Go, go, go!"
We're in for it.
Take it easy.
- So Davis was wrong after all?
"- Well, I never did believe him."
And only a few yards from where he thought the tomb was.
- That's right.
"- Well, you deserve it, Monsieur Carter."
I shall come and inspect the tomb tomorrow.
This is a most excellent day for our department and for the country.
I shall arrange storage facilities at the Cairo Museum.
No.
It's far too early to involve the museum.
"Whatever we do, nothing must be rushed."
These things are precious.
I understand.
All care will be taken.
I'm putting together a team of experts.
I've already contacted the Metropolitan Museum as well as our own British specialists.
This is a huge task.
Please do not forget there are national interests to be considered.
That may be so but this must be preserved for all posterity.
That is far more important than the concerns of any single nation.
"And as His Lordship's field director, I intend to ensure that the correct procedures are followed at all times."
I hope that's clear.
"This is an Egyptian tomb, Monsieur Carter."
Can't save the world.
Not trying to.
How long have you known rosie?
"2 years,give or take a fight or three."
What is he claiming?
That mrs.
Neuwirth could have been saved.
There's a chance of settlement.
I don't want to settle if it's going to leave a cloud of doubt over this hospital.
"Code zero,possible hijacking,assailants unknown."
You've got to move your belongings and find a permanent residence.
You don't have to respond to everything they throw at you.
"Yes,I do."
Maybe you can defend every action you've ever taken.
Some day you must tell me what that's like.

"We start with ""el paseo,"" the stroll."
No other dance connects 2 people more closely than the tango.
Emotionally as well as physically.
"There is skill, communication, and intimacy like none other."
Thought tennis was a gentleman's game.
"Hey,too bad you didn't break your arm before the match."
"Why don't you piss off,you dick!"
"Or would you like another forehead across the head, 'cause you broke the wrong arm."
Hold still.
That's the only shot you made today.
That's it.
Don't move.
I'm outta here.
You promised.
"No,I promised I'd get physical therapy not public humiliation."
# Rock you #
# Sing it #
# We will we will... #
"Hey, Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?"
I joined the basketball team.
I gave up singing and dancing forever.
I'm just not into it.
You gave it up?
That's right.
"You know, sometimes you just have to go with what your heart tells you."
There's things we're all good at and we can't just keep them bottled up inside.
# 'Cause you got to do what you wanna do #
# Don't let nothin' get in your way #

# He was unhappy #
# 'Cause he just wanted to play ball #
# But he finally got the courage #
# To answer his heart's call #
# Just like me all I ever wanted #
# Was to sing and dance #
# And now that I stood up for my dream #
# I finally have the chance #
# You gotta do what you wanna do #

I've been looking in on the doings on your lively little Earth.
Then you've been looking in on the doings 900 years past.
"Oh, really?"
Have I made an error in time?
How fallible of me.
"Oh, I did so want to make you feel at home."
I'm quite proud ofthe detail.
General Trelane--
"Retired, sir."
Just Squire Trelane now.
And you may call me squire.
"Yes, I rather fancy that."
For what purpose... have you imprisoned us here?
Imprisoned?
Nonsense.
You're my guests.
"You see, I just finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society."
You came by at the most propitious moment.
"I want to know all about your campaigns, your battles, your missions of conquest."
"Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest."
"When we do battle, it's because we have no choice."
"That's the official story, eh?"
I must ask you to let us go back.
I wouldn't hear of it.
You shall join me in a repast.
"I want to learn all about your feelings on war, killing, and conquest."
Do you know that you're one of the few predator species that preys even on itself?
Not yet.
"Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle."
"DeSalle, did you say?"
Un vrai Francais?
"My ancestry is French, yes."
I got accepted to Florida University.
"You mean to tell me, that you got in without hacking into the computer system... and making it all happen like you usually do?"
"All by myself, just like a big boy."
I see you guys later.
Where are you going?
What's wrong man?
Time to celebrate!
Touchy subject.
"""What are we all doing tonight?"""
Katie.
"Katie, you work at Hybra Tech don't you?"
I bet you see all sorts of examples of these scientific processes.
"Actually, I work in the monitoring station in security."
Hybra Tech is a classic example of a company... whose goods and services constantly udelices... the scientific discovery processes.
"They create almost everything, from processed cheese to napalm."
A very unfortunate part in the scientific processes is failure.
"In simple terms, you can not make a omelette without breaking a few eggs"
Where are you going?
Get back to your seat please.
What is going on here?
Julian parents was 2 of the volunteers that died last year at Hybra Tech... they where in a car-wreck.
Julian!
wait.
She didn't know.
It's cool...
They been on my mind a lot lately.
It's been really hard on my brother too.
I am so sorry.
Thanks...
I'll be alright.
"Well, well, well..."
What have we here?
I have to get out of this as soon as possible.
My kids are still young...
They would be shocked if they knew their dad was suspected of murder.
"I just remembered, it's my oldest daughter's birthday today."
And it's just going to pass by like this.
Even though us meeting at Chung Gye Plan was an ill-fated relationship...
What was an ill-fated relationship?
We... got along like blood brothers.
We did?
- When?
"- Wow, seriously..."
"But I was thankful that you gave me 150,000 won more than the others..."
So I will repay you with this favor.
Hey...
Thanks.
"For us, as a life mentor and his apprentice..."
"We shared a lot with each other, don't you think?"
- When?
"- Oh, seriously..."
There will be moments when you suddenly remember these things...
I will go with Chan Gyu tomorrow morning.
We've been working together all along.
The remaining one percent that's crawling out...
I have that too.
"Anything I'm doing with Jung Yeon, I know I can do to the best of my ability."
What?
How should we understand this relationship?
What is there to understand?
We're friends.
"Well, more than friends..."
"I guess we should say, best friends?"
Aren't we all friends now?
I'll take care of it my Paşa.
Don't you worry
"But Sümbül Ağa, in silence.."
Right?
Mustafa go to your room.
It is late
We have things to discuss with your mother
"Mahidevran, I'm very pleased of how you raise Mustafa"
Your effort on raising him as a prince is great
"I'm doing my best, your Majesty"
I'll keep the honory of being graced by you all my life
About the things I want to discuss with you ...
I'm all ears your Majesty
"As a Haseki and mother of a prince, I am granting you a plenty of spending money to do charity anywhere in any way you want"
You make me happy your Majesty
Thanks to you I'll get countless of prayers
It is like you have given me the paradise
May God bless you
I'm going.
Have a good night
"What is it, Nasuh Efendi?"
You seem so troubled
It is nothing my Bey.
We are having fun
"Come on, welcome"
Is it that you are in love?
How can I fall in love My Bey?
I'd recognise a man in love even if I see him in the darkness
Obviously you have a heartache
"Diamond cut diamond, Nasuh Efendi"
Wine won't heal your wound
A human can heal
"You got frostbite, avalanches, and deadly icicles."
Icicles aren't deadly.
They're refreshing and delicious.
They're knives that can fall from the sky at any moment.
Sky knives!
- They kill a billion people a year.
- That seems high.
"Dad, come on."
It's snow day.
Can't we at least go outside and build one tiny awesome snow fortress?
Absolutely not!
You shovel that walkway before it turns into ice.
"And no forts, I mean it!"
"Naturally, we did the opposite 'cause forts are awesome!"
"Good job, dude."
"I can't feel my fingers, but this definitely was two hours well spent."
Do you think maybe we should shovel the walkway a little so Dad doesn't totally freak?
"Yeah, we should..."
after a quick expansion.
Quick's good.
Whatcha thinking?
"I'm picturing a master bedroom with an attached bath, butler's quarters, a dojo, one of those maze gardens, all of the rooms from ""Clue,"""
an indoor basketball court.
A basketball court inside a snow fort?
That's just the first floor.
The second level's where the party's at.
"Hot tub, sauna, fire pit."
You don't think that'll create an awful lot of heat?
Yeah...
- once the word gets out.
- Son of a bitch.
A fort?
You have a... gentleman friend?
"Vastra, what's happening?"
"The snow is highly localised, and on this occasion not naturally occurring."
It's coming out of that cab parked by the gates.
"Sir, one pulver grenade would blow these snowmen to smithereens."
"They're made of snow, Strax, they're already smithereens."
"See, Clara - our friends again."
Clara?
Who's Clara?
Your current governess is in reality a former barmaid called Clara.
That's the way to do it!
Meanwhile your previous governess is now a living ice sculpture impersonating Mr Punch.
"Jenny, what have you got?"
Should hold it.
"Sir, this room - one observational window on the line of attack and one defendable entrance."
"Right, everyone in there now, move it."
You - carry her.
Nice to see you off your cloud and engaging again.
"I'm not engaging again, I'm under attack."
"You missed this, didn't you?"
Argh!
Argh!
Shut up!
"Strax, how long have we got?"
They're not going to attack.
They made no attempt to conceal their arrival.
An attack force would never abandon surprise so easily - and they're clearly in a defence formation.
"Well done, Straxie, still got it!"
"Sir, please do not noogie me during combat prep."
So there's something here they want.
The Ice Woman.
Exactly.
Boring.
When do we get in contact with Hunter?
"Ms. Lance, are you all right?"
How do we get the Waverider back here?
"- Hi, Daddy, we miss you."
- And love you.
- And love you.
"- Captain,"
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Tell me you've located Savage.
"No, but we have received a transmission from 2016 Star City."
I don't understand.
This should have worked.
Did you account for subspace interference?
It's the first thing I thought of.
Did you adjust for temporal polarity?
"Oh, Raymond, you insult me."
Can you reach the Waverider or not?
We're working on it.
"Actually, guys, I think it just worked."
I thought I made my intentions perfectly clear.
And we wish to be equally clear about ours.
- Do you mind?
- Just checking to see if you're real this time.
You're not ditching us again.
"When the mission's over, then we can all go"
- our separate ways.
- And this mission is not over.
"Yeah, just curious how much headway you've had tracking Savage without all of us."
None.
"But neither have I got myself into bar fights in 1975 and the Old West, put dwarf star technology into the hands of terrorists, or got myself turned into a scary bird monster."
We get your point.
"Let's just say I'd prefer to gloss over this period of my life with a simple paragraph that reads,"
"""For a while he was employed in a minor executive capacity"
"""in a commercial...enterprise..."""
"What happens if they're bigger than me, like him?"
You're not going to wrestle with him!
All you're gonna do is use a bit of psychology.
-
- Show me.
-
"- Granville, it's simple enough."
I'll show you this last once and then it's y--your turn.
I'd like to try on something a bit smaller.
Don't be silly.
"The bigger they are, the harder they spend."
Pay attention.
Make sure he is going to pass the shop.
"If he's coming in anyway, you're wasting your time."
"No, it's too late once they've passed the shop."
He'll be away.
It's never too late.
You catch him at the warehouse door as they pass the back.
"You go out there, and if he goes round the corner, stamp your foot."
-
- Stamp me foot?
-
- You know what stamping your foot is.
Like that!
Missed him.
Obviously missed him.
The one thing I hate is grit in the eye.
The tiniest speck feels like a d--dormer bungalow!
You want to wet the corner of your handkerchief.
"""Mr. Black Eagle, who had been petitioning for some time..."""
"""to be allowed to participate in the race."""
A mysterious aviator?
Look at this face!
Who else could this be other than Moriarty?
"He is going after the prize of 1 00,000 crowns, Moriarty, that fiend!"
Trying to win the championship with a stolen engine... that's thoroughly unforgivable!
Mr. Mac Bain was always so kind to my late husband.
I would like to do something to help him in return.
You look very nice.
"I promise, I won't get in your way."
"In any event, I've already decided."
Well...
Well...uh...
Right...
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up and get us to Holland!
I will capture Moriarty with my own hands!
"Well, well."
"Mr. Holmes, your reputation precedes you."
Welcome to Holland.
"In terms of this Mr. Black Eagle, we've discussed whether we should... accept his entry or not."
However...
However?
Have you heard the old story from medieval times?
Where a mysterious cavalier came out of nowhere to participate... in a joust and won the title?
So you're saying that you accepted the mysterious pilot's entry... in honor of that cavalier.
Yes.
"But, Moriarty used foul means to..."
Do you have proof that Mr. Black Eagle is Moriarty?
"No, but..."
My teeth are still rattling from that.
Twenty seven is a lot of very fast rocks.
Scale nine puts the storm over a vast area too.
How much would it add to our flight time if we went around it?
Estimated flight time of 84 hours would increase to 336 hours.
- Four times as long.
- Confirmed.
Would the force wall hold if we went straight through the storm?
"It is within the maximum design tolerance, however there would be no safety margin."
Is there enough reserve power to maintain the wall?
Insufficient data for accurate projection.
"- In other words, he doesn't know."
- Confirmed.
Let's go round.
Are the others still searching?
"Yes, nothing so far."
Do you want any help on the flight deck?
"No, we've almost finished."
"Sonheim, there was something I wanted to ask you."
"Go ahead, I'll catch you up."
What is it?
Finding Dortmunn's body put it out of my mind.
Why did you follow me to the storage hold?
Why do you think?
You're an attractive girl.
"You asked where the hold was, I snapped at you."
I came after you to apologise.
To apologise?
Of course.
What other reason could I have?
Perhaps you were afraid I would find Dortmunn.
That's ridiculous!
- So Pylene-50 is actually made here?
- It has to be.
"It only remains stable for a few days, and then the enzyme bonds break up and it's no longer effective."
If we could find a sample for analysis...
Where's the synthesising plant?
"You're sitting on top of it, but it's guarded night and day."
It's worth taking a look.
- I wouldn't leave without.
"- Well, be careful."
"I wish I could help you, but I can't stay any longer."
"You've been a great help already, Leitz."
We're very grateful.
- Have you fixed its position?
"- Not enough time, sir."
"But it's above Roche's limit, so it must be a spacecraft."
Or a spy satellite.
- What's that thing called?
Orac?
"- Yes, sir."
- Means nothing to me.
How was it detected?
"- A one-in-a-thousand chance, General."
The operator happened to pick it up while running a routine line scan.
And what was this data it was taking from the terminal?
A study on freighter design modification.
Information being relayed from Space Centre.
"Sounds like a bit of commercial jiggery-pokery, Quute."
- I shouldn't worry about it.
"- That's not really the point, sir."
"These spaceship builders, they're always at each other's throats."
- Underhanded bunch.
"- Yes, sir, but..."
"Been a minute, man."
Yeah.
- We good in here?
"- Yeah, don't worry about it."
Everything's been rendered safe.
These guys weren't messing around.
"Hotch, these tubes surround what would be the explosive charge."
And this cylinder right here?
It's gotta be where they put whatever bio or chem agent they plan on dispersing.
- That's a happy thought.
- Yeah.
Tell me about it.
Looks like a 4 man cell.
They assimilated into the community.
Just like any other suburban gangster wannabes rolling at the mall.
Who do you think we're dealing with?
Most likely middle-eastern males in their early twenties.
"Judging by that device out there, they're looking at significant targets:"
"Military installations, government buildings."
You must be the BAU boys.
And gal.
Pardon me.
- I'm Jason Gideon.
"- Andy Bingaman, FBI."
"- Agent Prentiss, Dr. Reid."
- Hi.
I'm the intelligence supervisor here at Gitmo.
You guys having a hard time getting Jind Allah to talk?
"Not only can't they get him to budge, but 2 weeks ago, word got out that one of the other detainees was spilling secrets."
Jind Allah managed to have a 3 minute conversation with him in the shower line.
"That night, the other detainee committed suicide."
He's reciting the Qu'ran from memory.
"Ah, beautiful, hearing it purr."
That is not going to work.
"The worst thing is,"
"Jaguar were working on an F-type, and they cancelled that as they'd spent their money on the diesel."
This is a heartwarming tale of British boffins.
"Mark and Colin have been in their sheds smoking pipes, making tea."
They've looked at the electric car.
"They have a prototype, the emotion."
"They say, ""We aim to lead the way with a variety of innovations -"
"""many could find a market in the mass production"
"""of commercially viable electric cars. """
Let's see.
What a rubbish thing!
It's got a fridge freezer!
"""You've forgotten the windscreen."
"Lend us your crash helmet. """
"They obviously made it blunt at one end, then pointy ""cos it's aerodynamic""!"
Look!
There's a way to go before it becomes a viable family car.
Why not invent another Concorde?
You know that Subaru and Mitsubishi film we showed earlier?
"You're probably thinking, ""That scenery, the cars - perfect. """
But it wasn't.
I'll show you an outtake which will explain why.
Caravans.
Get out of the way!
Pull over once in a while!
Once every 300 miles!
Pull over!
Ple-ease get out of the way!
Please stay in a hotel next time!
Ple-ease!

On what basis had you sought the warrant?

What transpired when you reached Mr. Ortiz's place?
We knocked.
We identified ourselves as police officers.
"After 1 0 seconds, we forced entry and found Mr. Ortiz standing in his toilet trying to flush 23 ounces of crack cocaine."
I don't think you mean to say Mr. Ortiz was standing in his toilet bowl.
"He was standing in his bathroom, flushing the cocaine."
What did you do at that time?
SlPOWlCZ:
"We prevented him from destroying evidence gave him his rights, arrested him."
Mr. Ortiz has stated that you broke down his door without warning.
"No, we identified ourselves, and then we gave him time to open the door."
So you made no surprise moves to throw the ecology of Mr. Ortiz's apartment out of whack?
- Did I miss something?
"- Yeah, me getting my balls squeezed."
That'll be all.

"Although they didn't gain anything, we lost quite a number of men and the kungfu expert like Golden Demon"
I think they will try again

Prince Kang is confined here
How can they save him?
Right.
There's only one way up hill and it is also where the Jin troops camp
Hundreds of thousands of Sung soldiers... still won't be able to come through
So how can these people do it?
"However, the cliff at the back is left unguarded"
There?
Unless it's a bird

Speaking of people with great lifting skill
I know one
Yian Luyan?
Yes
Do you know where he is?
"Yes, he's at the Xinlung Town"
We need some help here
It would be nice if he's here
Only if he agrees to come

We have Skinnarland on radio.
Haukelid and two local guys to execute the mission.
They will place 19 pounds of high explosive below deck.
Something which ought to create an 11 square foot hole.
The ferry with all its cargo should go down in less than five minutes.
Too fast to get to shore before it sinks.
Right.
"Another attempt, another blast, another fuckload of people die."
That's war.
There's a price to pay for success.
"How successful were we, really?"
We lost 41 men with Freshman.
We sabotaged the factory and had it the Germans rebuild it in two months   and listened to the Yanks and bombed the entire valley.
- All right.
And now about to blow up a passenger ferry.
- Very successful.
"- It's war Julie, you told me..."
The Heavy Water War:
Stopping Hitler's Atomic Bomb
What the hell are you thinking?
The alternative is bombing again.
We're talking about 40-50 civilians.
Plus even more reprisals.
Can't we blast it on the way down?
"Or after the ferry, out on the ocean?"
- I estimate most of them will get to shore.
- With the water temperature below freezing?
- They have two life boats.
- What if the ferry sinks before that?
Then they swim.
And those who can't?
The children and the elderly?
"Such intimate and important things happen in life, they seem to me to be outside of all control."

You recognize those films in the sound and in the lighting.

The spectator is impoverished after such a film.
People usually question in order to understand something.

Watanabe-chan good work here what's that?
this is a calming cactus and it matches mine matching?
You bought this many?
!
Don't be silly.
You're buying them.
Huh?
Why me?
"As an apology for the failure the other day, obviously."
Having us infiltrate a fortress for no reason.
Leaving behind a hero relic we found without even using it.
"You're buying dango for me every day from now on, okay?"
You left it right along with me!
What were we going to do?
You think using a hero relic that's been resting for centuries is that easy?
And how does that relate to buying dango?
"Yes, ma'am."
I'll buy them.
It would be my pleasure.
- Very good.
"- Thank you, come again!"
Why does this happen to me?
Damn it!
This is all Sion's fault!
He keeps pushing one pain in the ass after another on me!
"I'll bet he's having a nice meal in the castle right about now, or a lazy afternoon nap..."
"Your Majesty, how do you intend to take responsibility for this matter?"
Watch your tone when addressing His Majesty!
"No, I shall be heard."
You've been too soft.
You granted status in our lands to the neighboring Estabul lord and nobles.
You even guaranteed that the populace would keep their lifestyle.
- That sort of attitude ferments...
- Be silent!
Benvolio?
What brings you here to me at dead of night?
My care for one you love.
"The good lord Romeo, he waits by Juliet's tomb, all full of woe."
Why talk of woe?
Say rather joy.
"How joy, when all his love and life are in the grave?"
Did he not receive my letter?
What letter's that?
"Is that you, Tybalt, in that mortal sleep?"
"Forgive me, cousin, for the harm I did."
"There is no reparation more than this, that I shall kill the man who once killed you."
Leaving this sweet corpse is trial enough.
"Oh, my love."
My wife.
It is time to join you in all eternity.
"Juliet, why are you still so fair?"
Death that has sucked the honey of your breath has had no power as yet to spoil your beauty.
Shall I believe he has a plan in this?
"That insubstantial Death is amorous, keeping you perfect for his paramour?"
"For fear of that, I will still stay with thee."
And never from this palace of dim night depart again.
Eyes...
look your last.
Arms... take your last embrace.
And lips...
"the doors of breath, be forever sealed with a righteous kiss."
"Come, bitter conduct."
"Come, unsavory guide."
Here's to my love.
"Oh, true apothecary, thy drugs are quick."
Juliet.

"Mr. Dinamo,"

"I did not know that not only are you efficient, and a good observer, you are a photo enthusiast."
What?
May I see your lighter?
My lighter?
"Yes, your photographic device."
"Very well, you lot already found out?"
I only wanted to take pictures of the important people attending the conference.
That was all.
Mr. Dinamo
"It is logical that you should fail as a vulgar detective, unlike us, who are specialized agents."
So I would suggest for you to not move!
"It was a good idea of yours, that."
"My picture could have been identified by the intelligence service, but I can assure you, that will not be so."
"Freeze, Mr. Dinamo!"
"It seems you fail to understand that behind this book is a machine pistol with silencer, ready to fire."
"Very well, I will demonstrate."
Lucrecia?
Report in.
"Calling HQ, calling HQ?"
"Go ahead, Lucrecia."
We have Dinamo.
"Understood, hand him over to S.O.S. so they can take care of him."
"S.O.S. recieving,"
"Agents S.O.S. one and S.O.S. two bring Dinamo onboard, alive, or dead if necessary."
General advisory!
General advisory!
"We will hold a meeting immediatedly, over."
"Mr. Dinamo, thanks to you, we will have to rush our plans."
Take care of him!
"Very well, shall we?"
"-Harmony, architecture."
When I report this at home...
"And I would like to repeat once more in this solemn moment, as a poet says:"
"""O, thanks, thanks to your effort."""
Because miniaturization and electronics... are the future of mankind.
Do you know what I like the most about people?
That they can always celebrate something.
"All right, I'm coming."
-They're always pestering.
"-Hurry, these are ours."
Inhabitants of Earth live in houses.
"In small, bigger and the biggest."
Many houses together are called a town.
A town provides comfort for people.
People start the day with a row of typical actions.
"When they have done the prescribed number of actions, they leave their houses and rush away."
"They attend to useful activities, which they call work."
On Earth work is the meaning of life.
People get money for work.
"People buy things with money, which increases their comfort."
After work people return to their homes.
By pressing a button they set in motion a device for amusement.
"Amusement serves people by drawing in new energy, so they can successfully repeat another cycle of daily activities."
-Oh no.
-Oh yes.
You put more effort in your work.
"As we say, toil."
Not so.
"You put into it more intelligence, as we say, craft."
"Well, all right."
It's beautiful!
Splendid.
"No names, certainly."
"More rumour, to be honest."
"No names, certainly."
"Thanks for your interest, Joe, but we've got that well in hand."

"Even worse, we might get blamed for every corpse in here."
And boss'd chaff us to the hill on account of unnecessary roughness.
Not to mention the gang war we might've already started.
"And it's not even like we can switch out the bullets, because the calibers won't begin to match the ones of our styles and rods."

Hi.
Miley Stewart best assistant any international pop sensation.
Has ever had.
You must be Mrs. Jameson.
Oh my goodness it really is you.
Oh I thought she was just one of those desperate types.
That would do or say anything to get in.
"I mean she did this ""Stanford whoo"" thing that was."
Well borderline creepy.
I'll pass that along.
The girl loves constructive criticism.
Plays well with others and is an avid flossier.
"Healthy gums, healthy mind."
Now if you could just give me that orientation package.
I'll take it with me help save you the postage.
-Miss Montana...
-No worries.
It's just my way of contributing to higher education.
But I will need a receipt for tax purposes.
It isn't that.
It's apparently Miley misunderstood.
I didn't say this would get her in I said we'd reconsider.
"But even if we do accept her, she goes to the end of the waiting list."
[Stammering] The waiting list?
Oh well look Miley is a wonderful applicant it's just that the information.
Came a little late and the board only makes exceptions.
In very rare cases.
Well like for example if you were applying.
Me?
Well of course.
Having someone of your accomplishments here.
Would be a wonderful addition to the university.
"Ry quiet,very private."
"There's an oversized backyard,that's a big plus."
Whole house has been newly renovated.
There are upgrades all over the place.
"Stainless appliances,air purification system, total move-in condition."
"The furniture is rented,but if you likit, I can have the company make you deal."
"Amy,you are going to love the kitchen, but first I'm going to show you guys the living room."
It has a wall-mounted flat screen and a gas log fireplace.
You won't believe how easy this is.
One push of a button... isn't that cozy?

- If you would be so kind.
- You got it.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
"There's no rush,gentlemen."
Our patient isn't going anywhere.
"I don't know,ducky,the old gibbs is back."
The old gibbs?
"Mcgee,over here."
Hands and knees.
"On the floor okay,... yore not going to step on me,are you?"
Footprints.
Footprints.XXXXX
- it's a pretty tight weave.
- Looks like sisal.
It's a naturally stiff fiber woven from the leaf of a cactus plant.
"It doesn't mat,trap dust,build static."
Makes it ideal for carpeting.
"Personally,I prefer a good shag."
from a criminal-investigative standpoint.
What's so funny?
the man who has the Devil's own power.
What's that?
We have taken complete control of this base.
Please abandon your weapons and do as I tell you.
Who are you?
Bastard..!
What did you do to me..?
Yu!
You brat!
though it can't be helped if you want to die like him.
Idiot!
I'm not dead yet.
Wow!
Still alive after taking that shock wave?
You have the life force of a cockroach.
I won't die from such a thing.
Cockroaches should crawl on the floor!
Stop playing around!
Let's protect Yu!
you fools!
What good will it do for you to die needlessly?
and Ms. Margaret.
We finally meet I see.
I am God of the sky.
He who awakens me can freely make use of that which surrounds the Earth.
When evil begins to spread across the world turn the blessings of heaven to the curse of the Devil and then create a new human race.
That's the message that was left on the stone manuscript we have.
Analyzing this with the Professors data...
The blessings from heaven are the ultraviolet rays of the sun which warm the Earth.
such as carbon-dioxide and the ozone layer.
Thus controlling the amount of ultraviolet penetration.
"If you don't mind, I'd like to spend some time with you."
He stopped his recitation.
He's sizing Gideon up.
If I don't mind?
Like to get to know you as a person.
"Your faith, your ideology."
To what end?
Studying human behavior is what I do.
"if these guys are fundamentalists, you'd think they'd have Qu'rans,"
- prayer mats.
- No.
We didn't find any of that here.
They must have at least one other location.
"Ryan,"
- Hotch.
- What is it?
That looks like a list of chemicals.
Let me check with Garcia.
"- Go, doll."
"- Hey,"
I'm gonna read off a list to you.
These are chemicals.
"I'd like to believe, with greater understanding one day, we can come to a peaceful resolution of our differences."
Is that so?
"Look, I don't know what you've done or what you may have planned to do."
"But unlike the other detainees here, you have the education, intelligence to convey the nuances of your culture."
That's what interests me.
"Until, I don't give you what you want."
Then you will resort to other tactics.
"I swore an oath to uphold the United States constitution, no matter where I am, no matter who I deal with."
You're sure?
All right.
"The film became the studio's top box-office musical and won nine Academy Awards, including one for this lovely song."
The film stars Louis Jourdan and the lovely Leslie Caron.
"Oh, no"
Overnight there's been A breathless change
In you
"Oh, Gigi While you were trembling on the brink"
Was I out yonder somewhere Blinking at a star?
"Oh, Gigi"
Have I been standing up too close?
Or back too far?
When did your sparkle turn to fire?
And your warmth become desire?
"Oh, what miracle"
Has made you the way
You are?
What a time it was.
Life was simpler then.
And so was the movie business.
"MGM's dream factory created a rich, romantic..."
And although we may not see anything like it again we're blessed with memories and miles and miles of film.
In the words of Irving Berlin:
"""The song is ended but the melody lingers on. """
A show that is really a show
Sends you out with a kind of a glow
And you say as you go on your way
That's Entertainment
A song that is winging along
Or a dance with the touch of romance
Is the art that appeals to the heart
That's Entertainment
The world is a stage
The stage is a world
How come you are here?
I was rescued by Miss
I was supposed to... we'll talk about this later
Tell me whether there's any hidden path in this house that leads to some other places
Hidden path?
I was stalking someone but he just disappeared here!
I've served Miss for almost 3 years and have never heard that there's any hidden path
It's here
Shing Kwun
Shing Kwun... where are he going?
what's inside?
I don't know
Shing Kwun...
Chian Kuen shifting Technique!
This is a superior technique of the Ming Cult
Right
This is where their head Yeung Po Tin used to practise his martial arts
"Never mind him, let's see how this kung fu works"
How come there're no words in it?
How did you know its secret?
"Never mind, just look at the creed inside"
The first level of the technique
"Unite heart and spirit, lotus position"
Start from...
Mr. Chang
It's you
How come you're behind me?
I don't know either
This must be the secret power working
"Once you move, I'll automatically dodge you and move to this spot"
That means you've accomplished your training
"I unintentionally acquired knowledge of the skill, never meaning to steal it"
Yang-Jeong.
Yes.
"I have decided,"
I will not be sending reinforcements.
"Your Majesty,"
Do you realize that your decision will catalyse the collapse of BuYeo's diplomacy with the Hans?
"This decision does not lie in your hands, but in mine."
"However, if the Hans will forsake our ties just because of this, then it only goes to show how unreasonable they are."
You have gone too far..
"Compared to... the way you have insulted BuYeo over the years,"
This is nothing.
I will give you more time.
Do think this over carefully.
"Even if I think it over a thousand more times,"
My answer will remain unchanged.
Dismissed!
Those barbarians who dare stand up against us Hans will disappear like ashes from the face of this world.
"And after this, the Emperor might consider doing exactly the same thing to BuYeo."
PREPOSTEROUS!
"You go back and tell your Emperor,"
BuYeo will be well prepared for it.
"The one that will turn to ash is not BuYeo, but the Han Dynasty."
I will convey this message.
Listen up!
"Regarding my decision,"
Don't ever bring it up again.
"Yes, Your Majesty."
Chief General!
"Yes, Your Majesty."
"From this moment onwards,"
Move the entire BuYeo's military into battle position.
We must stand prepared for any provocation from the Hans.
Cat-and-mouse game.
With us as the mouse.
"90 degrees to starboard, Mr. Sulu."
"Turning, Captain."
Now veering aftwards.
"90 degrees subport, Mr. Sulu."
Adjust.
Turn completed and still accelerating toward the planet.
Or it toward us.
Decelerate into orbit.
Prepare transporter room.
"Captain, you're not beaming down."
"Yes, I am, Dr. McCoy."
I am going to see our playful Mr. Trelane and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship.
Stand by communications.
"If you don't receive a message from me within the hour,"
Leave the vicinity at once.
No turning back.
The prisoner may approach the bench.
Trelane.
"Any attempt at demonstrations will weigh against you with the court, and this time my instrumentality is unbreakable."
I've had enough of your games.
"Oh, the absurdity of these inferior beings."
"""And now, Captain James Kirk, you stand accused of the high crime oftreason against a superior authority, conspiracy, and the attempt to foment insurrection."""
How do you plead?
"I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane."
Anything you might say has already been taken down in evidence against you.
I've come to get back my ship.
Irrelevant.
We've made you angry with our will to survive?
Uncalled-for.
Then vent your anger on me alone.
There's nothing complex to understand.
"Please, Sadhana!"
I'm already terribly confused.
You are actually very clear.
Only I am confused and running behind you repeatedly...
What's happening here?
But...
I have seen many fraudsters.
"But you have tricked a cop for your own selfish, personal reasons."
Panju...
"- You easily decided that a person like me will be a constable forever, that you can take full advantage of me!"
Can't blame you.
My face is made to look like that!
"Had I not known the truth even now,"
I would be roaming with you dreaming of becoming a TV celebrity.
Mister...
- You almost got me fired from my job!
We couldn't have made such a progress in this case without you!
You would have gotten nowhere had I not come.
"Panju, the case has made a big progress."
Our work starts only now!
Our work?
I won't even have you on my Facebook friend list.
Enough!
We started this case to find the details of the dead man.
But this case has reached new heights now.
"If we are able to nab her,"
You will be in the limelight.
She is really a journalist.
"If we solve this case perfectly,"
The cover page of her magazine Vikatan will bear your photo.
This face?
Yuk has been disappeared.
We have reasons to believe that she was killed by Foon too.
We believe that our almighty God...
Cause his justice.
"This is a court, as well as a place God shows justice!"
He is really something.
Defence counsel.
"Your Honour, may I ask the jury few questions?"
What questions?
Very important questions.
Go ahead.
"If you think the accused is handsome, please raise your hands."
"If not, please raise your hands."
"If you think the accused is terribly ugly, please raise your hands."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the accused is ugly and poor, you can see how ugly looking he is."
How could he seduce the wife of the manager of a well-off family?
"Your Honour, objection!"
"Your Honour,"
I just want to prove the motive of killing... is actually ridiculous!
"Your Honour, the defence counsel is ridiculous and not practical!"
"Alright, be a bit practical."
"Lady, if the accused wants to court you, will you accept that?"
Of course not.
"If he gives you a thousand, can you stay with him for a night?"
Nuts!
Doesn't he think he can court me with a thousand only?
What a creep!
"Auntie, you should answer the question only."
Why did you scold me?
Who do you think you are?
You are a pervert!
You murderer!
"She's trying to get a divorce, but it's not working out so well."
I'm just curious.
Tell me the truth.
You saw everything.
There was no one.
Was there?
No.
Moonsook.
And did you hear my confession to you?
"Yes, I did."
"I know I'm hopeless, but I'm struggling with those bad images."
"And, I've got to write a script."
I'm using all my mental capacity.
This is something I realized a while back.
"And since I'm fighting with images again,"
I have more confidence in it now.
Look here.
Your actions now and my obsession with purity are all images.
We're repeating images imprinted on us by others.
Look at this.
Let's assume that this is the real thing.
This constantly changes and has infinite curves.
"Let's say, for example, here, here, here."
People keep focusing on these points.
"Then, there is an image that recurs."
Like so.
You having sex with foreigners.
Let this be the face of the woman having sex.
"And this, the image of his phallus."
"And this, the weird position you'd see in porn movies."
"When these three images form a set, it coincides with the existing bad image."
"Then, the real thing disappears and only the image remains."
"If I quench thee, thou flaming minister..."
"I can again thy former light restore, should I repent me:"
but once put out thy light... thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature...
I know not where is that Promethean heat that can thy light relume.
Balmy breath... that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword!
"One more, one more."
"Be thus when thou art dead... and I will kill thee, and love thee after."
"One more, and this the last:"
So sweet was ne'er so fatal.
I must weep... but they are cruel tears:
this sorrow's heavenly;
It strike where it doth love.
She wakes.
Who's there?
Othello?
Ay Desdemona.
"Will you come to bed, my lord?"
"- Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?"
"- Ay, my lord."
"If you bethink yourself of any crime... unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, solicit for it straight."
"Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?"
"Well, do it, and be brief;"
I will walk by:
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
No; heaven forefend!
I would not kill thy soul.
- Talk you of killing?
"- Ay, I do."
"- Then heaven, have mercy on me!"
"- Amen, with all my heart!"
"If you say, so, I hope you will not kill me."
And yet I fear you;
What?
Only 2 rafts?
The soldiers must have scared them off
You're so bold
"Brother Ting, I think this person... is the River Dragon of Jin"
You really know me
Quickly
Quickly
Come...
Let's go
These two hiding in burrow and trunk... are the villainous pair
"They, the River Dragon, Fire Demon Lui, ...and Golden Demon are Man Tiankuei's henchmen"
They are so-called Five great fighters
Golden Demon has been killed by me;
But Lui's fire bomb is the most difficult to deal with
After you met with hero Tseng... did you run into him?
The seven of us escaped to a village and ran into hero Tseng and his men
We were about to tell... hero Tseng what had happened... when Lui and Golden Demon came with their men
Hero Tseng
"Brother Gau, just the few of you?"
Where are all the others?
They were all killed
Somebody's here
Could it be...
Retreat...
We had been taken to jail and... following day sent over to the execution ground
They were all killed one by one
I never even dreamt that...
I could escape
They were all killed
That means... so many heroes have sacrificed their lives but still don't know where Prince Kang is confined
Not really.

What the hell are you thinking
Alternative is another bombing
"-We're talking 40-50 civilans, Plus reprisals against even more"
-Can't we take it on the way down?
"-Or after the ferry, out on the ocean?"
-I calculate most of them will get to shore.
-With minus degrees in the water?
-They have two life boats
-What if the ferry sinks before that?
Then they swim
And those who cant do it?

"In Indonesia, we're seeing fires being intentionally set in order to create palm oil plantations, which grow the cheapest vegetable oil in the world."
"It's in cooking oils, in processed foods, in your cosmetics, in your detergents."
This really cheap commodity is making companies tremendous profits.
DICAPRIO:
Just as far as you can see.
Rows of palm oil.
"They have destroyed so much of this forest, it's unbelievable."
DICAPRIO:
What a beauty!
DICAPRIO:
I can't even comprehend what these forests must have looked like.
Forests where rhino and elephant and orangutan would be populated into the thousands.
DR. SINGLETON:
These guys are a byproduct of the forest lost because of the palm oil industry.
"You know, they're effectively refugees from forests that no longer exist."
DICAPRIO:

Yeah!

"Not having an education, failing, are family traditions."
"I'm happy... that you have kept tradition alive, and indeed you're two steps ahead"

Have you thought this Uganda Yugandhar is dead?
Will you not inform me that my nephew is into coma till I call you?
"There is Facebook, Twitter, Skype and the latest WhatsApp calling."
"Will you still be there, when the technology is so developed?"
[SpeakingGibberish]
Why have you come back from Uganda leaving out the lands?
"What lands bro, you bought 1000 acres spending a lakh."
Added it is a great danger with those black fellows.
"They chase for even egg, bread and coriander like in Temple Run and kill it."
[SpeakingGibberish]
You drove me to Uganda to get relieved of me.
Then there Linda was stuck to me..
She does not know the difference between a keyboard and a remote.
[SpeakingGibberish]
What about you?
What are those engagements in that house when my nephew here is in coma?
Tell me..
"Instead of catching the guy beating my son, will you hit my brother?"
"Malini, listen to me."
Please!
Hello..
Sorry madam.
I dashed without noticing you.
"- It's fine, leave!"
"When I dashed her, why do you telling sir?"
"You tell me that, madam."
As you can see I don't know how we might help you.
"We investigate serious crimes, but your case does not seem to be in our department."
What do you mean?
I mean that your story resembles a case history to me.
I beg your pardon.
Thank you.
Isn't it too short?
Igor Alexandrovich?
I knew we would meet again!
It's a miracle!
God heard my prayers!
Here is a release certificate with signatures and stamps.
I'm a victim of arbitrariness!
That head doctor quarrelled with somebody.
Criminal proceedings were instigated against him and he got fired.
"Not only was I released,"
I was restored to my work place.
They'll even pay me my wages for the entire period of my absence.
I got so lucky!
So we were in the prison of the neighbouring region!
Let's go to the prosecutor!
I'll prove them that I'm not crazy!
What are you doing?
You won't prove anything to them.
You'll only create more problems for yourself and for me.
The man who ordered you locked up is very influential.
Illegal detention means nothing to them.
Do you exist in reality or not?
Don't surrender!
Don't surrender!
Despair and fear are the illness itself.
It's the madness!
After half a lifetime spent here... this land still remains alien to me:
And I to it
No one here knows me.
None except these doves.
Because they're like me
Neither do they belong to a country.
Just drop down where you find food
"Have your fill, then fly on"
When shall I fly?
I don't know.
"Of necessity, my wings are clipped"
I'm shackled to my bread.
But someday I'll surely go... to my land.
To my Punjab

- Good
Why is my little one giggling away?
- Mom!
Every day for 20 years...
Dad has been walking down the very same street... to his very same destination.
"Yet every day, you call him up... just to ask him, ""Have you reached?"""
- You won't understand
"They're the white Americans and black Americans,"
- Mexican and Italian Americans.
- [Woman Screaming]
"They're the great silent majority, and they have become angry, finally."
"Angry, notwith hate, butangry, my friends, because they love America... and they don't like what's happened to America these lastfouryears."
- [Cheering]
- Let us understand.
North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States.
Only Americans can do that!
[Cheering]
I say to you tonight...
[Clears Throat]
"I say to you tonightwe must have a newfeeling of responsibility, ofself-discipline."
We must look to renew state and local government.
"We must have a complete reform ofa big, bloated federal government."
- [Shouts]
- Those ofus in public service know... we can have full prosperity in peacetime.
"Yes, we can cut the defense budget."
"We can reduce, uh, conventional forces in Europe."
We can restore the natural environment.
We can improve health care and make it more available to all people.
"And yes, we can have a complete reform ofthis government."
We can have a new American revolution.

[Man] It'd be a disaster.
There's a lot ofsympathy out there forCambodia.
"Tiny, little, neutral Buddhist country."
"They'll be rioting in the streets, on yourfront lawn."
This is the next step in your treatment.
"You do trust me, don't you, Isabel?"
Good.
Nurse Oaks?
Please undo her gown.
Reorienting the body's humours is a difficult process.
We must begin with the most base reaction and work towards more complex emotions and cognitive arrangements.
We'll start with the most primitive of feelings:
pain.
- Ah!
"- Isabel, look at me."
"It's a long path, but by the end, you will find the freedom that you seek."
"You are a brave woman, aren't you?"
"You see, a woman like you has probably never felt real physical pain, have you?"
That... is a problem.
And... another.
God!
The mind is an incredible organ.
"The body's senses and send signals to the brain, but how the brain interprets those signals is a matter of great delicacy."
"More of an art than a science, I believe."
Most live their lives controlled by these impulses.
But you don't have to.
If we can rewire this most primitive instinct imagine what's possible.
Complete authority over one's own mind.
Limitless autonomy.
Absolute power.
We must strip away the last vestiges of your old self.
And only then will you know real empowerment.
Again.
Congratulations.
Welcome to the first day of your new life.
Come in.
I must go to the Mujinju base.
- Get ready.
"- Yes, sir."
You think the governor has time for the likes of you?
Get out of here right now!
Do you know who this is?
That's none of my business.
You can't set foot inside the base.
Leave at once!
What's the ruckus?
These men insist on meeting you.
What do you want?
"I am Kim Yang, the new governor of Mujinju."
New governor?
I haven't received any word from the imperial city.
The new governor has arrived?
"Yes, he has already inspected the troops, and is now taking over all official business."
Who is the new governor?
His name is Kim Yang.
Kim Yang...
Find out every detail about him.
"Yes, madam."
How could you have managed the finances so poorly?
The governor has been serving without pay.
You can't cover your incompetence with integrity.
"He has stepped down from his post, but he is still the former governor."
- Please show your respect.
- Stay out of this.
It is not easy to govern Mujinju.
We've been suffering from famine year after year.
We could hardly collect tax grains.
And we are exhausting a large portion of our budget to reinforce the navy in order to keep pirates away from our shores.
That could be a big mistake.
What do you mean?
"I mean, we just discovered a fucking time-traveling camera!"
We need to consider the possibilities.
"Well, one possibility is we've all been dosed with lethal amounts of radiation... that, you know, could've killed Mr."
"Okay, Negative Nancy, but what if we could use this thing?"
How?
"Remember how Mr. ""B"" took a photo of himself holding that sign?"
"What if we put up, like, the newspaper?"
We would know what happens in the future.
"Yeah, the newspaper, Jasper?"
What are you thinking?
Arts and Entertainment?
- Or are you thinking the race results?
- Oh.
"Well, what if?"
Think about how much money we could make.
"Callie, I foretell that tonight is your last night waiting tables."
"And instead, you can pursue writing full time."
Callie?
No!
Absolutely not!
We're calling the police.
"Finn, I foretell that you live the rest of your life in pathetic obscurity... and die penniless and insane."
"- I'm serious, Jasper."
- So am I.
Does it look like the cops are here?
That people are buzzing about the charred corpse in the storage unit?
Everything looks fine.
"If we reported it, we probably wouldn't have had the party anyway."
We'd have canceled it altogether.
"Uh, we can't cancel it."
Here are the possibilities...
The surface became mirrored and deflected the heat... or it put up some type of field that altered the direction of the attack.
"In any case, we need more data than what we have from Narita."
If only we had more samples...
But we should do what we can for now.
You're right.
Enough complaining.
Right!
Analyze!
Analyze!
"After all, that is our job."
I see you're on a 5-day rotation here.
Nothing shows up on eyeball sensor No. 50 and 60.
Special agent Fubuki has successfully infiltrated.
Accurate data of target interior will be transmitted.
"Each of you, confirm entry route."
The goal for this mission is to seize secrets of Agwarda.
Avoid combat action as much as possible.
Is there anything you value more than yourself?
If it's for the person I love...
I'd put up with anything.
Something I value...?
Enemy attack...
Where on earth did they come from?
We can't tell.
Nothing was picked up by the security cameras or sensors.
Emergency alert!
Estimate enemy's present location from the direction of attack and deploy Cross to intercept!
Roger!
What's the situation with Burst and Flail?
They're in the final stages of tune-up.
They'll need at least ten more minutes.
My ear stud has fallen in the tank
Will you take it out for me?
Is your stud in this tank?
"For your sake, I will jump into the sea also, just see"
I will not come without the stud
Is it stinking too much?
this is our house septic tank
Is it a septic tank?
"It is ok, after all it is our tank"
What a stink is this?
This is a trade secret
- Just like we sieve the gold sand I can get your stud
- Take it
Thank God!
This is the last bucket this must be seived thoroughly
Has the tank been cleaned?
Many thanks
"Yet to get your ear stud, why do you thank me now?"
-You have already taken it
-Which one?
- The sludge
- What about stud?
- Here it is
"Don't be upset, the drain was blocked for the last 1 0 days"
..the corporation guys asked for Rs 50
So I told you I have lost my ear stud But you are really fast
You have cleaned it Good boy!
Sinner
She has made me clean this sludge
"Come, what do you want?"
Want to check the voter's list Give us your ration card
"We are newly married, we don't have a card for us"
Give me a light.
Colonel... does that box really look like standard espionage gear?
A clever prop to lend authenticity to your cover.
A prop?
"That Ark is a priceless relic, you buffoon."
"In time of war, the penalty for spying is immediate execution."
What war?
This area is supposed to be protected by the U.N.
You are remarkably well-informed for one who claims not to be a spy.
I watch the news.
Then you will know that this region belongs to my people and we will take it.
Even if it means killing innocent people who happen to live here?
We must cleanse the area.
You're talking ethnic cleansing.
That's racial genocide.
"Look, pal, the whole world has been watching what's been going on around here."
"Now, you can call it whatever you want."
But it's murder.
Pure and simple.
"Exactly, now for the last time, we were sent by the Royal Academy of Archaeological Science in London, England."
You are already dead.
It is only a question of how you will die.
"Like men, with dignity, or screaming in agony."
"Either way, you will tell me who you are spying for."
Hey.
"Stop that, MacGyver."
Ah!
Leave him.
Leave him alone.
No.
Thank you for your knife.
This will make a great cigar box.
Take it
What are you doing?
"Don't go away, what are you doing?"
"Take it, you need money ls it not enough?"
"Everyone's coming to Hong Kong, how many can I take in"
"Go to 2nd fl. to wipe the windows,  you sweep on 3rd"
Uncle
You go to the fourth floor to clean the toilet
Uncle
Are you hiring someone?
Are you from the mainland?
Have you got an id card?
No?
This wouldn't do
This will make me an accomplice
You go to the fifth floor to clean up this thing
Look at you
Where have you been?
Look how dirty you are
You've got dirt and mud all over you
Let me clean you up
Look at you
"See, you've got mud on your face and your head"
You deserve a good beating
Ah Hung was on night shift last night and wasn't back until this morning
Don't go out if you don't have an id card I must go out to look for opportunities
Don't cause trouble when staying under others' roof
Welcome to our wonderful show and a warm welcome to our audience
"The last winner, Miss Cheng..."
Come...eat...
Make way
None of these competitors for Miss Hong Kong is pretty
- Are you not scared?
- No I am not
But your eyes doesn't reveal the courage of your lips
I am daily praying God for his well being
Nothing will happen to him My husband is with him
He will take care
-What?
-I want to know either of the two
- What is that two?
- Will you marry me or not?
When did I say I will marry you?
"Then is your dance, songs and talks with me a farce?"
- You can take it that way
- Sir..
Sir..
If you don't marry I will marry her and make her my wife
"Don't worry, I have 40 acres of ancestral property share"
I will transfer that to your name
Why did you marry that beggar in haste?
I am loving you dearly
- Really
- Yes
- Then swear on my head
- Not true
Dont feel for it If we give 1 0 Rs she will give it back
Have this 1 0Rs and give me the chain back
Is the sacred thread so cheap to you?
For each lady that is the protection I am a Tamilnadu beggar
Come and live with me
All of you come what happened?
He is trying to decieve me after marrying me
"After marrying,is he deceiving?"
"For the orc too late, brothers, we have come"
To witness that strange fight and but in vain.
"For the orc too late, brothers, we have come,"
But not for him who did the work profane;
"May so from heart to heart my fury spread,"
Which in the waves will doom the godless dead.
"I, islanders, your rout which threatens death,"
Have power to scatter at a single breath:
"I, Orlando, from head to foot, a skin"
More hard than diamond have.
A Paladin!
"The naked rock my boat presently nears,"
"Where she was placed, to feed the monster spread."
"I look, and known to me the dame appears,"
"And more appears, when nigher her I head:"
"Olympia she appears, and is indeed"
Olympia!
Angelica's not my meed.
"But I, naked, to the warrior say naught,"
Drop my head and to raise my eyes dare not.
"Speak, Olympia."
What evil destiny
You to this cruel island has conveyed
From where you in as much felicity
Were with Bireno left as could be said:
"Narrating all to you, I should exceed."
How my false spouse betrayed me as I lay
"Asleep, and how of pirates made the prize,"
They bore me from the desert isle away.
And now I deliver you from your chains.
Oberto comes;
"I'm Oberto, who reigns"
Seems uncle is still angry with us I will come later
Ok
Today I saw uncle The one in Rangoon?
", has he come?"
I saw your parents at the temple
Say Father in law Yes I should thank him really
Had he not admonished you will you have dragged me married me and brought me here?
"Even now you have married me, because he scolded you"
Have you ever said to me 'l love you '?
"If I don't love you, will I get biriyani for you?"
Biriyani?
I don't eat biriyani
Then have you forgotten those leg pieces?
"That was before marriage, now I have changed"
-Eat for my sake
- I can't
"I am telling you, come on eat"
God does not like atrocities Arul does not like dirty talks
Kanmani doesn't like if you boss over
What will you do?
Look at me and say that
What will you do?
Look at my eyes and say that?
What will you do?
"Sudaamani, you are blowing hot"
"Don't rage, you have become red"
"Sudaamani, you are blowing hot"
"Don't rage, you have become red"
You are threatening me like a rogue
Injuring my cheeks with your moushtache
"I will get you chicken Biriyani, come"
Don't eat like a glutton and sleep
"You,uh changed my life."
This song is for you.

And I do not know why you didn't let me just kick his ass.
I kinda had it coming.
You know what's great about being broken up with via rock song?
Via crappy rock song that didn't even rhyme.
You get all the information.
I feel totally debriefed.
I do not want you marrying a musician anyway.
"You think he's all rock star and in the end,he's just some bitter 50-year-old who still wears black jeans."
Does he know to make a wedding chain?
Wedding chain?
He knows all jobs

-Have you sold it  frittered the money?
Don't lie that you don't know about it
"-What can I say, if I don't know"
-You are capable of stealing  lying
To whom have you given the money?
Please don't talk dirty
What self esteem is there for a thief like you?
I am a thief and my hands are not clean
I don't want to do this goldsmith's job Hereafter I won't touch this gold
I stole the chain Had some problems at her house
Father will not give assistance so easily
You sinner He was blamed unnecessarily
- You inform dad first
"- No, wait mom"
If I am insulted that will be limited to me
If he is insulted then his whole family will be humiliated
Chang wu Ji was blessed to have this opportunity plus he has eaten the red frog that can enhance the circulation
So he not only acquired excellent martial arts skills but also cured the poison within him for 1 0 years
That deadly palm strike mark has also vanished
How come you're still here?
who are you?
It's me
You are the one who bit my hand
How's your hand?

"Okay, come on"
Tie the two of them together we'll deal with you when the other clans arrive

That's good to hear
I recall now
"I once met you over at wu Ching Niu, where's your wife?"
wife?
Right
"Oh, she ran away what?"
and invent new things.
The most reasonable humans are called scientists.
"Scientists congregate in research institutions, where they attend to organised reasonable activity."
A group of scientists are called a scientific team.
"Scientific teams commit discoveries, which bring benefit to the whole of mankind."
The highest form of reasonable activity on Earth is the scientific symposium.
They resolve the ill-effects of beneficial scientific work.
"Particular scientists are tagged with labels, so they don't get confused."
"The more scientific teams, the more life on Earth is better and more beautiful."
"If it continues like this, soon life on Earth will be absolutely perfect."
So that was our last greeting from Earth.
What could they be doing there at ours?
At home?
Nothing.
You know them.
-Doctor Yansky.
-Dear doctor.
-Our mission is complete.
-We are flying back.
You've provided priceless service to the idea of interspace cooperation.
-The whole galaxy is proud of you.
-Congratulations.
I...
One moment.
I also have to thank you.
"So thanks for everything, and see you later sometime."
"No, no ""see you later""."
I know that we caused you certain inconveniences.
But now it's the end of this.
We are going back home.
We are already fed up with you also.
Don't take it personally.
"Father, I do not know where my visions come from."
But he who appears to me day and night speaks to me of God and goodness and calls me to the life of virtue.
How can I not believe him?
Who is responsible for this?
Answer!
"Father, is my foes!"
"Come forth, dark spirit, father of lies, ancient serpent!"
Do not torment!
"We pronounce anathema upon you, we expel you, we curse you, we repudiate your deeds!"
Do not torment!
We prohibit you from this place.
"Get away, dark spirit, destroyer of bliss, criminal and sinful one!"
"Run, banned, humbled shamed, to far-off, arid deserts, to terrible regions, inaccessible to man!"
"And there, hiding and keeping a check on your pride, may you await the terrible day of the last judgment."
Stay in your place.
Hold them down!
"Get away, dark spirit..."
"Are you here, accursed sower of sedition?"
He is here!
"Is it you, spirit from Hell?"
Oh yes.
"Spirit of evil, do you have accomplices?"
He has!
Perhaps in Sister Renata?
"...get away from this cloister and never return, devilish dragon..."
Perhaps in Sister Renata?
Oh yes...
"Devilish spirit, leave this body."
"Away, rapacious wolf."
"Away, venomous scorpion!"
"By the power vested in me from above, I command you:"
Go hence!
Emergency treatment is being performed.
Okay.
"Even the Blue House has been briefed of this situation, so keep me updated down to the little details."
Got it.
"Blood pressure is 175/110, pulse is 100, and heart rate is 70."
"Blood pressure is high, pulse is fast and irregular, and he is drowsy."
This appears to be hypoglycemia.
It said in his chart that he has diabetes.
Do you think it's a problem with insulin?
Let's take care of that first.
Please get D50W (Dextrose 50% in water) started as IV.
Wait.
This is a prescription from the president's doctor.
Nitroglycerin?
A vasodilator?
Why?
"This patient is a diabetic, and he's having an adverse response to insulin, isn't he?"
I told you that the chart is not to be trusted.
"If you switch the diagnosis with the symptoms, it makes sense."
He's not having hypertension due to hypoglycemia.
He's having hypoglycemia due to problems with his heart.
Please give this to him.
His blood pressure is suddenly dropping too much.
Open the lines and give him IV fluids.
What's this?
Abdominal distension?
"Hey, what's going on?"
What's the situation?
Abdominal distension and drop in blood pressure?
Hemoperitoneum?
(Bleeding in the abdominal cavity)
He is bleeding into his abdominal cavity.
What would your gracious figure?
"Alas, he's mad!"
"Do you not come your tardy son to chide... that, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by..."
Th' important acting of your dread command?
"- O, say!"
- Do not forget.
This visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
"But look, amazement on thy mother sits."
"O, step between her and her fighting soul."
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her.
"- Ho is't with you, Lady?"
- How is't with you...
That you do bend your eye on vacancy...
And with th' incorporal air do hold discourse?
- Whereon do you look?
"- On him, on him."
Look you how pale he glares.
"His form and cause conjoined... preaching to stones, would make them capable."
"Do not look at me, lest with this piteous action you convert..."
My stern effects; then what I have to do will want true colour...
- tears perchance for blood.
- o whom do you speak this?
- Do you see nothing there?
- Nothing at all; yet all that I see.
- Nor did you nothing hear?
"- No, nothing but ourselves."
Look how it steals away.
"My father, in his habit as he lived."
"Look, even now as the leaves out the portal."
This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in.
"Katherine, when you send a broadcast you're sending out these numbers to the agents in the field to deliver specific assignments they cannot trust to normal communication lines."
Do you know what that means?
Fifteen broadcasts.
Fifteen assignments.
Unauthorized.
"Assassinations, bombings."
Could be anything.
Murders?
Gonna fix it.
"Here, what does it say?"
Can't read that.
"Agents in the field carry, like, one-time notebooks, like pads."
Each page is a new cypher.
"When you broadcast something, the agent matches up the first set of numbers to the page in the notebook."
"Now he knows he's using this page, and this page only, to decode the message."
"When he's done, he destroys the page."
So we send another broadcast to cancel this one.
Every cypher's a one-time deal.
Totally random.
Completely impossible to crack the code unless you have the original cypher.
That changes with every shift.
So we need the cypher?
"-Yes, we need that cypher."
-(crashing)
(indistinct conversations)
"As much as it seems like we're here to hurt you, to kill you, I assure you, both of you, that's the worst-case scenario."
Must have left the computer running.
-lt doesn't scare me.
-Shut the fuck up!
Back off!
Please.
Let me rephrase that.
We thank Mr. Joseph Vanyerka.
"This way, please."
"-Pray, because..."
-Just like a dumpster.
"-Please, the conference."
-Just like a big dumpster.
"Dear spectators, utilizing the international symposium and with live broadcasting from the Milton hotel scientists of world significance will answer your questions."
"Profesor Elington, please."
Thank you.
"This is a sample of rock originating from Mars, that the probe M356 just brought"
from this mysterious planet.
Bravo!
Will this piece of space stuff answer the question that has been bothering people for centuries?
So far we've been researching it in our laboratories.
Even the first results have brought some exciting prospects.
If we expose this sample to beams of the slightest intensity it will begin to warm intensively.
"Please, see for yourself."
Please.
-What are you drinking chairman?
"-Well, it's a medicine,"
I'm suffering from gall stones.
Seven billions... in the shit hole.
"Well, now we have another question."
Joseph Beysovec from Vamberka asks:
What do you think of dwarf stars?
"Professor Miller, please."
Dwarf stars are stars with a hormonal disorder.
In fact they are stars that didn't grow into the regular size.
"Also I can assure you, that in space most stars are precisely according to the norm."
-It's unheard of!
-On the contrary.
Bravo.
"Why not just go for the kill in the beginning, just knock him out, first round?"
The fancy embraced sporting enthusiasts from all classes of society.
"The Regent himself was a devotee, but so were servants and even highwaymen."
Fantastic.
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
The Regency was an age of gambling mania.
Gentlemen risked vast fortunes and dismissed their losses with an attitude bordering on the cavalier.
Five... five...
I'll take the first blood.
"That's it, I'm closing this book."
"Gentlemen of the fancy, the first fighter to make his appearance..."
Bruiser!
Bruiser!
Will be your local hero and champion...

HEAD WITH THE ARM
"Artist's imagination, full of faces, seeks the release."
"Series of portraits is being made: ""Wawel's heads""."
It's a tribute to great traditions of Polish renaissance.
Tribute from a modern artist.
Years passed by bringing new works of art.
"""Four Evangelists"" Writing down events and thoughts patiently and laboriously like folk chroniclers."
Artist's imagination is inexhaustible.
Dunikowski keeps searching for new ideas.
Some of them are surprising.
"""I walk in the sun"" - it's the name of the self-portrait of the one whose hands arouse human life and feelings from the stones."
PREGNANT WOMEN
CARTHAGINIAN WOMEN
There aren't many sculptors who are as skilled in making monuments as Dunikowski.
After the war the artist made monumental works like:
"""A monument of gratitude for Red Army"" in Olsztyn"
"""A monument of uprising action"" at the St. Anna's Mountain."
"Raw shapes, full of peace and dignity, embrace eternal glory of the heroes."
"We greatly appreciate your works of art, our tireless artist!"
Many stones are still waiting for you to bring to life beauty hidden inside them.
...always cheerful...
...to the cheerfulness..
Happy New Year!
"Well, what gives, little lady?"
"Always cheerful, always cheerful..."
To the cheerfulness...
Happy New Year.

Lord Muruga in Maruthamalai Hasn't it reached your ears yet?
Shut up your mouth
My husband has become mad Is he a human being?
"At the drop of a hat, he smacks me"
He fears no one other than you

"Whoever it may be, tear into two"
"Tear apart to two in one strike, that is our style"
Why do you buy meals from outside?
Is your wife not at home?
I don't want food if I have to forego my esteem
Seems sister in law has come
Where will she.....?
Hold it
Do you want to leave your sister at home?
Here is the key
It was not intentional You know about your sister
She has got a mouth bigger than this factory
I slightly patted over her mouth and that's all
I will go home at 5'o'clock
Look at his face
I won't touch her again
Come home I will teach you
You were talking like a tiger
Cooled down like a wet mouse when you saw your brother-in-law
Then what to do
- At the age of 1 2 he made a plot to revenge me
- How was it?
One day I scolded his sister
Keeping that in mind
You've been hanging around too long.
Those hats of yours...
Quick!
Mi?
"ka, please don't let anyone..."
"Be careful, there are all kinds of greedy tomcats there."
And don't take any...
"A flower like that only flowers once, don't let it be easily picked."

Somewhere in North Hungary there is a little village between pinewood and behind the beyond.
Far from everything.
Its air is clear and with ozone rich
Many tourists and vacationists visit to who the local population give out a room into rent a weekly.
"Lived in this village where silence and peacefulness reigned  and for example conflagration did not ravage since long years, his was called Tót Lajos."
Everybody first greeted him because it was surrounded by general respect  if he went along the high street.
Because he friendly natured one and majestical one was his authority.
He was sit on the head of table on weddings
The population turned to him for a council.
And death cases the coroner was called if he said his judgement already only.
Suffered poor.

You all will get punishment.
I have arranged proofs for you in 3 years
"Oh, fuck it."
I should have this figured out by now.
"Well, thank you for listening to the sentimental, and frustrated, ramblings of an old man."
You've done a lot for me.
I didn't do much.
No.
But your work did.
That's true.

I wonder what type of style we should be working on for these exercises.
I'm not sure I can answer that question.
"In fact, I'm certain I cannot."
I don't have a very academic relationship with form or style.
So...
What is your advice?
"The best thing I can offer is what I do, which is to kinda goof around until you find what works."
"Besides, in my experience, more than half of you will probably abandon writing, creative or the other kind, very shortly after graduating."
If you haven't already.
Lighter.
- Good.
"Be warned, you may experience unusually vivid dreams as a side effect of the medication."
- All right.
- You get some rest.
We'll begin our first session tomorrow.
Drink.
Please describe your... affliction.
"- Ever since my parents' accident, their passing I've had anxiety..."
- Mm-hmm.
...insomnia.
Uh... my doctor thinks...
- Dr. Torrington.
"- Yes, sir."
"He feels that my afflictions were not mere products of my grief, but manifestations of more latent maladies."
This is why he felt I would benefit from your care.
- And which latent maladies did he identify?
"- I have often been called wilful, overly curious."
I'm told that my flights of fancy are not becoming of a lady.
"These character flaws, he believes have evolved into my current difficulties."
- And what do you think of the doctor's assertion?
- My brother has always said that...
- I don't care what your brother thinks.
What do you think?
- I want to be a good daughter and a good sister.
I do.
But I cannot accept curiosity as a mark against my character.
And isn't imagination the sign of an active intellect?
"I know too much independence is not becoming of a lady, but it just..."
"- There is nothing wrong with you, Isabel."
You are independent.
"It is your nature, not a malady."
This part of the ship has been sealed off:
Admiral's orders:
"Yes, well, we're not exactly sure that the admiral is in complete control of his faculties, so if you'll just..."
"If you come any further, I'm gonna have to use this, sir:"
Huh:
"Cowan, what are you doing out of the brig?"
Let's go:
What's the meaning of this?
"Drop the weapon, Hawk:"
Drop it this instant:
"Now, what happened here, James?"
"Captain Rogers refused to obey my order to halt, sir:"
I told him you'd ordered this part of the ship sealed off:
"Do you have an explanation, Captain, for deliberate disobedience to one of my orders?"
"Admiral, somewhere down on that planet..."
I see:
"Apparently, whatever is causing the mutinous behavior amongst the crew: : :"
"Has affected you as well, Captain, and both of you:"
Disarm them:
Escort them to Captain Rogers's cabin:
See that they remain there until further orders:
We could have overcome the guards:
I know:
I thought about that myself:
I just thought we needed some time to decide:
"Buck, what is it?"
"Your cabins and mine, they're identical, aren't they?"
"Yes, except for the furnishings:"
I see it:
Yes:
The viewport is off center:
"The viewport's changed, but take a look outside:"
Flying light as a butterfly
Kicking hard as the top star!
Shi Zhengzong has led the young one astray
Even if you study with him all your life
All you'll learn is fancy boxing somekicks
"Brother Jin, can I learn from you?"
You want to betray your school?
Not really.
Betraying one's own school is a serious violation in martial arts
I don't want to be called a traitor!
You do have a character
Character?
If I had that...
I won't stay under their roof and be bullied!
"You really wish to learn from me, huh?"
"Of course, but then I don't want to be a traitor"
That's easy.
I'll teach you discreetly
Nobody will know
"Brother Jin, when can we start?"
Starting from tomorrow
T omorrow I'll show you what real martial arts is
Boxing has four types
"Fist, Palm, Claw and Hook."
These are founded on
"Four bases : kick, strike, wrestle and hold"
There're 3 don'ts when practicing boxing
"Don't act on impulse, don't rush, don't be vain"
Impulsive will break the energy;
Vanity will loosen the energy
By being hasty you'll have a sloppy potential
"Boxing is also about coordination of... the eye, the body and the hand"
I decided to come up with more then maybe I'll too
"I mean, ground slogan"
I want to learn more then this is the one we have now
Future happiness straight to you
hey can I ask you something?
nice work nice work
it's good yes
they are really close
I think about it what?
working like this all by myself or being with someone else like that
on a night like this drinking wine from the year I was born
which is more happy?
well we'll meet together upstairs
then I'll change and... yea
oh what's up?
uh... how much does this cost?
Tanaka mizuho you finally called
sorry for e-mailing you multiple times
I only could e-mail at work
I heard my husband called you
weren't you surprised?
but were you ok?
it was bothering me it was hard we fought a lot and screamed at each other crying and screaming adults
but now it's ok
Satoshi become a good guy
when you say good guy you mean a guy acting as a girl wants
a real good guy for a long time is able to face one girl
so you face her too
show your real self
Fujii-san
Ishida Yuya what are you doing?
nothing wine?
Are you insane?
What have I done?
They're going to drown.
They're innocent.
Innocent.

ORLANDO ENRAGED
THIRD PART
"Olympia married Bireno, after Orlando saved him from Cymosco's clutches, but the vicissitudes of the poor countess are not finished."
"Her newly wedded husband leaves her and flees with the very young daughter of the killed king, who had become his spoil of war."
There lies Olympia safe in greenwood shade
"Removed from noise, and for her tranquil breast"
(Knowing her lover was beside her laid)
"No further thoughts, no further cares molest,"
"Olympia laps in slumber so profound,"
No sheltered bear or dormouse sleeps more sound.
"Thus in silence, without a cry we flee."
Let us both loosen thence and put to sea.
Now from her gilded wheels the frosty rhine
Aurora upon earth beneath has flung;
"And the old woe, beside the tumbling brine,"
"Lamenting, halcyons mournful descant sung;"
"When I, 'twixt sleep and waking, ... make a strain,"
"To reach my loved Bireno, ... but in vain."
I no one find: and then my arm recall;
"I try again, yet no one find;"
I spread
"Both arms, now here, now there, and seek at all;"
Now either leg; but yet nothing instead.
Alone in bed;
I ope my eyes: in view
T o learn about the essence of close range
You've to practice hard
How?
I'll tell you later!
Have you learnt the rules of sword by heart?
Getting' there.
I've been studying whole night
"Starting tomorrow, I'll teach you the way of sword"
Sword is listed the top of all short weapons
It has two blades and a ridge in the middle
The blade will break if hit by hard material
The essence of sword is at the edge
So all attention is being put there
The art of sword is also based on that
The perfect use of sword hilt
Is not only an art by itself
But can also be used to confuse the enemy's vision
It helps in your attack
"Brother Jin, how come these tiles are so hard to break?"
Because you're not concentrating enough
Just watch!
"First clear your mind,"
and concentrate
"Brother Jin, you're amazing!"
"Remember, more haste makes for less speed otherwise it could cause you injury and can turn you into a moron"
Thanks for your teaching!
"Brother Jin, you haven't recovered yet"
"And we ran out of money, what should we do?"
"Don't worry, the fortune teller said"
I can live up to ninety years
Is it true?
How do I know?
She'll take good care of the princess
She'll teach her our language step by step
But she doesn't want to learn
Make sure nothing is missing for her comfort
Your Majesty
You know the traditions of European palaces are a little different
The princess struggles to eat on the floor
Have a table made immediately
There should be blue tiles on it
The best of the masters will do it in my palace
As you order your Majesty
"Your Majesty, Our Valide Sultana wants to visit you"
May she come to my room
"When you are thirsty you shall say "" su istiyorum """
I won't learn a single word in Turkish
Don't bother
At least learn the important words.
Perhaps you may like it later
What's your name?
Angela
"In Turkish it is ""melek"""
"If I don't teach you Turkish, Sümbül Ağa would be very angry at me, Signora"
If you want I can take you with me while leaving
You can escape with me
I'm happy here in the palace
We are well cared in the harem
Education is good too aswell
"I like my Sultanas, I respect them"
"My mother, how are you?"
My lion
I'm fine
It should be important since you visit me at this time
That is true
I'm glad I met you Bebi
I've learned a lot about life listening to your sorry stories
Doesn't that mean you're passing down wisdom to the next generation?
Maybe it's a sense of self-sacrifice
Maybe Bebi will become a role model for future Japanese
You think so?
Maybe that hunting was sort of a prophecy
Grandpa used to say this when me and Lin got bullied
One gets bullied because they have something special
"Bebi, I'm sure you have something special, too"
Really?
Yes
A nonchalant spearing soul
A spearing soul?
Yes
"Bebi, you are an absolute gross Otaku."
You proudly wear disgusting fashion
There is no doubt that you are a gross Otaku
Lin and I are still somewhat concerned with our fashion
Even when we aren't so interested
"But Bebi, you aren't like that"
You aren't concerned with social norms
You don't even mind your body odor
Actually you should mind that
"Anyways, you have a spearing soul"
A spearing soul isn't really helping me
The number of Otaku girls is increasing
"Recently at the cafeteria, I saw two girls going..."
"""I stayed up watching anime all night, I'm such an Otaku"""
"""Me too!"""
Bon...
Mercy
Stop fighting...
Stop fighting...
Deadly Finger
Shadow Finger who are you?
"I am Yuen Chun, before I became a monk"
I was called Shing Kwun
Shing Kwun
I am the cousin of the Master's wife we were in love at the beginning but her parents married her to your Chief for money
Because of this
I've sworn to try my best to destroy the Ming Cult
I manipulated the fiery temper of my student Tse Shun
I raped and killed his wife and daughter
I used him to fight against the martial arts world
As a result the six mighty clans are attacking Summit Guang Ming today
Although we are seriously wounded
I still have strength left... to give the last blow
"Now, let's see who recovers first will win this fight, or we'll die altogether"
"Little brother, maybe you have to give some help to the Ming Cult"
Little brother?
I've brought a person in my bag
You can't tear it open
Jump slowly
"Alright, tell me where he is"
I Chang wu Ji have to avenge for my father's death what?
Chang wu Ji
"He's five steps from your left, hop over"
One
Two
Three
"Four, five"
"That villain is right in front of you, fight him"
The second round begins
After Ah Mut Sha delivers a swift left leg sweep... both lash out at each other
Kong is hit
Now he starts his attack
"Ah Mut Sha is hit, the attack is ferocious"
Ah Mut Sha delivers a right punch
Kong Yuen Sang falls
Kong is determined to win
Ah Mut Sha realises his weakness of being too rash
Don't get up so fast
Wait until he counts to seven
Kong wants to get up
He's up
"Once he gets up, Kong retaliates"
"Good, two punches lt seems that both are stalling"
Kong rushes over and holds him
Ah Mut Sha has been under attack with sheer force Kong forces him to the ground
Kong presses him down
You stupid fool I told you to hit his head but you keep hitting his body
There's no point hitting his body I did
Be careful of his elbow
You've messed up the tactics
Did you know that you've lost this round?
Don't be so hasty
He can't beat you
Don't be afraid.
Fight on
Fight harder
"Fight yourself lt's right to fight like this, keep it this way"
You should pass out in the next round
Shut up
Remember what I've said
Anderson:
"We met with residents of north aceh,"
One of the areas most affected by deforestation.
"When we drove here, we passed lots of palm oil plantations."
Did all of that area used to look like this rainforest?
(speaking foreign language)
Anderson:
They said that they've already started resisting
And took me to see an excavatr that had been stolen
From one of the palm oil companies.
They've admitted that they confiscated one of these
"As a tactic to try and discourage the company,"
But no one is admitting who set this one on fire.
"But clearly the message is that if this continues,"
Then things like this are just a taste of what's to come.
(man speaking foreign language)
Anderson:
"Elsewhere in sumatra,"
Other people have also started taking matters into their hands.
"Rudi putra, a biologist by trade,"
"Leads a campaign to dismantle illegal palm oil plantations,"
Even if he has to do it tree by tree.
(putra speaking english)
Anderson:
"All rudi is doing is enforcing the law,"
But he still needs the protection of local policemen while he works.
Humans aren't the only ones affected by the destruction of the forests.
"Once abundant, many species of wildlife now face extinction."
(air rifle poofs)
(speaking foreign language)
(people speaking foreign language)
(people speaking foreign language)
(We go hunting in the mountains)
(We share food in our clan)
(We fetch water from the creeks)
(I'm willing to give my life for these)
"(Oh, creek!"
Be quiet)
(Sisin babblers are singing)
(Sing us a beautiful song please)
(Sing for our people)
(a song of our ancestral spirit)
(I'm willing to give my life too)
(When the lightening rifts the rock)
(a rainbow appears)
(and a proud man emerges)
(Who is this man so proud?
)
(It's your offspring)
(A Seediq Bale)
What?
Tado Mouna became a hero before I did
Those Japanese are outrageous
I can't believe they beat up someone who offers them a drink
A while ago... three girls from Boarung Clan were asked to serve them drinks and they were raped
Why couldn't Tado be a real hero and kill Yoshimura right on the spot?
Kill him?
Don't you remember how my family died?
My father killed only one Japanese man and they burned my whole family alive
I was hiding in the woods watching without even blinking my eyes
So... that's why we can't kill only one Japanese man
We have to kill all of them to make a difference
Are you kidding me?
We wouldn't still be sitting here if we could kill them all
"- Bring it yourself, Suad"
"Of course, Mr Selim"
In the name of God
- Is this your daughter?
- My daughter!
"She's an employee, my daughter is still in prep school"
"In the name of God, she must be your secretary"
"We don't have secretaries and all that, Hajj"
- Mrs Suad is very energetic
- She's a Mrs?
"And she has a boy about 6 or 7 years old her husband went to work in Iraq, He died there"
- God rest his soul
- I've no idea how he died
"= Here you go, Hajj A'azam"
- Thank you very much
I'll go make your coffee myself
- But with very little sugar
- At your service
"What is it, Hajj?"
There are pretty faces that give you a feeling of comfort
She looks decent
"You have a high average,"
Why'd you choose the police academy over other colleges?
"- To serve my country, sir"
- Even the engineering graduate...
- can serve his country
"- Of course, sir but if everyone serves in his field, his service will be better"
"Good, what are the characteristics of a good police officer?"
"Discipline, a sense of justice, determination, honor and above all, he must be humane in all his actions"
What does your father do?
"He's an employee, sir"

"If you love me, let him stay here a night more please!"
"934 01:16:47,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:50,900 You will come without being late, right?"
"935 01:16:50,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:56,500 Your guest can come too, please!"
"By the way, I am Mira."
Hello!
"936 01:16:56,512 --&amp;gt; 01:16:57,759 Hello."
"937 01:16:57,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:01,400 Mrs. Nevin, Yaman's mom"
"938 01:17:02,500 --&amp;gt; 01:17:07,600 Is that so?"
Very pleased to meet you.- Me too.
"939 01:17:07,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:13,500 What a beautiful name you have, just like you... 940 01:17:13,600 --&amp;gt; 01:17:15,273 Thank you.- Mira!"
"941 01:17:15,300 --&amp;gt; 01:17:19,100 Come on Safari, sweet."
"Err he escaped again 942 01:17:19,200 --&amp;gt; 01:17:23,400 I came to see where were you but... 943 01:17:23,500 --&amp;gt; 01:17:27,500 I see that the problem still continues here ."
"944 01:17:30,504 --&amp;gt; 01:17:37,199 No, the problem isn't continuing."
To the contrary we're celebrating that we returned from a mistake dear Sude.
"945 01:17:39,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:45,900 Don't worry, we will be at the fair together with our guests a little after"
"946 01:17:48,100 --&amp;gt; 01:17:49,516 What fair?"
"947 01:17:49,516 --&amp;gt; 01:17:54,980 The foundation where my wife's dad is president is celebrating his 80th anniversary."
"948 01:17:54,980 --&amp;gt; 01:17:57,890 and tonight there is an aid night."
Everyone will be there.
"949 01:17:57,890 --&amp;gt; 01:18:02,000 I assume Mr. Asim will come too..- Of course he will be there too."
"950 01:18:02,060 --&amp;gt; 01:18:04,230 Wonderful .. 951 01:18:04,501 --&amp;gt; 01:18:07,827 We go get ready.."
"952 01:18:10,600 --&amp;gt; 01:18:14,900 Okay, then we are expecting you.. 953 01:18:15,600 --&amp;gt; 01:18:20,000 Come on ,Mira .- See you."
"954 01:18:22,240 --&amp;gt; 01:18:25,568 What happened?"
-We will talk with you later!
"955 01:18:27,800 --&amp;gt; 01:18:30,889 Come on, show your mom the room, I will take a shower 956 01:18:30,900 --&amp;gt; 01:18:33,500 No Mert , we are leaving.-Dad !"
"957 01:18:33,700 --&amp;gt; 01:18:36,334 Mr. Selim ,really we need to leave."
"958 01:18:36,334 --&amp;gt; 01:18:39,800 But look, if you go like this it will be like escaping as guilty, 959 01:18:39,915 --&amp;gt; 01:18:44,962 but if we go there as a whole family, all of us they will understand that all accuses are lies, 960 01:18:45,000 --&amp;gt; 01:18:48,100 and those who were up to something behind your back will be up a gum tree(surprised)."
"961 01:18:50,588 --&amp;gt; 01:18:55,066 If I were you I wouldn't let Mert down.- I love you."
So that's the picture for a two by two system.
"And if the right-hand side B happened to be twelve seven,"
then of course the correct solution would be one two.
Okay.
"So let me come back next time to a systematic way,"
"using elimination, to find the solution, if there is one,"
"to a system of any size and find out -- because if elimination fails,"
find out when there isn't a solution.
"Okay, thanks."

So we're going to add 5 again and get to 16.
Let's do 4 just for good measure.
"So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5 gets us to 21."
"Now, I want to think about, can we, using this pattern, figure out how many toothpicks it would take for us to, say, make 50 of these townhouses or even 500 of these townhouses, or even 5,000 of them?"
Now we just have to look at this pattern here and see can we come up with an equation for each of these actual values?
"So, for example, we see a pattern that-- well, we already recognize that we started with 6, and we're adding 5 every time we add a house."
"So when you add the second house, you add 5 once."
"The third house, you start with 6, and you add 5 twice."
"The fourth house, you start with 6 and you add 5 three times."
So let's actually write that down.
"So 21 is equal to-- you start with 6, you start with this 6 here, and then you add 5 three times, plus 5 times 3."
"When you had the 3 houses, once again, you started with 6 and you added 5 two times."
Let me do that same color.
And you added 5 two times.
Plus 5 times 2.
"When you had 2 houses, you started with 6 again."
"This is equal to 6 and you added 5 once, so plus 5 times 1."
"And then when you had 1 house-- and it'll fit the same pattern-- you started with 6, and how many times did you add 5?"
"Well, you didn't add 5."
You could say that you added 5 zero times.
So you might see a little pattern here.
"However many houses you needed, you take one less than that and multiply it by 5, add that to 6, and you get the number of toothpicks."
"And actually, let me rewrite this."
So I could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 4 minus 1.
I could write this as 6 plus 5 times 3 minus 1.
You could write this as 6 plus 5 times 2 minus 1.
You could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 1 minus 1.
And maybe that makes a pattern a little bit clearer.
This 4 is right over here.
This 3 is right over here.
This 2 is right over here.
I'm going to have to get my calculator out.
So it's going to be 1 minus 4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2 squared plus 3 minus 4.2 squared plus 8 minus 4.2 squared plus 7 minus 4.2 squared.
And it's going to be all of that-- I know it looks a little bit funny-- divided by the number of data points we have-- divided by 5.
So let me take the calculator out.
All right.
Here we go.
Actually maybe I should have used the graphing calculator that I have.
Let me see if I can get this thing-- if I could get this.
There you go.
"Yeah, I think the graphing one will be better because"
I can see everything that I'm writing.
"OK, so let me clear this."
"So I want to take 1 minus 4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2 squared plus 3 minus 4.2 squared plus 8 minus 4.2 squared, where I'm just taking the sum of the squared distances from the mean squared, one more, plus 7 minus 4.2 squared."
So that's the sum.
The sum is 38.8.
So the numerator is going to be equal to 38.8 divided by 5.
"So this is the sum of the squared distances, right?"
Each of these-- just so you can relate to the formula-- each of that is xi minus the mean squared.
And so if we take the sum of all of them-- this numerator is the sum of each of the xi minus the mean squared from i equals 1 to n.
And that ended up to be 38.8.
And I just calculated like that.
"I just took each to the data points minus the mean squared, add them all up, and I got 38.8."
And I went and divided by n which is 5.
So this n up here is actually also 5.
Right?
And so 38.8 divided by 5 is 7.76.
So the variance-- let me scroll down a little bit-- the variance is equal to 7.76.
"Now if this was a sample of a larger distribution, if this was a sample-- if the 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7, weren't the population-- if it was a sample from a larger population, instead of dividing by 5 we would have divided by 4."
"And we would have gotten the variance as 38.8 divided by n minus 1, which is divided by 4."
So then we would have gotten the variance-- we would have gotten the sample variance 9.7 if you divided by n minus 1 instead of n.
"But anyway, don't worry about that right now."
That's just a change of n.
"So let's see, this is time 0, this is 5 seconds."
"So if we look at the hare's position after 5 seconds, so after time equals 5 seconds, it does indeed look like the hare's position-- the hare is just sitting there at the 90-foot marker line and is not moving at all."
The rate of change of position with respect to time for the hare at that point is 0.
"So this does seem true, it just doesn't apply to the question."
It's not the meaning of the rate of change of T of t on this interval.
This is applying to H of t.
The hare runs at a speed of 18 feet per second for the first 5 seconds.
So let's see if this is true.
"For the first 5 seconds, so this is 5 seconds going by, the hare is able to cover a distance of 90 feet."
"So the hare is able to go 90 feet in 5 seconds, so for the first 5 seconds, the hare is-- hare's rate is 90 feet."
You could say average rate of change is 90 feet in 5 seconds.
And 90 divided by 5 is indeed 18 feet per second.
"So once again, this third statement is true, it just doesn't apply to T of t."
It's not addressing the question.
Now this fourth choice is that the hare wins the race.
"Now, winning the race, they have to get to 100 feet in the shortest amount of time."
This is 100 feet right over here.
So let's see.
So it looks like only the tortoise even gets to that point.
"At 20 seconds, the tortoise gets to the 100-foot mark."
The hare is still hanging around taking a nap or something at 90 feet.
So this is actually outright false.
The tortoise wins the race.
So we will definitely go with our first choice.
"Fred:Hey, it's Fred, and today's May Day."
"Yay, May Day!"
"So, yeah I'm gonna deliver everyone in my whole entire neighborhood May baskets."
Full of love and happiness.
"I don't know if you already realised this, but, my mom got me a ""Fred"" shirt."
"She said that we can't afford to get a lot of shirts, so, I'm just gonna wear this shirt for the rest of my life."
"No offense to you guys who have a ton of shirts, but, it's more cool just to have one shirt."
I hope I didn't offend anybody.
"And when I add them, I get 0."
"That must mean that a plus minus b is equal to 0, or that a is equal to b, that we're dealing with the same number."
"We're essentially dealing with the same number, the negatives of each other."
So what can it be?
"Well, if we're doing the same number and they're negatives of each other, 64 is exactly 8 squared."
"But it's negative 64, so maybe we're dealing with one negative 8, and we're dealing with one positive 8."
"And if we add those two together, we do indeed get to 0."
So this will be x minus 8 times x plus 8.
Now you don't always have to go through this process I did here.
"You might already remember that if I have a plus b times a minus b, that that's equal to a squared minus b squared."
"So if you see something that fits the pattern, a squared minus b squared, you could immediately say, oh, that's going to be a plus b-- a is x, b is 8-- times a minus b."
Let's do a couple more of just general problems.
I won't tell you what type these are going to be.
Let me switch colors.
It's getting monotonous.
Let's say we have x squared minus 24x plus 144 is equal to 0.
"Well, 144 is conspicuously 12 squared."
And this is conspicuously 2 times negative 12.
Or this is conspicuously negative 12 squared.
So this is negative 12 times negative 12.
This is negative 12 plus negative 12.
"So this expression can be rewritten as x minus 12 times x minus 12, or x minus 12 squared."
We're going to set that equal to 0.
This is going to be 0 when x minus 12 is equal to 0.
"You can say either of these could be equal to 0, but they're the same thing."
Add 12 to both sides of that equation and you get x is equal to 12.
"And I just realized, this problem up here, I factored it, but I didn't actually solve the equation."
So this has to be equal to 0.
Let's take a step back to this equation up here.
And the only way that this thing over here will be 0 is if either x minus 8 is equal to 0 or x plus 8 is equal to 0.
So add 8 to both sides of this.
You get x could be equal to 8.
They can't be p.
They only get as high as p minus 1.
This is not an option.
"So the only possibility, if a is equal to 0, for the determinant of capital A to still be divisible by p, is for bc to be equal to 0."
So let's think about how many possibilities there are over here.
So let's think about all of the combinations.
"So there's the one situation, where b and c are equal to 0. b and c is equal to 0."
Now let's think about the other ones.
There's one where b is equal to 0 and c isn't. bc will still equal 0 in this situation.
So how many possibilities are there?
How many possibilities are there for this?
"Well, b is equal to 0."
"C over here can be any value, although we've already considered the case where c is equal to 0."
"So it could be any value so that we don't double count, any value where c does not equal 0."
So it could be 1 through p minus 1.
"Or another way to think about it, there's p minus 1 possibilities."
Now let's think about c is equal to 0 and b isn't.
"Well, exact same logic."
"Once again, we don't want to double count that they're both being equal to 0."
So let me write it.
"And c isn't-- well, we're saying it isn't 0, so we are actually already putting that constraint there."
So it has p minus 1 possibilities.
So how many total possibilities do we have where the determinant of A is equal to 0 and a is equal to 0?
So we have one here.
"We have one possibility here, then p minus 1 and p minus 1."
"So our total possibilities are p minus 1 plus p minus 1 plus 1, which is 2p minus 2 plus 1, which is 2p minus 1."
2p minus 1 incremental possibilities when a is equal to 0 for the determinant of A to be divisible by p.
So that's what we just got in this video.
"In the last video, we had p minus 1 squared possibility when a does not equal 0."
"So if we want the total number of A's, where the determinant of A is divisible by 0, we can add the number that we got in the last video to the number we just got."
So let's do that.
"So if I were to rewrite this over here, this is equal to p squared minus 2p plus 1."
"At 877 pounds, he is CRlMINALLY light for his size."
"Take a look at a real blue whale, which can grow to be up to twice as long as a Wailord."
"They weigh around 150-170 metric tons. or something around 350,000 pounds."
The difference in weight is so astronomical that it's absurd!
"In fact, at that weight and that height, if you estimate Wailord's volume with around a 20 by 48 foot cylinder,"
Wailord is actually less dense than air.
"Like, he'd float! in the Air!"
Like a Blimp! and that's when you realize
Wailord's the- the what?
The FLOAT whale pokémon.
AUGHHHHHHHHHHHH!
The official pokédex is a strange one and it usually crushes my dreams every time I learn about a pokémon's true size.
I might not ever be able to ride a Charizard but it's okay bec-. . .(begins sobbing) who am I kidding?
T n T (sniffles) This isn't okay at all!
I hate my life!
Thanks for watching today's video.
I encourage you: find your favorite pokémon in the pokédex and find out exactly how long they are and what they're weight is.
"I guarantee, 9 times out of 10 you'll be surprised."
Let me know in the comments section below if one of your favorite pokémon was a size you NEVER would have expected.

"We headed to one of the Quran Institues here in chechnya, and Indeed I was amazed from what I've seen"
Its as though the Dream is now Reality.
"Before I came to chechnya, I was told that they focus so much on their Quran [especially the kids]"
"But when I came here, I found their Institutes to be very different from the other Institutes."
Some of you may think that I am standing in a Random Public Garden or a park.
"No By Allah, I am standing in a park that belongs to Quran Institue"
A very distinguished Institute that has many things to help the students to memorize the Quran.
I wish that this dream comes to reality back in my country and in other countries as well.
"The dream of this great concern about the Book of Allah here in Chechnya, Come with me to check it out"
"This institute... has special Rooms for Their students a classes that fits their schedule well, and a Cafeteria that provides their daily meals."
"And they have a Masjid of their own, along with a wide green field, for the students to enjoy their break time"
"But Truly, the most Beautiful thing we found in this institute.."
"Is the Organized system of the institute, along with its discipline from the Hufadh of the Book of Allah Swt."
Who can start reciting for us a portion of what they have memorized from the Quran?
"MashaAllah TabarakAllah, Do you listen to Shaykh Abu Bakr Al Shatri?"
"-Yes he does -MashaAllah, May Allah make you"
-..become like Shaykh Abu Bakir al Shatri.
Congratulation to AbuBakr for having
-.. the kids of chechnya listening to him.
May This is all be found in his scale of good deeds
Institute of Shaykh Zayid - Chechnya.
while I was walking around the institute.. here in Chechnya
"The insititute of Shaykh Zayid for Quran Memorization and while I was listening to their beautiful recitation, I met a boy named Ikhwaan"
It was said to me that this young boy is 12 years old and has the Quran Memorized.
"MashaAllah Shaykh Adam, When did ikhwaan start memorizing the Quran? - he started memorizing as soon as we opened up this Institute which was 8months ago."
- He started memorizing 8 months ago? - yes he did.
"MashaAllah Tabarak AlRahman, he memorized the Quran only in 8months! honestly I am a little shocked because he doesn't speak Arabic right? - yes he doesnt."
"-But with that, his main focus was to memorize.."
-..the Quran in 8-9 months.
And he sure did.
MashaAllah.
- How many pages does he memorize a day?
I dropped out of high school  with a baby on the way.
"I had no home, no money  and no help."
I put my hope in the crime on the streets.
"At the time, that scene  was my only option."
Crime on the streets eventually led me to jail.
I came close to death many times.
The lost that changed ...
"The lost that changed my life was the violent death of my younger brother."""
"It was 1967, Mike found his way into Youth Build program in Columbus, Ohio."
"And today, 14 years later, he is the director of his own Youth Build program, he is a minister of his own congregation, he is the owner of his own  construction company."
He has a family and 4 children  and he owns his own home.
"There are millions of young people who have this aspirations, they want  the same thing that you and I want."
"They want to know their true nature,  they want to know their value, they want to make a contribution, and they want to be able to support their families and be happy and safe, right?"
"Yet, because of poverty and racism,  they have been denied that opportunity."
And the schools have failed them.
You all who worked in some of those school have tried your best to counteract that.
Youth Build is developed  as a place for them to land.
"We started,my wife and long-time partner,  Dorothy Stoneman, who is right here, started Youth Build in 1978  at East Harlem, New York."
We as young people had some adult  back-up and some money to do.
"So, I stared across the street and said, ""I would like to fix up that building""."
It took us 5 years to do that first building.
"Starting there step-by-step,  there are now 273 Youth Build programs in the country's poorest communities and 16 other countries like South Africa,"
"Serbia, Haiti, Mexico."
"They asked us to come  by Afghanistan lately, I said:"
"""Wait!"
"Get your things together first, then we'll think about that."""
"They spent about a year in the program,  going to school, getting the GED diploma."
"Half the time they add and had the time building affordable houses for lower income people, learning leadership skills."
In this process they reclaim their lives.
Here are some elements that I think will work and we know about them here.
One is caring and love.
They come in pretty beat-up  by racism and poverty.
"Their positions in feet as a function of time in seconds,"
"T of t and H of t respectively, are plotted below."
"So T of t is the position of the tortoise as a function of time, and it's in feet."
H of t is the position of the hare.
What is the meaning of the rate of change of T of t on the interval t is greater than 0 and less than 20?
"So T of t, they were talking about the tortoise here."
"This is the function T of t right over here, this blue line."
And it looks like it's moving at a constant rate of change.
The slope of this line is constant.
So let's see what this rate of change is.
If we start-- so we could even start from the starting position.
"When 1 second goes by, each notch here in the horizontal axis is 1 second."
"You see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"So every time 1 second goes by, it looks like-- and we have to be very careful here."
"At first it looks like, oh, maybe he moves 1 feet."
But we have to be careful about what these notches represent.
"It looks like these notches represent 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 feet."
"So every time 1 second goes by, he moves forward 5 feet."
"Another second goes by, he moves forward 5 feet."
"So it looks like the rate of the tortoise, so I'll say the tortoise rate, the rate of the change of distance with respect to time is 5 feet for every second."
So let's see which of our choices seem to match that.
And that is over the entire interval.
"The interval starts here, this is 0, and 20 is right over here."
"And it looks like we have a constant rate, we have a constant slope."
We have the same inclination of this line the entire time all the way until t is equal to 20.
"So this first choice says the tortoise walks at 5 feet per second the whole time, and this looks right."
Our tortoise has a constant rate of 5 feet per second.
This walks might be an understatement.
"5 feet per second is a pretty good speed, especially for a tortoise."
But we are going to go with that one.
"Now, let's just look at the other ones for fun to see how true they are or see if they could have somehow applied to this problem."
The hare stops moving after 5 seconds.
"Well, what I do is I take the transformation of this guy."
"My domain right here is R2, and I produce a vector that's going to be in Rn."
"So what I do is, let's see."
So I'm concerned with multiplying things times vectors in R2.
"So what we're going to do is we're going to start with the identity matrix, identity 2 because that's my domain and it just looks like this:"
"1, 0, 0, 1."
I'm just going to start with that.
"And all I do is I apply my transformation to each of the columns, each of my standard bases."
These are the standard bases for R2.
"I showed you that they're bases, how do I know that they're standard?"
Why are they called the standard bases?
"And I haven't covered this in a lot of detail right yet, but you could take the dot product of any of these guys with any of the other guys, and you'll see that they're all orthogonal to each other."
"The dot product of any one of these columns with the other is always zero, so that's a nice clue."
"And they all have length of 1, so that's a nice reason why they're called the standard bases."
"But anyway, back to our attempt to represent this transformation as a matrix vector product."
"So we say look, our domain is in R2, so let's start with I2, or we could call it our 2-by-2 identity matrix."
And let's apply the transformation to each of its column vectors where each of its column vectors are a vector in the standard basis for R2.
So I'm going to write it like this.
"The first column is T of this column, and then the second column is going to be T of 0, 1."
And I know I'm getting messier with my handwriting.
"What is T of the vector 1, 0?"
"Well, we just go here."
We construct another vector.
So we get 1 plus 3 times 0 is 1.
"Then we get 5 times 0 minus 1, so that's minus 1. x2 is zero in this case."
"And then we get 4 times 1 plus 0, so that's just 4."
"So that's T of 1, 0."
"And then what is T of 0, 1?"
"T of 0, 1 is equal to-- so we have 0 plus 3 times 1 is 3."
Then we have 0 minus 1 is minus 1.
Let me make sure I did this one right.
What was this?
"So, you have to get your own strategies together before you go to make a major purchase."
"Now, something else that the book talks about."
It talks about price comparrison.
And here we are not necessarily talking about a major purchase.
"This can be, I'm going to the store and I'm having dinner and it normally takes two cans of green beans for my family."
"Well I can buy one can, the small can of green beans for $.99."
"So to buy two of them would be $1.98, right? $.98 X 2."
"But, I can buy a larger can, double the size, for $1.50."
Should I buy two small ones or one large one?
"Obviously, you would buy one large one."
"And we make the assumption, because this is how it used to be, that the bigger the quantity the less per ounce or per pound or whatever an item is."
And let me tell you that is not always true.
They got you to thinking that so now they do just the opposite because if you need two cans of green beans for a meal you will buy the big one when maybe the big one is $2.25 and the two little ones are $.99 each.
You are better off buying the two little ones even though you have to open two cans than you are buying the one big one.
If it is twice the volume.
Okay?
"So, how can I do this?"
And I will tell you what I do this in the grocery store all the time.
"It takes a little longer to buy groceries sometimes, but this is what you need to do."
You need to be able to figure the unit price of an item.
"And if you will look on page 190, there is the example."
"To calculate the unit price of an item, divide the cost by the number of units."
"So, if I am trying to figure out how many ounces are in something."
I mean how much an ounce of something costs.
I look at how many ounces are in the can and then I take the price divided by the number of ounces.
"So, if you look at this it says a 64 ounce product costing $8.32."
So you take $8.32 divided by 64 and it tells you the cost per ounce.
Okay?
"So, you need to use that when you go grocery shopping."
Take a calculator.
Use the calculator on your phone!
But sometimes it is cheaper to buy two little cans of green beans than to buy the one big can.
The team travels a lot and their on the road for quite sometime how do the students keep up with their school work?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well it's difficult and I think golf is probably as challenging as any of the sports.
Because you know when we play on the road the first day is typically a 36 hole round.
That's 10 hours of being on the golf course your completely wiped out.
And it's tough to keep up you but know they have the computers they...they stay with them and they work on projects together a lot of times their in class together.
So they can try and help each other out as far as assignments and tests and things like that so you know typically
I've had good students on the team and this year is no exception.
We have great kids that work hard and they do their best in the classroom.
[Nick Spinozzi]
This Friday the team goes on the road to compete in the Pinehurst Intercollegiate Tournament.
What do you expect to come out?
Do you expect to come out with a victory?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well that's a very difficult field.
I mean there's I think 3 Bit Ten Schools there.
UNC Wilmington's ranked 52 a lot of good mid-major schools are there.
And so you know I think that we have our work cut out for us in terms of winning the tournament.
"But, you know our schedules very demanding and I think that pays off for us in the...in the Summit League at the end."
So you know I expect us to...to continue to improve
I'm not going to put any predictions on how we finish.
"But, obviously Pinehurst is a great place to be the golf course is a great challenge for us."
The kids will really get a great experience out of being at Pinehurst.
[Nick Spinozzi]
How much of an advantage would you say the team has when it competes in the Beu Mussatto Invitational?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I think playing on home course is a big advantage.
Because the golf course is very challenging it's got some holes on it you really need to play a few times and get some experience on it.
The greens are very challenging difficult a lot of slope so it is a big advantage.
Althought we have some very difficult schools coming.
Oakland in our conference is doing very well this year.
Wisconsin Greenbay has a great team.
This is a subspace of L2 from -1 to 1.
"And it is a subspace spanned by polynomials of degrees of 0, 1, 2 to up to N-1."
"There is a self-evident naive basis, mainly sk is equal to tk, k going from 0 to N-1."
This naive basis is not orthonormal and can be quite badly behaved when N becomes large.
"Our goal will be to approximate vector x, which is sin t over this sub-space, so sin t does not belong to P3, so we have to find the orthonormal projection of sin t over this sub-space P3."
"From the basis s k, we can build an orthonormal basis using something called the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure that you're probably familiar with from linear algebra."
"So, you take the original set s k and you derive the orthonormal set u k using an algorithmic procedure which is given in steps below."
"At each step k, you first derive p k as s k minus the projection on to the previous orthonormal set."
"And then, you renormalize p k into u k by simply dividing by its norm."
"Let us see the Gram-Schmidt procedure on a set of two vectors s 0, s 1."
"So, they are obviously not orthonormal to each other."
"So first, we normalize s 0 into p 0 divided by its norms, that gives you u 0, which is of length 1, it's the blue vector."
"Then, we compute the projection of s 1 onto the subspace, using u 0, so that's u0 inner product with s 1 times u 0."
"Then, we subtract this from s 1: that gives us p 1."
"And finally, we normalize p1 into u1 which is the blue vector."
"Now, we have two vectors that span the same space and are orthogonal to each other."

Taking apart my syringe.
"I'm going to add this in here, and then I want to turn my stopcock to open it up to the patient."
I can shut off this side port so it doesn't leak out.
And then the patient's head should be elevated a little bit.
You don't want them flat.
"So let's make sure, either raise the head of the bed or the patient can be raised up with some pillows."
Make sure they're not flat.
Okay.
So now I'm ready and I can take my feeding and pour it in here.
Okay?
And then you just want this slightly higher than the patient so that it'll go in but not too fast.
Okay?
"All right, and then I would give whatever my feeding amount was slowly and then after that, I would turn my stopcock again to shut it off so it's off here so it won't leak and then I can come back and do it again."
"Now, once I've been feeding the patient and I'm doing it, if this was my first time, after I check for placement, that's all I had to do."
"If I'm coming back four hours later, to give another bolus feed, I would need to check for residual first, tube placement, check for placement, check residual and then give the feeding."
"I may need to follow it with water per my order, to make sure the line is flushed and also to give the patient free water."
"If the patient's on continuous drip, meaning that they get a continuous feeding over 24 hours, we're going to use a special pump that is designed to be used with the feeding tubes."
And there's a special bag and seth (phonetic) that fits in this special type of pump.
All right?
So we're going to use a special feeding bag.
All right.
And then I'm going to pour my required amount of feeding into the bag.
Close the top.
Okay.
Now this is similar to an IV.
"It has a drip chamber, kind of like an IV does, but to get this IV to run, we have to do something special, to get this tubing to flush."
This part here is stretchy tubing.
And I need to stretch it flat and that allows the drip chamber to fill.
All right?
Okay.
"And then I put, prime my line, just like an IV line, until I get a drop to come out."
There we go.
"Let's say that I have a 5-Newton force, and its moment arm distance is 4."
The distance is equal to 4.
That's enough for that side.
And let's say I have a I'm going to switch colors.
"Actually, no, I'm going to keep it all the same color and then we'll use colors to differentiate between clockwise and counterclockwise so I don't bungle everything up again."
So let's say I have a 10-Newton force here.
"And, of course, these vectors aren't proportional to actually what I drew."
50 Newtons would be huge if these were the actual vectors.
And let's say that that moment arm distance is 3.
Let me do a couple more.
And let's say I have a moment arm distance of 8.
"I have a clockwise force of 20 Newtons, And let's say at a distance of 10 again, so distance is equal to 10, I have my mystery force."
It's going to act in a counterclockwise direction and
I want to know what it needs to be.
"So whenever you do any of these moment of force problems, and you say, well, what does the force need to be in order for this see saw to not rotate?"
"You just say, well, all the clockwise moments have to equal all of the counterclockwise moments, So clockwise moments equal counterclockwise."
I'll do them in different colors.
So what are all the clockwise moments?
"Well, clockwise is this direction, right?"
That's the way a clock goes.
"So this is clockwise, that is clockwise."
I want to go in this direction.
And so this is clockwise.
What are all the clockwise moments?
It's 10 Newtons times its moment arm distance 10.
"So 10 times 10 plus 5 Newtons times this moment arm distance 4, plus 5 times 4, plus 20 Newtons times its moment arm distance of 8, plus 20 times 8, and that's going to equal the counterclockwise moments, and so the leftover ones are counterclockwise."
"So we have 50 Newtons acting downward here, and that's counterclockwise, and it's at a distance of 8 from the moment arm, so 50 times 8."
"Let's see, we don't have any other counterclockwise on that side."
"This is counterclockwise, right?"
"We have 10 Newtons acting in the counterclockwise direction, and its moment arm distance is 3, plus 10 times 3, and we're assuming our mystery force, which is at a distance of 10, is also counterclockwise, plus force times 10."
And now we simplify.
And I'll just go to a neutral color because this is just math now.

Charlie says that helping youth learn skills is a source of pride and inspiration.
"Maybe not so much for his grandson, Andrew."
But for other local champs like Billy Bugenig it just might be.
I worked with him on some ranches when I was growing up.
He taught me a lot.
He always knew the way the cattle were going to move.
I learned a lot by watching him.
I met Charlie at a really young age when I was just learning how to rope.
You knew that every time you went and you roped with Charlie you had a chance to win.
When I started team roping and stuff when
"I got into high school, he was always there to help and he was always someone that I looked up to because he knew how to do everything."
And I always enjoyed and still to this day would rope with Charlie any time or anywhere he wanted to.
Champs.
"Those kids, I tell you."
They're good.
"Ya, he still should have a good shot."
He's always able to catch something.
What we're gonna do is to look at the difference between cooking with the regular old-fashioned range and an induction cooktop.
So what we're gonna do today is focus on what happens when you cook it on a regular conventional range.
"What we've got is a GE (if you want to show that, Honey)"
We've got a GE range that's maybe three years old.
"And it has this glass cooktop, which we're told is about as efficient as the old-fashioned kind with the radiant elements."
"So I'm just going to pull our Lodge cast iron skillet out of the cabinet, put it on this main eye that we use, and I'm going to set it on a range from zero to (I guess) an imputed 10 because it's like 2-4-6-8-high,"
I'm going to set it on 8.
And you can see here what's happening here is as the element heats up it's going to heat up that skillet.
But it heats it up very slowly.
"Now I'm going to get some olive oil, which we use when we're cooking our eggs."
"What we're cooking is a frled egg for Amanda and a scrambled egg for me, with a little bit of veggies and some cheese in it."
We'll get that ready for Amanda's egg.
[Cabinet door closes]
"Oh, and I didn't notice when I turned it on; it's probably been on now for maybe 15-20 seconds (Note: actually about 45 seconds)"
What's 0.5 times 0.03?
"I'll do it down here just because multiplying decimals seems to be a problem for a lot of people, including myself, many times."
"So what you do, you just multiply the numbers."
5 times 03 or 5 times 3 is 15.
"And then, how many points do we have behind the decimal?"
How many digits behind the decimal?
Let's see.
"We have 1, 2, 3."
"So 1, 2, 3."
We have to add the 0 because we need three spaces behind the decimal point.
So we get the force is equal to 0.015 kilogram meters per second squared.
And this is a Newton.
So the force is equal to 0.015 Newtons.
Let's do another problem.
"And this one's going to be-- and actually, I think you'll find most of the difficult Newton's laws problems or force problems, they're just some combination of making sure you get the units right when we're talking about in one dimension."
"The difficult part is usually getting the units right or just the math, just the algebra."
So if you have trouble with this it's usually because you have to just brush up a little bit on the algebra.
The physics itself is just force equals mass times acceleration as we will see in this problem.
"So let's say that when I apply some force, some particular force, I use this little 0 here."
So I call that force F sub 0.
So this means a particular force.
This is some value.
"When I apply that force to some mass, let's call that m sub 0, I get some acceleration."
I get acceleration a sub 0.
We could've put numbers here.
"We could've said, well, if I apply a force of 10 Newtons to a mass of-- I don't know-- to a mass of let's say 2 kilograms, I have an acceleration of 5 meters per second squared."
But I'm just doing this because this could be any relationship.
"And let's say the problem tells us that when I put another mass with this first mass, so let's say that, you know-- let me draw this diagram."
"So here's my mass, m sub 0."
"When I apply a force of f sub 0 to it, I get an acceleration of a sub 0."
Now the problem tell us when I add another mass-- so let's says I stack it up and we're like in an ice skating ring or something.
"And I stack another mass up here, and let's call this mass m1."
The embarrassing thing here was that I was prepped to answer this question.
"Well I think just to, I'm sure there are bigger ideas than this, just to stick with the subject I would hope that even though I don't see this in purely generational terms, I would hope that parents begin to realize that handing your kids constantly inundating them with new technologies and giving them motivation to be interrupted all the time and to inundate themselves with information has to be balanced by encouraging them to be attentive, to read, to back away from the technology and to back away from there friends sometimes, and like you said collaboration and conversation is great, but there is a role in the world for solitude and I think that we should encourage our kids and ourselves to practice that as well."
Peter Norvig:
Ok (People Clapping)
So thank you to Nicholas Carr for sharing your incite and vision with us tonight.
This meeting from the common
"Perez, thank you for your kind words as well as sharing my latest Old Spice commercial with your readers"
Receiving accolades from you was truly an honour
"If I were to create a metaphor of blogs using mountains, your blog would be the mighty Everest, sitting on top of a skyscraper"
"And that skyscraper would be sitting on top of one of those rolling library ladders used to reach really, really high shelves"
"And on top of that wildly high ladder mountain, would be the mightiest of falcons, wearing an oxygen mask and flying at an impossibly high altitude"
And this falcon would represent your generous and flattering comments about me and on that falcon's head would be a top hat because top hats are for gentlemen
"Gentlemen like you, Perez."
I thank you.

"So, if you look at this graph."
This is how much health care is growing projected based upon the growth in the past and you can see sixteen percent in 27 going up in nearly 50 percent in 75 years.
Now we're not going to get the 50%.
We have a major crisis before we got there but you can see what impact the growth of Medicare and Medicaid are having.
Medicaid roughly and this is before healthcare reform.
But Medicare huge increase over that time and will get a wide that it is shortly 2009 and 2010.
Just one year.
"That's the year, the year for which we have the latest data that arise 300 billion, 200 billion, 100 billion, 50, billion, 25 billion."
"Now this is all health care spending, not just government."
"So, we got a tag 200 billion, 200 billion."
"You guys are a little more pessimistic, I already, I must have scared you, it's a 100 billion."
A 100 billion dollars change in one year.
"Now again, you are not used to thinking about billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars but a 100 billion dollars, that's how much it's costing us to expand health care to everyone."
Per year.
"So, if we could hold health, healthcare inflation and zero for one year, we could pay for the expansion in the healthcare system."
Think about $100 billion in almost any other context that you know of.
Right?
It's a huge amount of money.
"It's $300 for every woman, man, woman, and child in the United States."
We're talking about the payroll tax and all of that.
That's less than this level of inflation.
Benefit to a family of four of changing that payroll tax is less than just one year increased in health care cost.
"Here, you have from 1960, 147 this is for the per cap of spending so it's controlled for the growth and the population."
1968 was spending $147.
Now it is true this is nominal so.
"Up to, in 2009, $8000 per person."
"Again, a phenomenal and then if you look over the decade of the 2000s, you can see going from 5200 to 8000."
60 percent increase in spending.
This is the change in.
"Each decade comparing in the green bar, the growth in the GDP and the growth in the health care, NHE stands for National Health Expenditures, right?"
"First thing you can see is every year, every decade."
Healthcare expenditures exceed the growth and GDP.
"A food that's archetypically connected with winning the golden ticket, that's connected with prosperity."
"I was taken on a rocket ride across the universe in a voyage of discovery  that has brought me right to you at this present moment, right now."
"This food is filled  with legends and lore, which I summarized along with scientific data and recipe information and all kinds of great stuff in my book ""Naked chocolate,"" which became the sourcebook  or a reference book for people who are interested in raw chocolate, because all the chocolate we've ever had has been processed through high heat and machines."
"And we thought,  maybe we should just eat it cold processed -- is there a difference."
And that's we're gonna explore here as we delve into the astonishing truth about the world's greatest food.
Chocolate comes from the Mayan lands  and ancient Mayan farms.
Chocolate is a Mayan word.
"The word ""cacao"" is one of the oldest words in use in the world today."
"Some people estimate that  that word is 15,000 years old."
The oldest word in the world.
It was brought to the West  and brought to you by Hernando Cortez.
He was the conqueror of Mexico.
"It all happened by an accident, because Montezuma,  who was the leader of Mexico at that time, was in a state of civil war in Mexico City."
"And when Cortez showed up there  in 1521, there was -- they believe that"
Cuauhtémoc himself had come to the great city.
"Christopher Columbus,  when he first spotted cacao he thought it was almond."
And this was money for them.
This is what their currency was.
Today we use coins.
Then they used cacao.
It was their money.
And he saw -- somebody dropped some cacao beans on a little boat.
And they all jumped for it.
Columbus wrote that these people  are crazy about almond.
Montezuma was known to drink  50 cups of chocolate a day.
It was always consumed as a drink.
"And there you see the cup that Montezuma was known to drink out of, or one that's similar to that."
"Anyway, how do you turn this bean,  this nut, into a drink?"
"Well, you'll have to break it open, and eventually get all of those cacao beans into a beverage,  which we'll see later."
"But before we do that, we've gotta look at where  the chocolate comes from."
This is the chocolate tree.
"And yes, money does grow on trees."
Why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe?
What are the dark matter and the dark energy that make up so much stuff in the universe?
Where did the universe itself come from?
What we're hoping is that the Higgs boson gives us a new tool to answer these questions.
"That is, one era ends, another one begins."
"It is as if we'd been in one room for all of our lives, doing physics, and the Higgs is a door into the next room."
And it'll be very interesting to see what's inside.
"Of course, I believe."
"Especially during the period of recession, my faith has grown even more."
Human actions can only be successful with the help of God .
Let's see.
We have this graph over here with t is the independent variable on the horizontal axis and d is the dependent variable on the vertical axis.
And then they have a table here.
Looks like this table corresponds to this graph.
"When t equals 1, d is 40, when t is equal to 2, d is 80."
So these points correspond to points on this line.
"And then they explain to us, you are buying a gym membership."
The membership costs $40 per month.
"In the graph and table above, d is the total number of dollars that you pay for your gym membership, so that's d right over there, and t is the time in months that you keep the membership."
"Write an equation for the amount of money d that you pay for your gym membership, if you keep the membership for t months."
And you see that here.
"If you're one month, you pay $40, two months you pay another $40, you pay $80."
You see that in the graph right over here.
"If you have 0 months, you pay nothing."
"Then one month, $40, the next month another $40 getting you to $80."
"So if I were to write this as an equation, the dependent variable here is the amount that I pay in dollars."
So that is going to depend on the time.
And how is it going to depend on the time in months?
Well I'm going to pay $40 per month times the number of months.
"So I can either write it as 40 with a little asterisk sign, which is Shift 8-- and then I put t there-- or I could literally put just a t right over there."
"And I think that's right, because if my time is 0 according to this table and according to this graph,"
"It turns out that what we want for, what we'll call the common denominator, it turns out to be the least common multiple of two and three."
Well what's the least common multiple of two and three?
Well that's the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three.
Well the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three is six.
So let's convert both of these fractions to something over six.
So one half is equal to what over six.
You should know this from the equivalent fractions module.
"Well if I eat one half of a pizza with six pieces, I would have eaten three pieces, right?"
That make sense.
"One is one half of two, three is one half of six."
"Similarly, if I eat one third of a pizza with six pieces, it's the same thing as two over six."
So one half plus one third is the same thing as three over six plus two over six.
Notice I didn't do anything crazy.
All I did is I re-write both of these fractions with different denominators.
"I essentially changed the number of pieces in the pie, if that helps at all."
Now that we're at this point then the problem becomes very easy.
"We just add the numerators, three plus two is five, and we keep the denominators the same."
Three over six plus two over six equals five over six.
And subtraction is the same thing.
"One half minus one third, well that's the same thing as three over six minus two over six."
Well that equals one over six.
Let's do a bunch more problems and hopefully you'll start to get it.
"And always remember you can re-watch the presentation, or you can pause it and try to do the problems yourself, because I think sometimes I talk fast."
Let me throw you a curve ball.
What's one tenth minus one?
"Well, one doesn't even look like a fraction."
But you can write it as a fraction.
Well that's the same thing as one tenth minus-- how could we write one so it has the denominator of ten?
Right.
"It's the same thing as ten over ten, right? ten over ten is one."
"So one tenth minus ten over ten is the same thing as one minus ten-- remember, we only subtract the numerators, and we keep the denominator ten, and that equals negative nine over ten. one tenth minus one is equal to negative nine over ten."
Let's do another one.
Thirteenth year back at Western and I coached a couple years right out of college so it's nice to be hear in Macomb and at Western.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now you were the team was picked to finish 8th in the Summit League
Pre-Season Polling.
You think the team will exceed these early expectations with such a young roster?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well it's kind of hard to tell you know the...the ranking system is based on the Fall results and you know we have a very young team very inexperienced team to start the year and I think that we'll play much bettter this Spring just having known who's going to be playing and a little more experience under our belts.
So I look forward to the competition
I'm not sure about exceeding expectations but were obviously are going to do our best.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now the team finished 10th tied with 11 place with Boise State in the Pat Hicks Thunderbird Invitational how do you think the team did there?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well you know it's the first...first term of the year we've been playing in February now for I think this is our 8th year and you never know what to expect there.
But we really had some bright...bright spots in that tournament.
Andrew Godfrey played very well.
Kurt Slattery who's a transfer this semester he played very well too.
And some of the young guys did fine.
Konrad Deka had 72 in the last round.
So we had some bright spots the finish wasn't as high as what we'd hoped but we try not to take those things into consideration to highly at this point in the year.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now you have know returning seniors on the team.
In your coaching career have you had to deal with anything like that before with such a young roster that doesn't get to play that hasn't played that much?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I don't I think it's more than just no seniors on the team.
We lost a lot of experience too.
So a lot of the players that we have this is their first collegiate experience.
It's different to not have seniors is one thing.
But to be going into the season knowing that you really didn't have anybody that have played the golf courses.
That really wasn't us to playing at the Division One level.
Those things are you know there's no substitute for experience.
I expect us to be a lot better just because of those things.
[Nick Spinozzi]
"Preached in many churches can say, but only on the outskirts of Fortaleza."
"Probably the major ministries do not know me, to tell the truth I am alone, like a drop in the middle of the desert."
"I'm just a man who does what he believes God has put in my heart, and I do not care about what others say."
"I don't care that God knows my heart, this is the most important thing."
Q: the big ministries missionaries know Gap?
A:
"No, I think not, I can't guarantee it."
Sometimes we try to establish contacts but ...
"Q: can't you feel kinda saddened because nobody pays you for what you do, for your sacrifices?"
A:
No.
Q: why don't we have been called to become famous.
The word says that we cannot be more than our master.
One of the things that most are horrified me is this idea of the Ministry set up blindly ...
"Watch, the helmsman's not you ..."
But the rower!
What obeys.
"Are not entered in the missions looking for earnings, but conscious of the sacrifices."
Got It?
"Usually we say that no one can be sure to be a servant of God if he has not first explored the depths of the disenchantment of oneself and the world, because the treasures that gives the world not a blessing but a priming."
There is one thing that happens sometimes ...
"God gave us the grace to spread the word about Gap for Fortaleza, but few have heard of me."
I see it as a gift in many ways because there is something in us that ...
It is difficult to explain.
The Bible doesn't say that to get something from Christ we need to deal with him.
It is he who tells us what is our call.
We trust in him then!
"There is a phrase that says ""join in the boat with God and return to port with him."" In short, don't you dare even to start without him, we do ours that ""dying"" expressed by Christ on the cross, dying to our dreams, and everything that we thought they needed ..."
I wish to remain clear that God has never abused my will.
"It was always patient, as in fix I've often complained."
"But I felt in these 12 years as say the Scriptures, that his goodness is perfect and good, I only had to align my heart closer to Her to figure it out."
"I don't know where I will go, whether I'll live a humble life."
We are reaching out to friends and  communities who are doing the same.
This is not new.
"It's a really broad area, it covers a lot."
I do not think we could cover it all in 6 days.
I think you know.
What is special here is that we are face-to-face.
"We get to hear from a real living being and from our heart,  not on a website or something."
You'll have time also afterwards  to approach our wonderful friends.
So this is the living Dharma as they will speak from their experience.
The panel is a way of reaching out and connecting and collaborating with others.
"We are doing similar things, bringing and helping education,  improving the purpose of education and creating techniques  and methods to help teachers, students as well as their parents and the whole overall."
So we can just start with the classrooms and it will touch everything.
"That is the core  of our teacher's teachings, interbeing."
"When you touch one student, one teacher, naturally you will have to deal  with all the other issues."
So we have here today our panel  that represents a very diverse area and they will share  their personal journey and how they have come  to the point here.
"Without any further ado,  I introduce brother Richard here, a wonderful friend in our community."
He will be introducing each member.
Richard Brady is also  a retired math teacher and he has inspired many people.
Having him to come up here is a gift.
I met his student  who came to Plum Village.
After many years he came and  we asked him:
"""Why are you here?"""
"He said; ""I used to take a class."
"My math teacher is Richard Brady."""
"So you can see, just one student's experience in a class, how later on in life,  he confronted suffering and he remembered the teaching and came to learn more about the practice."
There are many stories like that  but I won't hold up the panel here.
Thank you for being with us.
(Richard Brady) Thank you brother.
It is my honor to introduce some old and new friends to you.
It is a privilege to hear from them this afternoon.
"Each will speak for  about 8 minutes, not very long, but we want to leave some time  for questions and answers at the end."
"So, just focus on them and if there is any questions that come up afterwards, be ready to ask them."
He's lazy.
And they gave kind of behavioral descriptions to something that wasn't behavioral at all.
"To be told over and over again, you're not quite cutting the mustard, it breaks down your self esteem."
And you have to go somewhere else to get your self esteem built up.
And kids get into trouble.
And they go looking for things that are more exciting than being told every day that you're dumb.
I think there's a huge payback for not providing kids with what they need.
"Just as the experts could have predicted, Adam turned to drugs and alcohol."
"When I drink, it's just to forget about everything."
"If I'm really having a tough time, I can't take this anymore, I just have to go drink some beers to let it all just get away."
There's been a lot of evidence of drug use.
"Continuously money being stolen, no matter where it was."
"We're kind of guilty of overlooking it, thinking, well, you know, so he needs some money."
"But when he gets into the thousands, you know, we've let it go too far."
And it got there.
"Then, one night, the phone call every parent dreads."
We get a phone call from the state police.
I thought he's getting ready to tell us that somebody been killed.
"I thought about, how do you plan a funeral for a kid who doesn't seem to want to be part of your family anymore, doesn't want to be a kid?"
Adam was safe but in deep trouble.
The police claimed that he had crashed a stolen car.
"The next morning, Terry took his 15-year-old son to the psychiatric ward at Boston Medical Center and had him committed."
I've had my son hospitalized to give him some attention.
"I mean, he could have been killed that night."
And he was out that night because he skipped school that day and didn't want to come home.
So he was out that night.
"I mean, how many more chances does he have?"
"After years of academic failure, Adam's slow, downward spiral was turning into every parent's nightmare, a teenager too far gone to rescue."
His parents will soon be confronted by that terrible prospect.
"But right now, the story of another young boy sending alarming signals that he is headed for trouble."
"His parents, desperate for help, can feel him slipping away."
"10-year-old Nathan Suggs lives in rural Bear Creek, North Carolina where he"
"Andfor real man, this is it."
You know.
"I've talked about how I faked rage when it came out to these stupid memes that I wanted to be popular and that sort of thing, man."
Don't get it wrong.
"The rage as it pertained to the political and the social components and the capitalist components, they were genuine."
They were 100% genuine.
"As a matter of fact,"
"I was a pretty livid guy back in the conservative days, man and believe it or not, I had health problems during that time."
"I had a lot of health problems that that .... that were inspired or transpired because of me thinking about all these subject, you know."
"And believe it or not,"
"I found that utilizing this show as a way to exert all that angst that I had was comfortable and if somebody listened, that's fine."
"If they didn't, you know, it's good."
"I mean, it didn't really-- I didn't really do it for the money."
"I mean, if I did it for the money,"
I would be -- I would've put out books and shit.
"I would've done that shit, but... anyway..."
"It is necessary, are you kidding me?"
It is necessary.
"No, the show's not gonna be back this fall."
"No, no, no."
"Fuck no, I am not going to fucking continue to fucking have a venue for these idiots to, you know, I don't know, to do whatever it is that gets them off or whatever whatever it is that sustains the continuity of these sons of bitches as it relates to their goddamn trollin'."
"Well, I'm just not gonna do it anymore."
"I'm done here, man."
"I see we got a whole bunch of people here so I'll stay in here for a few more minutes, but it's over man."
"I mean, like I said, I'll come into this room and not to mention, the people that I have talked to about making actual businesses with, I am not joking, you know what I mean?"
I'm not joking about that whatsoever.
"I am sincere when I say that you know, I want to make businesses."
"I want us to make money, you know."
And ...
I'm sincere when I say that man.
But I got a lot on my plate on top of all this stupid online ridiculous bullshit.
"You know, a lot of people depend on me for a lot of shit and I know it seems that"
"Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state?"
"You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing, you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry."
"You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"""
"I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye, dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers."
"I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day."
"""And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively, it might be time to think about it."
"Because, dude, you know, four years."""
"You know, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin, thoughts are bouncing around."
"And, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really didn't change, in terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally."
"And now, when I talk about the show,"
I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.
"I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong, some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not."
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.
"As a group, they're the happiest people I know."
"And I don't want to start whistling ""Look for the Union Label,"" and all that happy worker crap."
I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work.
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work.
I swear to God --
I did it with them.
They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.
And I see it over and over and over again.
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows.
Follow your passion -- we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?
Probably the worst advice I ever got.
(Laughter)
"You know, follow your dreams and go broke, right?"
"I mean, that's all I heard growing up."
"I didn't know what to do with my life, but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out."
"I can give you 30 examples, right now --"
"Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine."
Why?
"I have a speech prepared, but..."
I don't know if it's for the toast.
I didn't know I was gonna lead the toast.
[laughter]
Be prepared next time!
[laughter]
Bring your walking legs.
[laughter mixed with gasps]
Okay.
Now this is something uhh...
"I didn't know I was gonna give a speech today, but"
"I happen to type at 30,000 words per minute, so... in the time that I was up there I quickly whipped something up for you, Bayley and Megan."
"I promise you, it will be the most touching thing you've ever heard in your entire life."
[laughter]
More touching than the vows?
Yes.
[laughter]
Fornication such as this...!
Wait... [hesitant laughter]
"For an occasion such as this, it is very important to recognize the people that put their time and effort into making this a reality."
"So thank you... me, for working to make sure that this thing went off with out a hitch... power issues aside."
I wasn't a part of that.
"And thank you, me, for almost making it right on time for the rehersal."
"And thank you, me, most of all for taking time away from myself to recognize the efforts of the little people - Megan, this isn't a dig at you, don't worry, those are coming later, but instead I mean all the people that weren't me and still gave their (less important) time and energy to... decorating..."
"This means to clap, monkeys."
[applause and laughter] feeding us all... [applause]
"and finally, thanks to you for having me here, which lets face it, was  the most important thing to happen today."
"Now, as many of you already know, my name is David Sprague."
"And, as many of you have felt strangely compelled to point out, some of you doing so cruelly within ear shot of the groom, I am the best man here today."
"Don't get me wrong, I understand that I am great, but come on people; this is supposed to be Bayley's special day."
"He has had to hear just how great I am every single day since well before he even met me, so can we please just give him one day free of constant reminders that I am better than him?"
"For those of you that haven't been to a wedding, this is normally the part of the best man speech where I would point out that the groom is actually the best man here because the bride is marrying him instead of the person titled ""best man"", me."
"When x is equal to 0, why is equal to 0."
So the y intercept is 0.
So we know that this has a form y is equal to mx where m is a slope.
Let's figure out the slope.
Slope is equal to change in y for a given change in x or change in y over change in x.
"So when we increase x by 1, how much are we increase-- or decrease y by?"
Well then y increases by 2.
"So we could say that equals y changes by 2, by plus 2 when x changes by plus 1."
"So we get the slope is equal to 2, so the equation of this"
line is y is equal to 2x.
Which is choice B.
Next problem.
Which point lies on the line defined by 3x plus 6y is equal to 2?
Well the best thing to do is just probably to substitute these numbers in for x and y and see which one works.
"Changes to Rumble, Urgot, Cho'Gath, and the Tribunal, covered in this episode of the Patch Preview."
"Welcome, summoners."
"I'm Phreak and I'm here with Morello, Lead Champion Designer."
Together we'll be discussing some gameplay changes coming into the next update for League of Legends.
"While this video does not cover every single change, it will explain the thought process behind some of our decisions."
Rumble seemingly came out of nowhere and was suddenly an overpowered champion.
"In this patch, we'll be lowering the damage amplification from being in the Danger Zone as well as reducing the damage of Flamespitter."
"What's the story here, Morello?"
"We over-buffed Rumble in the Jayce patch, but no one really saw that change because we didn't do any other balance changes with that patch."
Basically we did a bug-fix that made Flamespitter more reliable so you'd get full damage out of the spell more often.
The damage on Flamespitter was extremely high and was balanced for when it was broken.
We're bringing the damage value to something that's much more reasonable for the way it behaves now.
"We really like the Danger Zone gameplay, but we had to re-evaluate the numbers on it."
"You'll still feel good for using Danger Zone effectively, but not 30% stronger good."
Last patch we gave Urgot a whole slew of nerfs aimed at his ability ranges and damages.
"This patch, we're reverting the damage change on Acid Hunter, meaning its base damage is going back up and the attack damage ratio is going back down."
Why are we reverting this change?
Our goal when balancing champions to let them shine in their own special niche.
What happens when we have different denominators?
"Well, hopefully it won't be too difficult."
Let's say I have one fourth plus one half.
Let's go back to that original pie example.
Let me draw that pie.
"So this first one fourth right here, let's just color it in, that's this one fourth of the pie."
And now I'm going to eat another one half of the pie.
So I'm going to eat one half of the pie.
So this one half.
I'll eat this whole one half of the pie.
So what does that equal?
"Well, there's a couple of ways we could think about it."
"First we could just re-write one half. one half of the pie, that's actually the same thing as two fourths, right?"
There's one fourth here and then another one fourth here.
"So one half is the same thing as two over four, and we know that from the equivalent fractions module."
"So we know that one fourth plus one half, this is the same thing as saying one fourth plus two fourths, right?"
"And all I did here is I changed the one half to a two fourths, by essentially multiplying the numerator and the denominator of this fraction by two."
And you can do that to any fraction.
"As long as you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, you can multiply by anything."
That makes sense because one half times one is equal to one half.
You know that.
"Well another way of writing one is one half times two over two. two over two is the same thing as one, and that equals two over four."
The reason why I picked two is because I wanted to get the same denominator here.
I hope I'm not completely confusing you.
"Well, let's just finish up this problem."
"So we have one fourth plus two fourths, so we know that we just add the numerators, three, and the denominators are the same, three fourths."
"And if we look at the picture, true enough, we have eaten three fourths of this pie."
Let's do another one.
Let's do one half plus one third.
"Well once again, we want to get both denominators to be the same, but you can't just multiply one of them to get -- there's nothing I can multiply three by to get two, or there's no, at least, integer I can multiply three by to get two."
And there's nothing I can multiply two by to get three.
So I have to multiply both of them so they equal each other.
We'll come back to larger questions of community design on
Thursday.
This is a video about how Vi Hart creates her videos.
He is filming a video about how I actually make my videos but I am filming  a video about How I make a video about how I make a video...
She's famous for being YouTube's most popular Mathemusician and a Khan Academy employee.
"If you haven't seen any of her videos, go to  youtube.com/vihart and watch a few of them."
Vi aims to make videos that show math is cool and  she's doing a great job of achieving her goal.
"For example, ever since seeing her videos about plants and the Fibonacci spirals and Sponge Bob's pineapple when I watch an episode of Sponge Bob or see a pine cone,"
I've become aware of patterns I never seen before...
"Vi Hart has been featured in newspapers including the New York Times, on the YouTube home page several times, and on the YouTube channel ""The VlogBrothers"" from Hank and John Green."
"""Nerd fighters, Click here watch a Vi Hart video  and your whole life will be changed"""
"Well, who am I?"
"Well, I am Ethan Bresnick"
I am a student and short filmmaker.
"Although math is not my thing, making films is and I want to show you how Vi Hart makes her videos."
"Vi starts by writing a script, first."
"If you are interested in how she writes scripts, click on the link in the description below to  view an example of her script writing."
It takes Vi anywhere from a few hours to a  day to write a script for a doodling video
Videos that require research take up to a week or even a month!
"But sometimes it takes a few weeks, as in the  case of her ""What Was Up with Pythagoras?"" video, to make sure that nothing was embarrassingly wrong."
Vi spent several months researching and scripting her plant series of videos.
"For you tech geeks out there, Vi uses Microsoft Word on her work computer and Open Office on her home."
"Next, she shoots her videos."
"""Filming time!"""
Shooting is one of the shortest parts in her process.
"While she usually shoots her videos alone from start to finish, sometimes she offers supporting roles to a few of Khan Academy's interns and employees."
They are eager to help out.
We are just going to do the old switcheroo
You can finish out writing this 100 times.
Keep going!
"It kinda like, you smear it on the back of my hand."
Okay we need more snakes!
Still today the number one  cash crop in the world.
"And it's the best crop for keeping indigenous people in the jungle, so that we don't cut down our sacred forests."
"Every time you choose to buy chocolate, organic chocolate, and or,  what I prefer -- raw chocolate, you are voting with your money  to save the rain forest, and it is a vote that counts."
It's the best vote you can have.
It grows in a little pod.
What an interesting looking plant.
It grows right off the trunk.
The fruit does.
And inside -- there's the flower.
This is the glory of chocolate.
Look at the different colors there.
Inside we see this.
"These are the cacao nuts,  or the beans, or the nut that all chocolate is made out of inside."
And around each nut is a white pulp.
"And that pulp was traditionally  in Amazonia and Central America where chocolate is from,  was only eaten by women."
But men ate the nut on the inside.
This is what that pulp looks like.
That's what we call 'The best day ever'.
"When you have that much chocolate,  real chocolate, original chocolate, raw chocolate, the fruit than nut,  the pulp, everything, but you gotta watch out,  because all the creatures in the forest eat it."
"And in fact, it is known that if you have a forest with 140 species of different birds then when you put a cacao orchard in, and you put it right into the jungle; no trees are taken out,  nothing is cut down."
"You take your little baby cacao plants or ""chocolate trees"", you put them right in the forest, and that will attract at least  40 more species of birds."
Birds love to hang out in chocolate trees.
"It comes back to this; the coin of the realm, the great cacao bean."
The secret inside.
We had an amazing discovery early on.
"In that, that cacao bean, the thing  that all chocolate is made out of, is the highest antioxidant food in the world."
This was a discovery.
This was not known ten years ago.
It is known now.
"Chocolate contains 15 times  the amount of antioxidants as wild blueberries, 20 times the antioxidants  as what's in green tea, 30 times the antioxidants as red wine."
"All of those pigments of color,  that are captured, that beautiful purple color that's the antioxidants;  it's actually the color."
And the brown of chocolate  is the polyphenols that protect yourselves and actually  protect you from aging.
So you've essentially gone from hundreds of channels in your TV line-up to millions of channels just with the implementation of a browser.
How do you search all of this content?
"Well, we thought of that, too."
"So I'm going to bring down the search box again, and from here I can type in the name of a channel and"
I could see that right now this is a show that's playing.
"With one click, I tune there and I'm done."
People don't have as much time as they used to.
We want to get them there quicker.
"But the search box is interesting not just for channel searches, but we can search for anything."
Let me search for Star Trek.
You'll see here that we're integrating
TV search as well as pages from the web.
I can even search TV and video content and this takes me to a page where I can access all the content about Star Trek that I ever want to watch.
I can browse movies.
"I can go to specific shows, specific episodes, and even clips from the web."
"Now, it doesn't matter what's on right now."
What matters is what do I want to watch?
Google TV lets me watch it.
And this is--some of this is free and some of this is paid.
We're doing integrations with different video on demand providers to allow users to pay for things instantly and watch them immediately on their TV.
"So now you have all your TV, you have all of the web, and you have a way to search it all."
It gets even better.
I'm going to go to my home screen really quickly and navigate to one of my recordings for Top Gear.
"Now, this specific episode of Top Gear is all about the Ferrari."
And let's just say for a minute that I was so captivated by this show that
I wanted to buy a Ferrari.
Check this out.
"With one button, I can collapse the screen into a smaller screen size and I do a search for a ""buy a Ferrari""."
"Granted, this is just a demo, I'm not really going to buy one today."
"Now, I can go online and do that just now."
"Now, you can imagine all of the use cases where this can be very compelling."
I'm watching a breaking news story and I want to go see what people are saying on Twitter or Facebook or I'm watching a game show like Jeopardy and I want to go cheat and get the answer before the people on TV do.
"Elvis was a hero to most, but he never meant  to me."
"Straight up racist, the sucker was simple and plain."
Mother your man John Wayne.
Already I'm hyped cause I'm amped.
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamp.
"You want to find something that you are engaged with, that you are engaged in, that something that keeps your interest because some of you are going to look back at this time in your life when you were a revolutionary radical and then you grew up and you had kids and stuff."
"I was going to transform the world, now I'm a corporate lawyer with 10 clients, making half a million dollars."
I want to come and visit you then.
"Because life is like that, but the point is you evolve."
You grow.
You deepen.
Let's end the bigotry against young people.
I know some of they sag their pants like they live in sag harbor.
"Maybe if you lift their hope, aspirations, and dreams they're pants will follow."
[Applause]
"Martin Luther King Jr. didn't just change black people, he changed America."
He made white people more human.
He made white civilization more tolerable.
And he brought the humanity of black people to bear.
But he refused to give up on white brothers and sisters and said there is something dignified and beautiful in the consciences of America when we can appeal to those consciences to transform America.
This rather unusual looking car can reach speeds of up to 180 kilometres an hour but that is not what makes it special.
All is revealed when it unfurls it propellors; this car can also fly.
The Personal Air and Land Vehicle or PAL-V is a gyrocopter that can both fly and is allowed on the road.
So what do you need to drive this machine?
"Robert Dingemanse, CEO and founder of Dutch company PAL-V, said:"
"""A normal drivers licence."
And for flying a personal or private pilot's licence and that's something you get in around 20 to 30 hours worth of lessons.
So it's pretty easy in a gyrocopter.
"It's a gyrocopter and that's the easiest way of flying, also the safest way of flying."""
"If the PAL-V sounds like the answer to the traffic jam, there is a hitch."
"It requires 165 metres of runway to take-off, 30 metres to land and can only be flown from an airport."
"It is expected to retail for somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 euros."
"Kyle, are you here?"
"So, that is my work -to try to bring  a change in the vision of education which is basically about people  getting jobs and doing skills rather than becoming a complete human being."
"Holistic education is about educating  the whole person, the body, mind and the spirit."
"Gandhi said they are an invisible whole, as soon as you try to break off one, you commit a gross fallacy."
And we have committed the gross fallacy in education.
"So, the aims of holistic education,  in my view, are the development of wisdom, and compassion and happiness."
Wisdom and compassion.
"Not intelligence, but wisdom."
That deep understanding of how things are.
"So in holistic education, what is really important, and I think in any education, is the presence of the teacher."
"And so much about teacher's education  and even in service education, is about technique, is about theory, but there is nothing about how  to enhance the presence of the teacher."
"So, how does one enhance  the presence of a teacher?"
"It is simple, it is through practice."
It is through practice.
"So, my practice has been meditation,  and so, in my courses, starting in 1988,"
"I required all my students to meditate for six weeks, every day."
Starting with five to ten minutes  and working up to about half an hour.
"And they kept a journal, they still do  keep a journal, cause I am still teaching."
"And at the end, they write  a one page reflection."
Also I introduce mindfulness activity.
"I have them eat a raisin mindfully and then for the rest of the week, do something mindfully, take some  small thing and do it mindfully."
The final thing is I start my classes  with loving kindness meditation.
"This is in a public university, University of Toronto."
"I think one of the reasons  I came to Canada,"
I do not think I could have done this in US.
"So, since 1988, I have been introducing meditation to over 2000 teachers."
"And to read those journals and  to read that one-page reflection, has just been one  of the greatest joys of my life."
(Half Bell) (Laughter)
So I taught this summer and I have one student that was in my summer class and I am really delighted  to see the students come up to me.
"But I just want to read the journal  of one of the students, just a few words."
"In the meditation,  he was counting one to four."
"So exhale, one..."
"I used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats, and I remember fishermen saying they can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net, because it leaves a black slime behind."
So that must have come from the shark.
"Now, we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable."
We would use conventional methods;
"I have a crossbow -- you see it in my hand there, which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well."
"So I tried that, I tried many techniques."
"All it was doing was breaking my arrows, because the shark's skin is just so strong."
There was no way we were going to get a sample from that.
That wasn't going to work.
"So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat,"
"I thought, ""If you take what you're given in this world ..."""
So I scraped it off.
I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.
"So I scraped the slime off and sent it to Aberdeen, and said, ""You might try that."""
And they sat on it for months.
It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man.
"But I kept emailing Les, saying,"
"""Have you had a chance to look at my slime?"""
"And he was like, ""Yeah, yeah."
"Later."""
He thought he'd better do it because I never met him before; he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him.
And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime.
"They amplified it and they tested it, and they found, yes, this was actually basking shark DNA, which was got from the slime."
So he was very excited.
"It became known as ""Simon's shark slime."""
"And I thought, ""Hey, you know, I can build on this."""
"So we thought, OK, we're going to try to get out and get some slime."
So having spent three-and-a-half thousand on satellite tags ...
"I then thought I'd invest 7.95 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in Kilrush for a mop handle, and even less money on some oven cleaners."
And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle and ... (Laughter)
I was desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks.
"And this was into August now, and normally sharks peak in June, July, and you rarely see them, or rarely can be in the right place to find sharks into August."
"And you can see that in 2000s that 1.3 percent or yeah, 1.3 percent gap basically doubled to 2.5 percent gap in the next decade."
Health care cost mushroomed.
"Now, this is a somewhat complicated slide but I just talked to you about the fact that o ver four decades, we've have this big growth."
Basically 2.4 percent above the growth in the GDP in health care.
Taking more and more and more of the GDP into health care arena.
This is projected by the Congressional Budget Office into the future.
It's not all health care spending.
It's just federal health care spending which is predominantly what?
Medicare but also have a big portion of Medicaid.
And this is to see what happens if there is no excess cost quote.
"That means, if healthcare cost which I haven't done in 40 years equal GDP."
That solid line here is what happens over basically the next 25 years if health care cost do not rise any faster than the growth of GDP and what do you see?
Just interpret the graph.
What do you see?
It's still growing right?
"This is a percentage GDP, Medicare and the Federal portion here is about five percent and you can see, it goes over eight%, 8-1/25 in 25 years."
"This in the GDP, if it doesn't exceed GDP."
"If it exceed GDP by two percent which is slightly less and what has been doing in the last 40 years, you can see it balloons past ten, eleven%."
"And if it has slowing growth down to 1.7 percent points, okay?"
You can see that it still goes over ten%.
"So, the federal budget contribution to health care is extremely."
"Dependent on how much healthcare grows above GDP but even if it doesn't grow above GDP, it's going to be bigger and bigger drag on the federal budget, okay?"
"This is one reason people who are budget [inaudible], who worry about the healthcare, worry about the federal budget."
The predominant worry is not social security but healthcare.
"We're going to do a few international comparisons so that you could get a feel for how our healthcare spending compares to the rest and well, as [inaudible] percent, how mush more does the US spend on healthcare than the number two country in the world?"
"32%, say 30 percent were third higher."
"32%, say, 50 percent of quarter, say, 40%."
"Before we get there, who is the next highest country in the world?"
"It's Norway, that's right."
They are number two.
"And they spent we spent rough, they, we're at 50 percent higher than what they spend."
Look at this graph.
"It didn't have a clear designed aesthetic, it didn't have an approach to consumers."
So it was a very powerful product and if you couldn't figure out what was really the best user experience you'd build both and have a pref for it.
"It was known as loaded and overweight and technically good, but a poor product."
That was 2002.
"About a year later,"
AOL decided they were tired of investing in the browser.
"They still had, I don't know, 75 or a 150 people they were paying to work on the browser and they weren't really getting anywhere with it."
"At long last, they became interested in taking mozilla.org assets and giving them to those of us who'd been running the project."
"Again, to give you a sense of what life was like in those days, mozilla.org assets were the trademark, the name, mozilla.org, four big servers we fought for that ran all mozilla.org"
and some seed startup money.
That was really it.
"Yeah, Mick."
[Question]
That's definitely the timing.
"Yes, so that was why it may well have been."
What Mick said was
"""wasn't it the case that the reason AOL stopped investing in browsers and in Gecko is that they just completed a deal with Microsoft where they had agreed to use IE or the Microsoft rendering engine in their browser."""
Is that right?
"Yes, that's right."
"The AOL client, that I forgotten about."
So Microsoft managed to buy AOL out of their own browser effort.
But it was good for us.
"Because that didn't seem like a lot of assets, but it was really critical to us."
"We had thought before about starting our own effort at mozilla.org but without the name, it would have been really hard."
"And four giant servers doesn't seem like much today, but in that era it was a big deal."
"We also got some seed money from them, we got 2 million dollars."
That was a funny story too because
"I had ended up working with Mitch Kapor,"
"I don't know if you know, from Lotus, those who remember Lotus 1-2-3, and Mitch had come to see that open source was really important, after he left Lotus and he had his own open source organisation, and I was working with him."
And he really stepped in to help us.
So Mozilla has a history of things appearing when we need them.
"There is that saying that is it luck, or is it effort, or is it skill."
Question from Diane.
I noticed some attendees at the NASCSP conference asked how they could apply for Promise Neighborhood funds.
Are you seeing more of this happening in the CAA network?
Mark: there are a couple of agencies that are receiving/applying for Promise Neighborhood funds.
I don't know that I've seen a lot of increases in this.
Promise funds are a relatively smaller program right now and it has a very specific focus.
"I have not seen a large number of agencies that are looking at this as a source of funds, but it certainly is similar work to what a lot of agencies are doing."
Brad:
"Bob Scott, are you still with us?"
Bob:
I am.
Brad:
"Bob thanks for being patient through this very long discussion, and as we approach the end, having heard what we said earlier regarding the FY ""13, we hope to hear on the reallocation within a matter of days on FY ""14."
What are your thoughts?
Where do you see the program right now in terms of funding?
Bob:
"Well, I still think that we're at levels below what is really needed to sustain a national weatherization program, and I hope we can make that impression on Congress that $184 million minus a possible $24 million for the multi-family initiative will not keep maintaining this program."
Can we survive 2013 on $68 million plus whatever might be added by DOE?
Perhaps we can.
"I'd like to think we can, but it's only a matter of time before these types of numbers destroy the network."
"We're on very thin ice with it and I hope something can change, and we'll be working to do that."
We need to at least get to those pre-recovery act levels of $225 million.
So I hope we can get by.
"I think most states can hang on for another year, but I think the term, ""we could get starved to death"" is a good way of putting it."
It's certainly something that I fear and hope we can change.
Brad:
Certainly our strategy is to get the funding back to the pre-recovery act levels.
We're talking with
"Senators Reed and Collins right now about an ask in the range of $225 million for FY ""14."
"Elyse was with us Earlier, Senator Reed's Legislative Director, and when she referred to the member request letter, that's where we're having the conversations right now."
And we're looking at the figure right in the range of $225 million.
That's where strategy is.
I'm going to show you one last technique.
"And in fact, we're going to put quotes around the word better, but it does better than even this kind of binary search, and that's a method called hashing."
"You've actually seen hashing, you just don't know it."
Hashing is the the technique that's used in Python to represent dictionaries.
Hashing is used when you actually come in to Logan
Airport and Immigration or Homeland Security checks your picture against a database.
Hashing is used every time you enter a password into a system.
So what in the world is hashing?
"Well, let me start with a simple little example."
Suppose I want to represent a collection of integers.
This is an easy little example.
And I promise you that the integers are never going to be anything other than between the range of zero to nine.
"OK, so it might be the collection of one and five."
"It might be two, three, four, eight."
"I mean some collection of integers, but I guarantee you it's between zero and nine."
Here's the trick I can play.
"I can build -- I can't count -- I could build a list with spots for all of those elements, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
"And then when I want to create my set, I could simply put a one everywhere that that integer falls."
"So if I wanted to represent, for example, this is the set two, six and eight, I put a one in those slots."
"This seems a little weird, but bear with me for second, in fact, I've given you a little piece a code to do it, which is the next piece of code on the hand out."
So let's take a look at it for second.
This little set of code here from create insert and number.
What's create do?
"It says, given a low and a high range, in this case it would be zero to nine."
I'm going to build a list.
"Right, you can see that little loop going through there."
What am I doing?
I'm creating a list with just that special symbol none in it.
So I'm building the list.
I'm returning that as my set.
"And then to create the object, I'll simply do a set of inserts."
"If I want the values two, six and eight in there, I would do an insert of two into that set, an insert of six into that set, and an insert of eight into the set."
"Several core members of the TED community, during what was a 2-year transition process, really got behind it, Jeff Bezos, John Doerr, Sunny Bates,"
"Linda Stone, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and -- actually some people in this room who I won't embarrass, but thank you -- really swung the community around to believing that TED could go on."
"And so, the first event did pretty much sell out well ahead of time."
"As a junior at 2003, there was one of the things that I felt like really needed to happen."
"I felt like this sense of inspiration and possibility that always hit people at TED, we just needed to do something with that."
There was so much potential there to make a difference in the real world.
What could we do?
"So, at the end of TED 2003,"
"I urged the audience to consider getting behind some of these big, wild causes"
"like AlDS, fresh water, you know,  the ocean's crisis."
"And, some people loved it."
"And, some really didn't."
"I mean, the truth is, one person's cause is another person's ""Dear God, please shoot me now""."
"And, it is!"
"In a conference filled on how people re-discover wonder, a sense of possibility, curiosity, you have to be really careful what you kind of do that might be perceived as cramming something down someone's throat."
"So, a few longstanding members of the TED community were thorouly pissed off, and actually left. and I thought I might have blown it."
"However, that little kerfuffle led to something very special."
"A group of us went away for a weekend, and we brain-stormed about, look, there's got to be a way to do this."
This stuff really matters.
"It's actually, inherently, quite interesting"
How do we bring to it to TED in a more TED-like way?
"And, what that led to was this."
"So, every year, we bring 3 remarkable people to TED and give them this unique proposition."
Come and make a wish.
Tell us your dream.
You can make one wish without restriction.
"This process has, first of all, allowed us to bring people to TED we could never have brought."
"Second, it brought to the conference, the world biggest issues in a way that seemed different, magical, exciting, and in a way which led to an extraordinary range of collaborative projects that frankly wouldn't have happened in any other way."
"One is ""One.org."""
"Cameron Sinclair is in the room actually, TED prize winner, Cameron."
Where are you?
Here you go.
I tell it every time
"Now you're all here for eternity which I hardly need to tell you is a heck of a long time, so you'll all know each other pretty well by the end"
"But for now I'll have to split you up into groups, will you stop screaming? thank you"
"Now murderers? murderers over here please, thank you"
"Looters and pillagers over here, thieves if you could join them, and lawyers, you're in that one"
"Fornecators, if you step forward, by god there are a lot of you"
Can I just split you up into adulterers and the rest male adulterers if you could just form a line in front of that small gillotine in the corner
"The french, are you here?"
If you'd just like to come here with the germans
I'm sure you'll have plenty to talk about
Ateists
"Ateists over here please, you must be feeling a right bunch of nitwits"
And finally Christians
I'm afraid the jews were right
"Are there any questions? yes? no, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets"
"If you've read your Bible, you'I notice it was damnation without relief so if you didn't go before you came, I don't belive you'll enjoy yourself very much"
But I believe that's the idea
"OK, so it's over to you, Adolf, and I'll catch you all later at the BBQ, bye"
well this is a plane is this a UFO?
"This is my uncle, Charlie Rodriguez and that's his horse, Lucky."
My Uncle Charlie has won all-around cowboy at the Fortuna Rodeo more times than he can remember.
"In fact, he won three consecutive years in the 1990s."
"Charlie's won buckles for calf roping, calf branding, team roping, team penning, wild cow milking, and steer wrestling."
(music)
"Charlie was born into the vaquero tradition in Fort Davis, Texas."
This is a style of horsemanship based on respect and communication between horse and rider.
Now everyone knows that cattle were not indigenous to America.
"It is rumored that in 1521, a Spanish sea captain, Gregorio Villa Lobos, set sail for"
"Vera Cruz, Mexico, with six cows and a bull."
"Along with the introduction of the cow the Spanish also introduced Vaquero working skills, which were further developed in Mexico and became the foundation for the cattle ranching culture in Texas, which brings us to the place where Charlie got his start: the Kokernot 06 Ranch."
My grandfather worked for the 06 for 45 years.
He was the main boss.
He studied business and I studied economics and Sinology.
"When he finished his studies, he asked himself, what to do?"
Then he had the following idea:
"This is myrrh, a natural resin from the myrrh-tree."
And this myrrh-tree finds extremely well climate conditions in Somalia.
Therefor this is the resource - here you can smell it - please give it to your neighbors -
- for which the world still needs Somalia.
Then Ahmed had the idea to import myrrh from Somalia to Germany.
"This is used in shampoos, in many cometics, medicine as well. - the back rows will be happy if you pass it on."
"Ahmed founded a firm for this export business, here Mercatus GmbH, in Hobrecht Street 28, Berlin."
This firm is also the kitchen of his flat.
"The business works well, but sometimes he looses control."
Which is mainly due to Somalia and the civil war there.
And now actually comes the main punchline of this evening.
"Mister Liu Xenfang from Hongkong, who built the National Theatre in Somalia, who now runs a shop in Nairobi, found Ahmed's firm on the internet."
"He had the idea to invest in this myrrh-business, buy myrrh from ahmed, sell it to the far east."
But he heard that the myrrh from Somalia is often shit.
"There's goat-shit in it, or splints of shell or other shit."
"He didn't want this, therefor he wanted to check the situation on the ground himself."
"In summer 2011 Ahmed and Liu planned a journey to the Horn of Africa, in order to sort things out with the farmers there."
"And Ahmed asked me to join this journey, to make research there, and develop a theatre play out of it."
And then I searched in Germnay for people to participate in this.
"Hello, my name is Chang Bee, I come from Taiwan."
"I studied classical singing in Taiwan, this means, learning to sing in the way that the european opera needs."
Therefore I wanted to go to Europe when I finshed my studies in Taiwan.
"In order to learn it even better, where this aesthetic comes from."
And I went to Berlin for an entrance examination.
Somalia is not the kind of country where one can travel spontaneously.
I wandered about security concerns in advance of our journey.
"I wanted to plan it well, wanted to know which places are really dangerous, then we could figure out a route which is not critical, or do I have to cancel it all, because it's to dangerous everywhere?"
"When you make a good plan in Taiwan, you ask an authority which can tell you."
I asked my teacher when I wanted to go to Europe.
"(shouts, claps)"
"Hello, everyone, my name is Jonathan, and I am from Taiwan."
My project starts with my friend Jack.
"My friend Jack couldn't see, and he wants to know how people around him ""look"" like."
"How his friends, his family look like, but he was too shy to ask, so I designed little invitation cards that he could give to his family, or to his classmates, to his teachers, and to his friends."
"To tell them that he wants to feel their faces, and see if they accept it."
"Through the project,"
"I learned that it is the first time that Jack ever touched his mother's face, and I am very touched, and by the same time I feel very warm."
"And I think there are many people like Jack out there, so I printed more cards, and I spread them out to other organizations."
"We hope to help more people, and this is my story."
Thank you.
"(claps, shouts)"
"Hi, everyone, my name is Danielle, and I am form Guadalajara, Mexico."
I am here to share my story about
"""The Kilometer of Love,"" my project."
"Well, it all starts well..."
"I invented the project, so that we can help our children that have cancer from all around the world, so that they have better medications, and so that they could live a better life."
"And I believe that this program, it can help everyone, it showed me to never give up, no matter what the problem is, and that we can all make a difference, even someone like me, and we do it all from the heart, thank you."
"[claps, shouts]"
"Hello, I'm Katelyn Freedberg from Pearl River,"
"New York, and my classmates and I did a project."
"We tried to prevent bullying from happening in our school, because it's a big problem, and we wanted everyone in the school to have someone there for them when they need help, so we decided to have ADDvertisements instead of regular advertisements because they subtract from us."
"But we wanted to add something to someone's life, so, yeah."
"Our ADDvertisements were posters that display positive messages, such as ""Kindness doesn't cost anything"","
"""Be a friend not a bully"", and ""This is a bully-free zone""."
And we display these messages throughout the school.
"As soon as our peers began to understand what these messages meant, words began to turn into actions, and soon enough you couldn't find anyone who is lonely at lunch table, everyone have someone there for them."
"So, thank you."
"[Car starting, tires screeching]"
The first sight of Pyongyang is pretty dismal.
[Anthem playing in background]
We're in a hotel that's about 47 stories tall.
like it was quickly ported over.
"It doesn't convey that level of effort, and people are going to see that and make judgments off of how much effort you put into it."
It's kind of a negative note to end it on.
"All right, well thank you for coming."
Hey there.
I'm Paul Irish.
I'm a Developer Advocate on the Google Chrome team and today
I'm going to show some advanced uses of the core Chrome Dev Tools features.
"First, let's enter into the dev tools."
It's common to use the app's menu.
"And you can also use a keyboard shortcut, like Ctrl-shift-I on Windows or Cmd-option-I on Mac."
But I prefer to open them by right-clicking on an element and choosing Inspect.
"Now that we have this open, I can navigate the DOM by clicking on the arrows, but it's much quicker to use the keyboard arrow keys to traverse up and down the DOM tree."
"You'll notice as I'm selecting these elements, I get an onscreen blue highlight, but I also get a css selector that represents that element, along with its current width and height."
"Sometimes, I like to zoom out of the page with ctrl - to get the full view while I do this."
"Now, over in the Console tab, I'd like to share a few things."
"Let's say that you have a big string coming from your app, and you want to copy it into your clipboard."
"While you certainly could highlight the entire string with your mouse, it's much more effective to use the console's built in copy method."
I can now paste this wherever I am going.
Sometimes you get too much text in the console.
You can use the clear() function to clear it out.
"Or, of course, the clear icon below will do just the same."
"Now sometimes, you have a reference to a DOM element, and you want to inspect it."
"Right now, I have a reference to the big headline on the page."
A simple way to do that is the console's inspect function.
"Now, let's say you have the reverse:"
You're
"looking at an element in the Elements tab, but you want to access it via scripts."
What
I used to do is add an ID onto the element and use getElementByld.
You'll notice I brought up the console right here.
"In fact, I can toggle on a console on every tab of the dev tools with the escape key."
"So if I had the buffer contents A, B, C, D, E, right, and if I could slam those into a vector, and then I would need one other little bit of information here, which is where is the cursor in any given point because the cursor is actually where the uncertain lead operations take place relative to the cursor."
"The buffer's also going to manage that, knowing where the insertion point is and then deleting it and inserting relative to that."
"So I say, okay."
I need some index.
The cursor actually is between two character positions.
"This is like slot zero, one, and two."
"And the cursor is between, actually, one and two."
"And there's just a minor detail to kind of have worked out before we start trying to write this code, which is do we want the cursor to hold the index on the character that's to the left of it or to the right of it."
"It's totally symmetric, right."
"If I have these five characters, it could be that my cursor then goes from zero to four, it could be that it goes from zero to five, or it could be it goes from negative one to four, depending on which way I'm doing it."
I'm going to happen to use the one that does zero to five where it's actually recorded as the character that's after it.
Okay.
So that's just kind of the staring point.
I'm going to write some code and make it happen.
So I'm going to remove this.
"Reference it, that's okay."
And then I'm going to add the things I want to replace it with.
So I put in the editor code and to put in the buffer code.
Was buffer already in here?
I think buffer's already here.
Okay.
Let's take a look.
I get my buffer.
"So right now, let's take a look what's in buffered."
I think I have the starting set information.
"So it has move cursor over, you know move the cursor around, it has the delete, and it has - let me make it have some variables that I want."
I've got my cursor.
I've got my vector of characters.
"Right now, it has a lot of copying, I think, just in anticipation of going places where copying is going to be required."
"Right now, because it's using vector and vector has deep copying behavior, I'm actually okay if I let windows copy and go through."
But I'm actually going to not do that right away.
All right.
"So, conversation mode will be available on Google Translate in a few months."
We just wanted to give you a sneak preview.
I have just one more demo to show you before I go.
This is actually launching this week.
"It's the new Street View Ul, which will launch as part of an update to Google Maps for Android."
"And to show you that demonstration,"
"I'd like to take a quick trip to Florence in Italy, so I'm going to click on the bookmark here on my desktop."
"So here we are in Florence, Firenze."
I'm going to zoom in a few times and move around.
"Now, to activate the Street View feature, I can click on the business so I can just hold in place anywhere on the map, so which is exactly what I'm going to do here."
Let me try a different--slightly a different place.
So here we are.
"So, I can click on this little guy here, we call him Pegman and he will just launch the UI for me."
"So what you see here is a beautiful, you know, three-dimensional panorama on Street"
"View and there's a little guy here which we just launched, and if I drag Pegman around, you'll see this little circle, we call it the pancake; and the pancake actually knows the three-dimensional structure of the scene pretty well, so you can see that it understands that there are building and facades; and I can just drag it where I want to go, just"
"like I do on the desktop, and it will just take me there."
"Pretty cool, right?"
So it looks
"like there's something interesting here down the street, so let's keep going a little bit."
Let me just try this again.
Sorry about that.
So let's take an even bigger leap here.
So
I just keep going down the street and there's a beautiful building down there which I would
love to take a closer look.
"Now, here, I just want to show off this again."
Look how amazingly well is the understanding of the 3D scene here that we have with Street View.
"So I can actually get very close to that building down there, that's the Santa Croce Cathedral here in Firenze or over in Firenze."
"Again, I can zoom at it more closely."
"So if I want to take a look at the very specific details of the facade, I can see them in high resolution."
"This is beautiful, almost as if I were right there."
So these are the demos that I wanted to share with you.
(Laughter)
"So, anyway, we started and  because I have the disability,"
"I asked a colleague to teach with me because there are days I just can't walk and there are days that  my voice is not so good, so I always worked with a colleague."
So we started off about 8 years ago.
We had no money and what we had to do  is we have to make sure that we have enough students  to be able to pay the teachers.
"So, that is one of the most important lessons for you to think about."
We keep waiting for money and  permission to do this work.
And you don't have to do that.
You just have to step into it and  you have to find a way to integrate it.
"So whether you do luncheon learns for the teachers, whether you do it after school program, whether you integrate it into the teachers' morning coffee, however you are going to do it."
There are so many different ways  to be able to start to integrate mindfulness  and mindfulness meditation.
"Jack is right; that  if you teach the teachers, it will be contagious and  it will go right through the classroom."
"So, now I teach at University of Toronto,  and I also teach APEC master."
"So, two universities  for the mindfulness program."
That's remarkable.
And why are they asking?
"Because they realize that in health care in particular, not in education that is our issue, my program is addressing the professionalism which includes education but largely is a lot  of health care professionals."
We are suffering.
"I would say that right across the board, the society is suffering."
I think the world is suffering.
And we have forgotten how it is  that we are to attend this suffering.
So this is my goal and I have 60 workshops at University of Toronto and  there are 40 faculties.
Many of them who are here today.
"Okay, go ahead, hit the gong."
(Laughter)
That is another thing  mindfulness can do for you.
It just allows you just a larger vision because you perceptual feel changes.
(Laughter)
So I want to say to you that this is easy.
You can't be stuck in your demoralization  and we are all feeling demoralized.
"When you start to think back  to the early work of Thay around the Vietnamese war or Martin Luther King we worked with, you can imagine their demoralization  around seeing so many people injured."
We have gone the longest  of any civilization without war.
"What happened was not just people passed them on and surprising numbers viewed them, the tone of response we got back astonished us."
"People laughed, people cried, people were inspired, people tell their friends."
"This word again, passion."
"We saw the passion and that was a clue, that was something bigger here."
"So, we made a decision in 2007 that TED really officially was no longer a conference."
TED was going to be this.
[Slide reads:]
We engineered the web site to be built around spreading free talks to the world.
"And to our astonishment and delight, TED community far from being upset that we were giving away the crown jewels, shared this on, it was a thrilling to see."
"So, where is this going?"
"In 2009, we've seen the continuation of this process."
"Just letting TED go free to the world, we had this Open Translation Project, which has been thrilling seeing literally hundreds of translators take TED, bring those talks to their own communities."
"And, now, this TEDx program, spreading the live events to the world."
Where is it heading?
"Well, the truth is I don't know."
"I think it's an incredible fact, an incredible discovery really that millions of people around the world are wanting knowledge."
"You know, they want this re-discovery of wonder."
They want the sense of possibility.
And they actually want to be part of shaping the future.
That's a surprise and that's thrilling in its own right.
"But, even more thrilling is this."
"TED is part of much bigger revolution in, I'd say, global education that's made possible by the web."
"It's an amazing fact that people like this can become a new type of global icon, that the role of teacher in our world is about to become sexy, wonderful, you know, I mean,  and it should have always been, right?"
But that hasn't been for the last few years.
Teachers can reach people across the world.
That is amazing.
"And I... if you ask what my dream was, I think the way I would answer it, would be to look at this picture here."
These are kids photographed in the village in Pakistan not far from where I was born.
Their parents would have been born about the same time as me.
"Unlike me, I had an education and got to live an amazing life, they didn't have that chance."
They lived a life griding out a living in tough conditions.
"They're beautiful children,  may have a different chance."
I'm sure there is something else she's into
"No, there is nothing else"
"Ohh, there's toothpaste on this shirt."
"Someone needs to invent invisible toothpaste, please."
I see your little tongue.
Why don't you show everyone?
Look at that little tongue.
Yes.
Today's video's gonna be a little bit angry.
Little bit.
It's gonna be sort of a rant.
"So if you don't have time for that, then there's plenty of other things on the Internet for you to consume yourself with, so just go ahead and click off."
"So I don't think I've ever done this on my channel before, where I address, like, one thing that someone's said or written,"
"But I'm gonna do that today, because it's relevant and also because I think I can help people."
"What I want to talk about has to do with this fucking, absolute dickhead who wrote maybe one of the dumbest things I've ever read."
And his name is [fumbling pronunciation]
"Yuksel Aytug — I don't know how to fucking say that — wrote an article about how the Olympic Games are, quote, ""killing womanhood."""
Let me just read to you some of this article.
And I'm gonna link it below so you can go look at it.
"He's Turkish, I think the original article is written in Turkish, so this is a translation, but you'll get the gist of it."
"Basically what he's saying is that their bodies don't look like women, and to ""take a look at female swimmers."""
"""Broad-shouldered, flat-chested women with small hips."""
"They're ""totally indistinguishable from men."""
"""Their breasts — the symbol of womanhood, motherhood — flattened into stubs as they were seen as mere hindrances to speed."""
"He said the Olympics force women to ""look more like men,"" and ""the manlier you look the more successful you are."""
"Then he said that you should get bonus points according to how ""feminine"" you looked."
"""Otherwise we will destroy the grace and naïveté of women through the Olympics."""
"First of all, since we're objectifying people as tits and ass,"
"I'm gonna show you a picture of Ayteg [mispronounced], fucking whatever his name is."
"We're gonna call you ""Ponytail"" from now on."
"Now, I don't think that most people would agree with Ponytail."
"And, in fact, a lot of the Internet was angry, so I'm not going to try and slam him, for obvious reasons."
Uh huh.
"And it doesn't look bad on the phone, we still, we still probably, we're still gonna add a um, MPS piece, and try to get involved, to be more responsive probably the next day."
"But uh, yeah the night that some of these people that were on our team that, that are really."
"You know the staff from the responsive design and the nine sixty, you know that Mh-hm And all those kinds of things, you know, we don't have a lot of information, I would think and a lot of information that is going to come and that kind of that and that would be really helpful What's the next, what's the direction of the website?"
"It'd be kind of nice if you guys had something about it, a little discussion could start, th e future of the web and things like that."
"Yeah, we are definitely focusing much more on that in the coming year."
"We want to do a lot more, we have a user experience fundamentals course coming out, content strategy."
"We're looking at doing usability testing, a lot more."
Fundamental information that will help as you approach your project.
"Whether it's a redesign or a new, a new site."
"And um, we've really focused on tools in the past."
How do I use Flash to do what I'm trying to do?
But I think that um.
"An area that we really want to look at is, now that you are in conjunction with tools, it's, it's just as important to understand why you are doing what you're doing."
"And to, to make the best decisions for your site and, and your membership, or your viewership."
"Right, mm-hm. , That is very interesting."
"And especially because the way, technology is being consumed, has so fundamentally changed, with mobile devices."
People are actually having these conversations now.
"You know, people are talking about responsive design, or they're talking about, uh, user experience."
"And it, it wasn't, much of a conversation a year ago."
"And, um, I think that people really, are."
"Are looking for this type of information, and it sounds like this would be beneficial for, for your project as well."
"Yea, particularly right now cuz I think that everybody I think is going to be redesigning their web right now."
Trying to get moving towards.
See the social media kind of stuff.
Right.
Yeah.
How do we integrate social media effectively.
How do we.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And then we, and then we."
"A load of pople, and suddenly a sofa flying over everybody."
A sofa appeared through the street and they carried it into the square.
JL:
(laughs) Yes!
There have been precious moments that I didn't experience but they've told me about them.
"Like the first morning they ate rice with prawns, because the neighbours' were so supportive, or people who came from far away, brought a pot, and although they couldn't stay, they left it there so others could eat."
"And I remember the first or second night, they brought nine pizzas that someone had ordered for us from Galicia."
Someone in Galicia called a pizzeria close to Sol and put 9 pizzas on their credit card and asked them to be delivered to the kids that were there.
"That doesn't happen in real life, or maybe it does and we don't see it, that there are people that generous."
ST:
"I remember, maybe on the 17th, the second or third day, people from a restaurant came with beans and rice pudding."
"And I was so happy, for a few moments..."
JL:
"That was the Asturian, he also took cider."
He also took some of his own cider.
"I don't know if it's the same asturian, but a co-worker of mine interviewed that gentleman."
And he took his lorry.
"He took a lorry full of soft drinks of a particular brand, maybe we'll find out if it was the brand or the bar that sent them."
But there were very beautiful moments of true solidarity and communal generosity.
But that's not what it's all about.
Although it allowed the atmosphere to be very pacific.
"And the atmosphere swallowed up the very few who maybe would have liked to cause problems, because that was their way of fighting the system."
But that's not the debate
I want to go into.
"What I mean is that soon those people who usually do that kind of thing, they didn't because they were swallowed up by the multitude which said: ""we don't do that kind of thing here, we've decided that's not how we want to protest for now""."
That's an important force.
"And then the third moment of emotion was during the confluence of the ""northwest march"" and the ""northeast march"" on the 19th of July which was the first authentically hetergeneous demostration."
They came from different neighbourhoods and cities.
The moment they joined together at a roundabout on the Castellana.
Patricia:
Gregorio Marañón [in the background]
JL:
"So, watch out for that kind of thing, especially the multiple people have looked at the draft and edited the draft, references tend to get lost in the shuffle."
So here's an example of the first kind of thing I was talking about.
"So you, some authors give a reference to back up a statement."
You go to the original reference and it just doesn't back up the statement.
So here's an example.
"I'm going to pick on a particular example from something I was reading lately but again, These authors are by no means the only ones who do this."
"This is very, very common."
"So, I read the sentence."
These data are particularly disturbing as the UVC emission is even larger than ambient sunlight on a mountain.
"Now, I was writing about this for the lay public and so I thought, well great, here"
I've got a comparison that anybody can understand.
"The amount of UVC, if you're exposed to sunlight on a mountain."
"Well, that's a great way to put this in my piece."
So I wanted to get more information about this.
"I thought that was an interesting and cute fact, a good fact to use for a piece for the lay public."
"And I also had a question, because when they say it's larger than ambient sunlight on the mountain, they didn't give any time frame."
"So, is it larger than the amount that you'd get in one minute?"
Is it larger than the amount that you'd get in an hour?
So there was no reference right there.
So I needed to go back to the original references to get more information.
"And again, I, I'm doing this often for various reasons like, like we've been writing something for the lay public and I see an interesting statistic or fact that"
I wanna trace back.
Alright.
"So, to go to reference thirteen, Well, it's, it's you know, a URL."
"It's, it's a website link and it was broken."
"So, the, the link doesn't work."
"I get, you know, an error message."
It does bring me to a site.
So I search on that site and there's no relevant information about UVC emissions on a mountain on that site that I can find.
Maybe I didn't do a great search.
"So maybe, you know, the URL, link got broken, you know, between the time the authors wrotethe paper and, the time it was sent, it was published."
"Could have happened, But anyway, it's a problem because again,"
I know the labor HHS subcommittee's due the 26th.
I think most have planned it on that day.
Brad:
"Let's talk for just a minute about what that involves, because we've just been engaging with our community, many of whom are on the webinar today."
What's the strategy for the member request?
Are you seeking to be going out with Senator Collins on a broad-based letter?
Hopefully we can get 34 Senators or more.
Elyse:
Yes.
That's the hope and plan.
We are currently working with Senator Collins on finalizing a letter which we hope to get done in the next couple of days so that we can start circulating.
"The process is compressed this year because we only just finished up the FY ""13 process a few weeks ago and passing that continuing resolution for the rest of the year."
So now we're in this turn around.
We thought we would have a bit more time on these letters.
Chairwoman Mikulski really wants to get the process started.
The House is moving on a much faster clip with their member request deadline.
We're in this period where we're going to try to get this letter out in the next couple of days and share it with you so you can share it with your membership.
"And hopefully we will have the same kind of broad-based push for this letter as we did for the FY ""13 letter."
"Those kinds of efforts among the state directors and the people on the field to go out and call members of Congress, in this case the Senate, to say, ""This is an important issue, and I really would like you to sign this letter""."
That helps us get the signatures.
"The more signatures we have, the more signatures we can show, the better off we are in terms of trying to get a better number on the Senate Appropriations bill."
Last year the number was higher and we want to see the same this year.
Brad:
Absolutely.
Thanks to Senator Reed's efforts and Senator Collins for working together to get that number up to $145 million last year.
"But, very well said on the importance of the stake holder direct communication with the members."
Arley and I are on the Hill virtually every day.
"They see us, they know us, but when they hear from their own states and districts it makes such a huge, huge difference."
Elyse:
It's that human's touch.
That on the ground level knowing a constituent is calling.
You need both.
Dylan:
"Well the founder, Salman Khan, started out by posting lessons for his cousin on YouTube and now the Khan Academy has over a million unique students per month and boasts more than 2,000 tutorials covering everything from basic addition and subtraction to advanced calculus, physics and chemistry and joining us now is Ben Goldhirsh, the CEO of GOOD, it's a company dedicated to moving the world forward through its website, magazine, videos and events."
He thought that Khan was one of the breakout stars at this year's
Technology and Entertainment and Design conference.
"Before we get to all this Khan Academy business Ben, do you like it better when we're on opposite coasts or would you be comfortable if I was to move out to California to spend more time with you?"
Ben:
"I would love to have you out here Dylan, I think we do better in person."
Dylan:
And do you feel that you speak on behalf of the entire southern California community when you welcome me into that universe?
Ben:
The thoughtful ones.
Dylan:
(laughs) Okay the thoughtful ones.
We won't get into how many thoughtful ones there are but we will get into this.
Why did you decide to feature this so prominently with GOOD?
Ben:
"For the past two years, GOOD and University of Phoenix have been focusing on solutions in this education space and we haven't seen anything like it and to contextualize the findings for you, look at Los Angeles."
"We have Teach for America, we have City Year, we have KlPP Academy."
The best of the best of social innovators but they're facing a serious problem.
"600,000 students in LAUSD with a 50 percent graduation rate."
"That's terrifying and the bottom line is the solutions that we have on the ground, in my opinion, aren't going to catch this problem."
"We need a disruptive technology, we need to really revolutionize how we're tackling this."
Khan Academy is the first thing I've seen that gives me confidence that we're going to tackle it.
"It's the most exciting thing I've seen that we're doing to do this so I'm pleased to bring it to your show,"
I think we're going to dig into a good conversation.
Dylan:
Alright let's have at it.
"The man behind the idea joins us, Salman Khan."
Founder of the Khan Academy.
High praise for what you've got going from our friend Ben down there in southern California.
"He's a thoughtful southern Californian, is how he likes to refer to himself."
What have you found is the biggest problem with this?
"But, I were working on a portrait, someone's face, then I'd probably would lower the Detail slider and increase the Masking slider because I don't want every little detail in a subject's skin to be exaggerated by sharpening."
Now I wanna mention that these sharpening controls affect the entire image but if you wanna apply more or less sharpening to a specific area you can do that using one of the two local tools which I'll cover in the next chapter; the adjustment brush and the graduated filter.
And I'll also mention that sometimes you can apply a sharpening preset and that will do all the work for you.
Lightroom does shift with the number of presets.
Those are located over here in the left column in the Presets Panel which I'll open by clicking this triangle.
The presets in Lightroom 4 are inside of
Subject Matter folders.
These are User Presets and in the User Presets there is a folder of Lightroom General Presets.
"And here, I have two Sharpening presets that come with the program."
A Sharpening preset for faces and another for scenes like this one and you can certainly try those out at least as the starting place and then you can tweak the sliders to taste.
Were you fooled?
It's not that tricky.
The answer is still the same.
"Energy is an amazing quantity, but before we can start making calculations using it, we're going to need to learn about something called potential energy."
"-What's happenin', forum?"
"So imagine that you're in your bedroom, getting undressed and you're butt-ass naked."
But then you look out your window and you see this pervert.
Buhh...
"Now, I don't know this perverted cat's name, so we'll just call him Quagmire."
"Now, Quagmire's video got, like, a half million views and I don't know why."
"I mean, look at him."
Just creepin'.
Waiting for you to leave the room so he can sneak in and sniff your underwear.
"And what's with cats, you know?"
"I mean, a dog might rape your leg, but he isn't gonna cut off your penis and wear it like a mask"

"Okay, I actually didn't want to review the next video, but like literally billions of you sent it to me."
"Literally, billions... or hundreds, but you know, who's counting?"
So this awful video got like a million-and-a-half views in a day after it was promoted on FailBlog.
And you know what?
Just here...enjoy.
We also made an initial experience for people they could relate to.
That's our Start page.

[Question]
Do you want to?
"You don't have mics, and there's no mic for that."
How about... you (...)
So I'm gonna step back.
How did Firefox come into being?
"Firefox had started in a few years before, in 2001 maybe, where it became clear that the old products had a bunch of problems."
"Not only was it really built for developers and much too powerful, not too powerful but not elegant and not beautiful on how it displayed its power."
"And it was a combined browser, email client, IRC client, app launcher environment."
"This was a cause of intense fighting and so a small group of engineers went off and had an idea for doing something more elegant, just a browser, that was focussed on a product a family would want to use."
So there were five or six of them.
[Question]
Yeah.
So Dan says a couple of those guys were at Netscape working on the suite as their day job and during their spare time some were community members and some were not engineers like Asa was involved
"So that had been bubbling a lot for a while, and so on."
It wasn't anywhere near done and it was both a source of a relief and some contention for the engineers working on it.
Was there more you wanted to say?
Ok.
"So it had been bubbling a lot and existed in a source code repository,"
I think when we formed the foundation it was 0.2 or maybe 0.3.
That's probably a good time to tell the story of the name of Firefox.
"So when it was first started, the engineers thought"
"""wow we're building a new browser out of the ashes of Mozilla 1.0"" and so it was named Phoenix."
[Question]
For a really non-product but Mozilla/Browser when it came to have a name it was Phoenix.
"Well, there is a company, Phoenix Technologies, it's a BlOS company, it's been around forever, they once had a browser kind of thing and so the World of Trademarks contacted us and said we couldn't use the name Phoenix and we looked at it and they were probably right, they had a product that was pretty close."
"So of course, from Phoenix, the next obvious name is Firebird."
"So our browser was Firebird for one or two releases and it turns out there was, and still is, an open source database project by the name of Firebird."
[Question]
"I'm saying that when you ask teachers, ""What do you mean when you tell your students to 'pay attention,' 'focus,' 'concentrate.'"""
"You know, just like a camera, hold that image still."
I go to the students.
"So when your teacher tells you, ""Pay attention, focus, concentrate."""
What is she telling you?
Hold that image still as if you were taking a picture?
"I ask people at work, old people, young -- everybody says the same thing."
"Well, in fact, the only way you can really pay attention, most of the time, is to vary the image."
"So, whey don't you sort of look at your finger."
Do -- look at your finger.
"Now, if you want to stay attentive to your finger, you have to notice new things."
You can't just see it as the same way it was yesterday.
"I say, my goodness, this finger is different from an hour ago."
I notice a little piece of dirt here; there's a wrinkle I wasn't aware of...
That noticing these things is what keeps you attentive.
Right.
"So, in fact, we have all these people who are trying to pay attention..."
So we assume it's just a finger.
"Well, when you assume it's just a finger; (it can't change) that there's nothing new that by not looking for newness (right), it fades from view."
It's a very hard thing to do.
"When you're noticing new things about it, which is the essence of mindfulness and mindful learning, is that it becomes interesting to you."
Even something that might seem so uninteresting as (a finger!) the tip of your finger.
"Now, but this has tremendous implications for things like"
Hey!
"For today's illustration, I'm going to be using some pieces of paper."
"Now, if I take these pieces of paper and try to juggle them..."
...it doesn't work very well!
I can't do it!
"But if I take the paper and mold it into the shape of a juggling ball, it becomes something I can work with and use."
We need to be kind of like these pieces of paper -- we need to allow God to shape us and mold us into what He wants us to be.
"See, God wants to do all kinds of awesome things through us, but if we don't allow Him to shape us and mold us into what He wants us to be, then how are we supposed to be of use?"
Isaiah 64:8 talks about God as our potter and us as the clay.

"(R. Brady) Thank you John, thank you all."
Thank you all.
We now have about 25 minutes  for questions and answers.
"Please, there are some microphones in the center aisle."
"Please make your question brief, the answers also may also be brief."
Please ask your question  of the whole group and whoever feels led to respond would do so.
"It maybe that no one feels ready to respond and your question needs just to sit with you, which is a wonderful form  of contemplation."
Rilke talks about it in a very famous  quotation about living the questions.
"We all have questions that will take years for us to get answers to, so we might not get them today."
Let's begin with the first question.
"(Man in the audience) Hello,"
I grew up and started practicing as a child in a discipline which is quite different  than anything you do.
And actually I became a teacher  of this tradition.
That tradition was alloted to and added to science.
"Science as a tradition, as a discipline, has become the dominant one  in our culture today."
"Now, one of the interesting things is that over the time that I was teaching,"
I was trying to teach the students one thing.
That is to understand reality.
"And I find that the Buddhist tradition is essentially trying to allow you  to do the same thing, to see reality clearly  and to understand it."
"I wonder whether you teach the students using the Four Noble Truths, etc, to do that."
"(M. Chaban) The new science is going to be something that doesn't divide subject and object, is not reductive and all the paradigms  that went with scientific materialism have been proven inaccurate."
"We have lived for 500 years with one world view and we are at the tipping point of what Michel Foucault, a French  philosopher would say is a new episteme."
If you look at and this is more... because I am sure you understand this if you are asking the question.
"But if you look at Dan Siegel's work,  he has done a breathless presentation  on what the new sciences will be."
It would include the subject 'the voice'.
"So, part of what we did today  is we talked about ourselves."
That wouldn't be allowed a few years ago in any kind of scientific presentation.
"Secondly of all,  we are polished scholarships."
"Some of us are Buddhists,  some of us are not."
"Yet, we deep into different traditions and use them because they counter and form each other in a positive way."
His Holiness said that Buddhism  is very scientific.

-And that will conclude Elmo's order.
Let's say I have an n-by-n matrix that looks like this.
So let me just see if I can do it in general terms.
"In the first row and first column, that entry has a 1, and then everything else, the rest of the n minus 1 rows in that first column are all going to be zeroes."
So it's going to be zeroes all the way down to the nth term.
"And then the second column, we have a 0 in the first component, but then a 1 in the second component."
And then it goes zeroes all the way down.
And you keep doing this.
"In the third row, or let me say third column, although it would've applied to the third row as well, the 1 shows up in the third component, and then it's zeroes all the way down."
"Essentially, you have the ones filling up the diagonal of this matrix right here."
"So if you go all the way to the nth column or the nth column vector, you have a bunch of zeroes until you get-- you have n minus 1 zeroes, and then the very last component, the nth component there will be a 1."
"So you have essentially, a matrix with ones down the diagonal."
"Now, this matrix has a bunch of neat properties and we'll explore it more in the future."
But I'm just exposing you to this because it has one very neat property relative to linear transformations.
"But I'm going to call this the identity matrix and I'll call this I sub n, and I called that sub n because it's an n-by-n identity matrix."
"I sub 2 would be equal to a 2-by-2 identity matrix, so it would look like that."
And I sub 3 would look like this:
"1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1."
I think you get the point.
"Now, the neat thing about this identity matrix becomes evident when you multiply it times any vector."
"We can multiply this guy times the n-component vector, a member of Rn."
So let's do that.
"By one measure, the US stock of money is now $8.7 trillion--up 12% since last year."
And some people are still pocketing a huge share of that cash.
"Last year, despite the onset of the biggest financial crisis since the Depression, his hedge fund paid George Soros a cool $2.5 billion."
That's roughly 41 000 times more than the average American family earned.
"As they say on Wall Street,"
"""Way to go."""
"Now however, imagine a world with no money."
"500 years ago, the most powerful society in South America, the Inca Empire, had no real concept of money."
The Incas appreciated the aesthetic qualities of rare metals.
Gold was the sweat of the sun.
"Silver, the tears of the moon."
"Labour was the unit of value in the Inca Empire, just as it was later supposed to be in a Communist society."
"But in 1532, the Incas ran into a man whose hunger for money had led him across an ocean."
Francisco Pizarro and his fellow conquistadors had come from Spain to what the called
"Upper Peru, inspired by the legend of Eldorado-- the realm of the gold-covered king."
"After defeating the Inca army at the Battle of Cajamarca, their quest began in earnest."
"At Potosi, in what is now Bolivia, the Spaniards struck it rich."
They discovered the Cerro Rico--
"literally, the ""rich hill""."
"Towering nearly 16 000 feet above sea level, it was a money mountain."
"In that 250 years of Spanish rule, more than 2 billion ounces of silver were extracted from mines like this one-- 14 000 feet up in the Andes."
What the Incas couldn't grasp was why the Europeans had such an insatiable lust for gold and silver.
They couldn't understand that to
"Pizarro and the Conquistadors, silver was much more than just shiny metal."
"It could be made into money-- a store of value, a unit of account-- portable power."
"I must say, I find this place pretty harrowing."
"Spaniards had a system of forced labour, which meant that every able-bodied male in the native population had to do a stint down in these mines."
And you can see why 1 in 8 of them didn't survive the ordeal.
"Today, 500 years later, conditions for miners in the Cerro Rico haven't improved much."
But at least they get paid for the work they do.
"In those days, it was a way of making money but verged on genocide."
"The silver ore was ground up, refined with mercury, and then shipped to Europe as bars and coins. made the Spanish crown rich beyond the dreams of avarice."
"I thought to myself,  ""That is a good idea."""
"Mindfulness Without Borders not only develops programs  for health-care provider, professionals and the adults that surround youth, but let's do something for youth as well."
"And in time, with a group  of wonderful practitioners, and educators and lay people, and the younger generation thinkers, we developed curriculum called  The Mindfulness Ambassador Council."
"What separates us, I believe,  from the strictly mindfulness curriculum is that we wed social and emotional  competencies into the program."
It is 12 weeks.
"We teach and facilitate conversations in a council, where we value everybody's voice equally,  where there is no discrimination."
No discrimination.
(Laughs)
"And where we appreciate diversity, where we build self-esteem and, more than ever, where we hear people, we hear anyone who is in our council."
"We hear their voices, and we value them."
"So, our core values in the organization  are core concepts of mindfulness."
Our programs that we built  are core concepts of mindfulness.
"And we start off with breathing,"
We start off with using the breath  to bring us into the present moment.
We move into understanding and  talking about some of the challenges that prevent us from being our best self.
"We develop conversation around being compassionate, empathetic, understanding."
And all through the council process where  we just deeply listen to one another.
"It has been remarkable journey, and I think that if we all begin to take what we know best, model mindfulness to others, and advocate for that together as a community,"
I think we will be stronger.
I know we are in 23 states of Toronto  capital and district school board.
"And had it not for two lovely women who  are here, Rita Mamon and Diane Benasco, we would have never gone  as deep as we have there."

Thank you very very much.
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Theo."
Can we have one bell?
(Half bell) (Bell)
(R. Brady) Our next speaker  will be Jon Kristian Salunga.
Jon is a classroom teacher  in a high school in San Diego.
"He teaches English and like many of you, he teaches in public schools."
It is probably not so easy  to actually teach a practice so that may not be  the door you come in.
We will hear from Jon  about the door he has entered.
It just doesn't solve the problem and doesn't actually fulfill its promises.
"And just was it in January, when I was going off to Indonesia to give a series of talks I got to Perth airport and found that the Garuda flight was cancelled."
It was actually delayed by about 18 hours.
"And I was a monk so I just went up to the counter and said, ""Oh is it delayed?"
When is it going to leave?
18 hours.
"Okay, thank you very much,"" and I sort-of called the monastery and got a lift back to the monastery."
"But the people behind me they were thumping the counter - ""You can't do this to us!"
"I've got all of these arrangements and plans!"" I had arrangements and plans as well - thousands of people were waiting to listen to my talks."
But I couldn't do anything about it.
And you know all that anger and all that thumping and all that shouting.. it didn't make the plane leave earlier.
It didn't do anything good at all except making people upset.
"Themselves upset, and other people upset."
So really what is the use of anger?
You can intimidate somebody for a short time but they will always want revenge.
They won't respect you.
"And if you're a boss they'll only do what you want, they'll only do what you want for the time being, only because you're there."
They won't do what you've asked them out of respect.
Just out of fear.
And that's no way to have any sort of relationship or any sort of business.
Really anger doesn't make any sense to me.
So anger and fear and grief and depression these are negative emotions.
So first of all when these happen what should we do about them?
There's something in Buddhism called the second factor of the eightfold path.
The eightfold path is a way to happiness to enlightenment and the second factor is one of my favourite factors of that path.
It's called right intention or right attitude.
And I love that because it is an attitude which we have to everything we deal with in life.
Whether it's the physical world or the emotional world.
The path to enlightenment hinges on our attitude to things.
"So if you have depression or anger or grief, what should one's reaction be?"
"And the three parts of right attitude in Buddhism - second factor of the eightfold path - is letting go, kindness and gentleness."
The three factors.
- Have you seen it?
Just asking.
- Why did you ask?
- What?
Wait here.
I'll be back.

"Getting a sense for the way space time works in special relativity is very challenging and one of the ways that traditionally we Become accustomed to this and help wrap our minds around the weirdness, is to challenge ourselves with paradoxes."
"Almost invariably, they end up having to do with simultaneity because it's the relativity of what right now means that is really so current to everything that we are used to seeing."
"So, in this optional clip, I'm going to take advantage of my time and go through two of the most famous paradoxes in special relativity and discuss them in some detail and hopefully that will help clear things up and I suspect spur a lot of forum discussion because I'm not going to manage to clear everything up here."
"So let's start with a, a ladder paradox."
Ladder paradox is if you want urban parking problem.
The idea is you have a long
ladder of length L and the short garage of length G but G is less than L and you want to fit the long ladder into the short garage.
And the idea is very simple.
You come running with a ladder at the garage at a very high speed.
"Then, therefore the"
long ladder is going to be Lorentz contracted to the point if v is high enough where it is shorter than g.
"Notice that by making v close enough to c, I can make the Lorentz contracted ladder as short as I want."
"And voila, the ladder fix in the garage."
The ladder is fixed in the garage but note it only fixed in the garage while its moving very rapidly to the right.
"An obvious puzzle occurs because this may be true but relativity says I can look well, view the same situation from the point of view of somebody sitting on top of the ladder."
"And from the point of view of the ladder, the ladder is at rest, that's an inertial frame, the ladder is moving with a constant velocity to the right v. in the"
"ladder frame the ladder itself is stationary, while the garage is moving at exactly the same speed v but to the left approaching the ladder."
But from the
"ladder point of view, the ladder's length is L, its at rest."
"I've always wanted to be able to teach everybody, every single person and that's not been easy and I don't think I can teach everybody."
"But this experiment, hopefully which becomes an ongoing activity in my"
"life, I feel like this gives me the ability to reach out to you on a one to one basis and hopefully."
"Make you learn, and be excited."
Finally.
I love change and uncertainty.
Because life would be pretty boring if I knew exactly what was going to happen when.
I know sometimes in life you want certainty.
But I'm talking about most of life.
Uncertainty is what gives you value in life.
So remember we are experimenting here.
I want you to come with that attitude.
I'm going to learn
"Finance in a new way, and I'm going to go with it."
There'll be glitches.
There'll be errors made along the way from your side.
"Maybe from technology, maybe from some errors in the assignments or so and so forth."
I'm almost sure we'll try our best not for that to happen.
"But if something happens, remember, you are a pioneer, I am a pioneer, and we are working on it together."
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a week.
And may the force be with you.
See you soon.
Bye.
"Often times we think about the dangers of vehicles on the highways, but we rarely think about how dangerous they can be when we're parked in a driveway."
"You know, probably more children die every year than we'll ever imagine from being backed over, from a caring, loving, parent, or a visitor, who never intended to cause harm to that child."
"You know, with children playing, they're not paying attention to what the adults are doing, or the drivers are doing."
"And even from inside the vehicle, they could even check both mirrors,"
"left / right, rear-view mirror, and think that they really are clear, and that they can't see anybody."
"But you'd be surprised how a child can somehow maneuver their way into the back of a vehicle, into a blindspot, and you may never even know they're there, until it's too late."
"Then the driver puts the car into reverse, backs out, and that's all it takes."
"It's going to be important for a person to know where the children are at, at all times."
"Maybe even to say, everybody could you move into the yard, or could you move onto the porch until we back away, and are out of the driveway altogether."
"We informed about what was happening in Malaga, Gijon..."
We have been in many cities.
"And I can tell you in Madrid, for example, the work was mainly developed thanks to"
"Jessica Romero, Lidia Molina, also my own work where other people like Leila Nachawati and Olga Roríguez collaborated..."
"The family of Periodismo Humano is large and more or less intensely, depending on each person, we have all collaborated a lot."
With the coordination of Javier and Patricia who made it possible for everything to fit in and make sense.
"But, a normal day of coverage during the 15M, during those first weeks,"
"I would get up late, because the night before"
"I had gone to bed very late, go to the Puerta del Sol, and start talking to people and ask them what they were doing there, who they were, if it was true that they were hippies or radicals or violent... or if it was true that they weren't going to vote, or if they had fleas."
"I don't know, ask them who they were."
And from there lots of interesting things came to light.
"And you spend your day talking to people, listening in on the assemblies to understand what it was all about."
I remember telling one of my co-workers:
"""Get a computer and write down everything we've heard, these are the 15M political proposals""."
"Because someone had decided to read a list of things that they had talked about in an assembly, areas of work."
Areas of work where they would form commissions.
"So at that moment, in my short-minded journalist's brain, I thought that was the headline."
And I asked my co-worker to write it down.
"From that moment until it was published everything calmed down a lot, and fortunately we weren't wrong and we didn't slip up."
But we could have.
Because at that moment you didn't know what we were looking at.
"But our job was to be there 12 or 15 hours with the people, uploading photos and video."
"Not just for the sake of uploading them, but looking for humane details that defined what was happening."
To escape from the freakshow idea.
To escape from the freakshow idea and the exception.
NOT to go up to the wierdest looking man in the square.
Because that didn't define what was going on.
NOT to find the biggest Mohawk haircut.
Because Mohawk haircuts are fine but they didn't define what was going on.
"NOT to go up to someone with a bottle of beer in his hand, that didn't define what was happening in the square."
Just talk to people.
12 hours.

To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.
(Laughter)
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.
"And you're on the outside, you're at home."
"You're like the Raspyni Brothers, where you've got your balls in cold water."
And -- (Laughter) -- you just play with your fingers all day.
And then you get invited.
"And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be."
It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over.
And it's only taken five minutes.
And you want to go back and do it again.
But I really appreciate being here.
"And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible."
"So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit, within the subject of creation and optimism."
"And if you put creation and optimism together, you've got two choices that you can talk about."
"You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z."
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
"But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us."
"Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?"
And our own opportunity to make something new there?
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
"I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation."
The main factor determining your success will be your marketing skills.
Will the Liftago service work from day one of the launch?
"Yes, indeed."
Our Liftago Team will take care of that.
What we expect from you - the marketers - is to help us spread our business across the globe.
No passenger can order a taxi without taxi drivers using our app.
"And likewise, no Liftago driver can receive an order without passengers."
That's why we share half of our taxi ride revenue with you.
"You are the only ones with enough power, resources, and motivation to share the apps with drivers and passengers."
What is the key to success?
"Support your community, talk to taxi drivers and passengers, and share your experience and knowledge."
Create a group of skilled taxi drivers who will join your community and attract many new Liftago passengers every day.
And now I'd like to ask Ondrej from our Liftago team to show you our app.
"Hello, let's have a look at what our apps will look like."
We've been developing two of them: the Liftago Taxi app for passengers and the Liftago Driver app for drivers.
Both of them are compatible with iPhone and Android devices.
All versions will be availabe in local languages upon launching.
Let's take a look at the ordering process from the passenger's point of view.
"Now imagine that I'm a potential passenger sitting in a café, finishing my coffee and waiting for the bill."
I'm launching the Liftago Taxi app and I immediately see there are 3 available taxis around.
I click on the taxi icon and the app gets me the best taxi according to my preset preferences.
"But since I know where I'm going, I'd rather insert my destination address."
I switch to the list of taxi drivers and I can see that there is one I have hired before and whom I was happy with.
I can see the fare and I take a look at the rough estimate for the total price of the ride.
"It's acceptable for me, so I place an order."
"Now I'm waiting for the driver to confirm the order, which he does quickly!"
I can see he's just around the corner.
Now I'm just waiting for him to tell me he's here.
"I can see him on the map, and in the meantime, I pay my bill."
He's arrived!
I'm leaving the restaurant and my taxi is waiting outside.
The driver greets me and has indicated I'm on board.
"And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur."
And everybody's happy about that.
(Laughter)
And they're happy over and over again.
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.
"And then, then, then, and then ..."
"Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire."
"And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around."
"So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos."
(Laughter) (Applause)
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
"Now if you want dinosaur DNA,"
I say go to the dinosaur.
So that's what we've done.
"Back in 1993 when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur, and we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen."
"And one of my former doctoral students,"
"Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing."
"And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there."
"They found these red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world,"
like red blood cells.
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.
"And so she thought, well, what the heck."
So she sampled some material out of it.
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
"But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin."
And that was really cool.
That was interesting.
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
"So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project."
"And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them."
"And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff."
And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture.
"The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras, and those cameras can, frame-by-frame, reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment."
"So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject."
"And if you look in a comparison, on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us."
"So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this."
"But these were the early days of this technology, and it wasn't really proven yet."
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count.
"And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons."
We could go up into the millions of polygons.
It seemed to be infinite.
"This was when we had our ""Aha!"""
This was the breakthrough.
"This is when we're like, ""OK, we're going to be OK,"
"This is actually going to work."""
"And the ""Aha!"" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt, and we could put Brad in this device, and use this Contour process, and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights, and we could, in fact, scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses."
Right?
"So, effectively, we ended up with a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing."
(Laughter)
"From there, we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face."
"So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes, a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing."
"Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44."
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.
"We brought in Rick Baker, and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry."
"And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji, and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time."
"And we commissioned them to make a maquette, or a bust, of Benjamin."
"So, in the spirit of ""The Great Unveiling"" -- I had to do this --"
I had to unveil something.
So this is Ben 80.
"We created three of these: there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60."
And this really became the template for moving forward.
"Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad."
"So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct."
Is there indifference or is there passion?
Passion is the measure of a media business that has valued for the long term.
"You can get away with selling ads for a while for example to large numbers of casual people, but they pretty well will knew, passion is how you build a community, how something takes on a life of its own."
"And, what I saw at TED was not only what the 800 people there -- you know, really influential people!"
But they had a level of attention that was way off the charts.
"I mean, they were there for 4 days."
They were focused.
They were engaged.
They used words like  'this is the highlight of my year'.
"I mean, this was a media thing that just exhibited extraordinary passion."
"So, I thought"
TED is amazing.
"And I also thought, Wow, it's an incredibly potent media asset, if you like, in the making."
"There's something really, really amazing here."
"So, I started to dream about whether there might be some way I could play a bigger role."
"And you know, to cut a long and complicated and occasionally painful story short, 2001, a foundation that I had set up found itself as the proud owner of TED and I got to run it, and I was terrified."
"First of all, business I'd been building had been smacked hard by the dot-com bust."
I'd had to lay off a thousand people off the workforce.
I knew that it was time for me too to leave.
I felt like an abject failure.
"If I failed at TED as well, there would be nowhere to hide."
It also didn't help that I knew nothing about the conference business.
(Laughter)
"Or, that I had none of Richard Wurman -- who had been the sole owner --"
I had nothing of his huge stage presence.
"So, the goal number one was ""Don't screw it up."""
(Laughter)
"And, I worked really hard to figure out, what was it about TED so special?"
"""Don't touch that."
"Only tweaks."""
"Some of the early tweaks included professionalizing the logistics of TED, courtesy of these two amazing Canadian twins, the McCartney sisters, who put on events with attention to detail that I hadn't seen before."
"And then as far as the program was concerned, it was just continue this process, make it -- continue the process of broadening it out, you know, bring in more people, brought in more scientists, more out-of-the-box thinkers, more non-Americans, more women."
The two connect.
"This year here at the Mechina is a very, very significant year."
It creates a real revolution among these young men.
"And slowly but gradually, through all the experiences and laughs, you see how these kids stabilize, kids who walked around with a kipa, but with spikes underneath with all the gel in their hair etc.."
"The hair slowly but gradually gets shorter, they begin to dress differently"
like a Talmid Chacham.
Something stabilizes within them.
Two words the Mechina gave me:
Torah and Life.
"As far as I'm concerned, they are both the exact same thing."
The Mechina brought Torah into my life.
It totally changed my life.
I understood this at the Mechina itself which was one of the most significant things I've ever done.
I think that only after looking at the long-term will I be able to see just how significant and essential it impacted my life.
"After a year-and-a-half at the Mechina,"
"I received not only direction, but also serious momentum to begin life in the best way possible."
"Our spiritual situation when we came here wasn't exactly ""up there"", and had we enlisted directly into the army, we would have absolutely experienced [spiritual] burnout."
The Mechina saved us.
"Thank G-d, we see amazing success at the end of the year when we see the same student who, was began the year with an earring, and at the end of the year before enlisting in the IDF, the student makes a Siyum Masechet/concludes a book of Talmud and with this Siyum he enlists in the IDF in a combat unit, nonetheless!"
Amazing!
"""Magic"", perhaps, but I call it ""Divine Assistance""..."
"I became so attached to this place that the decision to get married happened right over here, on the steps."
"I came here with my wife, even after the Mechina had already moved elsewhere."
I took her to these steps and we talked and I felt my best in this place
I felt here the most confident to tell her that I want to marry her that I love her and want to build a Jewish home at the very place which helped me know what a Jewish home is...
I'm carrying around the centre of Europe. i like the idea very much.
"Lisboa, it's the centre of good food, good nightlife."
"- Open to the world, to multiple cultures."
"- Its' kind of becoming the centre of cultural evolution, in its own way."
"- And I think it can be the centre of Europe, because it captures the European culture."
- This is Lisbon: ... open-hearted.
- The centre of Europe?
"After the summit with Nehru Prime Minister then, introduced my grandfather to the citizens who gathered."
"He introduced,"
"""We have a special guest form great country called Japan."
Japan once fought with and defeated Russia.
"And that gave India inspiration and hope to strive for independence."""
"At the time, Japan was still recovering from the defeat of the World War Il."
And so I was told from my grandfather that Nehru Prime Minister's speech deeply encouraged Japan and my grandfather.
"I, as a leader, would like to strengthen and develop this long relationship with India."
"I wish India Center further success in the future; with wonderful leaders like Mr. Vibhav and Mr. Yoshimi Ishikawa, I am very confident."
I call upon your support for the cause and I would like to send my best regard to the India Center.
It was a coincident that the MC of today's ceremony gave a campaign speech for me during the election.
It gives me a sense of fate with India Center.
I would like to end my greetings with graces to India Center.
Thank you very much and congratulations once again.
ALEX FAABORG:
"All right, good afternoon."
Thank you coming.
"This is Advanced Design for Engineers, and really glad to have you here."
"Design's often broken into two components, form and function, and this talk is no different."
"We're going to have Christian Robinson presenting on form, and he designed the Roboto typeface."
"And I'm going to present on function, on interactive design."
"And I got to work on Google Now, which launched yesterday."
"So as you can imagine, I'm incredibly tired."
"Being engineers, you guys know how launching software isn't making sure everything's perfect in the end."
"But while I am physically incredibly tired, I am extremely excited to be able to give this talk."
"The thing I love more than actually doing interactive design is teaching it, so it's really exciting to get a room of incredibly smart people and to provide all of this information to you So let's dive into interactive."
"Now this is a room of engineers, I'm assuming?"
Raise your hand if you're an engineer.
"Yep, OK."
"So often engineers don't have a tremendous amount of respect for design, and it's not that they don't think design's important."
"They realize it's critical to the success of their application, but the reason they disrespect it is it's not controllable in the way that software is normally controllable, and hardware, because you're dealing with people, and people can be kind of random."
Dooby-doooby-doo Doo-doo-doo-di-da
"Hey there, it's Kati again."
Thanks for coming back to check out my videos.
"Today I'd like to talk about a tip, that I give to all of my client's I even have to give it to myself repeatedly to remind myself about this."
"And this has to do with people suffering from anxiety, stress, depression."
"You name it, this is something that we should all constantly evaluate in our lives."
"And that is, not spending time with people who are bad for us."
Okay well that sounds really easy.
People who we hate probably don't hang out with.
People who are really mean to us we probably don't hang out with.
"But if you really think about it, there are probably people in your life, that I call ""toxic"" friends."
Especially when we're talking about eating disorder people.
"We go into inpatient, we're there with maybe six to ten other girls, some of which want to get better, like you, working hard to pull through, and it's really difficult, and they're there to help support you."
"Those are great friends to have around and that's what I'm hoping to cultivate in this website, is a big support system of people rooting for us, right, to do better not to do worse."
"But there's always a few people in those treatment programs, who kind of make a life of being in treatment."
"They don't really want to get better, and they kind of pull the rest of us down."
"They even put up websites and things to help ""promote"" anorexia and"
"""promote"" sickness."
Why would you do that?
These are people that can hinder you're recovery.
"And I know it's hard to let people go, and I'm not saying that you have to tell your friends, or call them up and say,"
"""hey you know what?"
"I was watching this video and I'm not friends with you anymore. 'click'."""
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying limit your interaction with people like this.
"Because I guarantee, if you evaluate it after."
"Like, Let's say you go have coffee with this friend who is ""toxic""."
"Afterwards, you probably feel worse about yourself, you're probably counting calories, more than you normally do, you skipped a snack,"
"""not on purpose"", but kind of on purpose, because they're in your head."
"They're making bad comments about you, about themselves, about what's going on."
And those people just aren't healthy.
"So that's my tip that I give to everybody, whose suffering from anything."
But all three that you can tell are leveling off.
"We in Computer Sceience, about seven years ago, hit a ledge and it was a problem."
"We couldn "" t make the computers any faster."
"We couldn't make the frequency faster, we couldn't use more power, we couldn't make the computers as we thought we could."
They couldn't follow this exponential curve anymore.
"What happen was we were making too much heat, way too much heat."
And we'll get to that.
"But, we solved this problem by making multiple cores."
"If we have multiple cores, they could do multiple things at the same time and that's increase of speed the same way."
"And as you can see the Parallell, the"
Parallel Thread Performance has increased and while the Single Thread stays the same
Awesome.
"So, heat, computers have this 0's and 1's transistors,, and every time you change it, it wastes heat, and capacitors, we'll get to that later."
"But it wastes heat and you can see this graph that over time we had some hot ones, and cold ones and so far we've been able to cool them with heat sinks and fans."
Nothing too special.
"Around 2000, we started making really hot computers and back in 1995 [INAUDlBLE] was as hot as a hot plate."
"Loves this example, that if it's as hot as a hot plate, and you had an egg that size, you could fry the egg on your computer because it's that hot."
Wow.
Come on.
"So, computers have only gotten hotter."
They've actually gotten to the heat of a nuclear reactor.
"Of course it's not gigantic, it's just the size of a quarter."
But it makes as much heat as a nuclear reactor.
And soon we're actually even close to rocket nozzles and the sun's surface.
They're just going to get so hot.
"And we've made all kinds of cool cooling systems with hydration and water and air and just really crazy cooling systems, and we've found that we just can't keep this up."
There's no way about it.
"So it ws like a game of chicken, who's going to give up first, and around 2004, 2005, we gave up and we got to the heat of a nuclear reactor and after that we just gave up."
"We can't cool it anymore, So we just moved to multiple cores."
Cool.
So let's see why this actually helps.
Well having multiple cores actually makes it more power efficient.
"Your life would be better if you could work a little less, if you didn't have to work so hard, if you could get home a little earlier, if you could retire a little faster, if you could punch out a little sooner -- it's all in there, over and over, again and again."
Washington?
I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don't really know.
I just know that that's a front in this war.
"And right here guys, Silicon Valley,"
I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?
How many people have their Blackberries?
We're plugged in; we're connected.
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.
"Good grief, not to this crowd."
(Laughter)
But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time.
"And nobody celebrates imitation the way ""Dirty Jobs"" guys know it has to be done."
"Your iPhone without those people making the same interface, the same circuitry, the same board, over and over?"
All of that?
That's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it.
"So, we've got this new toolbox, you know."
Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks.
They look like the stuff we walk around with.
And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.
"And I realized, probably too late in this game --"
"I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with, is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things, not just the testicles on my chin."
I got a lot wrong.
"So, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me -- that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work, manual labor, skilled labor."
Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits.
"I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost a little."
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.
The infrastructure is a huge deal.
"This war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualties"
like any other war.
The infrastructure's the first one; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one.
"[INAUDlBLE] just take the cost of the machine and estimate the amount of time we want, and then divide it?"
JON GRUBER:
Sure.
"No, and I'll cover that later."
"You could think of the rental-- if I bought the machine today and sold it tomorrow, that'd be like I rented it."
And this would be the cost difference between what I paid for it and what I'd sell it for.
"But it's just easier to think of it as the rental, because the flow measure-- like the wage-- is a flow measure."
"Now, in the short-run, capital is fixed."
"So in the short-run, our fixed costs are rk bar."
"That's our fixed cost, the rental rate times the fixed amount of capital in the short-run."
"And our variable costs are w times I, which is a function of q."
"That is, the more you produce the more labor you use in the short-run."
"So total costs in the short-run, short-run total costs, are rk bar plus wL of q. k is not a function of q because k's fixed in the short-run, but the amount of labor used is a function of how much you produce."
"This implies that the marginal cost, the key concept we want to work with, marginal cost, which is the derivative of total costs with respect to quantity."
"So dc dq is going to be equal to w-- or, let's do it in deltas, because we're not doing calculus here."
Delta c delta q is going to be w times delta I over delta q.
That's going to be the marginal cost.
The marginal cost-- so I'm just differentiating the total cost function-- is going to be the wage times delta I delta q.
"So the marginal cost of producing the next unit is going to be how much labor I have to produce to produce the next unit, times the wage I pay per unit of labor."
"Now, does anyone remember what we call this?"
"I know this wasn't on the exam last night, so you may not-- cast your mind back to the lecture on Monday."
Do you remember what we call delta I over delta q?
Anyone?
Bueller?
No?
It's the marginal product of labor.
Remember from Monday?
So this is the wage times the marginal product of labor.
So what we say is that the marginal cost is equal to the wage times the marginal--
I'm sorry the wage over.
"I'm sorry, it's one over."
That delta q does-- I was the marginal product.
"Stone standing over our hero, who's been drugged and bound and gagged."
[music]
And we have this fight.
[music]
"It's an incredibly violent fight, but made much more tense, because no one in the scene can speak, our hero has been gagged."
The rescuers mute and of course the captain dare not say anything cause he doesn't want to bring the attention of the crew to them.
At the same time we hear off screen that calypso song.
[music]
"Which adds more tension because it really illustrates the distance between what everyone else on the crew is experiencing, and the horrors that are going on in this cabin."
How unaware they are.
"And also gives this counter point, which makes what we see on the screen all the more horrible."
Compared to the happy song going on off-screen.
"Worse and wells would learn about this, would learn from this."
[music]
In touch of evil.
[music]
"And Quentin Tarantino, of course uses the same technique of sound counterpoint to violence quite a lot."
"This is one of the first times, it's not the first time that I've seen it in a Hollywood film in 1943."
[music]
"And it comes from this B film from Lewton and Robson made at RKO. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; This is secure. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And of course, then, we come back to the voice over."
"And the odd thing is, Finn is supposed to be reassuring us that everything is fine."
"But if there's anybody who can't reassure us of anything, it would be Finn."
Especially when it's combined with this
"low key lighting in the bridge, and on the ship."
"And I dare you to call this a happy ending, in the end we come back to a place that's like the one where the film began."
"And it's important that when our hero goes and meets the new girl, who we don't see, we see only her shadow."
We feel the entire cycle beginning again this is our new Stone.
Because becoming a captain of ship losing yourself in work leads to this isolated madness in this world.
Now that is an overview how the film uses sound but the film also has these two set pieces.
Two moments that are there to push the audience to the edge of sanity by terrifying them.
And one set piece involves a hook and the other one involves a chain.
Now I recommend you go back and listen and think about how the chain sequence works.
But that's cheating.
And it hurts your throat.
"So there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me."
"If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it."
"So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine."
"We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me."
And I'm going to show you what it can do.
"And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice,"
I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice.
"This system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind."
"So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple."
So the polyphony problem:
I've only got one voice.
How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time.
The simplest way to do it is something like this.
(Beatboxing)
By dancing.
It's like this.
(Music)
Thanks.
(Applause)
So that's probably the easiest way.
"But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up."
"There's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like."
"So I'm going to start another beat for you, like this."
(Beatboxing)
"There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want."
You don't have to.
It's fine.
Check it out.
I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.
(Music)
Is this a future we want to leave for our children and grandchildren?
I don't think so either.
So let's steer towards a better future.
Thomas Berry wrote that our great work for our generation is to learn to live on the planet at least benignly.
Why would we do that?
"One reason we would do that is that our fellow living things, who happen not to be human, don't have a representative in Congress; they don't have a lobbyist in Washington, they don't have a voice at the table, and yet, they are completely dependent for their survival on our good will; much like children."
Let's talk about our country's population and our wildlife.
"We had about five million people in our country around 1800 and about 290 million people in 2000 - more now, of course."
"At a conference, I met a scientist, Andrea Laliberte, who had done fascinating work comparing wildlife sightings in the 1700 and 1800 in our country to how wildlife range today in our country."
"This chart, the pinkish areas - I'm not sure how it looks here - are where we used to have black bears."
The yellow areas are where they still are today
- you see there's been a lot of recession there.
This is the gray wolf; we used to have gray wolves running all over our country;
- the pinkish areas you see on the chart - not so today.
"We used to have grizzly bears running over about half of our country; as you see, they've receded, and we don't have them."
This was just 200 years ago.
That yellow island-like area
- that would be the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.
"Let's look at a summary map: take a look at the right here - red is good, green is bad, white is very bad."
"You see that we've lost a lot of species in our country; those white areas mean that all of wildlife that was looked at,"
"- in this case, in the 1800s - it's gone from our country."
Do you think is normal not to have wildlife running around us all the time in our country?
That's not normal.
"Let's bring it home, here, to the Front Range of Colorado; tonight."
We used to have wild bison; they're gone.
We used to have gray wolves; they're gone.
"We used to have-- - sorry, my clicker's little sluggish - grizzly bears; could've been right outside."
They're gone.
"We used to have lynx, the cat; gone."
Maybe they are not leaving.
(Laughter)
"We used to have black-footed ferret, very dependent on prairie dog for their survival; gone."
"To find the median, or middle, begin by crossing out the least and the greatest  numbers in the set until you reach the middle."
The median of this data set is three.
Now let's review finding the mean.
Here's the same graph again.
"To find the mean, we need to add each of the values together and divide by how many numbers are in the set."
"The numbers total seventy, and we divide by fifteen because there are fifteen data points."
"So, the mean is approximately four and seven-tenths."
That squiggly equal sign means approximately.
"A common mistake that students make  is confusing the mean, median, and mode because they all begin with the letter ""M"" and they do sound a lot alike."
"One way to remember is that the median is the middle,  like the median of a highway."
"The mode is the most,  they sound alike."
"And mean, or average, is the meanest because it requires the most calculation."
Let's look at this graph again.
"We decided earlier that the mode was two, so let's put a line here."
We decided the median was three; we'll put a line here.
And the mean was approximately four and seven-tenths.
These three lines show where the three measures lie within the data.
Which of these looks like the best way to describe the data?
"In this case we have an outlier, or a number that is much less or much greater  than most of the other responses."
"One student read twenty one books, and that's great, but it makes our mean much higher than it would be otherwise."
"The mean is probably not the best measure here because only four students read more books than the mean of four and seven-tenths, while eleven students read fewer."
"On the other hand, the mode of two was the most common answer but does it reflect the data set as a whole?"
Probably the median would be the best measure here.
Let's look at another data set.
Students were asked their favorite number from one to ten.
There were four different answers that all got two votes.
"So, the mode is one, four, five, and nine."
"In any data set there can be a single mode,  many modes (like there are here), or even no mode."
This is why the mode is not used very often to describe data sets.
"When we find and measure a center, we want to use a single number to describe the data."
"So, the mode here is not good."
Let's find the median by crossing out the least  and the greatest until we find the middle.
"I, I can do it and you can't right?"
Well yes but we've still made you.
Oh no that's foolish.
"To make a long story short, actually it's not a very long story but it's a delightful one."
"The robot is utterly convinced that, it is"
God's creation.
"And its, highest commandment is to keep that beam aimed at a particular spot on the surface of Earth."
And these poor humans are simply mistaken about that.
And there's no convincing the robot that they are right.
"The humans finally decide, you know."
"It may not be that the robot understands it's own origins, but it makes no difference because it will obey that commandment and so they leave."
"In other words, the robots have to know what is right for people and do it absolutely, even if they completely misunderstand what the human beings want, say and do."
"This is a fairy tale, okay?"
How can anybody know what's good and right automatically and always.
No one can.
"How could robots, therefore, be able to?"
Can they read our minds?
"Well, that's not posited, but they have positronic brains."
"As one reads through the stories in I, Robot, one goes from the beginning where you just have a robot nanny to, who was selfless, of course, in the care of her charge."
Its charge?
The young child.
"All the way through to the last couple of stories in which the main character we need to confront, who's new, is Steven"
"Bierley, the world administrator."
"The whole world, in other words."
On the basis of having robots to do good and provide the wherewithal is moving ever more toward a utopia.
"As you read the whole book, if you think of it not as separate stories but as a composite novel, the ending would have to be utopian."
"Of course, if you read the story separately that wouldn't follow."
"And the very last story, the evitable conflict, that is we can get rid of conflict."
The evitable conflict is one which Steven Briarly is having a colloquy with a character named Susan Calvin.
Susan Calvin is a robopsychologist and she has been a continuing character referenced though out the book and interstial parts between the separately published earlier stories as a [unknown] was created to bind the whole into one work all feature Susan Calvin.

Ober's test assesses for iliotibial band syndrome.
"Wlth the patient in the lateral position, the knee is supported and flexed to ninety degrees, then extend and adduct the hip and release the knee support."
Failure of the knee to adduct is a positive test.

"Thanks, everyone, for joining us today."
"I'm Krista Bessinger, the Director of Investor Relations."
"I'm just very quickly going to cover the Safe Harbor statement, and then turn it over to Mary and Eric."
"So, before we begin, I would like to note that our comments and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements regarding Google's business outlook."
Our actual results may differ from those made in any forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties.
These risks are detailed in our public filings with the FCC.
"Also, please note that a web case replay of this session will be available on our investor relations web site in a few hours."
"We routinely post important information on our investor relations web site,"
"located at investor.google.com, and we encourage you to make use of that resource."
"So, with that, I'll turn it over to Mary. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Thank you, Krista, Maria, Vic, David, and Eric for coming."
We've moved the schedule back 10 minutes.
"Eric's been in the building for 15, but we finally got him in the room."
"For my disclosure, go to our web site for all information you need to have."
"So, Eric, thanks for coming."
"You did take away the glowing introduction with a moderately light start, so it was glowing."
"But, with that said-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
I'm much more interested in my criticism than my successes.

I already mentioned a few cities that we are actively working with.
But there are so many more that we could and will be working with.
"So again, just to illustrate my point, here is a snapshot from Google Analytics that shows the geography of visitors to the webpage of my institution."
"And it's really not a webpage on which you can bump, it's not advertised, you really have to look for it."
So people who have found it have some interest in the same things that I'm interested in.
"Yes, as you can see, it covers almost the whole world."
"I know, I think we have to work on Greenland, but apart from that, it does cover the whole world."
"I guess what I'm trying to say is that contrary to a popular belief,"
"NGOs are not just about giving, they are as much about getting back or receiving."

"Think of us, 7 billion people,"
like molecules running around.
"What you, I think, don't want, as Bertrand Russell would say, is to be like a hard, separate entity, a bit like a billiard ball that can have no other relationship with other such entity, except that of a collision."
"What you also don't want is to leave your chances of meeting those 150 most amazing friends of yours to a pure chance, because if you're going to sit home, nothing will ever happen."
"So my suggestion is to do something, and to do what?"
"To support, to get involved in one of the existing NGOs, or create a new one."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good morning.
I'm going to tell a story.
I think I need a piece of technology here.
Thank you.
Now I just have to figure this out.
"I'm going to tell a story about -- ecology, which is a story of plants and their parasites."
"If you'd like to take a look at one of the parasites, you and I do every morning when we look in the mirror."
(Laughter)
"This story is literally the flow of energy and there happens to be one exquisite transducer, the land plant."
(Laughter) (Applause)
"And I'm not one of the people from Australia, either."
(Laughter)
"That story is literally better told by another set of constructs which is basically the cycles that make life possible, because life is made of the same materials."
"You and I have the same molecules that were in Plato, were in the dinosaurs, were in literally the first blue-green algae, as they emerged 3.5 billion years ago on Earth."
"Then, we have cluster computing, which is, the common thing is, like Google, gigantic warehouse, and buys a 100,000 of the same computer, and puts it altogether, and houses it altogether, and that's called a cluster."
And all the computers work together to do whatever you need them to.
"Cool? side note, personally, this isn't on Dan's lectures, this is mine. my definition cloud computing."
"Google has its own cluster, its own cluster of machines, but they don't always use all these computers."
"Sometimes, a lot of them are idle like in Christmas break, people are searching more, so they need more machines, but over the summer that people are searching less they still have the machines."
"So, what do they do with them?"
"Well, came out the idea of the cloud that you can rent out these computers for whatever services other people need."
And it's just opens up a world of possibilities.
"The ideas that because these computers are for you to use, you get to them over the internet, and you can get to them over the internet from your phone, computer,"
"laptop, anywhere anytime."
"And this just opens the possibilities everywhere, but it's not actually that much of a new technology."
"It's just like, oh, a new way to use the Internet and the computer we already have."
"It's pretty cool, but it's just very applicable and really nice."
Awesome.
"So, the five parts of the computer."
[INAUDlBLE] is tower.
A computers are usually split into five parts.
"The first being the processor, which has the control, the brain which actually does the work and the datapath which shares the wires that connects the different part of the brain."
"And, then there's the memory, which is the storage, both long term, short term, anything."
"Registers, caches, hard drive, whatever you can think is part of the memory."
"And then, there are the devices, the inputs and outputs."
"Keyboard, mouse, monitor, whatever you need."
"This is called, well, we'll get to that in a moment."
This is called the Von Neumann
Architecture.
"And you should know John von Neumann, I believe in the 60's, he came up with this architecture and he's a famous guy."
"John von Neumann came up with this architecture and is still used today, decaed and daecades later, and he's pretty famous."
You should know him.
He maybe tested on.
Awesome.
So what's inside the processor? we're back on hopefully.
"There is the processor, brain and datapath."
And you might want to connect with others to do further explorations around some of those ideas.
And do you want to add to that Natalie?
Natalie:
"Well just that Fred also had something online, something that he shared some failures of the past and the class inspired him to go back and try it again."
So if theres something that you had tried before and put aside but you want to pull it out of that file cabinet and try another version.
"Or that someone did out in the community, they were recalling some amazing project they had done in a housing project."
And if that can inspire other people.
So either with other people or your own project.
Mitch:
"I think its very much in the spirit of learning spiral that we introduced right in the beginning of class, this idea of continually iterating."
"And week to week we aren't giving you so much time to iterate so the diving deeper really gives you an opportunity to iterate on some of the things you got started with, some of the weekly assignments or readings or discussions."
So hopefully you'll get a chance to get started on that over the next few weeks along with doing some of the readings about tinkering and doing your own tinkering with some of the suggested activities.
And then we'll come back three weeks from now on April 29th to explore more fully the idea of tinkering in the next session of Learning Creative Learning.
Thanks a lot.
Natalie:
Bye Mitch:
"Bye, bye."
"But now it's Bach, so I won't confuse you."
That was only a snippet of Chaconne by Bach.
A song I play at many classical concerts.
What music do you actually listen to?
Melodious.
What does that mean?
That every genre in the world is a gift from God.
It's just not that everyone are good representatives of it.
"When you listen to rap, for example, then you  most likely listen to Eminem or ""Klovner i kamp"" because when good rap exists why listen to bad rap?"
When you listen to country you listen to Willie Nelson.
"It's, of course, everyone is allowed to try but it would be better if there only were good examples for every genre."
"So there would not be criticism like ""Oh, you're stupid because you listen to rock"""
What do you put highest of all Norwegian music?
You once said you'd like to play Ole Bull.
"Well, yeah, you just answered the question."
And going to college.
Just whoever was - There never seemed to be any shortage of people that could play.
Somebody played an accordion.
I can't remember who that was.
What did Walter McCauley play?
Guitar.
Did he sing?
I'm not sure.
Who were the singers?
Rita was one of them.
Rita?
Jules's wife.
Mary's mother.
I'm not sure.
"Oh, Loraine would get up - every once in a while she'd get up and do the tap dance thing and all this kind of stuff."
That would be entertaining more than a singer as far as...
I didn't ask the question.
I didn't take that risk because of being concerned about that my question is going to appear stupid.
"And learning about our own tendencies and understanding how certain situations may interfere with our other goals of actually learning and developing is very important in our self knowledge and in our ability to regulate our own motivation and say, I recognize this in me, I can see how this is holding me back and I'm going to regulate my emotions and shift my goal."
Or consciously adopt a learning goal orientation in order to pursue learning.
And part of the process that allows this to happen is what Ricarose is doing which is engaging people in conversation.
"How did you feel about this, what did it make you do and how would you cope with this and learning from each other and recruiting the community and supporting you in regulating your own motivation."
Natalie:
And we do it in a genuine way because we want to understand and then that gets them reflecting.
I've seen that also in this after school program with the University of illinois in Urbana-
"Champagne, part of a project called the Pathways Project where we're interviewing young people and staff in a variety of after school programs."
And asking young people to reflect on some project they've worked on over a period of time.
And through the interviews you start to see that they start to realize some things.
"Like they were preparing for a presentation, some of them said, I was going to do anything to get out of this situation."
"But because of their team, they didn't want to let their teammates down, they went and then they realized, oh actually it wasn't so bad."
"So these multiple experiences of working on projects and then having questions where you reflect back, like what did you think it was going to be, how was it?"
"And a lot of them are finding, oh actually now I want to do more of that."
"No way."""
"So Les did a finer study, and he found out it came out about 9,000."
"Using different microsatellites gave the different results, but the mean of all these studies is about 5,000, which I personally don't believe."
"But then, I am a skeptic."
"But even if you toss a few numbers around, you're probably talking an effective population of about 20,000 animals."
Do you remember how many they killed off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?
"So what it tells us, actually, is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small."
"In fact, of those 20,000, 8,000 were thought to be females."
"There's only 8,000 basking shark females in the world?"
I don't know.
I don't believe it.
The problem with this is they were constrained with samples.
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail.
"So, where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis?"
"Well, one obvious source is dead sharks -- dead sharks, washed up."
"We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year, if we're kind of lucky."
Another source would be fisheries' bycatch.
We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets.
"That's banned now, and that'll be good news for the sharks."
"And some are caught in nets, in trawls."
"This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas -- illegally, because you're not allowed to do that under EU law -- and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak."
"They even put a recipe up on the wall, until they were told it was illegal."
They actually did get a fine for that.
"So if you look at all those studies I showed you, the total number of samples worldwide is 86, at present."
"So it's very important work, and they can ask some really good questions, and tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure, but they're constrained by lack of samples."
"When we were out tagging our sharks -- this is how we tagged them on the front of a RlB, get in there fast -- occasionally, the sharks do react."
"On one occasion, when we were up in Malin Head in Donegal, the shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail, more, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it, rather than the tag going in."
And that was fine.
We got wet.
No problem.
"And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier,"
I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
"The stars and the sun are fixed to the dome, and this dome rotates around."
The earth is at the center.
It's flat.
"It's got corners, according to the bible."
Hell is somewhere below the earth.
Day and night was created before the sun and the earth in Genesis 1:4-5.
"According to biblical scholars like Usher, the age of the universe is somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 years."
"Although, they're not quite sure which. and the universe was created by god from nothing, from the void."
"In acutality, in reality, the earth is a planet, one of many in the solar system."
"There is no firmament, no sphere out there."
The sun is the center of the solar system.
The sun is a star on the spiral arm of a typical galaxy with billions of stars.
"The Milky Way is a galaxy, one of billions in the universe."
The age of the universe is 13.
"75 billion years, and the universe was created by natural processes from a singularity, as far as we know."
"So, lots of wrong here."
Lots of screwed up cosmology.
"Aristophanes, back in 2000 BCE, measured the size of the earth."
"He knew is was a sphere, and he measured the angle of the axial tilt."
"So, that's pretty impressive."
"Galileo upset the incorrect church's view using observational astronomy in the 1600s, and pointed out the foolishness of the church's position."
The church was not too happy about people using telescopes because they thought they were going to look up the skirt of god or something.
"Poor Galileo spent most of the rest of his life under house arrest, after that little episode, under fear of being killed."
"There's a long list of astronomers and others who have expanded and refined our understanding of the universe, and they continue to do so today."
"So, meanwhile, the church and the bible has contributed nothing."
"Yet, they're happy to claim credit."
"They say god did it, or whatever, and there's this notion of the god of the gaps, where, if there's something that's not known, well, that's a good place to stick, that's a god-shaped hole to stick god in there, and that explains it."
"But, as we learn more, that gap gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and it's really just an argument from ignorance."
"For other physical sciences, let's talk about lightning, rainbows and materials."
"Okay, lightning."
The chrisitan view up until the 18th century was
lightning was the wrath of god.
"Now, the next thing we have to do is that we've got to relate this probability of backscattering."
We are going to have to relate it to the diameter of those nuclei.
How do we do that?
"Well, the probability of a particle backscattering is simply going to be the total area of this crystal, there's our crystal, the total area of this."
"Now, you've got to ignore these aluminum blocks here because this piece of equipment comes from my laboratory."
And I pressed it into service for this demonstration.
This has nothing to do with the demo that we're going to put here.
It's just structural because this is my manipulator puller-outer from our machine.
"So you've got to ignore those, but that whole area there is equal to 2,148 square inches."
And now the probability of that backscattering is this total area of the nuclei to the total area of the crystal.
"And the total area of the nuclei then is just the sum over all nuclei, and there are 119 of them here."
So i=1 to 119 of the area of each one of the nuclei.
"And so that is just 119 times the cross-sectional area of these nuclei actually, which is pi d squared over 4, and this is all over 2,148."
That's the probability.
This is the diameter of the nuclei.
And now I am going to rearrange that and solve for the diameter.
And when I do that I get 4.79 times P to the one half.
"If I measure the probability of backscattering by this, measuring the number of backscattered balls over the total number we throw at it, then I can calculate the diameter of the nuclei, the diameter of those Styrofoam balls."
That is the idea.
"Now, you're going to do this experiment."
And so now the TAs are going to give you all a ping-pong ball or two.
Come on.
We need to distribute the ping-pong balls.
Here's the deal.
What you have to do is you have to aim to hit this lattice.
That's all you've got to do.
"Then you have to watch your ball, and you have to see if it scatters back to you."
"Now, what doesn't count is if you hit these steel bars and it scatters back."
"That doesn't count, okay?"
It also doesn't count if the ball hits the Styrofoam but it continues going in that direction.
Your ping-pong ball has to actually scatter back at you to count.
"And then, when we get all done, I am going to ask whose ball backscattered."
"Masking tape helps protect your car, your buffing pads, and, of course, makes it easier to clean up at the end of the day."
"Now that everything is taped off, it's time to get to work."
Work in two-by-two areas and complete the rest of the car.
"Now that we've compounded, polished and jeweled the paint, the next step is to seal it."
"Apply paint sealant one panel at a time, then remove with a microfiber towel until every painted surface is covered."
"Once cured, the sealant will protect your freshly restored paint and help hide any scratches that were just too deep to safely repair during the correction stage."
"Now we've sealed the car so it looks spectacular, and it's protected."
"Now, if remember back in the previous episodes, we talked about putting Carnauba wax on top, and that's exactly what"
I'm going to do.
"That's going to bring in a pop, that shine back to this paint."
So let's get started.
"The trick here is to add a light, thin layer of Carnauba wax on top of the cured sealant."
"It's possible to do two or three panels before removing the wax with a clean microfiber towel, and the car should take no more than 15 to 20 minutes to get insane depth and shine."
"Although the Porsche took about eight hours or so from start to finish, it was totally worth it."
"Remember, we started off with paint that was completely neglected and in need of some serious correction."
"And after a bit of testing, we managed to restore the paint to near perfection with a safe and easy-to-use machine."
"All right, guys."
"Well, we finally finished this beautiful Porsche Speedster."
"Now, the one thing that we've learned is that you need the right tools."
"You need the right techniques, and a little bit of patience."
"And you, too, can have your car look as amazing as this."
"Now remember, download your free PDF and product guide at ammonyc.com."
"If you have additional questions, shoot me an email or visit my blog for other how-to videos."
"Well, that's it for you guys."

"A bit overwhelmed and actually humbled, with all the faces I see out here today."
You represent a lot of great memories from my family and I.
So stick with me as I kind of fumble through the next few minutes.
"Writing has always been a form of therapy for me,"
"So, today, I welcome you to the congregation of voices that reside in my head."
Might be a scary thought.
"And when we solved this equation, we would know exactly where the two bodies would be at all times."
"As long as we know where the bodies were when they started out, using that force law and this equation of motion, we could tell you what r would be for all future times."
That's called deterministic.
That's classical mechanics.
"Well, we're not going to do it, but we could actually set up a differential equation and solve for what r(t) is using that force law."
We could do that.
"And if I did that and if I started out the electron and the nucleus at one angstrom from each other, like they are, roughly speaking, in an atom, what would happen is that that electron would plummet into the nucleus in 10^-10 seconds."
"If I solved these equations,"
I would find that r would be equal to zero and t equal to 10^-10 seconds.
We've got a problem here.
"The problem is that this classical physics,"
"Newton's second law and the force law, it is predicting that after 10^-10 seconds the electron and the nucleus are on top of each other, they've neutralized each other."
We no longer have an atom that has a diameter of 10^-10 meters.
That's contrary to our observations.
This is saying the atom collapses in 10^-10 seconds.
But what we see is that the atom seemingly lives forever.
"So we've got a big problem here, as they did in 1911, 1912."
And the problem is that this kind of classical way of thinking does not predict our observations.
"It does not predict the fact that the atom lives together, it lives forever."
It says the atom falls apart.
"So it could be that the Coulomb force law is wrong, or it could be that this equation of motion is incorrect."
And of course what's going to turn out is that this equation of motion does not work for electrons in atoms.
You cannot use classical mechanics to describe the electron within the atom.
"We need a new kind of mechanics, and that new kind of mechanics is going to be quantum mechanics."
That is where we will pick up on Monday.
Have a nice weekend.
"When I was growing up in Montana,"
I had two dreams.
"I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur."
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life.
I was very fortunate early in my career.
I was fortunate in finding things.
"""This isn't a party and we're not here for fun."
"We have a problem and we have to solve it like this and this and this"", with a very coded language, a very traditional political narrative, very endogamic..."
"And suddenly the square and the internet is full of messages that deactivate any assault that they can set on you from the outside, and they deactivate the social depression we're in."
Suddenly the people were happy.
There were marvellous phrases.
"I can't remember any right now have a terrible memory, but they're in the archives."
There are people doing a great job archiving material and in 30 years we can look over the jokes and irony of 2011.
For me Twitter is irony.
Except when you have thousands of followers and you can't say anything because everything can be misunderstood and they make a #whatshisnamefacts hashtag and they crush you.
"But when you're in a manageable state, Twitter is pure irony."
And irony works better than any other register.
And soon I saw tweets on banners.
After I'd seen the May '68 book maybe it's the other way around.
But I've laughed so much
All along the walls starting from the underground access gate all full of the most creative messages.
They were also very rich.
And very enrichening.
"Like, even though this goes nowhere, although it comes to nothing, or it doesn't fulfill people's expectations, at least it will have given those who were there a chance to detoxify themselves from the typical political discourse."
"Because it's so boring, political language is so grey and suddenly irony pops up in political language without being demogogical, it's great."
ST:
Even when we have to laugh at ourselves.
There were moments in which I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
"Whether to go or stay... and thanks to the tweets and three posters, I chuckled and was able to go on."
It's curious.
I was marvelled.
"And after a phenomena like this, the satire."
"Like @acampadapolicia, or @putohelicoptero, which is minimalist, but every time I got one of his messages I laughed so much..."
JL: tacatacatacatacatacatacataca...
[laughter]
"There was also a really funny thing that happened whenever I saw a helicopter anywhere in Spain I took a photo and said ""Look! @putohelicoptero is here!"""
Creativity has no limits. @acampadapolicia has made us laugh.
"And that opens so many doors to so many things, so much creativity, you just can't say it's a bad thing."
Please wind stop blowing.

I'm just crying like a fool.

All right so QuickFind is too slow for huge problems.
"So, how are we going to do better?"
"Our first attempt is an alternative called, Quick-union."
This is so called lazy approach to algorithm design where we try to avoid doing work until we have to.
It uses the same data structure or array ID with size M but now it has a different interpretation.
We are going to think of that array as representing a set of trees that's called a forest as depicted at right.
"So, each entry in the array is going to contain a reference to its parent in the tree."
"So, for example, 3's parent is four, 4's parent is nine."
So 3's entry is four and 4's entry is nine in the array.
Now each entry in the array has associated with it a root.
That's the root of its tree.
"Elements that are all by themselves in just, in their own connected component, point to themselves, so one points to itself but also nine points to itself."
"It's the root of the tree, containing two, four and three."
"So, from this data structure we can associate with each item a root, which is representative, say, of it's connected component."
"So that's the root of three is nine, going up that root."
"Now, once we can calculate these roots, then we can implement the find operation just by checking whether the two items that we're supposed to check with are connective where they have the same root."
"That's equivalent to saying, are they in the same connective component?"
"So that's some work, going to find the roots of each item but the union operation is very easy."
To merge components containing two different items.
Two items that are in different components.
All we do is set the ID of P's route to the ID of Q's route.
"Let's make P's tree point to Q. So in this case, we would change the entry of nine to be six to merge three and five."
The components containing three and five.
And with just changing one value in the array we get the two large components emerged together.
That's the Quick-union algorithm.
Because a union operation only involves changing one entry in the array.
"Fincher would always say, ""It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."""
"And thing our process and the technology couldn't do, is they couldn't understand intent, the intent of the actor."
So it sees a smile as a smile.
"It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile, or a frustrated smile."
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
"But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology ""emotion capture,"" as opposed to just motion capture."
Take another look.

A lot of places are working with their local schools.
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food.
"Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore."
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.
"This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy."
"You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything."
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.
"Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town."
"Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on."
What does it look like if that's not the case?
And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody?
"As a friend of mine says, ""Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."""
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.
"From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world."
We're getting a lot of interest from government.
You are not alone.
I will be with you.
"Then, Jesus's commandment is:"
"""Go and make disciples."""
"So, Jesus has disciples."
Jesus wants christians.
"And so, the confusion in this verse,"
"I can't talk about the whole book, but at least in this verse, the confusion is there."
"""I do not wish to make you christians."""
Because Jesus WANTS people to become christians.
"A christian, a disciple, a disciple of Jesus."
"""Polak's Question:"
"Round 3"""
Earlier at the UN COmmission on Narcotic Drugs
"In 2008 Vlenna, Frederick Polak, a Dutch psychiatrist asked Antonio Maria Costa, HEAD of UNODC a simple question:"
"How does Costa explain the fact that the cannabis consumption levels are not higher in the Netherlands than in the neighboring countries, although in the Netherlands cannabis is available for consumption by adults?"
"Costa silenced his ""NGO Partner."""
"Embarrassed by our video, he decided to make his first official visit . . ."
"Mr. Polak asked Mr. Costa again at the International Harm Reduction Conference in Barcelona on May 15, 2008."
Good morning.
"Fredrick Polak, psychiatrist from Amsterdam, well, this is a continuation on the question I already posed, which I will very shortly repeat, the relationship between the availability of cannabis in the Netherlands, and the relatively low or average level of use, which in my view is contrary to the theory of prohibition."
"But now I would like to ask Mr. Costa, we heard that you made a visit to Holland and you visited a coffee shop and a consumer room, and I would like to ask you, what did you learn in Holland, and what are your impressions?"
Regarding Mr. Polak's sort of a continuing of questioning on the relationship between availability in Holland and high Availability of what? level of use.
"Availability of drugs, and the level, availability of alcohol and the level, availability of tobacco and the level."
I'm surprised Mr. Polak there is no focus as well on tobacco and alcohol.
"Here is the thing, for a number of reasons"
I am getting close to the Netherlands emotionally and culturally and many other reasons a country that I respect
"I decided in order to address the errors as scientifically as we could possibly do,"
"I decided to travel in a study mission to Amsterdam, the core if you wish of initiatives which are obviously quite problematic,"
"like the coffee shops, or for that matter the sex windows, where women are exposed in big windows at street level."
I decided to go there.
"It was a very interesting session, a couple of weeks ago,"
"Well, it turns out that a lot of us forgot somewhere along the line that are actually all of knowledge is connected."
"When you hear someone remarkable, whoever they are, share something of their passion or what they do, not only you're inspired by them personally, but you start to see connections that you didn't see before between what you do and what they do, or someone else does."
"So, we spend our lives digging these trenches."
"That's we get really good at one thing, and that's where we live, that's where we're focused."
"TED is the moment when you come out of your trench, and you ascend up a slope, and you see how what you do connects with whatever else does."
It can be really eye-opening and thrilling.
It can fill you with a new sense of possibility.
"So in, let's see, 11 years ago, I was certainly digging my own trench."
"I was trying to build this technology publishing company, magazines, websites."
I was in it deep.
"This was the year, I first went to TED."
I was smitten.
"You know, I'd always thought of myself  as this slightly ""Odd Man Out."""
"Like I always struggled to make conversations about house and God and family gossip, movies, celebrity, and all the things I think normal people talk about, do they?"
(Laughter) (Audience) We don't know.
CA :
(Laughing) 'We don't know'.
That was a great comment!
"At TED, I found myself surrounded by this motley crew of geeks, sort of passionate entrepreneurs, inventors, creators."
"Really, they didn't have a whole lot in common except that they were all very curious, they were all absolutely eager or willing to talk out-of-the-box ideas and to engage in conversations that depending on your view point, rather a little bit crazy or might turn out to be really important."
"I loved it, I thought I'd come home."
"And, the media entrepreneur in me noticed something as well."
"So, media were obsessed with this."
Attention is a currency.
"We measure it in lots of different ways: we measure eye balls, how many are there, ratings, circulation, and so forth."
"We also look at demographics, who owns those eye balls."
Bill Gates is worth more than Billy Blogs.
"And, there is a third measure of attention that is much harder to measure."
"So, we don't often talk about it."
We should because it is the most important of the three.
It's the measure of thequality of attention.
Is it focused or casual?
"In some sense, being aware of context -- that things look one way from one perspective, you look at it from another perspective, it can be a whole different thing."
"What ""certainty"" is, by definition, is something that is, that's SUPPOSED to make us feel very comfortable and satisfied and certain about life."
"But you've said ""certainty"" is ""counter learning."""
Yeah.
"All this search for ""certainty,"" is in some sense, again, like shooting ourselves in the foot."
I think the strategies that we've been taught about how to learn
lead to the overwhelming feeling of incompetence that so many people have.
To boredom and depression.
And in that people are searching and some of the things that they come up with as a way of explaining this I think get them into more trouble.
"The application of mindfulness extends, as you've made the point, you know, throughout life."
Let's start with children.
"You're saying that we have to start doing in our schools, we have to start teaching them to be active deciders, not passive deciders."
What's involved with that?
"Well, again, it goes back to this notion of certainty."
Most people are afraid of uncertainty.
And
I think what we have to do is learn how to exploit the power of uncertainty.
"Um, let me give you an example."
I don't know if this will be meaningful to you.
"But when I was in school, I was taught The Battle of Hastings was 1066."
"Now, that's all I know about The Battle of Hastings."
This doesn't seem to me a very important piece of information.
"You almost get the sense that people were saying, ""OK, we'd better get ready because The Battle of Hastings is about to begin."""
"Rather than realizing that somebody decided that we're going to call this ""The Battle of Hastings."""
It doesn't begin that way.
"When does a conflict become, you know, a skirmish;"
A skirmish become a conflict; a conflict become a war.
When do we want to call it a war?
"All of these labels that we have, all of our categories are given by people and it hides all the ambiguity.\"
Attentiveness:
"Most teachers, they are doing a good job, and you and you would (I would) probably concur if I was looking into their little window, into their classroom, if all the students had their hands on the desks, sitting in a straight line with rapt attention."
"Yet you said ""creative distraction"" can be helpful in the classroom."
The story started when Dr.
"Jaggers, who was Jessica's surgeon, received a phone call by the New England"
Organ Bank in the middle of the night.
The New England Organ Bank offered him the organs for another one of Dr. Jaggers' patient.
"Dr. Jaggers felt that the organs were inappropriate for this as a patient, But in part of the phone call, asked if they could use them for Jessica."
The New England Organ Bank somehow assumed that if Dr. Jaggers was asking for the organs for
"Jessica, they would match the blood type."
Vice versa is the work flow at the Duke
Transplant Center and Dr. Jaggers explicitly assumed that if the New
"England Organ Bank were offering the organ for Jessica, they would check the blood type."
"At the end of the day, nobody checked."
"In the aftermath of Jessica's death, a group experts were put together to assess what went wrong in this process."
They estimated that about one dozen caregivers had the opportunity to notice a mismatch.
"Typically, a single mistake in this type of process would have been caught."
"If one person forgets to check the blood type, well, there are eleven others who could have noticed."
"But if twelve people, at the same time, all make a defect at once, the outcome is tragic."
"British psychologist, James Reason, has developed a model to explain accidents and disasters."
This model is referred to as the Swiss cheese model.
The idea of the Swiss Cheese models is as follows.
Think about a slice of Swiss Cheese.
"In the slice, we have a couple of holes and we think of a hole as a defect."
"Now, the Swiss Cheese model, which doesn't look at one slice of cheese in isolation, but asks what happens when you stick multiple slices of cheese on top of each other."
"With a certain small, but positive"
"likelihood, you can stack up the slices of cheese and all the defects line up and the outcome is tragic."
This is the idea of redundancy.
As you add multiple layers of cheese on each other.
"It is less and less likely that you can see though all the slices at once,"
"But, again, the outcome probability is still not zero."
So what's the probability of a defect in a situation like this?
"Now, if we draw this as a process flow diagram, redundant check typically corresponds to a parallel path in the process flow diagram."
I've illustrated this here with these three paths that are all happening on the way of producing this flow unit.
"Now, the orange boxes here are the redundant test point."
I pay nothing.
If there was some initial membership charge then maybe we would add that membership charge and you would pay the monthly fee after that.
"But here this looks about right, that the dollars paid is equal to 40 times the time in months."
The time in months is the independent variable.
"It drives the dependent variable, the number of dollars you pay."
"So these are turkeys, and this is electrified also."
This is space age stuff.
There's a little stainless steel filament.
See it running through the horizontals?
"These, the verticals, are dead."
The horizontals carry the spark.
This is really a major breakthrough in pastured farming.
"This poultry net material, we get ours from"
"Premier in Iowa, it's only been around for about 20 years and it took computer chips to be able to shorten the spark length down to 4 thousands of a second, to get the resistance"
load low enough so it wouldn't melt the polyethylene.
"So this is why I say, I am not a [indistinguishable] by any stretch, we embrace technology."
"But it's cool that this netting comes in a 150 foot roll, weighs 12 pounds, one person can take it up and put it down in 10 minutes, and it keeps out bears, coyotes, wolves, possums, skunks, racoons, and keeps the turkeys and chickens in, and all those predators out."
Who would have guessed that you could have that eighty years ago.
I noticed that there's no covering
like we see with the chickens.
"Is it because at this stage, at their size, the aerial predators don't become an issue."
"Exactly, at this point the aerial predators are not an issue."
"The group over there is three weeks younger, than this group here, this group is eleven weeks old, that group over there is eight weeks old."
Are they getting ready to harvest?
"No, they'll go to sixteen weeks."
"Again, what keeps us awake at night is trying to figure out how to scale these things, and all that."
"So this is a ""gobbledy go"", this is the latest ideology of a portable turkey structure."
"This thing is 32 feet long, 12 feet wide, these are roosts here."
"But the thing to notice is, they're just lodged boards."
So these purlins up here are just lodged.
"The point is that in five minutes you can pop all these off, pop the purlins off, fold up the shade cloth, now you're down to just eight feet, hook up to a pick up truck, and you drive down the road at 55 miles an hour."
And why do you have these in here for?
Yes.
Was Mozilla the open source browser in those days?
Mozilla was in those days a technol..
"Sorry, the question was ""Was Mozilla the open source browser in those days?"""
Mozilla in those days was seen as a technology development organisation.
And Netscape liked to think that it was building the browser.
[Question]
Did everyone hear Dan?
"The initial theory was like the Linux kernel, where Mozilla would be the technology development asset that builds the kernel and other organisation would build the commercial products from it."
So we had this ongoing tensions and one of them was Mozilla was becoming a product in its own right.
"It turned out that as the Netscape and AOL management began building their product to drive traffic to AOL, more people started using the Mozilla version than the Netscape version."
That was going on in the background and let to some of these tensions.
"So I was fired and the belief at Netscape at the time was that by getting rid of me,"
Netscape management would then have the ability to control the Mozilla open source project and could convert it into a set of people that helped Netscape build the product that they wanted.
"Essentially, to view the community as a free work force that would help build the Netscape product."
"Of course, the competing view is that we're all building an open source project that has to meet the needs of the community and that people who contribute and build the product have some say in what happens to it."
"What happened at that point was that the two groups of people, the small group of people that had been mozilla.org staff and the larger group of people which were all the engineers contributing to Mozilla reunited to form one shared outlook."
What happened was that essentially the engineers working at Netscape were very clear that the leadership that they were following was Mozilla.
And it was me.
And it was not their management.
"So, everyone involved voted to continue to try to build an open source project."
So I remained the General Manager of Mozilla.
"I remained the leader of the Mozilla project and the spokesperson for the development of the Mozilla project, much to the surprise of the Netscape and AOL management."
We learned a lot of lessons out of that.
We learned from that that leadership depends on who will follow you.
You need to lead people.
"My own view is that you have to be leading in the right direction enough of the time, that enough people follow or enough people also lead in that direction."
[Question]
This would be...
I was fired in 2001 and yes...
Yes.
Yeah.
YOU ARE NOT ALONE HERE you... you are not alone here
Then he thought:
"""The joy leaves us whihtout even getting to know us..."
At the same time SOMETHlNG is reminding about itself again and again...
Then he thougt:
"""Approaching the cherished line closer and closer will we acquire something in each other person...?"
"At the same moment, the times are shrinking and stretching and yet... you can not understand when you can not understand that when....mmmmm..... you can unsterstand that when when the wind is trying to make with tree-peaks SUCH A THlNG after which they will not recover soon! and it becomes clearer: you'll never come out if alive!"
This is an introduction to what we'll be doing in Week one in Physics twelve.
"Basically, we'll be looking at the characteristics of science."
This includes that science is divided into topics.
This you'll mostly read about in the textbook.
We'll also talk about how to be human activity.
"Again, this is mostly in the textbook."
"We will talk about the science of philosophy, this will show up in the"
"lectures but if you want to review the sections, these are all in chapter one."
The fact that it's practiced by a community. the institutional aspects.
"These are going to come a bit more later in the course, but I'll review briefly in the textbook."
"The fact that there is a specific method or process, we'll start that this week in the lectures but that will be the focus in the next two weeks."
"And the fact that it's constrained, this will be a key element of what is done in discussion this week."
"Or if this is a purely online version of course, we would be doing that in the forums."
"The philosophy of science, something that we will start looking at this week contains a few key parts."
The first being that the
laws of the universe are discoverable.
The universe is noble.
"The second is that science is repeatable, this is a key part in the online lectures but is covered in the book."
The laws are uniform and invariant.
"The laws are simple, and the"
laws are objective.
"These are ideas you definitely want to start becoming familiar with this week, but we will keep coming back to over the next couple of weeks."
The three things that set the groundwork is the scientific process.
"And those would be the scientific method, which is the advanced version of what you learned, probably in grade school."
This is how the individual scientist does his work.
Programs can block.
It's not sensitive to blockage the way that event loops are.
"In fact, it loves to block."
The whole reason they have threads is so that they can block.
"Execution will continue as long as any thread is not blocked, and if you have multiple cores and if they're not blocking each other, they can all go forward and that's a good thing."
Maybe your program will go faster if you're lucky.
There are some cons.
One is that you need to allocate stack memory per thread.
"That was once a big deal; it's not a big deal now, memory's so cheap and abundant."
"A real concern, though, is if two threads are using the same memory, a race may occur, which is even worse than saying a race will occur."
I'll show you what I mean by that in a moment.
"There are more cons, but before we do that..."
"For years, people have been saying 'why can't we have threads in JavaScript?', so let me show you what happens when you have threads in JavaScript."
"Here we've got two one line programs which are each going to run as a thread, both at the same time, and they are both sharing access to my_array."
Each is going to append one element to my_array.
There are several possible outcomes of this.
One of them is that we get an array containing a and b.
Another is that we get an array containing b and a.
"This is not the race I'm talking about, although you do have this non-determinism, and that's considered good."
Let me show you what's considered bad.
"One possible outcome is we get just a or just b, even though both successfully completed their rights."
How is that possible?
Anybody have a question as to how this went wrong?
Let me show you what went wrong.
One way you can look at appending something to an array is to break it down into several more primitive instructions.
"When you do that first statement, you're doing the equivalent of the last four statements."
Everybody see how that works?
OK.
"Now, when you have threads, they're both doing similar stuff and they can shuffle the order of the execution of the stuff in any way that they want."
"They might do it always the same way, or they might occasionally do it a different way."
The way they'll usually do it is they'll work fine when you do it in development and do it in a really bad way when you're in production.
[laughter]
We have to follow the European
laws in Europe.
We have to follow the Chinese laws.
"We decided in China we did not like the way in which their censorship was working, so we moved to the other China, which was"
Hong Kong.
So we'll see what happens.
So we make that decision on a per country basis.
My own view is that these changes are happening so quickly.
The societies are not really prepared for what's going to happen when everybody is online.
Everybody is posting information about what's going on around them.
"I also think that in general this is very good because it empowers citizens, and citizens are fundamentally good."
"Citizens fundamentally want to make their countries a better place, and so I would say that in a positive context."
But I think that countries are a classic example where the laws conflict.
There are obviously also corporations that have different models from us that we also compete with.
"I see there are some questions over there as well, don't forget them."
"Yes, sir? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KAVlTSKl:"
Kavitski from Online Magazine in Germany.
I have two questions.
"One that is a specific one, Google translate, is that something you write, you also doing in a phone call over the air?"
"And the second, more general question about Chrome OS which, in my opinion, is almost like the big Android, for example, very suitable for tablets, is that coming soon or can you give us a short update there? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"So, two separate questions that the live translate is the next logical succession to the demo that you saw and you could imagine eventually it might be possible."
"Right now, we can do it the way you saw it."
So we're pretty close.
And I think eventually it'll be possible to speak.
"Today, you can SMS somebody and without speaking the language and I think it's reasonable to expect that with some level of accuracy you'll be able to do it live over time."
"Again, as the technology gets better, and remember these algorithms are trained algorithms."
"As they get more data, they get better."
"So a classic example where the computer does something better because the humans help it and the humans do something better because the computer is there, they can actually communicate with each other."
"On the question about Chrome OS, Chrome OS has been announced."
Chrome OS is an operating system which is in early availability and it's targeted primarily at the Netbook space today.
"And of course, because it's free, it's open-source."
People will also use it for tablets.
"Both say in unison, ""I certainly do."""
"Marriage is the same from here to Peru, Here, some examples of what it will construe:"
"Megan, baby Bayley when he gets the flu, Sure to feed baby Bayley hot chicken stew,"
"And top notch was his beer home brew, And no you don't smell his smelly old shoe."
"Bayley don't demonstrate your clumsy kung foo,"
Take Megan out when she wants fondoo.
"Here's your biggest marriage advice clue,"
Don't you dare speak of her taboo tattoo!
"And let NO ONE speak of a love that's untrue, From humble beginnings, all of this grew."
"Megan and Bayley, almost time for adieu, Honeymoon awaits, have fun when you scream down the highway at a high rate of speed on the way to your destination."
"All seriousness, you two are a great couple."
"Bayley, you are truly the best man here and"
"Megan, you could not have chosen anybody better to spend the rest of your life with."
Congrats to both of you.
"The answer for the first one is 0.125--that is the half times the half times the half, makes an 8th."
We showed earlier that this was 1/K--1 over the size of K.
Now we've shown that the probability of M equals M* is equal to the probability the message is M* divided by the K.
We've shown these two things.
Now we just need to plug them into our conditional probability formula.
"We're going to have this on top, and we're going to divide that by the probability of B, which is 1 over K."
"The ""over Ks"" will cancel out, leaving us with the probability that the message is equal to M*."
That's exactly our definition of a perfect cipher.
We can conclude that the one-time pad is a perfect cipher.
It exactly satisfies the definition of a perfect cipher where the cipher text reveals nothing at all about the key.
You might think the class should be over.
We've achieved our goal of perfect secrecy using a cipher that was invented over 100 years ago and is actually provably perfectly secret.
We're not going quite done yet.
There are some pretty serious problems with the one-time pad.
One problem is that it's malleable.
"What malleable means is if Alice sends her ciphertext to Bob, and our evil interceptor--this times it's not just an eavesdropped, it's an eavesdropper with a hammer."
"If our interceptor has control over the network, and instead of just being an eavesdropper can be an active attacker."
An active attacker means they can actually change messages on the network.
"In it's a particular kind of hashing, called modular hashing."
It's just a particular way of computing a hash function.
"It's easiest to think about in terms of numbers, although it, it works in all kinds of situations."
"Because remember everything in a computer is encoded as a byte, which can be treated as bytes which could be treated as binary numbers."
And so what we are going to do is in this case We saw a pattern characters are decimal digits.
"And so, we'll treat a sequence of pattern characters as the decimal number."
"And modular hashing is, just take a big prime."
And compute the remainder when you divide your number by that prime.
"So in this case, 613 is the remainder that you get when you divide 26,535 by 997."
So you can check that.
So that's what we're going to use as the hash function.
And that.
This type of hashing is widely used.
"You have a prime number, we talked about it when we talked about hashing."
"It satisfies, it seems to satisfy something like the uniform hash assumption under various circumstances."
"So that's our pattern, a five character pattern, and we're going to keep the small hash values 613 and this is going to generalize to longer patterns, and we'll talk about that in a minute."
"So now, suppose we have this text."
And our pattern happens to occur here in the text.
And what the method is built on is the idea of you take the first five characters in the text and compute its hash value.
"In this case, 31,415, mod down 97, is 508."
So that's different so that's not the pattern.
"Maybe take the next five characters, that's 201."
That's diffent It's not the pattern.
Take the next one.
"That's 715, different it's not the pattern 15,926 by 97 is 971, it's not the pattern."
"Eventually, when you have the text characters that are the same as the pattern characters you're gonna get the same result, it's a match."
"If the pattern hat, hash equals the text sub-string hash you, you have the potential for a match."
And that's what the algorithm is based on.
"Now it seems like, we're doing a lot of calculation, with, making numbers out of these things."
"And, and keep doing modular arithmetic on it."
"But actually there's, a really, simple way to, severely limit the amount of calculation."
"And give a quick linear algorithm for, search."
"Finally, another definition that's important is marginal cost, which is the change in cost with a change in output."
"So the marginal cost is just like-- remember, we want to think in terms of marginal decision making in this course."
"So the marginal cost is the change in cost with the change in-- actually, that should be a little q."
The change in a firm's cost with the change in the firm's output is marginal cost.
"And then finally, average cost is just what it sounds like."
"Average cost is just c over q, it's just the average."
"So the difference between marginal and average cost, is basically average costs is the average over the whole set of goods produced."
Marginal cost is the cost of that next unit of production.
So those are our key definitions.
"Now with those in mind, let's ask how do we get costs?"
And the answer is we get them from the production function.
"Once we do a production function, we can derive costs."
"So if we have some production function, q equals f of I and k, then we can say the cost of producing q is equal to f of wl plus rk."
"Where w is the wage rate, or the rate you pay per unit of"
"labor, and r is the rental rate, or the rate you pay per unit of capital."
"Now, let me just pause here for a second to talk about pricing capital."
"It's easy to think the cost of an hour of labor, it's the wage you pay for an hour."
It's harder to think about the cost of a unit of capital.
"Because we buy the machines, right?"
So how do we think about the cost?
"I'm going to cover this later in the course, for now imagine all machines are rented."
Imagine you rent every machine you use.
And think of r as the rental price of that unit of capital.
"So with buildings it make sense, firms often rent the buildings they're in."
"Think of r as the rental price of that unit of building, or that unit of machine."
We'll come back later to see why that's a sensible way to think about it.
"The key point is, the reason we have to do this is the wage is a flow measure, every hour I pay you a new wage."
"If I use the cost of buying the machine, that be a stock measure, so you couldn't really compare it to wages."
So we want to use a flow measure.
The flow measures is what we have to pay every period to rent the machine.
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
"When contaminated food is ingested in the body, it weakens the immune system."
That's why the allergy aggravates and the diseases recur.
Some people claim their healed injury has started to ache again.
A weakened immune system also causes fatigue.
People with fatigue will probably become unable to extend themselves.
"About two weeks ago when we showed this data to you, you said you'd like to see a breakdown of the number of the reports according to prefectures."
So we created a map to show which prefecture those emails came from.
"And as you see here, most of them came from Tohoku and Kanto regions."
"In other words, from contaminated regions."
We are an webcast station that anyone anywhere in Japan can watch.
"Not a local TV station that can be viewed, for example, only in Kanto."
"Considering this fact, I was half-shocked and half-unsurprised to see most of the reports came from Kanto and Tohoku."
This seems to be an evidence that the connection with radiation cannot be ignored.
"Ideally, the government should be the first to conduct this kind of epidemiological research for the sake of the public health."
"The last time I went to Fukushima, I heard a story of some children in kindergartens and nursery schools in Date City in Fukusima Prefecture who aggravated a cold that lead to pneumonia and were constantly in and out of hospital, because of a weakened immune system."
This was exactly what happened in Chernobyl and I was shocked to hear that.
I really wished that such things would never ever happen in Japan.
I'm very worried by the fact that the people have been eating contaminated food and various symptoms have already emerged.
Something must be done.
"In Chernobyl, nothing was done with children for the first 3 years, which led to the high rate of cancer among them."
I'd really like the Japanese government to do something about it as soon as possible.
You went to Belarus 7 years after the Chernobyl accident and saw the situation there.
We're going to show some photos from the visit soon...
How was it?
In Belarus?
"Yes, when you visited Belarus...the photo is shown now."
"Well, they said there were no healthy children."
"If there were 100 children at school, 98 of them had some kind of health problems."
They said those children got ill when their immune systems weakened because of stress or shocking event.
"In other words, they were in the gray zone between ""healthy"" and ""ill."""
Most of the children were like ticking bombs that could explode at any minute.
"And the class length at school was shortened to something like 25 minutes, instead of 45 minutes."
They need nutrients.
Where are they going to get it?
Student:
Weathering or--
Prof:
They could get it from weathering or they could get it from upwelling.
Where does upwelling occur?
Student:
On a costal reef.
Prof:
"Yeah, continental margins."
"Get out in the middle of the ocean and there's actually a tremendous amount of fertilizer there but it's five miles down, three to five miles down, and you just can't get it up."
"It's sealed off, because the top of the ocean is warm and the bottom of the ocean is cold, and there's no way that cold water can come up through warm water, unless you have Coriolis force or wind or something like that driving it."
So that's why the open oceans are deserts.
You'll notice that tropical rainforests are highly productive per square meter.
In general forests are pretty productive.
Swamps and streams are very productive.
"Algal beds and reefs are quite productive, and so are estuaries."
"So if you want to go someplace where you're-- you know, you're a naturalist, you like creepy-crawlies, you want frogs in your pocket, you want to see something new for Christmas, you go to these places; that's where you'll see a lot of stuff."
Okay?
"So right there you already know where the prospecting is good, if you like to see lots of biodiversity."
"Now if you look at percent contribution to global primary production, the open oceans again crop up, and that is because there's just so darn much of them."
"If you're out there in space, looking at the world, you realize that you can fit all of the continents into the"
Pacific Ocean; it's bigger than all the continents put together.
And most of it is open ocean; most of it is low primary productivity open ocean.
But there's just so darn much of it that on the planetary scale it's making a pretty good contribution.
"And the tropical rainforests are big enough so that even though they're only 3 and a half or 4% of the globe, they have such high primary productivity that they're kicking in quite a bit."
"And the others, even though they are productive, occupy such a small portion of the globe that they're not contributing that much."
"Okay, so this is an overall view of energy flow on the planet, at least for the photosynthetically driven part of the planet."
The sun is sending in the energy.
"And by the way, any idea of roughly how much of the sunlight that comes into the planet is actually captured by"
life?
"And if you like big numbers and you like to calculate and look at flow models and compartment models and differential equations and stuff like that, biogeochemistry has a place for you."
"The contact here is with geology, physical chemistry and meteorology."
The connections are important.
They're not all well worked out.
"So there must be important connections between ecosystem ecology and community ecology, but they are still being explored, and this is not an area that's really mature yet."
"The part of ecology that analyses these processes really is the part that deals with the fate of the planetary environment, especially water and air, and that means it has important economic and political implications."
"So it's an area well worth worrying about and learning something about and remembering, because these are the processes that will affect the quality of human life on the planet, for forever basically."
"Okay, next time I'm going to discuss biodiversity, and about whether it matters or not, and about what extinctions mean."
Now we enter Part Two of the Crash Course.
"Here you'll see the very information that led me and my family to make profound changes in our lives - where we live, my line of work, even where we get our food."
"With the background you've received to this point, you are now positioned to understand how the Three ""E""s, the Economy, Energy and the Environment, intersect and seemingly converge on a very narrow window of the future, what I am calling ""The Twenty-Teens""."
It's the data in these next parts
leads me to conclude that the next twenty years are going to be completely unlike the last twenty years.
A small warning:
This material can be shocking.
"So we begin Part Two with ""Debt""."
(Laughter) (Applause)
"Young man, if you are trying to impress me, you are not."
It's not working.
"For him, that was the end of life."
We had to do a little work to get him back.
"To cut the story short, my son went on to graduate with honors from Waterloo, one of Canada's top universities."
(Applause)
"You need to have the bravado, to challenge the odds that life throws against you."
"OK, let's do a show of hands here."
How many of you use Facebook?
"Wow, I'm really in the wrong business."
(Laughter)
"Twitter, Google, I suppose everybody."
"How many of you know Aramex, Fadi Ghandour?"
"Well, if you look at the background of all these people, they are just ordinary people like you and me."
I hope Fadi Ghandour doesn't mind me calling him ordinary.
"Even if you're just depressed, I'm sure, I'm sure that you're hanging out with people, who probably aren't good for you."
This could even be a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
Somebody who tears you down instead of builds you up.
"What I'd encourage you to do is take out that journal, that I told you to purchase, hopefully a long time ago you go it, you've been jotting down notes."
But today
"I'd like you to make a list of the people that you spend the most time with, and just make note, take note of what they say to you, take note of how you feel when you leave them, when you've spent a couple hours,"
I hope you feel better not worse.
"And so we'll stop, you know, we'll stop torturing ourselves when we surround ourselves with bad negative energy."
"It's much more refreshing to spend time around people who, just build us up, they're there to support."
"So, I hope that's helpful."
"Continue to make your comments and to share this, if you're on Linkedln, if your on Tumbler, if you're on Google+, share this with people."
This can be helpful for anybody!
"This can be helpful for your mom, your friend, your brother all of us need to be supported by people who love us and care for us."
"And also don't forget to subscribe, so that when I post other tips and helpful things, you know about it right away."
"And we'll keep taking one step after another, to a healthy mind, healthy body."
"Two door Bugatti coupe, I call it Katy Perry"
"Wiz Khalifa papers, smoking my favorite berries"
"S65 I call it Rihanna, it got a red top but it's white like Madonna"
"Made man, you hear what I said"
Having a slumber party all my bitches counting bread
"Made man, also known as Papi Chulo"
And I'm running straight up in the culo
"My wrist always on frio, call me chilly chill"
"Super head from super head, and I really will"
"Californication, motivation in my pocket"
"Got on my blue Dickie, shout out my nigga Roccett"
"Still smoking sticky, it ain't no other option"
Not for made niggas and I'm never stopping

"And at the same time, in other parallel universes... the same cat can be alive and kicking."
But how?
How can you have a dead cat and a live cat simultaneously?
Because the universe splits in half.
"In one universe, we have a dead cat."
"In the other universe, we have a live cat."
Get used to it.
What is even more shocking... is that in some of these many worlds... a tiny quantum difference in thought can change the whole world.
It's like the butterfly that flaps its wing and makes the hurricane.
Tiny microscopic events would change the course of history.
"So every historical event actually happened... in every possible way in some branch... of this ever-splitting, many-worlds universe."
"In one, the Nazis won World War Il."
"In which case, I'm now speaking German... and there's a swastika behind me."
In another world... none of the horror ever happened.
"In one universe, there's no World War Il... and 50 or so million people didn't have to die."
"Like the endless rolls of the dice, all possible numbers... and all possible kinds of universes and outcomes... will eventually turn up and occur in one of these many worlds."
"In fact, all our wishes, too, can come true... in a parallel universe."
If the many worlds idea is right... then there's a branch of the universe... in which the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year.
"You can imagine that the USA was still a colony... of the British, for example."
Even the impossible is probable in some parallel universe.
There could even be creatures coming into our world... from these mysterious extra dimensions.
"As mind-boggling as it sounds... when it comes to the amazing world of parallel universes... anything that can happen has happened or will happen... in some other universe... in some other dimension, space, and time."
Quantum differences can rewrite history... creating multiple universes... each with wildly different outcomes... where anything and everything is possible.
Some wars never happened.
Others we never imagined did.
A slight change means a comet missed... and even dinosaurs still roam some Earth somewhere.
"All and every one of these fantastic parallel universes... occupy the same space... but are in a different dimension, and so invisible to us."
Even as you peacefully watch TV... whole other invisible worlds could be raging all around you.
These parallel universes are in your living room.
"This means that in your living room, there are dinosaurs."
You can't hear them.
You can't see the dinosaurs... that are rampaging throughout your living room... but they're there.
A spring rose
You are the light of my soul
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come back...
"Come back, oh crimson of my soul"
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Come back...
"Come back, oh crimson of my soul"
I'm very proud of you.
You did very well on the last exam.
Class average is a little bit above 70.
Congratulations.
There were 22 students who scored 100.
"Many of you are interested in where the dividing line is between C and D. If I take only the three exams into account, forget the quizzes, forget the homework, forget the motor, and you add up the three grades of your three exams, the dividing line between C and D will be somewhere in the region 135 to 138."
So you can use that for your calibration where you stand.
The controversy between Newton and Huygens about the nature of
light was settled in 1801 when Young demonstrated convincingly that light shows all the characteristic of waves.
"Now in the early twentieth century, the particle character of light surfaced again and this mysterious and very fascinating duality of being waves and particles at the same time is now beautifully merged in quantum mechanics."
But today I will focus on the wave character only.
"Very characteristic for waves are interference patterns which are produced by two sources, which simultaneously produce traveling waves at exactly the same frequency."
Let this be source number one and let this be source number two.
"And they each produce waves with the same frequency, therefore the same wavelength, and they go out let's say in all directions."
"They could be spherical, in the case of water surface, going out like rings."
And suppose you were here at position P in space at a distance R1 from source number one and at a distance R2 from source number two.
Then it is possible that at the point P the two waves that arrive are in phase with each other.
"That means the mountain from two arrives at the same time as a mountain from one, and the valley from two arrives at the same time as the valley from one."
So the mountains become higher and the valleys become lower.
We call that constructive interference.
"It is also possible that the waves as they arrive at point P are exactly 180 degrees out of phase, so that means that the mountain from two arrives at the same time as the valley from one."
"In which case they can kill each other, and that we call destructive interference."
I had a dream my life would be...
So different from this hell I'm living- so different now from what it seemed...
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed. piano
"Hi, my name is Nat McCullough on behalf of Expert Village."
"In these clips, we're going to talk about the proper way to remove and replace a front wheel drives vehicles ball joint."
"In this clip, we're going to talk about removal of the ball joints retaining nut."
There are two styles that you may possibly run across.
This one has what you'd call a through bolt.
"As you can see on the ball joints stud, there's a grove."
"The retaining bolt runs through that grove, something?s similar like this and clamps down and keeps the ball joint from coming off."
The other style you may run across is that the ball joint will be threaded on top and then actually a large nut will go down on top of it and hold it in place.
"Due to room constraints on front wheel drive vehicles, almost nine times out of ten, it will have a through bolt."
That eliminates the need for the stud to be bigger and having a large nut on it.
"Generally on pickup trucks, light trucks, and things of that nature, you will see the threads on the top."
So pay attention to that.
The nut and bolt is located right down here.
As you can see.
What I'm going to do is put an opened end wrench on the nut for bolt.
And use my three inch ratchet with the socket on the other side.
"You can see how I set my wrench on there using the spindle to actually hold it for me, so"
I can use both hands on the ball joints containing bolt.
And there you go.
"It may be necessary, just depending on how corroded it is, to actually have to screw the bolt out of its location."
"You can see, as I'm turning it the bolt is beginning to come out."

PROFESSOR:
Last time we were talking about binary search and
I sort of left a promise to you which I need to pick up.
"I want to remind you, we were talking about search, which is a very fundamental thing that we do in a whole lot of applications."
It came out of Netscape.
Netscape at one time had been the almost monopoly browser vendor.
"It was the first commercial browser, so we had, I don't know, 99% of the market share at one time."
And it was a pretty exciting time.
That was when the Internet and the Web actually really exploded.
Microsoft appeared.
They started building its own browser.
Microsoft did a couple of things that ended up eventually building a good browser.
And it also engaged in a whole range of illegal activities.
And so the combination of that changed the landscape drammatically.
And Netscape management had the foresight to recognise they could not continue and be successful in the way they had been operating.
And they realised with the help of the engineering folk set at Netscape that the best opportunity was to convert their typical proprietary closed commercial product into an open source product.
This was radical in its day.
"Open source is mainstream now, but it was not then."
"Open source was deep in the technical community, it never surfaced in a product, it was all sort of odd and it was a very radical move."
"The second thing that happened is that the management team,"
"I was there at the time, a lot of us were, but I was part of these discussions, realised that an open source project had to be real."
"So, inside Netscape there was created a small group of people who were charged with the job of building a successful open source project."
"And there was a larger group of people, engineering, that was charged with building a successful Netscape product."
"That Netscape product was designed to make money for Netscape and ultimately money for AOL, after AOL bought Netscape."
"So, in the very early days of Mozilla, through '98, '99, 2000, we had these two different groups."
"We had the engineering group, which was a 100-150 people working on building the Netscape navigator product managed by a set of people wanting to use that product to make money for AOL."
"Then we had the small group of people who were charged with building Mozilla as an open source project, building contributors from all sorts of different places and building a technology base that was useful for many different companies."
The open source side.
That was small in name.
There were six or eight of us.
"Of those, Mick was one of them,"
"Gerv was one of them,"
"Dan was one of them,"
"Brendan was one of them,"
"I was one of them,"
Shaver was one of them and there was a few of other folks who aren't here any longer.
"So if a naive user, a naive human, is not from Canada, he might not know how to spell Scatchwood."
"If a person is not know from New York, he might not know how to pronounce ""Schenectady, New York"""
And I'm not really sure I'm pronouncing it right either.
(audience chuckles) but this edge really makes the difference.
"So, why is that a problem for us?"
Humans regain the wake.
Franz just mentioned that the human evaluations switch volumes in translation.
It's the same thing in speech recognition.
"The ground truth, the standard, the golden rule- the golden standard for speech recognition is human performance."
We have humans transcribing these speech recognition and that's what we benchmark ourselves against.
"And if the benchmark is barely better than the actual system, then we really have a problem."
"The other issue is that, with the kind of growth that we've seen in terms of usage, we are getting a ton of data flowing throughout the system."
Everyday we get about 2 years worth of data.
You can't even start thinking about transcribing all that.
We also have to support 27 languages.
"Internationalization is a big, big empahsis for us and we're trying to expand in all the languages of the world."
"So, I'm joking here but we're sort of-"
Fred Jilinek is a very famous person in speech recognition.
"He used to say that every time he fired a linguist, the performance rate improved."
(audience chuckles)
I want to fire all the humans.
"So, the key insight for us has been- speech recognition as I said is two different components and those two components try to, sort of, compensate for the deficiencies of each other."
So the acoustic model can compensate for the deficiency of the language model and vice versa.
"The traditional way of doing it is that you have the Truth that's set by a human transcriber, that's the gold standard."
And you benchmark your system against the truth.
You compare your best system against the truth and you try to PUSH it. and learn towards that goal.
"If you remove the truth, you are out of luck."
You don't have anything that you can compare against.
"The trick here for us is that we can actually cheat, and we can artificially make it harder for some parts of our system to function."
We can actually weaken parts of our system.
"So for example, if I weaken my language model then I suddenly have a system that's actually. . ."
less powerful and I can compare against the best system.
They get a date with a guy that we have a crush on.
And the flipside is that we are always doing things that make other people upset.
Even if we don't realize doing it.
It's very easy to make someone else mad.
Helping some people can hurt others.
I was trying to be very helpful in the Zande village by sowing dresses for friends.
Who got mad at me?
The local Taylor.
I was taking away his business.
"When I took pictures for ID cards for students in [inaudible] for free, who got mad at me?"
The local photographer.
I was taking away his clients.
My Zande students would never answer questions in class.
They hated any kind of praise.
They didn't want anyone to know what grades they are getting.
They were terribly afraid that they'd make other people mad at them: jealous of them and then that would arouse their jealousy and their witchcraft.
"So with possible witch is all around you, no Zande wants to stand out, be richer, smarter, more beautiful, more successful."
"That causes jealousy and envy, and that can heat up witchcraft and cause bad things to happen."
Neither do Zande want to be poor or unsuccessful or miserable for they then will be accused of being witches and of causing misfortune and others.
Because they'd be the obvious one who would be jealous.
"People who are lucky who have opportunities such as scholarships to study abroad as this young man did, he actually got his PhD at the University of Paris right after I did."
They set themselves up for witchcraft.
"They return home as college professors, businessmen, bureaucrats, they earn good wages, and the next thing you know, they get sick and die."
"Unfortunately, as this young man did."
"People who get good jobs are inundated with requests for help from dozens if not hundreds of family members and help they must or they'll be seen as stingy and selfish, and they'll-- yeah."
And then soon their children will fall ill.
It's a very good system for wealth distribution.
"And it causes many Zande to question the wisdom of getting ahead, for they'll have to share their good fortune so widely that in the end, they won't really be ahead at all."
"In Africa today, the disparity between rich and poor is growing."
Development puts money in the hands of some but leaves others behind.
"So even though education and scientific knowledge is growing, witchcraft accusations are also growing."
"Moreover, whereas traditionally, only mentally competent adults were accused of witchcraft, nowadays, young children and even senile elders are accused and sometimes they're tortured into confessing."
It's exciting because of scale.
"We can bring, and other companies can bring out products that can touch a billion people fairly quickly."
And these markets are
large.
"They're very, very large."
They touch a lot of people.
They touch humanity at it's--in the way it really is as opposed to the way we think--we think of it is.
"But it's terrifying because it's all about information, and ultimately, information is what people care a lot about."
"So we end up, we Google, end up in the middle of most of these debates, whether it's privacy or street view or numerous other issues which people here in the audience know about."
"And from my perspective, I think the debate is healthy."
These are new ideas.
These are new issues.
Society hasn't really decided what to do about some of these things.
"Having the sharing and the opinions of everybody really does help, at least, us inform how we make the decisions of how we go forward with these new products."
"And we encounter this--the scrutiny and we're prepared to participate, and of course, we accept it very much."
"This disruption, this benefit is going to continue."
"It's going to continue from companies like Google and others as well, and the future gets very interesting very quickly."
"This golden era--I talk about the golden era of--or the age of augmented humanity, you can imagine a golden era of breakthroughs."
"The computer science is now driving knowledge in human discipline in all sorts of new ways that can--that we can really solve the scientists' big problems; global warming, terrorism, financial transparency, because these are fundamentally information problems."
"So, imagine a future--this is a very near future that goes something like this: you don't forget anything."
Why?
Because the computer remembers.
You don't have to remember anymore.
The computer remembers.
It remembers the things that you should have remembered but you don't remember anymore because you have too much else going on in your life.
"Computers, in many ways, will become good at what we're not good at, making lists, remembering things, keeping memories and track of all the things going on in our lives."
Humans are just not very good at that.
Computers sort of excel with this sort of thing.
"You're never lost, right?"
"It's funny how, you know, you're always buying maps and worrying about things."
"Now you're never lost, right?"
Your smartphones certainly knows where you are.
[narrator voice]
"Because the need for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to advocate for themselves is not limited by boundaries, Partners programs are being conducted in most states in the U.S., and a number of foreign countries."
"The individual needs vary, but there are some common themes."
The desire for full inclusion often rises to the top.
I think that the tips and the tools that you learn about advocating for yourself or for others are great.
You can use them for any disability
"Being a blind person, I come against things all the time as far as what I can and can't do because"
I'm blind.
They don't know what I can and can't do because they don't want to give you a chance.
"You have to speak up for yourself, so I learned to be more assertive. speak up for myself and sell myself."
I have to do that.
[narrator voice]
"While many graduates focus on issues of housing and employment, Doug Hedrick has zeroed in on respect, campaigning for the use of language that sees individuals with disabilities as people."
"The father of a son with autism, Hedrick went before the board of his"
local school district and got action.
"The eight month program gives you a lot of tools in your toolbelt, and I'm just starting to use a few of them."
Some of the ones that I've used is being able to speak to school boards and facilitating a People First language policy.
"What Partners asked me to do, in the course, was to change or create policies, and I saw an opportunity with my school board in Burke"
"County to say, let's use a People First"
language policy let's adopt that.
And the interesting thing is ... and this is what I've learned in Partners.
When you explain this to people. people generally do the right thing.
"People want to facilitate change if it's the right thing, and using a People First"
language policy is just a very good thing.
"And they adopted this policy last year, and they're using it today."
[male narrator]
Others have joined Hedrick as advocates of people first language a movement that has been supported and pressed by the North Carolina
Council on Developmental Disabilities
"Together with other Partners graduates, Hedrick has helped push for People First language with webinars, telling supporters how they can carry the message to their own communities."
"They are demonstrating leadership in their communities, as many Partners graduates do."
Debra Wilson completed the program and later was named a member of the
North Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities.
Thank you.
"Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites."
"As a child studying these eternal masterpieces,"
Bach's music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up.
"Late at night, after hours of practicing,"
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents' stereo.
It all became music to me.
I didn't hear the boundaries.
I still start every day practicing playing Bach.
His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me.
"But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression,"
"I realized that with today's technological resources, there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument."
"The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience."
The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept.
"The excitement from using multi-tracking, the way I did in the piece you will hear next, comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers, all generated from a single source."
My cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas.
"When composers write music for me,"
I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.
I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before.
I want to create endless possibilities with this cello.
"I become the medium through which the music is being channeled, and in the process, when all is right, the music is transformed and so am I."

bjbjLULU JUDY WOODRUFF:
And to our two-part look at immigration.
On the U.S. Supreme Court docket Wednesday is a tough new law in Arizona.
NewsHour correspondent Tom Bearden traveled there recently and sets the scene for tomorrow's arguments.
TOM BEARDEN:
Daniel Bell's family has raised cattle on this land along Arizona's southern border since the 1930s.
"But in the past few years, he's had to repair the simple barbed-wire fence that separates the U.S. from Mexico more and more often, because the steady stream of people entering the country illegally are always cutting it."
"DANlEL BELL, Arizona:"
So this is a common occurrence every day that we deal with on the ranch.
"You can't really see, but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels."
"The black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel, rather than a whaling vessel."
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language.
"I don't pretend to [know many Irish words], but in Kerry they were often known as ""ainmhide Na seolta,"""
"""the monster with the sails."""
"Another title would be ""liop an dá lapa,"""
"""the unwieldy beast with two fins."""
"""Liabhán mór,"" suggesting a big animal."
"Or my favorite, ""liabhán chor gréine,"" ""the great fish of the sun."""
"That's a lovely, evocative name."
"On Tory Island -- a strange place anyway -- they were known as ""muldoons."""
(Laughter)
No one seems to know why.
Hope there's no one from Tory here.
Lovely place.
"But more commonly all around the island, they were known as the sunfish."
And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out.
There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world.
"Some say it's not population decline, it might be a change in the distribution of plankton."
"It's been suggested that these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change, as they're basically continuous plankton recorders, swimming around with their mouth open."
They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN.
There's movements in Europe to try and stop catching them.
"There's now a ban on catching and even landing them, even landing ones caught accidentally."
"They're not protected in Ireland; in fact, they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever, despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside."
We know very little about them.
And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface -- we try and guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface.
"I only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man, just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably come to the surface to ""bask."""
It's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience basking sharks.
They are awesome creatures.
"It gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them, to get access to them."
"What we've been doing for a couple years -- last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks, so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movement and things like that."
So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active.
You do it with scientific measurements.
"So, today what people do is they use heuristics."
And the heuristics in that space are terrible.
The second issue in display has to do with standardization of ad formats.
"So, again, here you are--you have a property, you have a place for display."
And there's not agreement at the level that it needs to be on the standardization of the delivery of the display.
And especially around interactive and video ads.
"If you think about it, the future of display ads is not a static picture, but rather an ad that brings you in--that tells you a narrative."
The best ads add real value to the consumer's experience.
We take the view that ads are valuable if they're targeted and are information-rich.
"And the most information-rich, by obvious argument, is something which involves video and a story, and a narrative, and more references."
And the technology will enable the creation of those.

Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
I don't know if that scenario will occur.
"We did our best attempt at a deal with Yahoo, and as you know, we had to cancel it at the very last minute."
We wish them the best of luck.
And Carol is a fine and able CEO.
What do I really think will happen here?
I think that the problem has to do with Microsoft's ability to use its Windows monopoly to restrict consumer choice.
That's not a new subject.
It's been discussed at great length.
"So anything that Microsoft would do that would eliminate consumer choice with respect to search engines, Internet browsers, distribution-- for which it was previously found guilty--are of concern."
And there's a history of that.
So that's what we worry about.
"I think as long as the technologies are competing on a fair to fair basis,"
I think that's great. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;MARY:
"On that note, Eric, thank you very much. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
But at the time we had to throw in the towel.
It was deemed impossible.
It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.
"The human form, in particular the human head, has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry."
"The project came back to us about a decade later, and this time with a director named David Fincher."
"Now, Fincher is an interesting guy."
"David is fearless of technology, and he is absolutely tenacious."
"And David won't take ""no."""
"And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry, that anything is possible as long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money."
"And so David had an interesting take on the film, and he threw a challenge at us."
He wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor.
It happened to be this guy.
"We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors."
"That was one idea: that we would have different actors, and we would hand off from actor to actor."
We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.
"We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up, particularly in close-up."
And makeup is an additive process.
You have to build the face up.
And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the aging to this character.
He needed to be a very sympathetic character.
"So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head, aged to appear as Benjamin, and attach that to the body of the real actor."
Sounded great.
"Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry, and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either, because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store, you know -- we see his face constantly."
So there really was no tolerable margin of error.
There were two studios involved:
Warner Brothers and Paramount.
"And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course, but it was a very high-risk proposition."
There was lots of money and reputations at stake.
But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ...
"But despite our verbal assurances, they wanted some proof."
"And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin."
And we did it in about five weeks.
Already in the early grades?
Ole:
"Yes, and then let the individual find out for themselves how to formulate the problem and how to answer it"
Martin:
So a careful introduction to existentialism?
"Ole: and identity politics,yes that wouldn't be so bad and then as the next exercise ""Who are you""? that one's not that easy, is it? we live a life with each other based on qualified guesses, right? which in a sense is tragic, right?.. but on the other hand it's very good that we can't look into each other's consciousness"
Martin:
"So the ""Who are you"" project, might start a dialogue and that wouldn't be so bad?"
"No, and dialogue has also been found in Norwegian experiments at different grade levels that dialogue Capacity and the development of it, it promotes a huge amount of skills in other subjects"
"It's like music .. music is a dialogue, right?"
Ole: it's just on another level.
Martin:
Music is the best..
Martin:
"I have an old plan to combine singing, dancing and fighting because it is the oldest culture all expressions and there must be a formation of dealing with that in some abstract synthesis"
"But we can not really get around culture, can we?"
Foundation of culture if we are to be humans.
Ole:
We can not!
Martin:
"And if you look at how the media is today as the cultural subjekts is starved, right?"
To some extend.
Ole:
Yes it is..
Martin:
If you look away from it completely popped
Ole:
"Yes yes and the unified but culture is the participation so that requires the interaction it is not a spectator role that's why I enjoy amateur music and dance so much and in fact also the fight, right because it is integration, integration you have to take part, you should not be excluded, you shouldn't just sit and stare"
You must have all the senses involved and all the bodily
"I also made another word in my doctoral thesis which I called ""Synkinestesi"""
"See, in neurobiologists the senses deputize each other, not."
"""I can taste how you look"" or ""I can hear how the tree is"" but forKinesis you get movement with in and movement embraces everything in psychology it is called proprioception which is the sense of your own body and it is the feeling that, as in a probe moves you through the world and then it's the movement that brings together all your senses and the movement expressed in dance, in battle and in the music, right"
"The solution for me, is back again to the government, because the people, most of the people here, already agree about the garbage separation or the recycle, all the slogans, like ""Reduce, reuse, recycle"" or ""Bali go clean and green""."
Everyone already agrees on those slogans.
"But what we're talking about now is after the slogan, or after the the idea, something that you wrote, the words you have to do the action right now, right?"
"So what we're waiting for now, we as the grassroots movement, or the people still doing what we believe it, what we're waiting for is the government law to support this action."
"To institute that change on such a massive scale, wow, I mean, the government needs to intervene, and it needs to intervene from the top all the way down to the village."
"Every level, you know, and the way, with regional autonomy in Indonesia, ya, the Governor can say it should be like this, but then the Bupatis need to follow suit."
They need to care; they need to really care.
"I think now the government still doesn't have any serious concern about the garbage but I do believe, especially the Balinese"
"local government, because government in Bali is quite unique, we have a formal government and an informal government, and they are both equally strong, 50-50."
"So if both these governments had a really serious concern about the garbage or waste issue, it would be socialized effectively in the public."
"We, people here, would support 100%."
So make it real.
"""Refuse plastic bags, refuse plastic bags, plastic, plastic, plastic, refuse plastic bags."
"Bali is a beautiful island, plastic bags are giving it a scaly skin,"
"Let's play music, and support a beautiful Bali without plastic."""
(Off camera) What is a social worker?A social worker is really what I call an Agent of Change
A change agent.
And that is so important to understand the distinction.
When you look at a patient.
The doctor sees the patient.
The doctor doesn't see anything else but the patient and inside the patient.
The social worker does not just see the patient.
The social worker sees family.
The community at large.
The resources within the community.
And deals with all of them.
That is your change agent.
Because we do not focus on one thing.
We focus on the entirety.
And you really can't cure anything without looking at at the entirety.
If you only work on the one individual someone with mental illness or the senior... what about what comes with the senior?
"Well there's finances, there's there's housing, there's family issues, there's all these other issues."
Shit!!
"Well done, with your stupid make-up!"
"Ah, well done, really, well done!"
"Hey, don't start!"
"See what you've done, you?"
"Oh, look at that now!"
"I've got you, you've got me, by the beard; the first one of us to laugh will get a slap"
Are you crazy?
I didn't laugh
Yes you did!
But I haven't done anyhting
Dishonesty!
"What's wrong with you, are you insane?"
"What, you got some complaints?"
"But that's almost a punch in the face, not just a slap!"
"Ah but that's normal, if you laugh hard you get a huge slap"
What?
I get a huge slap?
I get a huge slap?
"After World War II with most of Europe in ruins, tension grew between the Soviet Union and the United States."
It was clear that the next global superpower required the ability to both launch and successfully defend nuclear attacks from intercontinental ballistic missiles.
"In North America, the most vulnerable point of attack was over the North Pole."
"So in 1958, a joint effort between United States and Canada was established, known as NORAD, or North American Aerospace Defence Command."
An important line of defence was the semi-automatic ground environment.
It was an automated system of over 100 long distance radars scattered across North America.
They were connected to computerized radar stations that transmitted tracking data using telephone lines or radio waves.
"All of this radar information was fed into a primary warning center, buried a mile deep inside Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado."
This application of machine to machine communication allowed operators to make split-second decisions using information transmitted and processed automatically by computers.
"This idea of being ""online"" was quickly adapted and advanced by universities in the following years, as they understood the potential of computer networking."
"The thing that makes the computer communication network special is that it puts the workers, that is the team members who're geographically distributed in touch, not only with one another, but with the information base with which they worked all the time, and this is obviously going to make a tremendous difference in how we plan, organize, and execute almost everything of any intellectual consequence."
"If we get into a mode in which everything is handled electronically, and your only identification is some little plastic thing you stick into the machinery, that I can imagine that they want to get that settled up with your bank account just right now, and put it through all the checks, and that would require a network."
Money transfers were just one of a growing number of applications which required encryption to remain secure.
"But raising them, of course we should raise them."
The problem is that the current system of education was designed and conceived and structured for a different age.
It was conceived in the intellectual culture of the Enlightenment.
And in the economic circumstances of the Industrial Revolution.
"Before the middle  of the 19th century, there were no systems of public education."
Not really.
"I mean, you could get educated by Jesuits, you know, if you had the money, but public education,  paid for from taxation, compulsory to everybody and free at the point of delivery, that was a revolutionary idea."
And many people objected to it.
"They said it's not possible for many street kids, working class children, to benefit from public education."
"They're incapable of learning to read and write, and why are we spending time on this?"
"So, there's also built into it a whole series of assumptions about social structure and capacity."
"It was driven by an economic imperative of the time, but running right through it was an intellectual model of the mind."
Which was essentially the Enlightenment view of intelligence.
"That real intelligence consists in this capacity for a certain type of deductive reasoning, and the knowledge of the classics, originally."
What we've come to think of as academic ability.
"And this is deep in the gene pool of public education, that there are really two types of people: academic and non-academic; smart people and non-smart people."
"And the consequence of that is that many brilliant people think they're not, because they've been judged against this particular view of the mind."
"So, we have twin pillars, economic and intellectual."
And my view is that this model has caused chaos in many people's lives.
It's been great for some.
There have been people that have benefited wonderfully from it.
But most people have not.
Instead they suffer this.
"This is the modern epidemic, and it's as misplaced, and it's as fictitious."
This is the plague of ADHD.
"Now, this is a map of the instance of ADHD in America, or prescriptions for ADHD."
"Don't mistake me,"
I don't mean to say there is no such thing as Attention Deficit Disorder.
I'm not qualified to say if there is such a thing.
"I know that a great majority of psychologists, and pediatricians think there is such a thing."
But it's still a matter of debate.
"What I do know, for a fact, is it's not an epidemic."
"But, of course, that only happened because there were occasions when the Mongols did slaughter entire towns."
"So, with all that background,"
let us return to the question of Mongol awesomeness.
"First, 5 arguments for awesome:"
1.
The Mongols really did reinvigorate cross-Eurasian trade.
"The Silk Road trading routes that had existed for about 1,000 years by the time the Mongols made the scene, had fallen into disuse, but the Mongols valued trade, because they could tax it, and they did a great job of keeping their empire safe."
"It was said that a man could walk from one end of the Mongol empire to the other, with a gold plate on his head, without ever fearing being robbed."
2.
"The Mongols increased communication, through Eurasia, by developing this pony express-like system of way stations, with horses and riders that could quickly relay information."
"It was called the Yam System and it also included these amazing bronze passports, which facilitated travel."
3.
Another thing that travelled along Mongol trade routes was cuisine.
"For example, it was because of the Mongols that rice became a staple of the Persian diet, which I mention entirely because I happen to like Persian food."
4.
"The Mongols forcibly relocated people who were useful to them, like artists, and musicians, and, especially, administrators."
"As you can imagine, the Mongols weren't much for administrative tasks,"
"like keeping records, so they found people who were good at that stuff and just moved them around the empire."
"This created the kind of cross-cultural pollination that world historians, these days, get really excited about."
And 5.
"The Mongols were almost, unprecedentedly, tolerant of different religions."
"They themselves were shamanists, believing in nature spirits, but since their religion was tied to the land from which they came, they didn't expect new people to adopt it, and they didn't ask them to."
"So you could find Muslims and Buddhists and Christians, and people of any other religion you can think of, prospering throughout the Mongol empire."
"And, it's that kind of openness that has led historians to go back and re-evaluate the Mongols, seeing them as a precursor to modernity."
"But there is another side of the story that we should not forget, so here are 5 reasons why the Mongols might not be so great:"
1.
Here is Genghis Khan's definition of happiness.
"""The greatest happiness is to vanquish"
"""your enemies, to chase them before you,"
"""to rob them of their wealth,"
"""to see those dear to them bathed in tears,"
"""to clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters."""
"While in Denmark and also to some extent Sweden, we draw all the people to the cities and closing small schools, and then ""you wonder"" why people move away from the local areas.."
Could we learn from Norway?
Ole:
Ehrm ..
I've actually been working together with Norway.
Seen cultural cooperation with..
"""Nord Trøndelag"" it's called where they have jazz festivals and where they work with art and business certainly, but also the schools that are around in the villages totally worn out"
"Norway don't always use there oil money in the right way, I would say .. but some things we can learn from Norway"
"In particular, we could learn modesty of Norwegians"
Norway has the largest number of middle managers who do not want to be leaders but I like the Norwegians because they remain committed to their values
I have stayed in a folk dance farm up in Norway which was organic awarded in Norway very special..
They made the costumes and danced under the midnight sun
It was very cozy.
I also have a stringed instrument
Martin:
Yes you play the violin and viola..
Ole:
Yes!
This gives rise to ... and that's a leading question ..
Is it something that gives perspective to all this philosophy?
Ole:
"Well, first it's a good way to get thinking as music affects your mentality"
Martin:
Sherlock Holmes also enjoyd it
Ole:
"Yes, but it's proven with children and so on that in music, at least, classical music because of its mathematical structure you become more gifted by playing and wierd enough .."
"If you have thought a lot in a period you will also be better at playing but generally yes, music is incredible"
"Especially classical music for ... especially Bach who is fabulous but the entire Danish culture is far down the road built on societies and associations and in music clubs, it was the amateur music which has been an excellent element in creating precisely those things that you're talking about because of democracy, in spite of lack of skills and abilities you have been allowed join in anyway"
Martin:
"But then we're back to Peideia, the bourgeois formation included music, cause it was good in developing people into good people"
I also think it has something to do with the nobility.
They had so much time and could do what they thought was fun and what gave them the most and it was to ride and fencing and paint watercolors speak French and of course play music and they would not go down as modern nobility does today with drugs and self-pity because the transcendental activities built them up as human beings rather than take them down
Evaluation is that it's still unacceptable.
"And so, you put on another expanded control which is periodic changes to the password."
"Again, simplistic example but it gives you the idea."
"With respect to integrity, you'll remember we had the two, two, and two, which would give us eight."
The decision was to retain it.
"Retain the, the integrity risk. it was, the management decided it was acceptable because there were adequate controls in place."
"With respect to availability, it was a twelve."
The decision was made to treat it by reducing it.
"A couple of controls were put in place, maintain the server hardware periodically, install anti-virus software."
"That brought the level of threat down to oh, actually, maint, maintained the level of threat at three, but brought the level of vulnerability down to a one, so that brought our risk point down to six."
"At that point, it was acceptable, adequate controls were viewed to be in place."
"And this is the kind of thing you can do for every, every, risk that you might, or every asset, information asset in your organization above a certain level."
"And then, you know, you, you, up, you know, in front, at the beginning of the process, users define what the acceptable level of risk is."
"In this case, it was eight."
"So, at the beginning, we had one that was acceptable, and two that weren't."
"After we applied our preventive controls, we still had one that was unacceptable, and so we did something additional and we had two that were acceptable."
"So, that's, that's kind of the process you're going to go through."
Does that make sense to everybody?
"It's a little more simp, more, more straight forward than what you saw with the 800-30."
"It's something you can actually sit down and do, you know?"
"800-30 is almost, you know, a career."
"[laug hs] And that's not to say it shouldn't be used, cuz it's a very, very thorough, very complete, very comprehensive standard."
We went to the campaign head-quarters.
It was very crowded there.
Some people were standing in Mirhadi Street.
"Everyone was very anxious, and wanted to know what was going on."
Some people listened to the radio.
Some spoke of rumors of Ahmadinejad's lead.
Others denied it.
No one knew whether it was true or just rumors destined to undermine our morale.
"But around midnight it was officially declared that five million votes had been counted, out of which Mr. Ahmadinejad had obtained more than 3 million votes."
"Mousavi had one million something, and Mr. Karroubi and Rezaei had obtained very few votes."
"When we see the beautiful in our Buddhist Society, you see the beauty in your partner, you see the beauty in yourself, you see the beauty in our wonderful Prime Minister Mr Howard [laughter]."
What are you
"laughing for, you cynical group?"
[laughter].
You can see the beauty in these things!
"And jee, I mean I wouldn't like to be a Prime Minister."
Would you?
It's a very difficult job.
"So when you start to see the positive parts in these people, you're actually generating the positive emotions such as respect."
"How many people actually have respect for their parents, for their partners, for the people in authority?"
Why do we disrespect our systems?
"Because we've been cultivating those fault-finding negative thoughts in our media, in our newspapers, in our conversations."
No wonder we have a lack of disrespect.
"You know if you ask people in other countries they look at Australia - ""This is a beautiful land."
It's pretty well governed.
"It could be better but could certainly be a lot worse!"" So why don't we have respect for our institutions, why are we so negative?"
"You know if we're so negative with our institutions, we get very negative towards our partners."
"Why is it that in our modern life people have such a hard time finding a life partner, keeping them, sticking with them?"
Because they always find fault with each other.
"And why do people always have lack of self-esteem, getting depression, because they start finding fault with themselves as well."
I'm not good enough.
They're not good enough.
Life's not good enough.
Be careful because that path leads to big depression.
We're actually building up those negative emotions and instead we can build up the positive emotions.
We deliberately look for something in our partner we can respect and love and care for.
"We deliberately look in something in ourselves which we can love and care, respect."
"We deliberately look for something in life which we care about, we love and got passion for."
"And that way, by focusing on that, we're building up, generating, the positive emotions of life."
"And when you start to learn how you can generate those positive emotions, the path becomes clear just how you can have a sort of control of this emotional world of yours."
"You're not just like a rudderless ship, always going through these storms and these calms of the ocean of your emotions, but you can actually have some guidance there, you can generate beautiful emotions."
That's basically just what our whole path of Buddhism is.
Photovoltaic on rooftops.
"There will also be, within the structure itself, a composite material."
And when the sun is out the structure moves.
That they call pressure transducers.
They generate electricity by expansion and contraction.
"So all the roadways, all the rooftops are not only photovoltaic, but they are heat concentrators."
"In regions where you have natural volcanic energy, you use the heat of volcanos to boil water and turn turbines."
"And there is enough volcanic energy to propel the Earth for thousands of years, just that alone, if we develop it."
"Harnessing the Gulf Stream, these waters move under the ocean."
"There are cold water streams, there are hot water streams, moving in different directions."
We can harness them by putting a turbine in there.
There are thousands of different ways of generating electricity.
"You don't need oil or gasoline or coal, these are filthy ways."
There is very little waste in the future.
"Today we manufacture things to wear out and breakdown so you have piles of television sets, computers, and cell phones in the junkyard."
Piles of it.
"In the future we design things that last, so you can just change a part very easily by plugging it in and pull out the transistor, put in another one."
It blinks and tells you where the problem is.
Your cell phone will repair itself when it can.
"In other words, the way a machine repairs itself, it has, say, three resistors or transistors, and when one fails the other one rotates and plugs in."
I think machines can do almost anything man can do except feel.
"Mr. Fresco has proposed innovative solutions to many of the environmental issues facing the world, such as the global shortage of clean, potable water."
"When it rains, we harness the water."
We direct the water to storage basins.
"Instead of floods, we build canals all across the world, in different countries."
"And those canals terminate the floodwaters into strip mining, where we dug big holes in the Earth."
We left these ugly places all over the world.
"In the future, we will store floodwaters there to be used at a later date."
We don't pour chlorine in the water.
Do you know that most embalming fluids are in all the reservoirs of all the big cities?
You can't put embalming fluid in dead people and not know that it doesn't go down into the ground and contaminate the water table.
"When you spray poisons on plants, it's very hard to wash those poisons off, because they do go inside the food you eat."
Is less.
"The time, the, the twin number, The twin on Earth aged during this segment is, indeed, less than the time that, the moving twin aged here."
And the same bi-symmetry is true up there.
"But when you add this extra segment from jumping ships, it's unambiguous the twin on Earth is older."
This is not a contradiction to relativity.
There is a difference between them.
You could measure the difference.
One of them accelerated.
Okay.
So we've cleared up the paradox We understand that the twin that accelerated remained younger and there is not a violation of relativity because you could measure the difference between the two.
"One was inertial, one accelerating."
"Okay, but there is an unsatisfactory feeling to this resolution because what I've essentially done is hidden all my ignorance in this instant of infinite acceleration where instantaneously as seen by the moving twin is."
"Suddenly aged all the difference that makes up the, the, the, for the, for the,"
"Lorentz, the time dilation that he otherwise would have seen."
This infinity doesn't make sense.
Can I do better?
Well of course I can do better.
"What I really wanna do, and in fact, the only physical thing to do, is you can't have infinite acceleration."
You could apply a finite acceleration and you could round off this corner a little bit.
And now I have a story without infinite acceleration.
"You can ask well what happens here? computing here is a little bit more difficult, because now the moving twin is not in an inertial frame."
"The way I cheated before was, that I, he jumped from one inertial frame to another inertial frame."
"And I ignored the acceleration that this implies, now I have to deal with this acceleration."
And that requires a little more calculation then we have.
"But we can get a sense for what this implies, by imagining here's a trick that will cause him to accelerate."
Remember I want him to be moving to the right and then accelerated to the left.
And the way I'm gonna do this is I'm gonna imagine that
"Somewhere out here, I don't know."
Little distance not exactly in the direction it is moving so it isn't crashing there.
But not far from there lies a star a heavy massive object.
"And what I am going to imagine is that as this twin approaches, the star is accelerated and then goes into hyperbolic orbit and is deflected by the star so that he comes back to the earth."
So basically I arrange the angles so that he overshoots the star.
"The work stations are so spacious, and they're beautiful, they're glistening, they're just calling us to come cook."
(Anna) There is this huge lounge.
"Like, every cookbook I could ever hope to own."
It's just a dream.
Come up here and join us.
(Becky) It's amazing.
It's gorgeous.
"Like, if you take every culinary equipment and throw it all together and cover it in gold and then dip it in chocolate and then put it on a pedestal, that's the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen."

Cook every dish like your life depends on it.
"On the count of three, you'll lift those boxes."
"The mystery box challenge, it's exactly like when I open up the fridge, and there's a couple of this, a couple of that, which happens to me every single night. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;One, two,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; three. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Lift.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Wow.
"I'm trying to figure out,"
"like, what is that?"
I have no idea what to do with it.
I see this beautiful duck breast.
"My heart lifts, because I know how it tastes."
I've worked with it before.
"You've all got &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the most amazing duck breasts,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;kale,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;rhubarb,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;dark rum,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sweet potato,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;five spice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;fresh bananas,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and some maple syrup. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Prove to us&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that you truly belong here&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; in this kitchen."
"People, when they lift that mystery box, they can see exactly what's underneath there."
"I have to listen to what the judges say when they list the ingredients, and try to commit that to my memory."
Your 60 minutes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;starts from...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Now.
Good luck.
Basically we're getting a lot of donations.
And with those donations we're using to buy supplies and food for everyone.
This is our dish washing area.
"And we have feeding tables here, it's like a buffet."
And all our storage is in the center.
And that's our donation area over there.
"The importance of having a strong media presence is unquestioinable, i mean, we need to have very powerful, positive media representation."
"And if we're not getting it from the mainstream media outlets,"
Then we've got to do it and create it ourselves.
"We're not allowed to erect any structures here in the plaza, so we're not allowed to put up any tents, we're not allowed to hang anything from the trees,"
"So when it rains, we pretty much just have to cover everything with tarps."
"We have one generator, I think another one just came recently,"
"We're running laptops, recharging batteries, recharging cell phones."
"We have a bunch of shooters, people out filming, who have signed up for different shifts, or have basically just showed up and said,"
"""Look, i have a camera, I'm ready to film."""
"We send them out to go film a workshop, or a march or a protest, whatever, and then they come back and we have an ingest department, where they ingest the footage, transcode it, whatever needs to be done,"
"And then give it to an editor, who either edits here, or in an off-campus location to bring it back to upload."
[protester]
I love my freedoms and this is my street!
I won't be surrendering because I have freedom in my streets!
"Yeah, we'll focus on that, all right?"
"Let me know if it's too much pressure or not, all right?"
"It's a stressfull environment, you're always going to have people kind of itching for some kind of confrontation, and this is anti-confrontational."
"This really can do a lot for people, you know?"
"Bring down stress levels, and you think differently, you speak differently, so if they're in a confrontation with someone else here because they've been sleeping out here for two weeks, or a police officer or a heckler, they might handle it in a calmer, more rational way."

"Alright, so hopefully you used some tools to make that a little bit simpler for you."
"If we load up the developer tools here, we can see that we've already got a syntax error."
"And if we go over, and click right here on line 28, and it'll take us right to where the offending error is."
"I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend to understand the genetics."
And that's why it's great to have collaboration.
"Whereas I'm a field person,"
I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on.
Take me away.
So we can work with geneticists who understand that.
"So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks, they found that the diversity was incredibly low."
"If you look at the first line, really, you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar."
I think this means they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry.
"But if you look at nucleotide diversity, which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents, you see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study, was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species."
You can see this work was only done in 2006.
"Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks."
We had no idea:
Did they distinguish into different populations?
Were there subpopulations?
"And that's very important if you want to know what the population size is, and the status of the animals."
"So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable, really."
"So he did another study using microsatellites, which is much more expensive, much more time-consuming, and to his surprise, came up with almost identical results."
"So it does seem to be that basking sharks, for some reason, have incredibly low diversity."
"And it's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck, thought to have been 12,000 years ago, and this has caused a very low diversity."
"And yet, if you look at the whale shark, which is the other plankton-eating large shark, its diversity is much greater."
So it doesn't really make sense at all.
"They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks: even though they're found throughout the world, you couldn't tell the difference, genetically, from one from the Pacific, Atlantic, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa."
They all basically seem the same.
"Which, again, is kind of surprising; you wouldn't expect that."
I don't understand or pretend to understand this;
"I suspect most geneticists don't either, but they produce the numbers."
So you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics.
And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size:
"8,200 animals."
"That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world."
"You're thinking, ""That's ridiculous."
And desire this public
"Notice may be given of their Resolution, so their Parents and Friends may have sufficient Time to be providing Homespun Cloaths for them."""
[laughter]
It was like: 'we are making a proclamation.
"Mom, send me some clothes.'"
[laughter]
That was like--okay.
[laughs]
But the feeling was there.
[laughs]
"And even better, they want their parents to provide homespun clothes,"
"""that none of them may be obliged to the hard Necessity of unfashionable Singularity, by wearing imported Cloth."""
Okay.
"'Mom, if you don't send me clothes,"
I'm going to have to wear imported clothes and I'm going to be really unpopular'-- so--[laughter] guilting the parents.
"Okay, but anyway that's--Yale students of the 1760s actually making acts of protest, organizing themselves into active protest."
"Now Yale isn't unique in this way, actually."
"Throughout the--this period, colonial colleges in a variety of different places were places that tended to brew sentiment-- political sentiment that was rebellious or outraged at some of the acts being imposed by the British government."
"Actually, Yale and Harvard and the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton, tended to be particularly well-known as sort of seedbeds of unrest-- particularly angry students who had strong political feelings, but there were other colleges as well where the students really were provoked to acts of protest in a variety of different ways."
"And I--this morning in researching for this lecture,"
I found a bunch of Princeton/College of New Jersey students who decided that no one in Princeton should be drinking tea.
So they went out into the town and just personally forced their way in to people's houses and when they found tea they burned it.
"That would be really popular--right?--and then one of them said something like, ""That was a real frolic."""
[laughter]
Okay.
[laughs]
The town must have been very pleased.
"I think in another college the commencement exercises, the speeches that the students gave at a commencement exercise, at a pretty early point actually, they debated, one for, one and against the possibility of independence."
I think that was in 1769.
You had students at one college who decided that would be what would be happening at their commencement ceremony is they would have that debate.
"It's a really early point and again, pretty radical."
"So we're kind of looking at a long-standing pattern of college students being bold and radical during times of political controversy and political unrest, and this is happening throughout the colonies in this period."
But it will come.
You can be sure of that.
"That means, today is not tomorrow yet?"
Today - is today.
And tomorrow will be tomorrow.
Every day?
Every day.
That's wonderful!
Every day will be tomorrow!
The End Subbed by Eus
"My beloved brothers and sisters, as we gather once again in a general conference of the Church,"
I welcome you and express my love to you.
"We meet each six months to strengthen one another, to extend encouragement, to provide comfort, to build faith."
We are here to learn.
Some of you may be seeking answers to questions and challenges you are experiencing in your life.
Some are struggling with disappointments or losses.
Each can be enlightened and uplifted and comforted as the Spirit of the Lord is felt.
"Should there be changes which need to be made in your life, may you find the incentive and the courage to do so as you listen to the inspired words which will be spoken."
May each of us resolve anew to live so that we are worthy sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.
May we continue to oppose evil wherever it is found.
How blessed we are to have come to earth at such a time as this —a marvelous time in the long history of the world.
"We can't all be together under one roof, but we now have the ability to partake of the proceedings of this conference through the wonders of television, radio, cable, satellite transmission, and the Internet —even on mobile devices."
"We come together as one, speaking many languages,"
"living in many lands, but all of one faith and one doctrine and one purpose."
"From a small beginning 182 years ago, our presence is now felt throughout the world."
"This great cause in which we are engaged will continue to go forth, changing and blessing lives as it does so."
"No cause, no force in the entire world can stop the work of God."
"Despite what comes, this great cause will go forward."
You recall the prophetic words of the Prophet Joseph Smith:
"""No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done."""
"There is much that is difficult and challenging in the world today, my brothers and sisters, but there is also much that is good and uplifting."
"As we declare in our thirteenth article of faith,"
"Normally, the first sound is slightly lower in pitch in comparison with the second sound."
"[normal first and second heart sounds, S1 and S2]"
Thank you.
Good morning.
We came here to do a presentation a bit more academic than the other two.
"Lorenzo Escot and I teach at the Complutense University of Madrid, and we have a research group that has spent years analyzing matters of gender equality, mostly in the labor market."
Our presentation is called:
"""Few women are directors because few men are caretakers""."
"Saying this, what we want is somehow, to address the question of why there is a presence so scarce of women, disappointingly, in the higher directive positions."
"After so many years, or so many decades of women having access to the labor market."
"For example, in companies listed in stock market, the IBEX-35, women in advising positions make up 8%."
"Their presence is still very low, and there are issues of permanence."
We wanted to address this type of issue but in a slightly different way.
"What we do is somehow go to the other side, why are there so few men who are caretakers."
"That is, men who have unpaid jobs, who work at home, taking care of kids, relatives, etc."
"Because we feel like, and the literature available proves it, that there is a high correlation."
"On the other hand, as we have been doing in our other two presentations, when we speak about gender matters, we're not speaking of women alone, we're talking about both women and men."
And they're interconnected.
"So the first point I'd like to deal with is, very briefly, what are the theories that explain why there still is a small presence of women in high positions in organizations."
One of the popular ones is the glass ceiling theory.
"""Glass ceiling"" refers to barriers, invisible barriers that limit the access of women to those higher positions within organizations."
I would also say that such barriers are external to women.
"And it has to do with matters such as, for example, not belonging to the networks or having the contacts that are necessary in order to plot."
One must plot to make it to the higher positions in an organization.
Maybe you need to play golf.
And women need to do certain things that they still do not normally do nowadays.
"For example, it also has to do with the lack of role models."
"This will disappear as time passes, but it's hard."
It's also related to stereotypes.
What are women good at?
What are men good at?
These are stereotypes related to social gender roles which have a great influence.
Statistics is different.
It is much more clear how gender matters get involve.
If we come to the conclusion that discrimination based on statistics is the one that is relevant in this case.
"We would continue by thinking what we can do so that we grant men access to care taking activities under the same conditions, family, children, basic domestic responsibilities."
"We must assume that most men would be ready to take it up, and many are already doing it."
"Not focusing on a gender war or something alike, but accepting that is a tendency that is also there."
What could we do to speed it up?
"From an economic policy point of view, what could be done?"
And here we have a list of suggestions.
"For us, the first of them is absolutely compulsory."
"That is, to equal the duration of maternity and paternity leaves, something that they're doing already in some other countries,"
"like in Nordic countries, Germany, even in Portugal!"
"Here it's starting, but we have a long road to go."
"We may take as an example the law, that some times sets an example."
"Sometimes, what laws say end up having an influence on our values."
"In this case, what does the law say in relation to parental leave?"
It says that when we have a child mothers have 16 weeks to take care of the children and fathers have only 2.
The law makes the father role look less important.
In such an important moment as that.
"Because many men find out what is taking care and what are egalitarian attitudes at that very same moment, when they really start getting involved, when they take care of their own children."
"It is a key moment, but here the law says no that this is mainly a woman's thing."
"Plus, it is the only legal discrimination based on gender that is left in Spanish law."
"We believe that if we don't change this, no matter what deadline we set."
We should change it to a month.
"We were supposed to pass this law in January, but it has been postponed due to budget deficit."
This is a key point for us.
The next one is the elimination of the gender bias in the reconciliation of work and family life.
"Sorry, did I go overtime?"
(Audience) No.
"The gender bias or feminine bias, regarding reconciliation in companies."
This is also very interesting for us.
"Through studies about reconciliation of work and family life we have observed that sometimes, human resources departments in companies only think of it as a need of their women workers."
"Self efficacy, caught in the motivation, and tolerance or ambiguity."
"By self efficacy, what we mean is that this is your belief that you can do something and something specific."
"So it's not self confidence, which is a bit more of a broader perception."
But it's efficacy in that you believe for a given scenario and a given situation that you can have success with that.
That you will be effective in that situation for that particular task or activity.
And that's a key predictor of individual performance.
The second element that we'll look at is the cognitive motivation.
"And again, that's that element of thinking."
Do you like to research?
"Do you like to understand? do you like to get a good clean sense of what's involved and what's at stake, and what you can do in that scenario?"
"And we see that if you do not have that high level of cognitive motivation, you tend to perhaps over rely on assumptions or experience."
And we see that successful entrepreneurs often have a higher need for cognitive motivation and that they're willing to do the research and they're willing to try and understand why things happen or may happen as they will.
And the third element is the tolerance re-ambiguity.
And that fundamentally is just being comfortable with change.
It's recognizing that you can't predict everything that things are going to happen that are unexpected.
And that you're comfortable within that.
And you believe that you can be successful within that changing environment.
"There are three cognitive biases to think about and to be aware of, and some of these are positives, and some of these can be negatives."
And the first if over confidence.
We certainly want to be confident.
We certainly want to believe in our venture.
But it's perhaps too much of a good thing if you are over confident.
"So, in that way, we want to be careful not to be overly ambitious."
And we've talked before about throwing good money after that.
It is okay to close a venture.
"It is okay to start something and stop it. and in that way again, there's something to be learned from that."
"But, you certainly want to be sure you know, that you balance your ideas."
That your thoughts are supported by research and that your assumptions are validated.
Representatives.
What we mean here is that you want to be sure that you are not basing your decisions on too small of a sample set.
"That you don't ask someone if they like your idea, they say yes, and you start your venture."
Ask many people.
In search of pastures and water sources they frequently cross the border with their cattle and goats.
"Cholima Logid, a father of nine used to cross the border to trade livestock. but he was confronted with different challenges."
Diseases cross the border with ease.
Pastoraslists can only rely on services offered at endpoints in either Uganda or Kenya.
Like here in Moroto Uganda where local organizations maintain routine checkups.
But there are differences in the quality and the prices of the veterinary services offered on both sides of the border.
And the lack of coordination makes it difficult to control disease outbreaks.
"With support from the European Union and ECHO this situation prompted IGAD, FAO and other organizations to initiate programs harmonized animal health care on both sides of the border."
April 2013 a Memorandum of Understanding between the government of Uganda and Kenya is signed.
The agreement commits both governments to develop programs for animal health care in the border regions.
The local NGO ACTED initiated the process.
ACTED's role began in August 2011. when we initiated a cross-border meeting ona very local level just among the district veterinary officers.
At that time it was to address and outbreak of Brucellosis.
We learned at that time that the dvos didn't have the freedom to work together without blessings from their ministries. and as a result we needed to move to ministry level.
Under the RlSPA initiative
"FAO liaised with the governments of Uganda and Kenya and animal health coordination was moved up the political agenda, resulting in the"
Memorandum of Understanding.
The next step is now to implement.
And the implementation entails development of a program program that is going to look up specifics on how to coordinate and share information.
Number two on how to have common activities.
For example in animal health.
How will they synchronize the vaccinations and treatment information.
The sharing and surveillance.
So that's a critical part of memorandum.
After the devastating drought that hit the Horn of African in 2011 governments in Eastern Africa spearheaded initiatives to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities
This new partnership is an important step.
One of the first issues to tackle is a frequenty reported lack of drugs to treat sick livestock.
Here Timothy Kelae is spraying a goat against tick.
But getting the spray and other treatments and medicines is a major issue.
The MoU will not necessarily provide the drugs  but the key thing is the implemenation of it which is going to be through the program.
The program now will go specifically to where the need is.
If there is a need of drugs
We need to make sure that we do not harden our hearts to God's work.
"We need to make sure that we allow Him to work through us, work in us, and ultimately shape us and change us to be able to use the various gifts and talents that He's given us for His glory."
I hope you were blessed by this.
Have a great day!
Projectile Motion
In this AP maths interactive model we are going to take a look at the independence of the horizontal and vertical components of velocity.
And this will help us understand projectile motion.
"So I have a red ball and a blue ball, equal mass, and we are just going to let them drop under free fall."
So you can see that their motion is identical.
I will just go through that in slow motion.
At each frame the vertical motion there is identical.
I'm going to project the red ball horizontally at five meters per second.
Now vertically I haven't changed anything.
We will pressure up.
When I move through these frames in slow motion the vertical motion remains identical.
Take this point here.
"Even though the red ball's horizontal components of velocity is five meters per second and it's being projected towards the right, vertically nothing has changed."
Both balls still vertical components of velocity equal to minus six point four meters per second and they are both the same height.
I will reset again and this time I will change the horizontal velocity to eight meters per second.
"Once again, if I go through this frame by frame we see that the vertical motion of both balls is identical."
The only difference is the red ball has a horizontal component of velocity and it is being projected horizontally.
"What I will do this time, I will also give the balls an initial vertical velocity."
Both balls are going to be projected upwards at four meters per second.
Let's see that again in slow motion.
Frame by frame again we see that the vertical motion of both balls is identical.
The only difference is the horizontal component of the red ball's velocity.
And this is very important when we are trying to model projectile motion.
The horizontal and vertical components of velocity are independent and we can model them separately.

"Refrigerant leaks are the most common problem in an air conditioning system, and are usually the result of faulty hoses or rubber"
O-rings.
Large leaks are rare and require the system to be opened up for repair.
"Hence, these animals were in Central Italy before Roman times."
"However, agriculture also arrived to Italy way before Romans."
"In fact, the Neolithization of Italy occurred about 6000 years BC."
How to narrow down the arrival period of these cattle?
"Mitochondrial DNA, our time machine, helps also in this case."
"By reconstructing genealogies and knowing DNA mutation rate, it became possible to date the ancestors shared by modern Central Italian and South West Asian cattle."
These ancestors lived in South West Asia and a branch of their progeny moved to Tuscany.
"The molecular clock dated their arrival around 2,000 BC."
"So we have some evidence on a possible relationship with the Etruscans: geography, date, the sea route..."
"They arose in Central Italy in the first millennium BC, exactly in that area."
"Look, we found a real proof of this..."
"I'm kidding, no scientific journal would take it as an evidence, however we found an Etruscan fibula representing a Maremmana-like bull, a male one."
"You see female horns are lyre-shaped, while male ones are crescent-shaped."
The origin of Etruscan civilization is still debated.
"The Italian school supports the local origin of Etruscans even if a clear influence from Eastern culture is acknowledged, so that their period of highest development is referred to as the Oriental Period- but they think they're local."
European Experts are divided between local origin with Eastern influence and purely Eastern origin.
"Archaeologists have different opinions, as linguists do."
"We only understand a few words of their language, and we know the Etruscan alphabet."
"But no analogous to the Rosetta Stone, that could allow us to understand Egyptian hieroglyphic, was ever found."
"Interestingly, some Etruscan words seem to have more sense when interpreted according to the Semitic rather than Indo-European languages."
"Herodotus, in his ""Stories"" reports that Etruscans were Lydians, once settled on the coast of modern Turkey, that sailed to Tuscany and funded the Etruscan civilization."
Human genetics for a long time have produced inconclusive results.
Etruscan bones have been analysed.
The results indicate modern Tuscans as the closest population to Etruscans and Anatolians just a little further.
"Since Etruscans were critical in interpreting our results, we seek advice from re-known human geneticists."
And since we were no longer talking about
"Etruscan cattle, but people, we went to Cavalli Sforza and his colleagues."
Antonio Torroni at that time was working on human DNA from people
living in small villages of Etruscan heritage.
This because people in large cities are probably mixed and have excessively diluted
DNA signatures of ancient origin.
The end of the story is that we joined bovine and human evidence.
Now what does statement two tell us?
6 of the cans sit exactly along the length of the carton.
"So they're telling us that these cans, there's 6 cans that fit right along the length, which we figured out from statement number one."
But that also gives you the same information as statement number one.
Because you know that these are cylindrical cans.
I think it's a safe assumption to say that these are circles.
Yeah.
"A cylinder, you're assuming that the tops are circles."
"So if you say that 6 can fit that way, then you know that the diameter of each of them is 8 centimeters and then you can make the same argument that the diameter's 8 centimeters to say that 4 can fit the other way down."
"So two, alone, is also sufficient by itself."
"So the answer is, what is that, C?"
"Both statements-- no D, each statement, alone, is sufficient."

It is around now you're living out the cliche gringo fantasy of becoming an honorary native and leading the resistance forces but screw it.
"If you don't take advantage of the talent, you're inefficient."
"If there is a lot of competition, you'll get displaced."
"However, there's a second type of discrimination: statistics."
And this is one is much more persistent.
I'd say this one is recognized by those of you who work in human resources and it has a lot to do with the gap hypothesis.
Think about the employer of the previous example who must decide who to promote.
Both candidates are 30 and have no children.
It's about a promotion to a high managing position.
Both have a very good CV.
Who will you promote?
"Statistically, we observe that for people who are 30 and have no kids, the probability of having children in the near future is quite high."
"Also statistically, empiric evidence shows, there is a quite high percentage of women that slow their career when they have kids, but very few men do that."
"For example, taking up part-time, or reduce the working shift when they have kids."
"From a human resources point of view, if we think about maximizing the company's profit, with incomplete information and uncertainty, and based on statistics, because they don't know the candidates personally, maybe they will choose to promote him and not her."
"Because that was their only difference, one was a woman and the other a man."
In that case discrimination happens.
But it's not based on prejudices or misogyny
like with the previous example.
It is much more rational.
It's a rational managing of an organization that we want to make profit.
"It may be unpleasant, but it is not based on the wrong values, because it is only financial managing."
"This is much more subtle, and, therefore, as I pointed out, it is much harder to get rid off."
"Competition is not going to displaced it,"
It is based on what we just mentioned in the gap hypothesis or concrete ceiling. that we just mentioned.
"If we believe the explanation of discrimination based on gender in the labor market is mainly here,"
"- because Gary Becker's theory, in my opinion, is very useful in order to explain discrimination against other type of minorities, for example, ethnic minorities,"
"like religious, cultural differences, etc."
"There it is true that sometimes there is xenophobia, pure prejudice."
"""I don't like to work,"" says the employer, for example, ""with Latin Americans,"" or something like that."
That is a person with a certain ideology
that will end up being inefficient because they don't make the most of it.
But this other is different.
Hi.
I'm Richard Mckenzie.
"In past lectures, my focus has been on what competitive markets do right, or how they tend to maximize production, and efficiency."
Efficiency.
Giving the constraints of supply and demand.
And make no mistake about it.
Markets do a lot of good in this world.
"Just take a look around at all the goods at your disposal, at prices that are often surprisingly low."
I remain dazzled by how much computing power I can buy today for a few hundred dollars.
"Frankly I'm amazed, at how little the equipment, and software used to produce these video lectures cost."
"To produce this video course, two decades ago would have cost a minor fortune."
Involving any number of people who would need to
"labor away for weeks, to get each video, lecture, in final form."
Thanks to the ongoing competition in technology markets over the past twenty years.
The production of this course really is a one man show.
"Both on the screen, and behind it."
I'm also impressed with how market prices summarize so much information on relative values in costs of.
People around the country and world.
"And with how those, summary prices ease the problems of shopping."
We don't need to know much about the cost of all the components that go into large screen televisions.
"All we have to do is compare the prices, along with their differing features, to make the choice."
That we need to make.
"Over past lectures, I have also shown how some government policies that seek to interrupt or redirect the forces of supply and demand can often have unanticipated and even perverse effects."
"In this and the following lecture, I will seek to explore the conditions under which competitve markets will not work well, or with the full efficiency that we have described."
"In these two lectures, I will deal with problems caused."
Caused by so called externalities.
"Externalities, for economists, are the positive or negative effects that exchanges may have on people who are not involved in market trades."
"They are sometimes called third party effects, or spill over effects."
"When su ch effects are pleasurable, they are called external benefits."
"When they are unpleasant or impose the cost on people other than the buyers or sellers, they are called external costs."
"In this, in the next lecture I will take up external benefits."
"In this lecture I will restrict my discussion of the effects of external costs on the competitive market in terms of their effects on production, prices, and efficiency."
Any escape into the future or the past is examined with the likely resistance on the ongoing encounters.
"A modern man has alienated, given up so much of his potential but his ability to cope with his existence becomes badly impoverished."
My aim is this:
"the patient should recover his lost potential, he should think it great the conflicting collarities, understand the difference between in pain, especially the pain of verbal games, on the one hand, and have genuine authentic confident behavior on the other."
"The civil war of inner conflicts weakens the deficiency of the conflict of the patient, that every bit of integration and strength."
"Now, in the safe emergency of the therapeutic situation,"
"I repeat, in the safe emergency of the therapeutic situation, the patient begins to take risks."
"He does transform energies from manipulating the environment for support into developing greater and greater self support, but he relies on his own resources."
This process is called Maturation.
"Once the patient has learned to stand on his own feet emotionally, intellectually, and economically this need for therapy will collapse."
He will wake up from the nightmare of his existence.
"The basic technique is this, not to explain to things the patient, but to provide the patient with opportunities to understand and to discover himself."
For this purpose I manipulate and frustrate the patient in such a way that he is confronting himself.
In this process he identifies with his lost potential.
"For instance, through assimilating his projections by acting out."
By acting out the irritating parts of himself.
"Principally, I consider any interpretation to be a therapeutic mistake as this would imply the therapist understands the patient better, than the patient himself."
"Takes a view from the patient himself of discovering himself, by himself, and prevents him from finding out his own values and stuff."
"On the other hand, I disregard most of the content of what the patient says and concentrate most on the non-verbal level as this is the only one which is less subject to self deception."
"And its verbal, pseudo self expression, on the non-verbal level the revelant"
Gestalt will always emerge and can dealt with in the here and now.
We are going to interview for half and hour.
Right away I'm scared.
"You say you're scared, but you're smiling."
I don't understand how one can be scared and smile at the same time.
And I'm also suspicious of you.
I think you understand very well.
I think you know that... ...when I get scared I laugh or I kid to cover up.
Uh-huh.
Do you have stage fright?
"Uh, I don't know."
I'm mostly aware of you.
"Although these particles may be difficult to study, they are plentiful."
Each second more than 50 trillion electron neutrinos from the Sun pass through you.
"Finally, astronomers and physicists have joined forces to build gravitational wave detectors."
"These ""telescopes"" do not observe radiation or catch particles."
"Instead they measure tiny ripples in the very structure of space-time, a concept predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity."
"With a stunning variety of instruments, astronomers have opened up the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, and have even ventured beyond."
But some observations simply can't be done from the ground.
The answer?
Space telescopes.
Hubblecast is produced by ESA / Hubble at the European Southern Observatory in Germany.
The Hubble mission is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.
Now it is a time of simplification:  everything becomes simpler.
"It is simpler to wash our clothes,  our dishes, to travel in space."
"Though, unfortunately,  the culture becomes simpler."
"The culture becomes different:  it changes its rate, its depth, and many other of its parameters."
"I'm not going to judge this process, it has many objective  and positive causes: the changes of communicational forms,  even new communicational civilization is connected to the Internet and different technical innovations which really make many things  simpler and better."
But there is also a loss of depth.
"There are also subjective elements  connected to, for example, simplification of culture in our country which is not always very positive."
"And we understand perfectly  that because of the development of different media, TV, etc., we also lose much."
What can we set over against it  without judgment?
"We can create ""spaces of complexity."""
"Unfortunately, there aren't many genres  where these spaces are possible."
"It is very difficult to combine this  with different new institutions, but it is real to combine this with  traditional institutions like museums."
Museums have all chances to be justified  as spaces of deepening of culture.
"Unfortunately, till now  they don't work this way."
For reforming them this way  we should work a lot.
What does this job consist of?
"First of all, goal-setting."
Every museum action or movement from ventilation of repository  to working with every audience --
I'm not even talking now  about the main tasks --
"like exhibitions, expositions,  scientific events, etc., all these actions should be considered  in connection with goals."
"The goals form themselves  and goals form the depth, and, at the same time,  they solve many tasks."
Each move will be made with millimetre precision.
Many objects in the Universe also glow in the infrared.
"Discovered by William Herschel, infrared radiation is often also called ""heat radiation"" because it is emitted by all relatively warm objects, including humans."
You may be more familiar with infrared radiation than you think.
"Because on Earth, this kind of radiation is used by night vision goggles and cameras."
"But to detect the faint infrared glow from distant objects, astronomers need very sensitive detectors, cooled down to just a few degrees above absolute zero in order to suppress their own heat radiation."
"Today, most big optical telescopes are also equipped with infrared cameras."
"They allow you to see right through a cosmic dust cloud, revealing the newborn stars inside, something that just cannot be seen in the optical."
"For example, take this optical image of the famous stellar nursery in Orion."
But look how different it is when seen through the eyes of an infrared camera.
Been able to seeing the infrared is also very helpful when studying the most distant galaxies.
The newborn stars in a young galaxy shine very brightly in the ultraviolet.
But then this ultraviolet light has to travel for billions of years across the expanding Universe.
"The expansion stretches the light-waves, so that when they are received by us they've been shifted all the way into the near infrared."
This stylish instrument is the MAGlC telescope on La Palma.
"It searches the sky for cosmic gamma rays, the most energetic form of radiation in nature."
"Lucky for us, the lethal gamma rays are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere."
But they do leave behind footprints for astronomers to study.
"After heating the atmosphere, they produce cascades of energetic particles."
"These, in turn, cause a faint glow that MAGlC can see."
And here is the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina.
It doesn't even look like a telescope.
"Pierre Auger consists of 1,600 detectors, spread over 3,000 square kilometres."
They catch the particle fallout of cosmic rays from distant supernovas and black holes.
And what about neutrino detectors?
"Built in deep mines or beneath the surface of the ocean, or in the Antarctic ice."
Could you call those telescopes?
"Well, why not?"
"After all they do observe the Universe, even if they don't capture data from the electromagnetic spectrum."
Neutrinos are elusive particles that are produced in the Sun and supernova explosions.
They were even produced in the Big Bang itself.
"Unlike other elementary particles, neutrinos can pass through regular matter, travel near the speed of light and have no electric charge."
The Mekong river basin is the land surrounding all the streams and rivers that flow into it
"This covers a vast area, roughly the size of France and Germany combined"
"On its long journey, across 6 countries, the Mekong provides a lifeline, to over 65 million people"
"They share Mekong waters for drinking, farming, fishing, and industry"
"Along the way, the river also generates electricity for Southeast Asia's emerging economies"
The Mekong has sustained life for thousands of years
But growing human demands are slowly building up environmental pressures on the river
"A new study, commissioned by the UN Environment Programme cautions that climate change could add to this in the coming years"
"The climate change would affect, in fact, the effect will come in the amount of rainfall which is received"
So under climate changing conditions we expect
less rainfall to be observed
And that would bring less flows in the river which would affect the water usage in the downstream area
"Dr. Muken Barbel, is a researcher at the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok"
He led a team of experts who studied what makes the Mekong waters vulnerable
"The study probed how climate change can impact the river from the highlands to the delta, affecting the survival and prosperity of millions"
"At the same time, the sea level rise, which is an associated impact of climate change would bring more seawater into the river systems and groundwater systems in the delta in Vietnam"
"Saltwater could go upstream by 60 to 70 kilometers, degrading the land and water in the Mekong delta"
"This would add to pressures already coming from growing human numbers, expanding economies, and disappearing forests"
Farmers would be among the most affected by these changes
"Today, most of the Mekong's waters are used for irrigated agriculture, especially for growing rice"
But the demands from cities and industries are rising
"If you look at the majority of water used, it's in the agricultural sector"
"And also, in the future when economic growth which is taking place in Southeast Asia will put tremendous pressure on the water resources and for that, we will need to be careful from now"
Some farmers realize they will soon have to manage with less water
"Man Pipakman, is a rice farmer,"
"living in Chonburi, in Northeastern Thailand"
"Farmers here use water from the upper Mun river, a tributary of the Mekong"
They get their water from a local reservoir
"But soon, it will also supply water to the nearby city of Korat"
"If they take water to the town, how can we get enough for rice fields?"
There's already not enough water
This can spell trouble for her rice fields
Today the palace is an important symbol of Mandalay. Many tourists and visitors come to see it.
Atumashi Monastery.
"The Atumashi Monastery is a Buddhist monastery. A monastery is a building where monks (holy men) live, work, and pray. This place is a ""kyaung"", a special kind of monastery. The name means ""inimitable ""vihara""."""
The monastery burned down in 1890. Only the plinth (bottom platform) did not burn. The government decided to rebuild the monastery. They started building on 2 May 1995. It was finished being built in June of 1996.
Mandalay Hill.
Mandalay Hill is a big hill in Mandalay. It is a holy hill. There is a legend about the hill. The Buddha visited the hill and made a prophecy. He said that some day a great city would be built at the bottom of the hill.
"The hill is tall. There is a road to the top. There are many temples, monasteries, and pagodas built on the hill."
Kuthowdaw Pagoda.
The Kuthodaw Pagoda is a very large pagoda. It was built by King Mindon in 1857. It was designed to look like the Shwezigon Pagoda in Nyaung U.
"There are 729 rocks around the pagoda. Each rock is smooth and has writing on it. The writing are the words of the ""Tipiṭaka"". (The ""Tipiṭaka"" are the Buhhdist holy books.) These stone rocks are the ""world's largest book."""
Mahamuni Buddha Temple.
The Mahamuni Buddha Temple is one of the most important Buddhist temples. It has an important Buddha statue. The statue was made during the life of the Gautama Buddha. The Gauthama Buddha hugged the statue seven times. This caused the statue to come to life.
Buddhists believe that the statue is alive because of this. They call it the Mahamuni Sacred Living Image. This makes the Mahamuni Temple the most holy pagoda in Mandalay.
The temple was built by King Bodawpaya in 1784. The Buddha is sitting. It is tall.
Other places.
Near the bottom of Mandalay Hill is the Kyauktawgyi Pagoda. It was built by King Mindon from 1853 to 1878. It was carved out of one big block of marble. Around it are 80 arahants.
The Yadanabon Zoological Garden is a small zoo in Mandalay. It is in between the palace and Mandalay Hill. It is the only zoo in the world that has Burmese roofed turtles.
"The Shwenandaw Monastery (, ; lit. ""Golden Palace Monastery"") is an important Buddhist monastery. It was built by King Thibaw Min in 1880. It is made from teak, a kind of wood. Inside of it are many carvings on the walls and roofs. The carvings show Buddhist myths."
People.
"In 2007, the United Nations (UN) guessed that there were about 1 million people living in Mandalay. In 2014, the Myanmar government counted all of the people in the country for a census. They found that there were 1,225,133 people living in Mandalay then. The UN thinks that there will be 1.5 million people in Mandalay in 2025."
Mandalay has always been an important city for the Bamar people. Most of the people who have lived in Mandalay are Burman people. Lots of Chinese people have been moving to Mandalay. The Chinese have been coming for the past 20 years. Now there are more Chinese people than Burman people in Mandalay.
"Today, 40-50% of the people in Mandalay are Chinese. About 30% of Mandalay's people are Yunnanese. The rest of the people in Mandalay are probably Burman. There are also a lot of Burmese Indians in Mandalay. (These are Indian people who live in Myanmar.)"
People in Mandalay speak the Burmese language. A lot of people also speak the Standard Chinese language. The Chinese language is used a lot in markets like Zegyo Market. People who have a lot of money and education also speak the English language.
Place.
"Mandalay is in the country of Myanmar. It is by the side of the Irrawaddy river. Its coordinates are 21.98° North, 96.08° East."
"The city is above sea level. It is in the same time zone as the rest of Mandalay: Myanmar Standard Time (MST), ."
"Mandalay is on a tectonic fault. This means that there are two tectonic plates that come together underneath the city. (A ""tectonic plate"" is a big piece of earth.) The tectonic fault underneath Mandalay is called the Sagaing Fault. It is where the India Plate and the Sunda Plate meet."
"A lot of earthquakes happen on tectonic faults. The biggest earthquake in Mandalay happened in 1956. That one was a magnitude 7 earthquake. That earthquake did a lot more damage to the city of Sagaing, which is nearby. It is now called the ""Great Sagaing Quake."""
Weather.
Mandalay has a tropical savanna climate. This means that the city has a wet season and a dry season. There is a lot of rain during the wet season. There is very little rain during the dry season. The wet season is from May to October. The dry season is from November to April.
"The coldest month is January. The average temperature is . The hottest month is April. Then, the average temperature is ."
It is very hot in April and May. Most days it is hotter than . Some days it is hotter than .
"The Carpenter Painter was a red-figure vase painter. He worked in Athens. He was active between 515 and 500 BC. He chiefly painted cups. His real name is unknown. ""Carpenter Painter"" is taken from his depiction of a carpenter at work on a cup in the British Museum. Few of his works are known. The way he painted nipples, pectorals, hands, garments, and other details identify his work."
John Astin
"John Allen Astin (born March 30, 1930) is an American movie, television, stage, voice, and radio actor. He has acted in many movies and television shows. He is best known for his role as Gomez Addams in ""The Addams Family"", his role in ""Evil Roy Slade"", and other comedic characters."
"Astin was born on March 30, 1930 in Baltimore, Maryland. He studied at Washington &amp; Jefferson College and at Johns Hopkins University."

Cerastes
"Cerastes is a genus of small venomous vipers growing up to the length of around 50 cm. There are currently three species found. They are usually known as the """"Horned Vipers"", the ""North African Desert Vipers"", or the ""Cerastes Vipers""""."
Bashir documentary.
"On February 3 2003 a documentary called ""Living with Michael Jackson"" was shown on ITV in the United Kingdom. Three days later it was shown in the United States. In the documentary a British journalist called Martin Bashir asked Jackson questions about his life. In the documentary Jackson's accuser Gavin Arvizo was 12 years old. At one point he is filmed with Jackson. Jackson holds hands with Gavin. Gavin rests his head on Jackson's shoulder. At the trial Gavin said he did this because Jackson was his ""best friend"". Gavin tells Bashir that he slept in Jackson’s bed with his brother Star while Jackson slept on the floor. Jackson said many children had slept in his bed, including Macaulay Culkin, his brother Kieran, and his sisters."
Gavin later complained that he did not realize that the video was going to be shown all over the world. Janet Arvizo said that she did not say that Bashir could film her son. She did not know that he had been filmed until the show was on TV. After the video was shown he was teased at school about being 'the kid that got raped by Michael Jackson'.
Arvizo family.
Gavin Arvizo.
"The court and the media called Arvizo ""John Doe"" until February 2005. Gavin Arvizo was born to David and Janet Arvizo in December 1989. He lived in a small apartment in Los Angeles with his parents, his sister and his brother. In 2000 Arvizo was diagnosed with cancer. Jackson rung him at the hospital. In August 2000 Arvizo stayed at Jackson's home Neverland Ranch for the first time. He slept in Jackson's bed with his brother while Jackson slept on the floor."
David Arvizo.
"Gavin's father, David Arvizo, visited Neverland several times in 2000."
Janet Arvizo.
A psychiatrist said that Arvizo was schizophrenic.
"Maria Gomez, a maid at Neverland Ranch, said that Gavin's mother Janet encouraged her children to call Jackson ""dad""."
Arrest and investigation.
"On November 25 2003 Jackson was arrested. He was released an hour after paying $3 million bail. In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" he said that he was locked in the toilet for 45 minutes. He showed big bruises on his arm, which he said were caused by handcuffs."
Charging.
"On December 18, 2003 he was charged."
The trial.
"On January 31, 2005 the trial began. Each day Sky One showed a re-enactment of the day's events in the trial, because cameras were not allowed in the courtroom. The first witness that the prosecution called was Martin Bashir. ""Living with Michael Jackson"" was shown to the jury."
"On March 10, 2005 Jackson went to hospital because of a back injury. Jackson went into court an hour and thirty minutes late. He was wearing pyjama pants and slippers. Bill Fallon suggested that Jackson was guilty."
"Starr and Janet Arvizo said that they saw Jackson licking Gavin's head on February 7, 2003."
"On March 15, Sgt Robel told the court that Arvizo said he had been molested five to seven times but could only describe two of the molestations in detail."
"On May 10, 2005 Macaulay Culkin gave evidence. He said that he had slept in Jackson's bed, but had never been molested. Phillip LeMarque, who was a chef at Neverland from 1991 to 1992, said that he saw Jackson with one hand in Culkin's shorts."
"On June 13, 2005 Jackson was found not guilty of all charges. Everyone was happy about the decision."
Aftermath.
"Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009."
"In May 2013 Wade Robson filed a complaint against the Michael Jackson Estate for ""childhood sexual abuse"". Robson was Jackson's first defense witness for People v. Jackson."
Oswiu of Northumbria
"Oswiu (–15 February 670), also known as Oswy or , became the King of Bernicia at the death of his brother Oswald. Later he became the King of Northumbria. When Oswiu defeated and killed Penda of Mercia at the Battle of the Winwaed, he became the seventh over the southern English kings. He took the throne of Mercia and appointed his son-in-law Peada (Penda's son) as a client king. Oswiu was one of those rare kings of Northumbria who died of natural causes and not in battle."
Early career.
"Oswiu was born He was a son of King Athelfrith of Bernicia and his second wife Acha of Deira. He was a younger brother of King Oswald of Northumbria. When he was about 6 years old his father was killed in battle by Edwin who became King of Northumbria. Along with his brothers Eanfrith and Oswald and their sister Aebbe, he found safety with the Scots in Dál Riata. The monks of Iona baptized the children and raised them in the Celtic Christian faith."
"About 634 Oswiu married Rhiainmelt, daughter of Rhoeth of Rheged, a marriage alliance arranged by his brother King Oswald. He had a son by this marriage, Alfrith of Deira. Rhiainmelt seems to have died as a year later Oswiu was in Ireland with the Dál Riatans. There he was involved with Fina, the daughter of the high King Colman. There is no record they married but they had a son Aldfrith of Northumbria (Irish name ""Flann Fína mac Oswiu"")."
King of Bernicia.
Hair was short and skirts were long
Kate Smith really sold a song
I don't know just what went wrong
those were the days!
"In 1975 Rob Reiner, Sally Struthers, Jean Stapleton, and Carroll O'Connor sung ""Those were the Days"" but changed the name to ""These are the days."" The song was for the live audience but was not but on television. The lyrics were different and it was about what was currently going on and realizing the changes. This was the only time that Reiner and Struthers were also singing with Stapleton and O'Connor."
Remembering You.
"""Remembering You"" was the closing theme song for ""All in the Family"". The song would play after each episode had ended and the credits were being shown. The song was composed by Roger Kellaway. The lyrics were never added to the show but Carroll O'Connor did sing them when he was an television. During the song the clips from ""Those were the Days"" would play but instead it would be backwards. It used to just be a piano playing but lyrics sung by Archie Bunker actor, Carroll O'Connor were added. In the episode ""Stewie Loves Lois"" of ""Family Guy"" this song was played for the end credits:"
"Got a feelin' it's all over now - All over now, we're through."
"And tomorrow I'll be lonesome, Remembering You."
Got a feelin' the sun will be gone - The day will be long and blue.
"And tomorrow I'll be cryin', Remembering You."
"There'a far away look in your eye when you try to pretend to me,"
That everything is the same as it used to be.
"I see it's all over now - All over now, we're through."
And tomorrow I'll be startin' Remembering You.
Family tree.
"This is the family tree for the Bunker family. Archie and Edith have one daughter, Gloria who is married to Michael. They have one son named Joey. Archie also has a brother named Fred. The information about Archie's siblings do not work a lot. Early in the show Archie says that he has three siblings. But later on he says he was an only child. But there are episode after this that have Archie's brother Fred in them."
Episodes and ratings.
Episodes.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
"After the two pilot episodes from 1968 and 1969, the first episode of the first season of ""All in the Family"" was called ""Meet the Bunkers"" and was on television January, 12 1971. Most of the seasons had 24 episodes but the first season only had 13 episodes. There were nine seasons of ""All in the Family"". In the episode, ""Sammy's Visit"" the longest laugh from the crowd happened when Sammy Davis Jr. kissed Archie during a photo. The episode was number 13 on ""TV Guide""'s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. A special 90 minute episode was made in season nine for the 200th episode. The episode was called ""The 200th Episode Celebration of All in the Family"". The last episode is called ""Too Good Edith"" and is used to start the story of the spin-off ""Archie Bunker's Place""."
"Five episodes of ""All in the Family"" won awards for the episodes:"
Syndication.
"Syndication is when a television program is being shown on a different television network then the first one it was one. CBS started to do reruns of ""All in the Family"" during the sixth season of the show on September 1, 1975. Viacom stopped this in September 1979 and let other television networks air the show. In the late 1980s networks like TBS had the show on. From January 3, 2011, to December 31, 2017, the show aired on Antenna TV. As of January 1, 2018, the show began to air on GetTV."
Ratings.
"""All in the Family"" is one of three shows ever to be number 1 in the Neilsen ratings five years in a row. The show was in the top 10 for seven of the nine seasons. 40.2 million people watch the show's last episode."
"""All in the Family"" first season aired at 9:30 pm because more famous shows were aired at 8:00 pm. When a show is ""aired"" it means it is on television at that time. When the show started to be famous, CBS moved the show to 8:00 pm because more people would watch at that time. CBS moved the show to 9:00 pm but put the show back to 8:00 in the last season."
Home media.
"Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first six seasons of ""All in the Family"" on DVD from 2002 to 2007. Then in 2010 Shout! Factory released the seventh season of the show on DVD. In 2011, they released the eight and ninth season on DVD. In 2012 the whole show was released on DVD."
Spin-offs.
"When a new show is created from a show that is already present, that is called a spin-off. ""All in the Family"" has the most spin-offs of any television show ever. There are even spin-offs of the spin-off shows. ""Maude"", ""The Jeffersons"", ""Good Times"", and ""Archie Bunker's Place"" were successful sitcoms and Norman Lear and CBS decided to make more. But ""Gloria"", ""Checking In"", and ""704 Hauser"" were not successful and were cancelled."
"Boris II of Bulgaria was an emperor (Tsar) of Bulgaria. He was emperor from 969 to 971. His father was Peter I of Bulgaria. When Peter died in 969, his son Boris was being held in Constantinople by the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II. The Byzantines apparently allowed Boris to return to Bulgaria. When he arrived he was immediately proclaimed Tzar Boris II. Sviatoslav I of Kiev, who had earlier subdued parts of Bulgaria, returned in August 969 and subdued the remaining parts of Bulgaria. He allied himself to Boris II in order to get his Bulgarian soldiers to fight against the Byzantines. The new Byzantine Emperor, John I Tzimisces invaded Bulgaria. By the end of 971 all of Bulgaria was in Byzantine hands. By that time Boris II had abdicated."

Jacques Marquette, a French , was the first European (or person from Europe) to get to the Wisconsin River and write down the name. He reached the Wisconsin River in 1673. He wrote the name of the river as ""Meskousing"" in his journal. Over time, other explorers from France this name into ""Ouisconsin"". This is now the French name for the Wisconsin River. As of 1845, the government of the Wisconsin Territory gave the name ""Wisconsin"" to the Wisconsin River."

Other rivers that make up the border of Wisconsin include the Mississippi River and St. Croix Rivers to the west and the Menominee River to the northeast."
"Wisconsin has a lot of different kinds of geography and is very diverse. Wisconsin is made up of five main areas of geography. The Lake Superior Lowland to the north is an area of land that is right against Lake Superior. The Northern Highland area of Wisconsin is to the south of the Lake Superior Lowland. This area contains trees and other kinds of forests. The Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (1,500,000 acres big), is found in this area. The highest point in Wisconsin, Timms Hill, is in the Northern Highland area. The Central Plain area is found in the central part of Wisconsin. Lots of sandstone , such as the Dells of the Wisconsin River, are found in the Central Plain area. The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands area is found in the southeastern part of Wisconsin. Many of the biggest cities in Wisconsin are in the Eastern Ridges and Lowlands area. The Western Upland area is in the southwestern part of the state.

Western Allied invasion of Germany
"The Western Allied invasion of Germany was an attack on Nazi Germany that was done by the Western Allies in the final months of the European War in World War II. The invasion started with the Allies crossing the Rhine River. Then they spread out and moved through western Germany. The Germans surrendered on 8 May 1945. This is known as the ""Central Europe Campaign"" in United States military histories."
"By the early spring of 1945, the Allied forces in Europe were doing well. On the Western Front the Allies had been fighting in Germany since the October Battle of Aachen. By January, the Allies beat the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The failure of this last major German attack took the last of Germany's strength. The Germans could not do much to stop the final Allied attacks in Europe."
"Additional losses in the Rhineland weakened the German Army, leaving few troops to defend the east bank of the Rhine. By mid-March, the Allies had captured an intact bridge at Remagen. They also defended the bridge on the river's east bank."
"German casualties during the Allied attacks to reach the Rhine in February–March 1945 were about 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as prisoners of war."
"On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Red Army had moved through Poland. The Russians"
were nearing Berlin. The Soviets also moved into Hungary and eastern Czechoslovakia. These advances on the Eastern Front destroyed experienced German troop groups. It also made it very hard for Adolf Hitler to strengthen his Rhine defenses.
Order of battle.
Allied forces.
"At the very beginning of 1945, the Commander of the Allies, General Dwight D. Eisenhower had 73 divisions under his command in North-western Europe. This included 49 infantry divisions, 20 armored divisions and four airborne divisions."
"As the invasion of Germany started, Eisenhower had 90 divisions. This included 25 armored divisions. He had one of the largest forces in any war. The Allied line along the Rhine stretched from the North Sea to the Swiss border. The Allies wanted to capture the industrial Ruhr area."
German forces.
"Facing the Allies was ""Oberbefehlshaber West"" (""Army Command West"") commanded by Field Marshal Albert Kesselring."
"Kesselring had shown he was good at defending land in the Italian Campaign. But in Germany, he did not have the troops or weapons to make a good defense."
"During the fighting west of the Rhine up to March 1945, the German Army on the western front had only 26 divisions. Most of the troops were used against the Soviet forces. The Germans had 214 divisions on the eastern front in April."
Eisenhower's plans.
"After capturing the Ruhr, Eisenhower planned to have 21st Army Group go east to Berlin. Eisenhower began to change his plans toward the end of March. He found out that Soviet forces held a bridge over the Oder River, from Berlin. He was worried the Soviets would capture Berlin before the western Allies."
"In addition, he was worried about the Ruhr. The Ruhr had many Axis troops and a lot of industries. He was also worried about the ""National Redoubt."" Some people said Hitler's most loyal troops were preparing to"
defend themselves in the mountains of southern Germany and western Austria.
"American forces in the south were really fighting hard to win. On 7 March, Lt. Gen. Courtney H. Hodges's 1st Army had captured a bridge over the Rhine at Remagen."
"In some countries, most notably where the weather is warm, there is a tradition to take a nap right after noon, or early in the afternoon. This tradition is called siesta, and is most common in Spain and Latin America. Some stores and services close while their owners and/or employees take their siesta."
Word.
"The word ""sleep"" comes from the old Old Germanic verbs for sleep. In Old and Middle High German, it was called ""SLAF"". The original meaning of the word was ""to slap"", which was related to the word for ""flabby"" (not hard or firm)."
"Many words related to ""sleep"" have very different meanings. For example, ""sleep"" may be used to mean death, so that ""putting an animal to sleep"" means to kill the animal without pain. ""Sleep with someone"" can also have a sexual meaning."
What sleep is for.
"Sleep helps the brain function. The details are not fully understood, but it is important to get enough sleep for the body and the brain to be healthy and to work properly. In general, animals (and people) sleep at periodic intervals, such as once a day. Certain animals send out signals to the others that they will soon go to sleep. Yawning is such a signal."
"Both humans and many animals sleep about once a day. Some animals, such as cats, sleep many times a day for short periods up to 15 hours a day (or even longer)."
"When people sleep, they often have dreams. Probably some animals do, too."
"Not only people sleep, but all mammals and birds, and most fish, reptiles and other animals also too."
Brief stages of sleep.
There are four stages during sleep:
"While humans sleep, REM and NREM are sleep patterns that help with long-term memory, remembering information, procedural memory, and creative thinking."
Different types of sleep.
REM sleep.
"In mammals and birds, sleep can be divided into two categories. In one of them, the eyes move rapidly. It is called REM-sleep (rapid eye movement). Most dreams take place in this phase. as the body becomes relaxed and the eyes move while sleeping. This phase helps prepare one for the next day. REM-sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night, and the periods of REM-sleep increase in length in the second half of the night. It is often encountered 90 minutes after falling asleep, and continues to occur every 90 minutes. REM-sleep was first discovered in 195253."
"REM sleep is found in mammals and songbirds, but is ""poorly established"" in reptiles and fish. According to a survey:"
NREM sleep.
"The other category, where this movement of the eyes does not happen, is called NREM-sleep (Non-REM sleep). In general, dreams do not occur during this time. There are three or four stages of NREM-sleep. Stage I is just barely sleeping, or dozing. Stage II is also light sleep. Normally, in adult humans, about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep. Stages III and IV are called deep sleep. Deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing. It can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage III or stage IV sleep. Sometimes, stages III and IV are combined and called stage III."
"Adult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each. The night's sleep can be 4 or 5 of these cycles. Each cycle includes, in this order: stage I, stage II, stage III (IV), and REM."
Getting enough sleep.
"People who regularly get less than 8 hours of sleep a night tend to complain more and feel very fatigued throughout the day. Getting the appropriate amount of sleep is extremely important, as it could affect one’s body and increase the chances of serious health problems. For each age group, there are different amounts of sleep that are recommended:"
- Toddlers (4 to 12 months): 12 to 16 hours (w/ naps)
- Toddlers (1–2 years): 11 to 14 hours (w/ naps)
- Preschoolers (3–5 years): 10 to 13 hours (w/ naps)
- Grade Schoolers (6 to 12 years): 9 to 12 hours
- Teenagers(13–18 years): 8 to 10 hours
- Adults (including old age): 7 to 9 hours
The timing of sleep and the amount of it are both important. Both are different for different people. Some adults sleep best from 22:00 to 05:00 or 06:00 or 07:00. Some sleep best from midnight to seven or eight. These variations are normal.
"How much sleep is enough also depends on age. Children need more sleep than adults. Newborn babies sleep about 18 hours per day. Small babies sleep many times a day; human babies do not develop circadian rhythms before they are 3 – 4 months old. At the age of 1 year, they sleep for about 14 hours."
"A nine-year-old should sleep about 9–10 hours per day and teenagers, too, also need that much sleep. Adults who sleep less than about 8 hours a day perform worse than those who sleep that long."
Bad habits.
Poor habits could affect one’s sleep schedule in many ways without taking notice. A few habits that are very common and ruin sleep are:
TV programs.

The red fox steals an old woman's milk and has his tail cut off. He starts to find his tail again. This is a short and humorous retelling of a favorite American folktale."
Summary.
"There is a red fox that is very thirsty in the great forest. He wants to drink, so he steals an old woman's milk. She gets upset and cuts off his tail. To get back his tail, he tries to find some milk from a cow. The cow wants grass for him to give milk. He finds a grass but the grass wants some water. Again, he runs to stream to beg some water but the stream asks him to get a jug. Like this pattern, the red fox goes travel to find milk. Finally he meets kind miller and cries. The good miller gives him the grain and he brings it to a hen to get an egg. The egg is given for a peddler to get a bead. After all paying is done, he can get some milk for the old woman so she carefully sews his tail again."
Main character.
"The main character is the fox that walks around the great forest. He cares about his looks, so he doesn't want to go back to his friends without his tail. He thinks that his friends will laugh at him. Also, he is sensitive. He cries a few times when the old woman gets angry or he meets a kind miller. It can be seen from the illustration, as his eyes always look pitiful to describe these personalities."

She married him on 12 July 1543, and outlived him by one year. She was also the most-married English queen, with four husbands. She was also the first woman to be queen of both England and Ireland."
"Catherine had a close relationship with Henry's three children. She personally helped teach school for Elizabeth and Edward, both of whom became English monarchs.

"Catherine gave birth to her only child — a daughter, Mary Seymour. She was named after Catherine's stepdaughter Mary – on 30 August 1548. She died only six days later, on 5 September 1548, at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, from what was probably childbed fever (sepsis).

Formation.
"With his friend Tim Staffell, Brian May started a band called 1984 in the mid-1960s. The band broke up after a little bit and then May decided to make another band and teamed up with two other college students named Tim Staffell and Roger Taylor. They called themselves ""Smile"" with Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Tim Staffell on vocals and bass and Brian May on guitar and vocals. They did a few hits such as ""April Lady"". Tim Staffell became friends with another college student, Farrokh Bulsara (to be later known as Freddie Mercury) and Farrokh became a big fan of Smile and encouraged them a lot. Later on, Tim left Smile to join Humpy Bongs and Farrokh Bulsara subsequently joined the band on vocals and piano in 1970. Then Farrokh came up with the name Queen, so they changed it from ""Smile"" to ""Queen"". They then started auditions for a new bassist. They were going through several bassists during this time and none of them stuck, only lasting for about a few minutes. None of the auditioners managed to suit the place of the new bassist, but finally in 1971, they settled on John Deacon. Queen's first album was released in 1973 and it was called ""Queen"" with songs such as ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" and ""Liar"". Farrokh Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury after the lyrics ""Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me"" in ""My Fairy King"". Brian May has a degree in astrophysics."

Many of the Axis forces managed to avoid capture and escape to the mainland. Benito Mussolini was removed as head of the Italian government. ""Operation Baytown"" was the plan in which Eighth Army would land near the tip of Calabria on 3 September 1943. The Allies sent the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment to airfields near Rome."
"The main landings (""Operation Avalanche"") were on 9 September. The main force would land near Salerno on the western coast. The ""Avalanche"" plan was for the Fifth Army to land. On the German side, Albert Kesselring realized he could not stop the Salerno landing."

X Corps' two divisions had moved between inland."
"For the next three days, the Allies fought to get more beach territory. The Germans defended. By 12 September, X Corps had taken a defensive position. On 13 September, the Germans launched their attack. The Herman Göring battle groups attacked the northern part of the beach. The main attack was between the two Allied Corps. On 15 September 16th Panzer Division and 29th Panzergrenadier Division took up defensive positions. On 15 September, Kesselring said the attack by XIV Panzer Corps must be successful. If this failed, Tenth Army must pull back from the battle."
"On 14 September, the Allies advanced. By 16 September 5th, the Infantry Division had reached Sapri. The Germans decided to pull out of the battle. They withdrew on 18/19 September."
"The Salerno battle was where the Salerno Mutiny happened. About 500 men of the British X Corps refused to join new units. Eventually the corps commander, McCreery, got about half of the men to follow their orders. The rest were court-martialled."

There is no limit to the number of traits a Sim can have. The aspirations are:"

Each aspiration gives your Sims a set of tasks to complete. When you complete all these tasks you will get a second special trait. The trait you get will be different for each aspiration. These can be completed if wanted using cheat codes in the game."
Child and Toddler Sims have their own group of aspirations to complete. These aspirations cannot be given to adult and teen Sims.

Sublimation is how a solid becomes a gas without becoming a liquid first. It happens when the particles of a solid absorb enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them. Most substances can sublimate only at low pressure. Many can sublimate in space.
"Sometimes snow sublimates. This is usually on sunny winter days when the air is very dry. Snow may look like it disappears on a cold sunny day, but this is not sublimation because it forms a thin layer of liquid water first."
"At normal atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth, only some compounds like dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) can go through this process. CO2 changes from dry ice, a solid to a gas without being a liquid. Also diamond, graphite, iodine, ammonium chloride and aluminium chloride sublime rather than melt at atmospheric pressure."

Wilhelm scream
"The Wilhelm scream is a movie and television sound effect first used in 1951 for the movie ""Distant Drums"". The effect became popular again (its use often becoming an in-joke) after it was used in ""Star Wars"" and many other movies as well as television shows and video games. The scream is often used when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion."
"The sound is named for Private Wilhelm, a character in ""The Charge at Feather River"", a 1953 western in which the character is shot with an arrow. This was believed to be the third movie to use the sound effect. It was the first use of the sound from the Warner Brothers sound library."
History.
"The sound effect comes from a series of sound effects made for the 1951 movie ""Distant Drums"". In a scene from the movie, soldiers are walking through a swamp in the Everglades. One of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator. The scream for that scene was recorded later in one take. The sound was labeled as ""man getting bit by an alligator, and he screams."""
Growing popular.
"The Wilhelm scream began to become popular when Benjamin Burtt Jr. found the original recording (which he found labeled as ""Man being eaten by alligator"") and put it into a scene in """". Burtt is credited with naming the scream after Private Wilhelm (after a soldier in ""The Charge at Feather River"" who was shot by an arrow and screamed). Over the next decade, Burtt began using the effect in other films he worked on. This included most projects with George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. It is used in all of the Indiana Jones movies. Other sound designers picked up on the effect, and use of the sound in movies became a tradition in the community of sound designers."
"Research by Burtt shows that actor and singer Sheb Wooley, best known for his song ""Flying Purple People Eater"" in 1958, is likely to have been the voice actor who first performed the scream. This has been supported by an interview in 2005 with Linda Dotson, Wooley's widow. Burtt discovered records at Warner Brothers from the editor of ""Distant Drums"". These records include a short list of names of actors scheduled to record lines of dialogue for roles in the movie. Wooley played the uncredited role of Private Jessup in ""Distant Drums."" He was one of the few actors used for the recording of more vocal parts for the movie. Wooley performed more sound effects, including the screams for a man being bitten by an alligator. Dotson confirmed that it was Wooley's scream that had been in so many westerns, adding, ""He always used to joke about how he was so great about screaming and dying in films."""
Usage.
"The Wilhelm scream has become a cinematic sound cliché. By 2008 it had been used in many works, including over 216 movies, television shows and video games . Some directors, most notably George Lucas, include it in almost every one of their productions."
"In 2010, a Wilhelm Scream App was released on the Apple iPhone. As of 2011, it is still free to download."

Highwayman
A highwayman was a type of robber who attacked people who were travelling. They were common in the British Isles from the time of Elizabeth I to the 1800s. Highwaymen rode on horses. They were thought to be socially superior to footpads (who robbed on foot).
"Some highwaymen robbed alone but others worked in gangs. They often targeted coaches because they did not have much defence, They stole money, jewellery and other valuable items. The penalty for robbery with violence was execution by hanging. The 17th century highwayman James Hind was hanged, drawn and quartered. As a supporter of King Charles, the Protectorate charged him with treason."

"The most common sticky note is the Post-it, which is made by a company called 3M. In 1974 a man named Arthur Fry came up with the idea for the sticky note.

The name 'Dodo'.
"The history of the word 'Dodo' is not clear. Dutch admiral Wybrand van Warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598 during an expedition to Indonesia. He called the bird 'walgvogel', meaning ""disgusting bird"" because he disliked the taste of the meat. Four years later, the Dutch captain, Willem van Westsanen, used the word 'Dodo' for the first time."
"The ""Encarta Dictionary"" and the ""Chambers Dictionary of Etymology"" say ""dodo"" is a Portuguese word, coming from ""doido"". It means ""fool"" or ""crazy"". Another idea is that 'dodo' was a copy of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeon like sound, ""doo-doo""."
"In 1606 Cornelis de Jonge wrote a description of the Dodo, and of other animal and plants on the island ."
Description.
"The dodo was a large bird and weighed about . They had grey feathers and yellow feet. Their big hooked bill was a green/yellow color. It had short wings that were only stubs. They ate fruit, seeds and nuts. Portuguese sailors said that they saw the Dodos eating fish. They also ate rocks and stones which might have helped them digest food. They are eaten by humans who come in the search of treasure or spouting."
Extinction.
"The dodo was not scared of people which made it easy to hunt and kill. Dogs, cats, rats and pigs were left on the island and also killed the dodos. Because dodos built their nests on the ground, the new animals ate their eggs. The forests were chopped down and the dodo lost its habitat. Within 80 years, the dodo was extinct."
"The last known stuffed bird was at Oxford University and was thrown out as rubbish. Only a foot and a head are left. The American Museum of Natural History in New York has a skeleton showing. It was put together out of bones from several different Dodos. The Natural History Museum of Mauritius has the only complete skeleton of a dodo, found in a swamp."

The age of Lord Ram precedes that of Lord Krishna and hence the work can safely be said to precede 3000 BC (the ideal period of Mahabharat Yudh).
"Lord Shiva and his Son Murugan is said to have laid the first tenets for the Tamil Language, probably long long time before sage Agastya could compile the same."
Great auk
"The great auk was a large bird, that could not fly. People hunted it for meat and feathers. It grew rare, because it was too easy to kill, and the ones left could not breed fast enough to make up for the lost ones. The last known great auks (there were two auks) were killed on June 3, 1844 in Iceland. It lived mostly in the water, like a duck."
"Penguins got their name from the great auk. The word ""penguin"" was the Celtic word for ""great auk"". When sailors saw penguins for the first time, they thought they looked like great auks."
"The great auk was covered in black feathers, but had white feathers on its chest and abdomen. It had very short wings, like stubs, which meant it could not fly. On land it stood upright and was about 75 cm tall. They spent most of their time at sea, coming to shore in the summer to breed. They lived in large breeding colonies on low rocky islands in the north Atlantic Ocean from Canada to Norway. Females laid one egg on bare rock. In winter they went as far south as Florida and southern Spain."

Reaction Agostini
Reaction Agostini is the name of a simplified examination for the presence of glucose in human urine.
"The method consists of preparing a solution of sodium chloride and potassium oxide, adding the urine to be investigated. If there is glucose present, the solution becomes red."
Distribution.
"The Carolina Coralbead has been reported in the following states of Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Locations of the plant range from opening of forests, to the beginning of streams."
Cultivation.
"The flowers are small and plentiful. At a young age, Carolina Coralbead appear greenish. Bloom time for the plant is in late spring and mature by late summer. They grow in tight abundant amounts of bright red berries. By using its scarlet fruits for aesthetic effects, landscapers allow it to be grown on trellises, fences or let naturally flourish through other weeds and shrubs. The berries should not be eaten by people but are eaten by a large number of birds. Each fruit has a single seed that resembles a small snail shell which is protected by the hard endocarp, also known as the inner section of the ovary wall."
Solar time
Solar time relates to the amount of time which has passed according to orbit of the sun. A solar day is the amount of time it takes an object to go around the sun.
Mark St. John
"Mark Leslie Norton (February 7, 1956 – April 5, 2007), better known as Mark St. John, was a guitarist known for his brief work with the rock band Kiss.

Ragdoll
"The ragdoll is a cat breed that is large, with blue eyes, and a semi-longhair soft and silky coat of fur. It is usually mostly white, with light to dark marks."
"The ragdoll was first bred by an American breeder named Ann Baker from a Persian-like cat (without a pedigree) and a Birman cat with the Siamese colorpoint gene. It is similar in appearance to the Himalayan, which was bred directly from the Persian and Siamese."
"The Ragdoll is gentle, easy going, and affectionate. The breed was named ""Ragdoll"" because they often go limp and relax like a rag or cloth doll when it is picked up. The original mother cat that the breed was created from was involved in a car accident, but contrary to popular belief, this is not why the breed goes limp when picked up (injuries from an accident are not passed on to offspring genetically)."
"Ragdoll is a breed that enjoys being around humans and it may follow its owner around the house. Due to its soft nature, it is strictly recommended to be an indoor only cat."
"In addition to the colorpoint pattern, Ragdolls may also have mittens (white paws)."
Srinivasa Ramanujan
"Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar (December 22, 1887 – April 26, 1920) was an Indian mathematician. His father's name was K. Srinivasa Iyengar and his mother's name was Komalatammal. On 1st October 1892 Ramanujan was enrolled at local school. He had no formal training in mathematics. However, he has made a large contribution to number theory, infinite series and continued fractions."
"He was mentored by G. H. Hardy in the early 1910s. After getting his degree at Cambridge, Ramanujan did his own work. He compiled over 3500 identities and equations in his life. Some of the identities were found in his “lost notebook”. When the notebook was discovered, mathematicians proved almost all of Ramanujan's work. His discoveries have led to many advancements in mathematics. His formulae are now being used in crystallography and string theory."
"In 2011, Ramanujan's birthday was made “National Mathematics Day” by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh."
North South MRT line
"The North South MRT line is the first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Singapore to be built. It is 45 km long with 26 stations, and it is being operated by SMRT Trains. It would usually take one hour to travel from one end of the MRT line to the other. This line is coloured red on the MRT Rail map."
"This line joins the Central area of Singapore to the Northern and Southern areas of Singapore. To transfer to the East West MRT line, a commuter can transfer at Jurong East, Raffles Place or City Hall. Transferring to the North East MRT Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut with a linkway. Bishan MRT Station, Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station and Marina Bay MRT Station can transfer a commuter to the Circle MRT Line. Transfer to the Downtown line is provided at Newton MRT Station."

These counsellors listen to nearly 6,000 calls from young people each week. Kids Helpline is run by yourtown. Most of the money needed for it to run is raised through lotteries held by yourtown. The Australian Government also helps by giving some money. Optus is their biggest sponsor."
History.
"Kids Helpline was opened for taking calls on the 25 March 1991. On the first day more than 3,200 young people rang up to ask for help. By the 17th day, 122,000 thousand calls had been made. Not many of these calls were able to be answered. After a year of been open for people to call the Kids Helpline had answered 75,000 calls."
"Kids Helpline was added into different states one at a time. In 1993 it was open into the whole nation of Australia. In 1999 ""Email Counselling"" was offered for the first time and in May 2000 ""Web Counselling"" was offered for the first time."
"Since the first call was taken in 1991, the Kids Helpline has been contacted more than 8 million (8,000,000) times."
Ways of Contacting.

The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)
"The Twilight Zone is an American television series created by Rod Serling. It is a series of unrelated stories of drama, psychological thriller, fantasy, science fiction, suspense, and/or horror, often ending with a dark or unexpected twist. A popular and critical success, it introduced many Americans to serious science fiction and abstract ideas through television and ""Twilight Zone"" books and comics."
Determiners.
"Determiners are words placed in front of a noun to make it clear what the noun refers to. The difference is each noun can only have one determiner and the determiner always comes before all the other parts of the noun phrase. The most common determiners in English are ""the"" and ""a/an""."
Adverbs.
"Adverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns. An adverb can describe a verb, like the word ""quickly"" in the sentence ""He ran quickly."" They can also describe an adjective. The adverb ""very"" describes the adjective ""sick"" in the sentence ""The boy is very sick."" Adverbs can even describe other adverbs, as in the sentence ""He ran very quickly."""
Prepositions.
"A preposition is a word that describes how one noun (or pronoun) relates to another in the sentence as a whole. The preposition usually comes before the noun that it adds to the sentence, which is called the object of the preposition. An example is the word ""over"" in the sentence ""he walked over the bridge."""
Conjunctions.
"A conjunction is a word that connects other parts of a sentence. It can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence. ""And"" in the sentence ""the boy and the girl run"" connects the boy to the girl because they both run. Conjunctions can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together. The word ""but"" in the sentence ""I like cats, but he likes dogs"" is a conjunction doing this."
Interjections.
"Interjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules. Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence, as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word. These can be used to show emotions, such as the word ""Hooray,"" which means that the speaker is happy or likes something. They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about. For example, saying the word ""yes"" is much simpler than saying ""what you say is true,"" so it is usually used instead. Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple. Often, though, interjections may have no meaning at all, such as the word ""um."""
Syntax.
"Grammar also studies how the parts of language work together. This is called ""syntax."" Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences, phrases, clauses, and paragraphs."
Communes of the Corrèze department
"The following is a list of the 286 communes of the Corrèze ""département"" in France."

Description.
"The soft-feathered, brown birds reach up to in height. Their feathers are in a double layer which helps keep the emu cool. They have bare skin on the sides of the face and their neck. They can weigh up to . They have two large legs, with three toes on each foot. Their wings are very short, about"
", and are hidden under their feathers."
They can live up to 10–20 years
The emu is common over most of mainland Australia. It avoids very thick forests and very dry areas. Emus can travel great distances at a fast trot. If necessary they can run at up to for some distance at a time. They may travel long distances to find food. One emu was found to have traveled .
Diet.
"They feed on a variety of plants (seeds, flowers, new growth) and insects. Because of their size they need to eat a lot."
Breeding.
"Emus are solitary birds. However, the young chicks stay with the father until they are 18 months of age. The breeding season is between February and July, when the female can lay between 5-15 eggs in a ground nest built by the male. The male then sits on the eggs for 8 weeks until hatching. The baby chicks have very clear stripes on the feathers which act as camouflage."
"On the east coast of Australia, emus were once common but have become uncommon with increased human population. On the other hand, the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid (dry) regions. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil and leather. The first emu farms began in Western Australia during the 1970s."
In captivity.
There are approximately 1100 emus in zoos.
The history of the name.
"The first written description of the emu was under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in Arthur Phillip's ""Voyage to Botany Bay"", published in 1789. The species was named by ornithologist (bird expert) John Latham, who worked on Phillip's book. He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species. Its scientific name, Dromaius novaehollandiae, is from the Latin words, meaning ""fast-footed New Hollander"". The history of the common name, ""emu"", is not certain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird. This word was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in New Guinea. In Victoria, some Indigenous Australian words for the emu were ""Barrimal"" in the Djadja wurrung language, ""myoure"" in Gunai, and ""courn"" in Jardwadjali."
Kiwi
"The kiwi is a type of bird from New Zealand. They are the genus Apteryx of the family Apterygidae. There are several species and sub-species of kiwi. The kiwi is a symbol for New Zealand. People from New Zealand are nicknamed ""Kiwis""."
"They have a long beak and brown feathers. The feathers look like fur. Kiwi cannot fly, and their wings are so small that they cannot usually be seen. Kiwi cannot see well, but they can hear very well. They are the smallest ratite birds."
Life.
"Kiwi are night (nocturnal) birds. They mostly eat invertebrates, like worms and insects. Kiwi keep a territory where they live alone or with their mate. In their territory they build several small caves where they sleep, or lay their eggs."
Kiwi are monogamous; the male and female stay together until one of them dies. The male and female live in the same territory and raise their children together.
"Female kiwi lay 1-3 eggs. Compared to the size of the mother, the eggs are the largest of any bird species. Kiwi are mature when they are 2 years old, and they can live more than 20 years. One kiwi kept in a zoo even reached 35 years old."
Eggs.
"The female brown kiwi lays enormous eggs, which are almost one-sixth of her own body weight. These eggs take 11 weeks to incubate, the longest time for any bird. In comparison, Yellow-breasted Chats' eggs take only 11 days, and chickens' eggs take 21 days."
Habitat.
"Kiwi prefer to live in burrows they make in forested areas. They either make their burrows in the ground like rabbits, in between the roots of trees, or in hidden sheltered places such as hollow logs. Kiwi line their burrows with leaves to make them more comfortable and warm. Sometimes they hide the entrance to their burrows using piles of twigs. Kiwi may have more than ten different burrows in their territory and will swap between them sometimes."
Kiwi are threatened by many mammals. Stoats are the main threat for the kiwi chicks. Ferrets and dogs kill adult kiwi.
Dodo
"The dodo ""(Raphus cucullatus)"" is an extinct species of flightless bird from Mauritius."
"Like many other island birds, they lost the power of flight because it was no advantage where they lived. Dodos were in the same family as the pigeon. They were endemic to (only lived on) the island of Mauritius. They became extinct in the late 17th century."
The Dodo has become a symbol of extinction caused by the arrival of humans in ecosystems where humans had never before lived.
Discography.
The Marvelettes released 12 albums:
"John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell"
"John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell (born about 1464, died 1513) was a Scottish lord. In Parliament on 24 February 1484, James III of Scotland gave him the barony (title) of Bothwell. He forfeited the title on 8 October 1488 and became Sir John Ramsay of Trarinzeane."
Dieppe Raid
"The Dieppe Raid is also known as the Battle of Dieppe, Operation ""Rutter"" and, later, Operation Jubilee. It was a Second World War Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe. The attack took place on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942."
"The attack began at 5:00 a.m. and by 10:50 a.m. the Allied commanders had to call a retreat. Over 6,000 infantrymen, mostly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian Armoured regiment. They were also helped by a strong force of Royal Navy and smaller Royal Air Force group."
"The goal was to capture a major port for a short period and to gather information. Upon retreat, the Allies also wanted to destroy coastal defences, port structures and important buildings. The raid was also intended to improve morale and demonstrate the commitment of the United Kingdom to attack a Western front in Europe."
"None of these goals were achieved. There was not enough Allied artillery support. The troops were trapped on the beach by obstacles and German gunfire. After less than 10 hours since the first landings, the last Allied troops had all been either killed, evacuated, or captured by the Germans."
"Instead of showing the British commitment, the terrible number of Allied deaths showed that the Allies were not ready to invade France for a long time. The attack did help the Allies to gather some information."
"A total of 3,623 of the 6,086 men (almost 60%) who went ashore were either killed, wounded, or captured. The Royal Air Force did not get the ""Luftwaffe"" to start a battle. The RAF lost 96 aircraft (at least 32 to being shot down or accidents), compared to 48 lost by the ""Luftwaffe""."
"The Royal Navy lost 33 landing craft and one destroyer. The events at Dieppe affected the plans for the North African (Operation ""Torch"") and Normandy landings (Operation ""Overlord"")."
Background.
The British decided the Dieppe attack could be planned within a month. They were very careful to keep the attack secret. No records were kept of the plans.
"After the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk in May 1940, the British started to plan an attack force. It would use new ways of doing sea landings on beaches (amphibious warfare)."
The British started planning was to see if they could capture a port. This would allow them to test out how to use ships in the attack. It would also allow them to test new equipment.
"Dieppe, a coastal town in France, is built along a long cliff by the English Channel. In 1942, the Germans set up two large artillery batteries at Berneval-le-Grand and Varengeville. One important consideration for the British planners was that Dieppe was within range of the Royal Air Force's fighter aircraft."
"There was also pressure from the Soviet government to attack the Germans in Western Europe. By early 1942, The Wehrmacht's Operation ""Barbarossa"" attacks did not destroy the Soviet Union."
"However, the Germans moved into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin demanded that the Allies attack in France to force the Germans to move 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front. This would make the fighting less hard for the Red Army."
Plan.
The Dieppe raid was a major attack planned by Vice-Admiral Lord Mountbatten.
"The attacking force would consist of 5,000 Canadians, 1,000 British troops, and 50 United States Rangers."
"It was originally planned in April 1942 and code named Operation ""Rutter"". The Allies planned to do a major attack on a German-held port on the French coast and to hold it for two tides. They would destroy enemy buildings and defences before withdrawing."
This plan was approved in May 1942. It included British parachute units attacking German artillery batteries. The Canadians would land on the beaches and attack. The parachute operation was cancelled and instead No. 3 Commando and No. 4 Commando would land by sea and attack the artillery batteries.
Land component.
"The Canadian government wanted that Canadian troops to do some fighting. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General John Hamilton Roberts, was selected for the main force."
"The plan called for an attack, without any heavy air bombing."
The lack of enough bombing was one of the main reasons for the attack's failure. Some people think that air and naval bombing was not done to limit casualties of French civilians in the port.
"The Dieppe landings were planned on six beaches. Four were in front of the town, and two to the eastern and western sides."
"Armoured support was provided by the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)). 58 of the new Churchill tanks would be sent ashore using the new landing craft tank (LCT). In addition, three of the Churchills had flame-throwers and all could operate in the shallow water near the beach."
"The Hershey Bears are an American professional ice hockey team that began playing in 1938 which makes them the longest-existing team in the AHL. They currently play in the American Hockey League and are the farm team of the Washington Capitals of the NHL. They play their home games in Hershey, Pennsylvania at the Giant Center. Their ECHL affiliate team is the South Carolina Stingrays. The Bears have won a total of 11 Calder Cups."
Social Security (United States)
"In the United States, Social Security is the term for the federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. That program is run by the Social Security Administration. The original Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. The current version of the Act, as amended, involves many social welfare and social insurance programs."
"Social Security gets its money through payroll taxes. Those taxes are called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Almost all salaried income, up to an certain amount set by law (see tax rate table below), is taxed by the Social Security payroll tax. All income over the set amount is not taxed. In 2019, the maximum amount of taxable money is $132,900."
"In 2017, Social Security spent $806.7 billion for OASDI and $145.8 billion for DI."
History.
"A limited form of the Social Security program started during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term. It started using ""social insurance"" to help during the Great Depression of the 1930s."
"Duffield Castle, Derbyshire"
"Duffield Castle was a Norman Castle in Duffield, Derbyshire. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument."
"The rocky site was easy to defend, because it was surrounded by the river in three sides and hard to climb. It is not clear whether the site was inhabited in prehistoric times. The Roman army might have been there to protect the ford nearby where people from Lutudarum Wirksworth passed before joining Rykneld Street at Derventio (now part of Derby) which was N-shaped route for the North Sea ports."
"Ancient items of Anglo-Saxons have been found there. They suggest that Saxon Thane named Siward or his relatives might have occupied the site. Also, many Roman or Romano-British pottery has been found, including roof tiles of Roman pattern. Some of them were kept in the Derby Museum, but others kept in the Parish Room were unfortunately lost."
The Norman Castle.
"Henry de Ferrers (Ferrars) faithfully served King William and was given land in Derbyshire, which became known as Duffield Frith. It was between Heage and Shottle on the North, and Tutbury on the South. He built Tutbury Castle as his main residence. He built another castle at Duffield to protect north side of his land. This castle was probably built of wood."
"His third son, Robert, fought the Scots in the Battle of the Standard in 1138, and became the first Earl of Derby."
"His great grandson, William, became the Earl in 1162. He supported King's sons when they resisted Henry II, and finally both castles were destroyed in 1173."
"William II was favored by King John, and took back the land of Wirksworth, Ashbourne, and Horston Castle (Horsley). The castles at Tutbury and Duffield were rebuilt with stone. William III was also favored as William II was."
"The next Earl (the 7th generation), Robert, fought against Henry III and Tutbury Castle was destroyed. Once the king forgave Robert, but he resisted again and was defeated in battle at Chesterfield. He lost his land in 1269 and Duffield Castle was destroyed. His lands were given to Prince Edmund, who became first Earl of Lancaster shortly later."
"The castle was completely destroyed. Most of the stones were taken away as materials of other buildings, and the place gradually retuned to wild."
Excavations.
"When the site was surveyed, the base of a traditional Norman motte and bailey castle was found with a large rock on it. The size of the rock was really remarkable, about 98 feet in length and 95 feet in width, only slightly smaller than the White Tower in London."
"The grounds were saved with definite shape of foundations, and transferred to the National Trust in 1899. For many years, Parish Council was in charge of the site, but recently the role was handed down to the Trust."
"Other surveys in the 1930s and in 1957 verified the residence before the arrival of the Normans, because many Romano‑British items were found."
"A geophysical investigation of the site was carried out by the University of Bradford in 2001. Traces of other structures to the south and the southeast were found, and they appeared to date from the same period. The Trust is planning to raise necessary funds to carry out further investigations."
Emme
"Melissa Aronson (born 1963 in New York, New York), better known as Emme, is an American plus-size supermodel. She is one of the leading plus-sized models in the profession, as well as its highest earner."
Casquets
Les Casquets or (The) Casquets () is a group of rocks 13 kilometres (8.08 mi) northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little grows on them.
Origin of name.
Andrew Jackson
"Andrew Jackson originally known as Andrew Jackson, Jr. (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was an American politician. He was a General in the War of 1812. He later became the seventh president of the United States of America. He was the first Democrat and is on the twenty dollar bill. His nickname was ""Old Hickory"". He forced many Native Americans to leave their homeland so white people could live there, and many died. This was called the Trail of Tears."
Early life.
As a boy Andrew Jackson was a messenger for the Continental Army. The British caught him and mistreated him.
He was the first U.S. president who was not born into a rich family. He was not a rich man and did not have a college education. He moved to Tennessee and became a politician.
Military.
"During the War of 1812, he became a general and won the Battle of New Orleans which made him very famous. He joined the war because of childhood trauma that he had endured during the Revolutionary War; both his mother and his brother died during the war, and Jackson blamed the British and wanted to avenge his late loved ones."
Marriage.
"In 1791, he fell in love with Rachel Donelson Robards. They went through a marriage ceremony. However, the marriage was not legal because she had not been granted a divorce from her first husband. Therefore, they married legally three years later. They had no children, but they adopted several. He became rich and owned a large plantation."
Politics.
"In the 1790s Jackson was a member of the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate, and the Supreme Court of Tennessee. In 1823 he returned to the Senate."
Andrew Jackson reorganized the Democratic Party and was its leader.
"In 1828, he defeated John Quincy Adams in the Presidential Election of 1828, he became president on March 4, 1829, and four years later he was re-elected to a second term as president. In the Nullification Crisis of 1832-1833, South Carolina declared secession from the United States. Jackson threatened war, and then compromised."
"In January 1835, Jackson was almost assassinated when an unemployed painter wanted to shoot him but both his guns jammed. He is the first president to have had an attempted assassination."
"During his presidency, he signed the Indian Removal Act which allowed the U.S. government to violently force the Native Americans to move from their land and go west. Many Native Americans were killed and the path they walked to get to the west was called the Trail of Tears."
Andrew Jackson was against the national bank of the United States because he felt that banks and their banknotes were for rich and powerful people and did not serve the interests of the common man. The national bank expired during Jackson's presidency. Jackson chose not to continue the bank.
"On March 4, 1837, Andrew Jackson finished his second term. After that, vice-president Martin Van Buren was elected president and continued many of the things Jackson did. Jackson was a big influence on other Democrats during the 1800s."
Legacy.
"Jackson's legacy among historians is mixed, going downhill, and heavily debated. Some have liked him because he was against aristocrats, bankers, businessmen, the British Empire, cities, and paper money, and in favor of ordinary country people. Some have disliked him for the same reasons and because he was in favor of war and against Indians."
Pillow
A pillow is a soft cushion that a person puts under their head when they are sleeping in a bed.
"A pillow is made from two pieces of cloth that are sewn together and stuffed with a soft material, such as feathers, duck down, or synthetic batting (man made soft stuffing). Pillows are usually rectangular. Pillows are covered with a fabric sheet called a pillowcase. The pillowcase protects the pillow from getting dirty."
"The word ""pillow"" comes from Middle English ""pilwe"", from Old English ""pyle"" (akin to Old High German ""pfuliwi"") and from Latin ""pulvinus"". The word ""pillow"" was first known to be used before the 12th century."
History.
"There is no clear inventor of the pillow. Millions of years ago, animals learned to use pillows. An early example is monkeys resting their heads on their arm. Many animals, including birds, use wood and stone nests as pillows. Many domesticated animals have also learned to make use of human-made pillows and cushions. They also rest on members of their own and other species for the same reason."
Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.
"In ancient Mesopotamia, people slept on stone pillows. Pillows were a status symbol. Early pillows were rectangular and had grooves shaped for the head. Pillows showed the wealth of a person — the more a person owned the wealthier they were."
"Anicent Egyptians used pillows as a solution to back, neck and shoulder pain. They also prevented insects from crawling in their hair, mouth or nose at night. Anicent Egyptian pillows were made out of wood and stone and looked like stands. These pillows were mostly used for the deceased."
Whaler
"A whaler is a person who hunts whales, or the boat they use."
"After 1869, the northern Japanese island was known as Hokkaido. Regional subdivisions were established. Nemuro Province was one of the new entities which were created in 1869."
"In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan including Nemuro Province were reformed in the 1870s."
"In 1882, Nemuro and the other ten provinces of Hokkaido were reorganized as Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture."
Queen Letizia of Spain
"Queen Letizia of Spain (""Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano"", born 15 September 1972), is the wife of Felipe VI of Spain, former Prince of Asturias, the heir apparent to the Spanish throne. Before her marriage to the prince, she worked as a journalist for several mass media companies. These included the Austrian newspaper ""La Nueva España"", ""ABC"" and EFE. She also presented the news on television. In 2000, she received the Larra Prize for her work as the best journalist under 30 years of age."
"In 1998, she married Alfonso Guerrero. The next year they divorced. Later she met the Prince Felipe at a dinner party. They married on May 22, 2004. Their daughter Leonor was born in October 2005. She is the second in the line of succession for the Spanish Crown. Sofía, her second daughter, was born in April 2007."
"Since her second wedding, she has had the title of Princess of Asturias. She accompanies her husband on official travel wherever she can. She very much likes fashion. People and the press are always noticing what she is wearing."
"Following the abdication of her father-in-law in June 2014, her husband succeeded to the Spanish throne as Felipe VI with Letizia as his queen."
Gianfrancesco Straparola
"Giovanni Francesco ""Gianfrancesco"" Straparola, also known as Zoan or Zuan Francesco Straparola da Caravaggio (c. 1480 – c. 1557) was a writer from Caravaggio, Italy. His principal work is ""Le piacevoli notti"", a collection of 75 stories. Modelled on Decamerone, it has participants of a 13-night party in the island of Murano, near Venice, tell each other stories that vary from the bawdy to the fantastic."
Among the tales are:

Diamonds and Toads
"""Diamonds and Toads"" () is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript in 1695 called ""Contes de ma mêre l'oye"" (). The volume was intended for the king's niece, and included four other tales by Perrault. It was first published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight prose fairy tales by Perrault. ""Le Doie Pizzelle"" () is a similar tale in Giambattista Basile's ""Pentamerone"" (1550-53). Other versions of Perrault's tale exist, including one collected in Hesse by the Brothers Grimm. Iona and Peter Opie write, ""The theme of this tale is one of the most popular in the world, that of the proud and the privileged being brought low, and the meek and down-trodden being raised above them."" Christopher Betts believes the tale was intended for a young audience, ""old enough to appreciate that the unkind sister is 'rude' ... but not enough to object to the scarcely disguised nannyish advice."""
Story.
"A widow has two daughters. The elder is ugly, selfish and rude. The younger is beautiful, kind and polite. The younger is sent to fetch water from a spring. An old woman dressed in rags (a fairy in disguise) asks for a drink of water. The girl politely gives her one. In thanks, the fairy causes diamonds and roses to drop from the girl's mouth whenever she speaks. At home, her mother is amazed. She sends her elder daughter to the spring. The girl meets a grandly-dressed lady (the fairy) who asks for a drink of water. The girl responds rudely. The fairy causes snakes and toads to drop from her mouth. At home, her mother is furious. She blames the younger sister. The girl runs into the woods. She meets a prince who falls in love and marries her. The elder sister dies after running away from home. A rhyming moral tells the reader that politeness and gentle words are worth more than jewels. They may bring unexpected rewards."

2017 Atlantic hurricane season
"The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active since 2012. It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. It was an extremely active and tragic season. With a damage total of at least $282.16 billion (USD), it was the costliest season on record. With over 3,300 deaths, 2017 was the deadliest season since 2005. More than 99.7% of the season's damage was due to Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Nate, was the worst natural disaster in Costa Rican history. Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate had their names retired due to their high damage costs and loss of life. Featuring 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, the 2017 season is the fifth active season."
"Tropical Storm Arlene in April was the first storm of the season that formed on April 19. This was the third consecutive season in which storms form before the official start of the hurricane season. In late August, Hurricane Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the first Category 4 hurricane since Charley in 2004. It also tied the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record along with the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the United States. In early September, Hurricane Irma became the first Category 5 hurricane to impact the northern Leeward Islands on record. It later hit the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane. Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. In late September, Hurricane Maria became the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island of Dominica on record; and later it made landfall in Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. Most of the deaths from this season occurred from Maria, and caused a human crisis in Puerto Rico. In early October, Hurricane Nate became the fastest-moving hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico while also becoming the fourth hurricane of the year to make landfall in the contiguous United States. Slightly over a week later, Hurricane Ophelia became the easternmost major hurricane in the Atlantic basin on record, and later impacted most of Northern Europe as an extratropical cyclone. The season ended with Tropical Storm Rina, which became post-tropical on November 9."
Storm names.
"The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2017. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2023 season. This was the same list used in the 2011 season, with the exception of Irma which replaced Irene. Irma was previously used in 1978, and it's only used once as an Atlantic hurricane during this season."
Retirement.
"On April 11, 2018, the names ""Harvey"", ""Irma"", ""Maria"", and ""Nate"" were retired by the World Meteorological Organization due to the very expensive amount of damage and significant number of deaths they caused. They will not be used again for a future Atlantic hurricane. The names will be replaced with ""Harold"", ""Idalia"", ""Margot"", and ""Nigel"" for the 2023 season, respectively."

Works.
"Two other famous plays are ""Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen"" (""The Waves of the Sea and of Love"") and ""Der Traum, ein Leben"" (""The Dream, a Life""). Although he said he was not interested in prose his short story ""Der arme Spielmann"" (""The poor minstrel"") is probably the best known of his works and one of the best short stories of the 19th century. Grillparzer wrote the funeral speech for Beethoven's funeral in 1827."
Legacy
An Austrian pastry is named after him: the Grillparzertorte.
Pastry
"Pastry is the dough from which some baked products are made. Pastry dough is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products. It is made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and/or eggs. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches and pasties."

Greek food such as Spanakopita are made from pastries.
Johann Georg Albrechtsberger
"Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (born 3 February 1736 in Klosterneuburg near Vienna; died 7 March 1809 in Vienna) was an Austrian composer, organist, music theorist and music teacher. He is most known today because he was Beethoven’s teacher for a time."
Life.
"From the age of seven, Albrechtsberger was a choirboy. He had lessons in organ and music theory. As an adult, he had several jobs in churches in small towns. He became Kapellmeister at St Stephen’s Church, Vienna in 1793. This was the best job for a church musician in the empire."
Writing music.
"Albrechtsberger wrote hundreds of compositions. He wrote most of them before he got the job in Vienna. He wrote in a classical style. Albrechsberger enjoyed doing things with music which were not normally done. He would ask string players to tune their strings in different ways (called “scordatura”). He would also write slow movements with muted strings. As well as classical sonatas he wrote lots of fugues. Several people, including Mozart, thought of him as the greatest organist in the world."
Teaching.
Albrechtsberger was a very important music teacher. Joseph Haydn thought he was the best teacher in Vienna. He was very interested in contrapuntal music of the Baroque period. He copied many fugues by Bach and other composers.
"When Beethoven was a young man, he had some composition lessons from Joseph Haydn. When Haydn was going to travel to England for several months, he asked Albrechtsberger to teach Beethoven while he was gone. These lessons took place from 1793 to 1795. A few years later, Albrechtsberger said about Beethoven that “he learned absolutely nothing and will never accomplish anything decent”. Beethoven said that Albrechtsberger was a “musical pedant”. However, Beethoven still studied Albrechtsberger’s books on music theory. The string quartets which Beethoven wrote near the end of his life show the influence of Albrechtsberger."
Fidelio
"Fidelio is an opera in two acts by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is Beethoven's only opera. The German libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner based on a French story. The opera tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard called ""Fidelio"", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison."
"""Fidelio"" is an example of a “rescue opera”, a type of opera which was popular at the time. The hero (or heroine) has to fight against cruel people in order to rescue a lover. It was written at the time of the French Revolution. At this time, ideas about freedom and peace were being talked about by everyone, and this led to wars all over Europe. The famous Prisoners’ Chorus is a song for freedom, just like the last movement of his Ninth Symphony."
"Beethoven spent some time working on the opera before he was completely happy with it. The first time it was performed (in 1805) it was a three-act opera called ""Leonore"". There were a lot of French military officers in the audience and they thought they were being criticised. In 1806 it was performed again with two acts and a new overture (now known as ""Overture: Leonore No. 3""). But arguments between Beethoven and the theatre management meant there were no more performances. Eight years later Beethoven revised his opera again. This time it was called ""Fidelio"", and it was a great success. It has remained a famous opera ever since."
Plot.
"The setting is a Spanish state prison, a few miles from Seville, in the late 18th century."

He played Huckleberry Finn in the movie ""Tom and Huck"" in 1995 and also appeared in the family drama ""The Cure"" in the same year. He made many feature movies in his career. His career ended because of alcoholism and drugs."
"Renfro was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. He died at age 25 due to heroin intoxication. For reasons unknown, Renfro, was not included in the annual Academy Awards tribute for Hollywood performers who had died during the past year."

Athelwald of Deira
"Athelwald (also spelled Oethelwald or Œthelwald) was a King of Deira. He was the nephew of King Oswiu of Northumbria, his overlord, but he turned on his family to support the pagan Penda of Mercia. When Penda was killed, Athelwald lost his kingdom."
Early Career.
"He was the son of King Oswald of Northumbria, who was killed by Penda of Mercia at the Battle of Maserfield in 642. At Oswald's death Northumbria was reduced back to the two kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswiu was the king of Bernicia and was acknowledge as overlord of Deira."
Penda had placed Oswine of Deira on the throne of Deira. But Oswine did not get along with his overlord Oswiu. He raised an army against Oswiu but then realized his army wasn't large enough and he sent them home. He was betrayed by one of his nobleman to Oswiu and was murdered in 651.
King of Deira.
"After Oswine's death, Athelwald became king. It is uncertain whether Oswiu (who was Athelwald's uncle) installed him as king or whether Athelwald took the kingship in opposition to Oswiu. At some point he allied himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda of Mercia. He guided Penda during his invasion of Northumbria in 655. But, when the armies of Oswiu and Penda met on 15 November at the Battle of the Winwaed, Athelwald withdrew to safety. Penda was defeated and killed. perhaps in part because of this desertion, and afterward Athelwald was not heard of again."
King Athelwald gave St. Cedd the lands of Lastingham to build a monastery.
Department
Department can mean several things:
Polar vortex
"The polar vortex (alternate names: Arctic cyclone or polar vortice) is a persistent large-scale cyclone located near geographical poles of a planet. On Earth, a polar vortex is usually in the middle and upper troposphere and stratosphere. The cyclone surrounds the polar highs. Polar storms lie in the wake of the polar front. They strengthen in the winter and weaken near summer. These vortexes span usually between 620 to 1,240 miles. They circulate counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere."
"Similar to hurricanes, a Coriolis effect causes the rotation of a polar vortex. The Arctic vortex has two main centers: one is over the Baffin Island, the other is over northeastern Siberia."
Climate change may be increasing Arctic polar vortex stretching events. This would cause more extreme cold in the United States.
Department of Alto Adige
"The Department of Alto Adige (, ) was a department of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy. It was named after the river Adige (Etsch), which flowed through it. The capital of the department was Trento."
"The department's territory was not the same as that of the modern Italian province of Alto Adige. Some of the territory is the same, such as the city of Bolzano, but most of the rest is now part of the province of Trento. These two provinces form the region Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol."
History.
"The name ""Alto Adige"" was created in the late 18th century by Napoleon Bonaparte, when he occupied the territory of northern Italy near the Alps. This was the name of the French administrative division known as the ""Department of Alto Adige"" (""Dipartimento dell'Alto Adige""), created during Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy in 1810. It was officially named ""Haut Adige"" to get rid of relation to the historic ""County of Tyrol"" of Austria. The District of Alto Adige was created by Napoleon as part of the Dipartamento del Benaco in his Cisalpine Republic, and was near Verona. This Benaco department, created in 1797, was gotten rid of in 1798 as a result of administrative changes to the Cisalpine Republic."
"Some years later, Napoleon created the Department of Alto Adige further north. This department was a part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1810 to 1814. It was created with the division of the Austrian Tyrol between French Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy, and included the southern part of Tyrol with the city of Bolzano with surroundings (along with the Trentino). The boundaries were made by Austrian and German commissioners, who said that a territory would belong to the Kingdom of Italy if it is inhabited by Italians."
Tonbridge is a town in Kent in England. The River Medway runs through the town. A castle stands on the northern river bank in the middle of Tonbridge.
Tonbridge is linked by railways to London and Dover.
There are many secondary schools in the area. such as Tonbridge Grammar School
Inverness
Inverness is a city in the northern part of Scotland. It is often called the capital of the Highlands. It is on the A9 road. Inverness Airport is an important way to get to the Scottish Highlands.
Boycott
"A boycott is a protest where the protesters do not buy a product or give money to a company. Instead of buying a certain product, they might also buy another, very similar product from a different company."
"The word was made during the ""Irish Land War""'. It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott. Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo, Ireland. In 1880, the tenants (those who rented) wanted their rent lowered. Boycott refused, and threw them out of the land they had rented. The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violent, everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott. The captain was soon isolated. No one helped him with the harvest, no one worked in his stables or his house. Local businessmen no longer traded with him, the postman no longer delivered his post."
"To get his harvest done, he had to hire 50 people from other counties, the counties Cavan and Monaghan. They were escorted to and from their work by 1000 policemen. Of course, this cost far more than what the harvest was worth."
Artificial
"When something is artificial, or man-made, it has been made by humans, not nature. For example, an artificial satellite is one made by humans, while a natural satellite is a satellite that was not made by humans. Many artificial things imitate or copy things found in nature. The imitation may use the same basic materials as those in the natural object; or it may use quite different materials, as in Artificial leather. These are concepts in defining reality. There are different ideas about what can be considered artificial and what is natural."
"The word ""artificial"" comes from the Latin words ""art"" (meaning ""skill"") and ""fex"" (""to make"")."
"Artificial does not necessarily mean ""synthetic"" (that is, created by synthesis). An artificial sweetener imitates sweetness using a chemical formula that is not found in nature; it is therefore both artificial and synthetic."
King Arthur
"King Arthur was a mythical king in the mythology of Great Britain. He lived in the medieval times, in his famous castle, Camelot. He possessed a sword known as Excalibur, given to him by the Lady of the Lake."
"King Arthur is a fabled ruler of Sub-Roman Britain who defended his kingdom from the Anglo-Saxons. He is a popular fictional character in modern literature. He won several battles, and had many homes. However, his favorite home was in Camelot. In one of the most famous tales of King Arthur, he pulls a sword out of a stone, making him King of the Britons."
"The first narrative account of Arthur's life is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin work ""Historia Regum Britanniae"" (""History of the Kings of Britain""), completed ."
Camelot.
"Many castles claim to be Arthur's Camelot, but the most likely one is Tintagel Castle, Cornwall (though there is no evidence for this). In Camelot sat the famous Round Table, where Arthur, his queen Guinevere, Merlin, Morgan le Fay, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, Percival and many other valiant knights sat. Arthur and his knights went on many quests including The Quest For The Holy Grail, The Green Knight, The Black Knight and more."
Death.
"After King Arthur's many adventures, his son Mordred seized his kingdom and queen, forcing Arthur to fight for what was truly his. They fought for a long time. Mordred hit King Arthur in many places, but in the end Arthur killed Mordred. After this victory, King Arthur was weak and died from losing blood from battle wounds. As his knights rode back to Camelot, they threw Excalibur into the lake so that it could return to where it came from. One legend says Arthur never died, and will return when the British need him."
"Books, poems and movies."
"Many books have been written about King Arthur. Most of them involve Merlin, the Knights of the Round Table, and Morgan le Fay."
"Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote the first book about Arthur in the 12th century. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory wrote one of the best-known books about Arthur, called ""Le Morte d’Arthur"" (""The Death of Arthur""). Later, in the 19th century, Alfred, Lord Tennyson visited Tintagel, the mythical Camelot, twice. He wrote a series of poems about Arthur."
"Some stories about Arthur say he tried to find the Holy Grail, the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper."
"There are also many movies about Arthur. These include Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone; Monty Python and the Holy Grail; King Arthur (2004); King Arthur, The Kid Who Would Be King (2019); the Legend of the Sword (2017)""; and the musical ""Camelot""."

The Brittas Empire
The Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen.
Chris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas. He is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.
The show ran for seven series and 52 episodes — including two Christmas specials — from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series.
"""The Brittas Empire"" had large audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's ""Britain's Best Sitcom"" poll."
"The show combined farce with surreal dramatic elements. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to be electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in ""The Brittas Empire""."
Plot summary.
"Gordon Brittas (played by Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. He is tactless, annoying and has 'half-baked' ideas. He is oblivious to all of his faults. Brittas frequently upsets his staff, the public, and his wife Helen. He often brings confusion and chaos into their lives."
"Helen Brittas, played by Pippa Haywood, finds it hard to cope with Gordon. She often turns to pills and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity. She is also helped by Brittas's calm and efficient deputy, Laura Lancing, played by Julia St John. Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas whom she regards as honest and decent."
"Brittas's other deputy, the dim-witted Colin Weatherby, is played by Mike Burns. Colin has several skin allergies and a constantly infected hand. Though he is an assistant manager, he works as the centre's caretaker. Carole, played by Harriet Thorpe, is the often tearful receptionist who keeps her three children in the drawers of the reception desk. Amongst other members of the team is Julie, played by Judy Flynn. Julie is a sarcastic secretary who hates her boss and refuses to do any work. Lively Linda, played by Jill Greenacre, gentle-hearted Gavin, played by Tim Marriott, and his paranoid partner Tim, played by Russell Porter, are more co-operative members of the team. Carole's son Ben was played by Jonathon Norriss."
Episodes.
"""The Brittas Empire"" was broadcast for fifty-two episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials. There was also one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off called ""Get Fit with Brittas""."
"For the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote the show, after which they left, along with actress Julia St John who played Laura. Series five was originally meant to be the final series, and Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas at its end, when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank."
"However, the show's popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a team of new writers, who carried the show on for a further two series, including one further Christmas special in 1996.

"'Curse of the Tiger Women' is the final episode in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is regarded as poor by many critics and viewers, and contradicts the 1994 Christmas Special by Fegen and Norriss, showing what happens to the staff post-Whitbury Leisure Centre."
"In 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, 'Word Up!' by Little Mix."
DVD and VHS releases.
"All seven series were released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Video, and also in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC released episodes on VHS in the 1990s."
Critical response.
Critics John Lewis and Penny Stempel commented that:
"In its positioning of an incompetent in charge of others, ""The Brittas Empire"" mined the traditional vein of TV humour (e.g., Dad's Army or Are You Being Served?). Yet it also had an element of absurdism...which gave it an appeal to younger viewers. At a stretch the show could also be viewed as a critique of the managerial class which expanded in the Thatcherite eighties. A show for all the couch."
Influence.
"The show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and ""The Office""."
Setting.
"The exterior shots and interior swimming pools of 'Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre' were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire."

Yukultji Napangati
Yukultji Napangati is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She is a painter of the Papunya Tula group of artists. She is part of a generation of female painters who followed in the footsteps of the original male Papunya Tula artists.
"Yukultji grew up around Marruwa, a waterhole near Lake Mackay. She grew up without knowing about places like Kiwirrkurra, or her relatives living there. She had never met anyone from outside her own family. Her family lived a completely traditional nomadic way of life. Her father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo, but he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns. Yukultji's father died sometime around 1980. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. The event was big news at the time, and the family became famously known as ""the last nomads"". Yukultji was the youngest of this group."
"Yukultji experienced major culture shock when first coming out of the desert. She often found new things difficult to understand. In an interview once, she remembers, ""I hopped into a car and crouched down, and I saw the trees move. I was frightened. I was scared. I jumped right off because the trees were racing around the place."""
"Yukultji began painting in the early 1990s. Before this, she had watched her brothers painting and later decided to try it for herself. She paints stories and songs from her and her mother's dreaming. These stories are about her traditional country, around Marruwa, Ngaminya and Marrapinti."
"Her paintings are shown in several public collections in Australia. Her work has been shown in over 80 exhibitions in Australia and overseas. She was a finalist in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In 2012, Yukultji won the Alice Prize, an award for Australian artists in Alice Springs."
Yalti Napangati
"Yalti Napangati (born around 1970) is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She is a painter of the Western Desert style of art, and paints for the Papunya Tula school. Her husband, Warlimpirrnga, is also a well-known artist. They were both members of the infamous Pintupi Nine, the last group of Aborigines living a traditional way of life in Australia."
"Yalti was born in the Great Sandy Desert, sometime around 1970. She and her family lived as nomads in the desert, travelling along the western side of Lake Mackay. Most other Pintupi families had moved into settlements during the 1950s, but Yalti's father kept the family away from these. Her parents were Lanti (or ""Joshua"") and Nanu. She has an older brother, Tamayinya, and a younger sister, Yukultji. She married Warlimpirrnga sometime during the early 1980s, possibly when she was as young as 12. She and her family came out of the desert in 1984. She now lives at Kiwirrkurra, and has two sons and two daughters."
"Yalti finished her first paintings for Papunya Tula in June 1996. She makes acrylic paintings of landscapes associated with Pintupi dreaming stories. Her paintings are of important places in her country, around Marruwa, Laurryi, Wirrulnga and Patjarr."

"James Buchanan was born on April 23, 1791 in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania, into a prosperous merchant family. He had four sisters and three brothers, and studied at the Old Stone Academy before entering Dickinson College in 1807. There he studied law and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar Association in 1812."
"Buchanan was engaged to Anne C. Coleman, but she died early, and he never had children. He is the only U.S. president who was never married."
"Buchanan served in both the House and Senate, representing Pennsylvania, as well as the Minister to Russia, under Andrew Jackson, before stepping taking the presidential career."
Presidency.
"During the beginning of his presidency, he called slavery an issue of little importance. This was clearly not the case at the time; Northerners and Southerners were very divided on slavery, almost to the point of war."
The Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not American citizens and that the states were allowed to keep slavery legal. James Buchanan supported that decision because he did not want the pro-slavery states to stop being part of the United States.
"Buchanan supported the rights of slave owners to keep their slaves and wanted Kansas to adopt a constitution that allowed slavery. Because of that, the Democratic Party was divided on that issue and after the 1858 Congressional election, there were more Republicans in Congress than Democrats. He did not get along with the Republicans."
He ordered troops to fight against Utah based on untrue information that Utah was planning a revolt. Buchanan later realized that he made a mistake and apologized.
"During his term, the country was becoming more and more divided over the slavery issue. A few months before his term ended, some of the southern states decided that they were going to not be a part of the United States any more."
"Buchanan believed that it was a bad thing, but he did nothing about it because he felt that using force against the south was against the Constitution. He did not even prepare the country for war."
Legacy.
"At the end of his term, he left the next president, Abraham Lincoln, to face the greatest crises in United States history, the Civil War."
"Some historians think that Buchanan was the worst president of the United States in the history, because he did nothing to prevent the Civil war."

History.
"People have lived in Bahrain before there was writing. It has been ruled and influenced by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Persians, and the Arabs, who made the island Muslim. Bahrain was in old times known as Dilmun, Tylos, Awal and Mishmahig."
"The islands of Bahrain, set in the middle south of the Persian Gulf, have attracted many invaders in history. The word ""Bahrain"", ""Two Seas"", means that the islands contain two kinds of water, sweet water springs and salty water in the sea."
"A location between East and West, fertile lands, fresh water, and pearls made Bahrain important in history. About 2300 BC, Bahrain started trading with Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and the Indus Valley (now near India). It was then called Delmon, and was linked to the Sumerian Civilization about 2000 BC. Bahrain also became part of the Babylonian empire about 600 BC. Historical records called Bahrain the ""Life of Eternity"", ""Paradise"", the ""Pearl of the Persian Gulf"" and other names."
"Until 1521, Bahrain also ruled Al-Hasa and Qatif (both are now the eastern province of Saudi Arabia) and Awal (now the Bahrain Islands). The country had all of the land from what is now Kuwait to Oman. This was called ""Iqlim Al-Bahrain"" (Province of Bahrain). In 1521, the Portuguese took Awal (now Bahrain) from the rest and since then the name of Bahrain only means today's Bahrain."

Book of Esther
"Esther is the name of a book in the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) and the Old Testament, and also its title heroine. It is the basis for the Jewish celebration Purim."
Author and Date.
"Although it is never said who wrote the book of Esther, from inside evidence it is possible to make some guesses about the author and when it was written. The author was a Jew, because he emphasizes where the Jewish festival came from and from the Jewish nationalism inside the story. The author probably lived in a Persian city, because he knew Persian customs well, and does not say anything about the land of Judah or Jerusalem. The earliest date of the book would be a little while after the events were told, for instance, about 460 B.C. (before Ezra's return to Jerusalem). It is also thought that the festival of Purim had been celebrated some time before this book was written."
"Purpose, Themes, and Features."
Purpose.
The author's main purpose was to write about how the yearly festival of Purim started and to make people remember the saving of the Jewish people during King Ahaseurus' reign. The book shows both the start of the festival and why it should continue to be celebrated.
Themes.
"In the book, the author repeatedly talks about the conflict between Israel and the Amalekites, a conflict that began during the exodus and continued through Israel's history. The author of Esther views them as the symbol of all the powers of the world against God's people. Now that Israel has been released from captivity, Haman's dangerous edict is the final try in the Old Testament time to get rid of them. When Haman is defeated, Israel enjoys a time of rest."
"Feasting is another important theme in Esther, as seen in the picture on the left. Banquets are the setting for important parts of the story. There are ten banquets."
Style and Features.
Repetition is one of the main stylistic features of the book of Esther. The three groups of banquets come in pairs; there are two lists of the king's servants; two reports that Esther hid her identity; two gatherings of women; two houses for the women; two fasts; two talks by Haman with his wife and friends; two sudden visits to the king by Esther; two coverings of Haman's face; two royal commands; two cool-downs of the king's anger; two days for the Jews to protect themselves and take vengeance; and two letters about how Purim started.
"Another important feature of this book that has often been wondered about is that it never directly talks about God, worship, prayer, or sacrifice. This has made some people think the book is not as religious as other books. However, it is possible that the author purposefully did not say anything about God or anything religious to show more clearly that it is God who controls all the ""unimportant"" coincidences that are in the story and ends in saving the Jews."
Content.
"The Book of Esther is about a Jewish girl adopted by her cousin, Mordecai, after her parents died."
"The Persian King Ahaseurus kicked out his wife, Queen Vashti, after she refused his demand, and fell in love with Esther at a beauty contest. He took Esther as the new Persian queen, not knowing she was a Jew."
"Haman, Ahaseurus' prime minister, developed a grudge against Mordecai because he would not bow down to him, but only to the God of Israel. He despised Mordecai because he was a Jew, and tried to trick the king into making a law to kill all Jews. Haman was unaware that Queen Esther herself was a Jew."
"Nowadays, there is little or no households with proper phunga lairu (traditional fire hearth). So, a modern fireplace is developed. Here, traditional rites and rituals are performed in honor of the goddess."
"There are a lot of changes in the way of worshipping Goddess Imoinu. However, the essence and the importance always remain the same as forever."
Festival.
"The ""Imoinu Iratpa"" (""Emoinu Eratpa"") is a religious festival dedicated to goddess Imoinu (Emoinu). It is celebrated on the 12th of Wakching month (December-January interface month) every year. Traditionally, worship and prayers are performed inside every households. Nowadays, Imoinu Iratpa festival is also celebrated in a larger way in public gathering clubs also."

Sanamahi was stronger than his younger brother, Pakhangba. He started his journey. Pakhangba wept to his mother, Leimarel Sidabi. She told him the secret behind the throne of the universe. The secret is that going around the throne of the Supreme Being is shorter than going around the universe. So, Pakhangba went around the Supreme Being, his father. Thus, he won the race and became the ruler of the universe. When Sanamahi returned home, he found his younger brother sitting on the throne. He got angry. He attacked Pakhangba. Pakhangba ran away. He hid himself among seven lairembis. The Supreme Being intervened the situation. He brought peace of Sanamahi. He made Sanamahi as the king of the household of the mankind. At the same time, goddess Leimarel Sidabi became another Imung Lai (household deity), besides Sanamahi."

So, houses of Loi castes are mainly made facing southwards. She lives in water also. So, she is worshipped in an ""Isaiphu"" (an earthen pitcher or terracotta pot containing water). There are no images kept to represent the two deities inside their abode."

"The regiment had to enter Pourville to cross the river by the only bridge. Before they managed to reach the bridge, the Germans had put machine guns and anti-tank guns there which stopped them. With dead and wounded Canadians lying on the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt, the commanding officer, crossed the bridge several times. He wanted to show his soldiers that the bridge could be crossed. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross."

LaWanda Page
"LaWanda Page (October 19, 1920September 14, 2002), born Alberta Peal, was an American actress and comedienne best known for her role as Aunt Esther in the 1970s TV sitcom ""Sanford and Son"". She later reprised the role in ""Sanford Arms"" and ""Sanford""."
Early life and career.
"She was born on October 19, 1920 in Cleveland, Ohio. Page was raised in St. Louis, Missouri. LaWanda Page and Redd Foxx were very close friends from the time they were pre-teens. They attended school and grew up together in St. Louis. Later on, they both entered the field of comedy separately and performed stage acts. Page later recorded several live comedy albums for the Laff Records label in the late 1960s and early 1970s under the LaWanda stage name. One release, a gold-selling album called ""Watch It, Sucker!"", was titled after one of her Aunt Esther character's catchphrases to capitalize on her newfound TV fame. During her tenure as a stand-up comic, which lasted all the way to the 1990s, she was often called ""The Queen of Comedy"", or ""The Black Queen of Comedy"". Other than the expletive-free ""Sane Advice"" album, released two years after the run of ""Sanford and Son"", most of Page's albums and stand-up material were raunchy in nature."
Other film and television appearances.
"In 1977 Page appeared in an episode of ""The Love Boat"", ""Martin,"" ""227,"" ""Family Matters,"" and ""Diff'rent Strokes."" She appeared on ""Circus Of The Stars"" as a fire eater."
Death.
"Page died of complications from diabetes on September 14, 2002. She is interred in an outdoor crypt at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California."
"Her daughter, the evangelist Clara Estella Roberta Johnson, died on June 4, 2006, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 69."
Atmosphere of Mars
"The atmosphere of Mars is the layer of gases surrounding Mars. It is mainly made up of carbon dioxide. The average atmospheric pressure of the Martian surface (6.0 mbar) is much lower than that of the Earth (1,013 mbar). The pressure is well below the Armstrong limit, meaning that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body: 98.6 °F (36.6 °C)."
"The Martian atmosphere contains 96% carbon dioxide, 1.9% argon, 1.9% nitrogen, and traces of oxygen, carbon monoxide, water and methane, and so on. Ever since the discovery of methane in 2003, scientists say that this might indicate life. It has also been suggested that is may be caused by geochemical processes, volcanic or hydrothermal activity."
"The atmosphere of Mars is quite dusty, giving the Martian sky a light brown or orange-red color when seen from the surface. Data from NASA pointed out that the dust particles are 1.5 micrometres diameter."
"On 18 March 2015, NASA found an aurora that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the atmosphere of Mars."
"Liquid water on Mars was once commonplace, which means the atmosphere was thicker. Many studies have found that the atmosphere of Mars has been weakened over time due to solar winds. On Earth, the magnetic field protects us from most of the wind. Mars used to have a magnetic field, but cooling of the core has resulted in the magnetic field being lost."
Solar Wind Composition Experiment
"The Solar Wind Composition Experiment (SWC) was an experiment that took place on the Moon during the Apollo program (Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16). It was done to measure the solar wind outside of Earth's magnetosphere. It was the first notable measurement of isotopic solar material."
The experiment was suggested by by a Swiss team headed by Johannes Geiss of the University of Bern and Peter Eberhardt of the Swiss Institute of Technology. It was partially funded by the Swiss Government.
"The SWC experiment was done by getting a aluminum sheet and facing it towards the sun. The foil was to collect the ion types and energies of the solar wind on the lunar surface. After the experiment, the sheet was placed into a Teflon bag, and sent back to Earth to be studied. The experiment was successful and found Helium, Neon and Argon isotopic compositions coming from the sun."
Caesar's Comet
"Caesar's Comet (C/-43 K1) is also known as 'Comet Caesar' and the 'Great Comet of 44 BC'. It was one of the most famous comets of ancient times. Many Romans thought the comet's seven-day appearance was a sign of the deification of recently assassinated dictator, Julius Caesar (100–44 BC)."
"Caesar's Comet was one of only five comets known to have had a negative absolute magnitude and may have been the brightest daylight comet in history. It was not periodic, and it had a parabolic orbit. The comet might now be more than 800 AU from the Sun."
Do You Know the Way to San Jose
"""Do You Know the Way to San Jose"" is a 1968 popular song. It is about a person from San Jose, California who wants to go back to her hometown. Dionne Warwick performed it."
The song sold over a million copies. Warwick won her first Grammy Award for it.
"The song was Warwick's first song after ""(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls""/""I Say a Little Prayer"". It was released in April 1968."
"The song was later sung by Connie Francis, Rita Reys, Neil Diamond, Nancy Sinatra and others."
Blasphemy
"Blasphemy is a word that means ""speaking badly about a religion"", or ""insulting a god"". Some religions see blasphemy as a religious crime. Many countries witha state religion have laws that make blasphemy a crime. For example, blasphemy can be punished with the death penalty in Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. In other countries, the punishment for the crime is a fine, or imprisonment."
"Some countries do not have laws against blasphemy. For example, after the French Revolution, France made blasphemy legal to make sure people would have freedom of religion and the freedom of the press."
"The United States, Canada, and many European countries, have laws to protect people who speak badly about religion. Sometimes people do this in a satirical way, like with a movie that makes fun of a religion. In these countries, profanity is often protected by freedom of speech as well."
Brie
"Brie is a type of soft cheese with a yellowish interior and a white layer (the ""rind"") on the outside of the cheese. The rind is eaten as well as the inside of this cheese. Like other cheeses, Brie is a dairy product made from cows' milk. Brie cheese may be served with fruit as a dessert at the end of a meal, or with a relish."
"The cheese is sometimes served slightly melted or baked, in a round, lidded ceramic dish, and topped with nuts or fruit, or both."
How it is made.
"Brie is a French cheese, and protected by AOC (""Appellation d'origine contrôlée""). This means only this cheese from this region (near Paris) can properly call itself ""brie"". This is ignored by some countries outside Europe, but the system of AOC is used in the wine business, so many parts of the world do honour it, and have similar arrangements."
"The milk of soft cheeses (""à pate molle"" in French) is not heated during the production of the cheese. Talleyrand said about this kind of cheese that it was the ""king of cheeses"". He said that in the 19th century. This kind of cheese has been made for at least 1000 years."
"In Europe this cheese is usually not treated chemically, so it might change in consistency or color. It will go bad if it is not kept cool. If that means it is kept in a refrigerator, note that it should not be eaten that cold. It is best eaten when it is somewhat below normal room temperature. In most countries, brie-style cheeses are made with Pasteurized milk."
"Brie can be aged, that is, carefully treated for up to a year. Then it has a darker colour and a stronger taste. This is rarely seen outside of France."
Types of Brie.
The following kinds of Brie exist:
"Other French ""Bries"" are:"
Bries from outside France:
Brie de Meaux.
"Cheeses are made into round loaves, of about 36 cm in diameter. The cheeses then weight about 2.5 kilograms. It is best tasted from April to October, after a ripening period of 8 to 10 weeks. About 2% of the production occurs on farms."
Brie de Melun.
"The Brie de Melun is smaller than the Brie de Meaux, but more salt is added to it. The ripening period is 10 weeks. It is best consumed April to September, but it can be found March to November, in some locations. About 5% of production occurs on farms."
What Brie should look like.
"When people buy Brie, they should make sure that it has the following traits:"
Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord
"Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (February 2, 1754 - May 17, 1838) was a French diplomat."
"He was a bishop and worked successfully for Louis XVI. He changed sides and served the French Revolution and Napoleon I. When Napoleon started losing his wars, Talleyrand changed sides again and served Louis XVIII. He represented France at the Congress of Vienna. He changed sides once more and served Louis Philippe I. Since the beginning of the 19th century he was known simply as ""Talleyrand"". He is widely seen as one of the most pragmatic and influential diplomats in European history. He was known to accept bribes from other European powers, especially while he served under Napoleon."
Pasteurization
Pasteurization (or pasteurisation) is a process of heat processing a liquid or a food to kill pathogenic bacteria to make the food safe to eat and to preserve longer. It involves heating the food to kill most harmful microorganisms. Producers pasteurize dairy and other foods to make them safe to eat. The process is named after Louis Pasteur. He was the first person to learn how to do it successfully. The first pasteurization was done by Louis Pasteur and Claude Bernard on 20 April 1862.
"Unlike sterilization, pasteurization is not intended to kill all microorganisms in the food. Instead, pasteurization gets a ""log reduction"" in the number of microorganisms. It brings their number down so they are unlikely to cause disease if the product is kept in the refrigerator and consumed before its sell-by date. Commercial sterilization of food is not common, because it tends to destroy the flavour of the food."
Namur (city)
"Namur (, ) is a city in Belgium. It is both the capital of the province with the same name, as well as of Wallonia, one of the three administrative regions of Belgium. It is in the French-speaking part of Belgium."
"In 2012, there were 112'246 people in Namur."
"Namur is at 50° 27 North, 04° 51 East."

"Mariska Magdolna Hargitay (born January 23, 1964 in Los Angeles, California, USA) is an American actress. She is best known for her role on the television series """". She is also the daughter of actors Jayne Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay."
Career.
"Hargitay plays Detective Olivia Benson on the television series ""Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. ""Olivia is a sex-crimes detective who works with people and children who have been abused, assaulted, raped, molested, and otherwise victimized."
"Hargitay was inspired by the sad stories she learned on SVU, and she created the real-life Joyful Heart Foundation in 2004. The Joyful Heart Foundation helps real-life survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault."
Santa Cruz de Tenerife
"Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the capital of the Canary Islands. It is in Tenerife, the biggest and most important (political and economic) island in the Canary Islands."
"The Parliament of the Canary Islands is in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The population was 222,417 in 2009. During the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, thousands of people take to the streets each year for over a week. On January 18, 1980 it was declared a Fiesta of International Tourist Interest by the Secretary of State for Tourism, and is one of the world's largest carnivals."
Saint Helena
"Saint Helena is an island of volcanic origin in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It is named after Saint Helena of Constantinople. It is part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, which also includes Ascension Island and the islands of Tristan da Cunha. Saint Helena measures about and has a population of 4,084 (2008 census)."
Napoleon was sent to this island by the British and their allies as a result of Napoleon's return from the Elba island and loss at the Battle of Waterloo. Napoleon died there in 1821.
The island is on a tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
History.
Early history (1502–1658).
"The island was discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese admiral João da Nova, and he named it ""Santa Helena"" after Helena of Constantinople. The traditional date of this discovery was long thought to be 21 May, but the results of an investigation into the discovery published in 2015 concluded this date is probably wrong, the 3 May seeming to be historically more valid. Another theory holds that the island found by De Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha, to the south, and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships under the command of Estêvão da Gama on 30 July 1503."
"The Portuguese found the island uninhabited, with an abundance of trees and fresh water. They imported livestock, fruit trees and vegetables, and built a chapel and one or two houses. Though they formed no permanent settlement, the island was, for ships travelling from Asia to Europe, an important place to stop to get food and water, and frequently sick sailors were left on the island to recover. After 1588, the island was visited also by Dutch and English ships."
"The Dutch Republic formally made claim to St Helena in 1633, although there is no evidence that they ever occupied, colonised or fortified it. By 1651, the Dutch had mainly abandoned the island in favour of their colony at the Cape of Good Hope."
East India Company (1658–1815).
"In 1657, the English East India Company was given a permit to govern St Helena by Oliver Cromwell, and the following year the Company decided to colonise the island with farmers. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, got there in 1659, and made St Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. A fort was completed and a number of houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a Royal permit to start a colony in the island. The fort was named ""James Fort"" and the town ""Jamestown"", in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II of England."
"The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792 and Chinese workers were brought to work in the farms. Many were allowed to stay, and their descendents became integrated into the population."
British rule (1815–1821) and Napoleon's exile.
"In 1815, the British government decided to use the island of St. Helena as a place of detention for Napoleon Bonaparte. To prevent any attempt to escape from the nearby islands, they formally annexed the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. In 1821, Napoleon died on the island of St Helena."
"In 1858, the French emperor Napoleon III got the possession, in the name of the French government, of Longwood House and the lands around it, last residence of Napoleon I (who died there in 1821). It is still French property."
Crown colony (1834–1981).
Tel Aviv
"The city of Tel Aviv-Yafo (;  ) is a municipality in Israel, often just called Tel Aviv. It is Israel's second largest city and main commercial, financial, industrial and cultural center. It is on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea."
"In 2018, 451,523 people lived in the city of Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv is a part of an area of cities called Gush Dan, which is the largest metropolitan area of Israel. About 3,850,000 people live in this urban area."
"The city calls itself Israel's capital of culture, economy and trade."
History.
"In 1909, Jewish people started building Tel Aviv northeast of Jaffa, making it the first city founded by Jews in modern times. Tel Aviv was part of Jaffa at first, but it became a separate town in 1921. Tel Aviv grew quickly as Jewish immigrants arrived, mainly from Europe."
Between the years 1925-1929 the Scottish city planner Sir Patrick Geddes was design the first city plan for Tel Aviv.
"In the early 1930s the area of the Yarkon River mouth has began to develop with the opening of the international trade fair - the ""Orient Fair"" and the opening of the ""Tel Aviv Port"" beside him. from the other side of the Yarkon River was built the Reading Power Station and the Sde Dov Airport."
"It was Israel's first capital when the nation was established in 1948. The capital was moved to Jerusalem in 1949, but the Israeli Ministry of Defense and many foreign embassies stayed in Tel Aviv. Most Israeli ministries that are located in Jerusalem, have offices in Tel Aviv. The national intelligence agencies of Israel, Mossad (external security), Aman (military intelligence) and Shin Bet (internal security) also have their headquarters in Tel Aviv."
"In 1950, Tel Aviv and Jaffa (called ""Yafo"" in Hebrew) joined to into the city of Tel Aviv-Yafo. Tel Aviv-Yafo is the official name of the city, but it is almost always called Tel Aviv."
"Tel Aviv continued to grow quickly in the 1950s and 1960s. The fast growth of the Tel Aviv area caused problems such as air pollution, slums, and traffic that took until the 2000s to fix. Traffic is still a problem. That is why the Tel Aviv Light Rail is being built to ease the road traffic. Most of the people of Tel Aviv live in apartment buildings."
"During the Persian Gulf War of 1991, Iraq fired about 25 missiles toward Tel Aviv. Several missiles and falling debris struck residential areas in or around Tel Aviv. Two people were killed, and about 7,500 apartments were damaged."
Cultural life.
"The cultural center of Tel Aviv is a downtown intersection of streets at Dizengoff Circle. Fashionable shops and sidewalk cafes line the nearby streets. The 37-story Shalom Tower is in the city's financial district, several blocks south of Dizengoff Circle. It is the tallest building in Israel. The southwestern part of the city was once the separate town of Jaffa. Jaffa, an ancient port from Biblical times, has many historic place that have been restored by archaeologists. Jaffa also has many art galleries, cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs."
"The Israeli opera, and Habima Theater, Israel's national theater, was are in Tel Aviv."

Trigonometry
"Trigonometry (from the Greek ""trigonon"" = three angles and ""metron"" = measure) is a part of elementary mathematics dealing with angles, triangles and trigonometric functions such as sine (abbreviated sin), cosine (abbreviated cos) and tangent (abbreviated tan). It has some connection to geometry, although there is disagreement on exactly what that connection is; for some, trigonometry is just a section of geometry."
Overview and definitions.
Trigonometry uses a large number of specific words to describe parts of a triangle. Some of the definitions in trigonometry are:
Trigonometric ratios.
"There are three main trigonometric ratios for right triangles, and three reciprocals of those ratios, making up a total of 6 ratios. They are:"
The reciprocals of these ratios are:
Cosecant (cosec) - The cosecant of an angle is equal to the formula_4 or formula_5.

"Tuten also played with the Hershey B'ars/Bears of the EHL for 4 seasons as well as the Baltimore Orioles from the EHL for 1 season. He went on to play for both the Kansas City Greyhounds and Kansas City Americans of the AHA for 1 season each. He entered the NHL and played with the Black Hawks for 5 games before rejoining the Americans. He joined the Black Hawks again and played 34 games with them. He left the Black Hawks and went on to join the Minneapolis Millers of the USHL for 4 games, the Fort Worth Rangers of the USHL for 2 games and the Kansas City Pla-Mors of the USHL for 10 games before ending his playing career with Los Angeles-S.D. of the PCHL. He died on May 7, 1994."
Münchausen syndrome
"Münchausen Syndrome (pronounced ""MUNCH-house-in"") is a mental illness in which a person repeatedly fakes disease, illness, or psychological trauma to get attention or sympathy from others. It is sometimes called hospital addiction syndrome, thick chart syndrome, or hospital hopper syndrome."
"A related mental illness is Münchausen Syndrome by proxy. People with this condition abuse another person, usually a child, in order to get sympathy or attention for themselves. For example, a parent might make their own child sick in order to get attention and sympathy from friends and medical professionals."
Symptoms.
"People with Münchausen Syndrome exaggerate or create symptoms of mental or physical illness. Some people with Münchausen make up detailed stories about medical problems they have had, or they may fake symptoms. However, others may harm themselves in many different ways in order to make it seem like they are sick. For example, they might take laxatives to make it seem like they have diarrhea, or take blood-thinning medications to cause bleeding. They might inject themselves with bacteria so that they get an infection. They might cut or burn themselves in order to create wounds. Sometimes, after getting medical treatment, people with Münchausen also do things to slow down or prevent their recovery - for example, by ripping out stitches."
"The goal of this behavior is to get treatment, attention, sympathy, and comfort from medical professionals. For a person with Münchausen, being a patient feels familiar and comfortable. This meets a deep psychological need that the person has."
Risk factors.
There are several risk factors for Münchausen (things which make it more likely for a person to develop the condition). Münchausen is more common in people who:
Types.
A few different types of Münchausen Syndrome have been identified. They include:
The Weeping Woman
"The Weeping Woman is an iconic painting. It was painted by Pablo Picasso. It is an oil painting done on canvas. Picasso painted this after his break-up with his mistress, Dora Maar. After the breakup he always said she was weeping there for creating the term of ""Weeping Woman"". Pablo Picasso used his skill for geometric shapes and design in the painting. You can see multiple dimensions in this picture. Made in 1937 it shows how old Pablo Picasso would be now, though also how experienced he was then, being born in 1881. The level of experience it would take to be capable of such a level of geometric art work is surprisingly high considering there have been so many artists over the eras who have mastered it."
Larry Zeidel
"Lazarus ""Larry, Rock"" Zeidel (June 1, 1928 – June 17, 2014) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played 5 seasons in the NHL as well as 12 seasons in the AHL."

After that he played with the Saskatoon Quakers of the WCSHL and then the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL for 19 games before being sent to their AHL affiliate, Indianapolis Capitals for a season. He was called up to the Red Wings and played 9 games with them before he joined the Edmonton Flyers of the WHL and played 1 season with them. He played joined the Chicago Black Hawks of the NHL for 1 season and rejoined the Edmonton Flyers for 1 season. He would then play in the AHL with the Hershey Bears for 8 seasons and the Cleveland Barons for 1 season. He returned to the WHL to play with the Seattle Totems for 2 seasons and joined the Barons again for 2 seasons. He ended his playing career after playing with the Philadelphia Flyers for 2 seasons."
He won the Stanley Cup in 1952 during his time with the Detroit Red Wings.
Zeidel was Jewish and because of this antisemitic remarks were said to him during his playing career. His grandparents were killed in concentration camps by Nazis.
"Zeidel suffered from dementia during his last years. He died in Pennsylvania from heart failure and renal failure, aged 86."
1583 (MDLXXXIII) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Gregorian calendar and a common year starting on Tuesday of the 10-day slower Julian calendar.
314
314 was a common year.
1500
Year 1500 (MD) was a leap year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. The year 1500 wasn't a leap year in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.
"The year was seen as being especially important by many Christians in Europe, who thought it would bring the beginning of the end of the world. Their belief was based on the phrase ""half-time after the time"", when the apocalypse was due to occur, which appears in the Book of Revelation and was seen as referring to 1500. This time was also just after the Old World's discovery of the Americas in 1492, and therefore was influenced greatly by the New World.[1]"
"Historically, the year 1500 is also often identified, somewhat arbitrarily, as marking the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Early Modern Era."
"The end of this year marked the halfway point of the 2nd millennium, as there were 500 years before it and 500 years after it."

Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park
"Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a national park in the U.S. state and island of Hawaii. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park was created in 1916. It includes The Mauna Loa, which is the Earth's biggest volcano, and Kilauea, the Earth's most active volcano."
"The park shows the results of millions of years of volcanism, and evolution. These processes produce bare land from the sea, and with complex and unique ecosystems, a distinct Ancient Hawaiian culture. Kīlauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, and Mauna Loa is the biggest, it offers scientists with insights on the birth of the Hawaiian Islands, and can give visitors views of the dramatic volcanic landscapes."
"In recognition of its outstanding natural values, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has been designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987."
Recent events.
"On March 19, 2008, there was a small explosion in Halemaumau crater, the first explosive event since 1924 and the first eruption in the Kīlauea caldera since September 1982."
"Debris from the explosion was scattered over an area of . A small amount of ash was also reported at a nearby community. The explosion covered part of Crater Rim Drive and damaged Halemaumau overlook. The explosion did not release any lava, which suggests to scientists that it was driven by hydrothermal or gas sources."
"This explosion event followed the opening of a major sulfur dioxide gas vent, greatly increasing levels emitted from the Halemaumau crater."
"In 2008, Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park and Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes became sister parks."

Name.
"The meaning of the name ""Emoinu Ahongbi"" (""ꯏꯃꯣꯢꯅꯨ ꯑꯍꯣꯡꯕꯤ"") can be found by splitting it up word by word. Here, ""E"" (""ꯏ"") refers to human being. ""Moi"" (""ꯃꯣꯢ"" or ""ꯃꯣꯏ"") refers to . ""Nu"" (""ꯅꯨ"") refers to female deity or goddess. So, ""Emoinu"" means ""goddess who rears the human beings"". ""Ahongbi"" means ""giver of plentiful household properties""."

"The Meitei people believed that goddess Imoinu lives in the houses of those who strictly obey her favorite social and moral behavior norms. Imoinu blesses such people with ""nungai yaifaba"" (well being and prosperity), ""watta padaba"" (having neither shortage nor excess), ""tekta kaidaba"" (unaffected by troubles of life) and ""punshi nungshangba"" (long life). These are the basic needs of life in the human world."

The second Leimarel would be the second woman. Her responsibility was to take care of the mankind on the planet called earth. Goddess Leimarel Sidabi obeyed her divine husband's order. She created another Leimarel. The appearance of the second Leimarel was similar to the first Leimarel. The first Leimarel named the second Leimarel as ""Emoinu Ahongbi""."
Lover.
"Once goddess Imoinu fell in love with a man. The two became lovers. They swore to be husband and wife. One day, she visited his house in his absence.

Book of Enoch
"The Book of Enoch is a book claiming to be written by Enoch. He was the great-grandfather of Noah and son of Jared in the Bible. However, scholars consider it to be Pseudepigrapha. It is not part of the Bible canon and only the Ethiopian Orthodox Church says it is part of the Bible. The Book is an old Hebrew text, likely written in the 2nd century BC, and contains material on the origins of demons and giants, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why Noah's Flood was morally necessary, and a description of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah. It is interesting to many Christians because the ninth verse of the first chapter is quoted in the Epistle of Jude 1:14-15."
Anton LaVey
"Anton Szandor LaVey (April 11, 1930 – October 29, 1997), born Howard Stanton Levey, was the founder of the Church of Satan. He created a religion called LaVeyan Satanism. He wrote several books describing his beliefs. His first book was called ""The Satanic Bible"". He reported a dramatic life story, although some say he lied about his past."
Early life.
"LaVey was born Howard Stanton Levey in Chicago, Illinois to a Jewish family of Ukrainian descent. His family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area of California soon after he was born. He was talented with musical instruments, particularly the pipe organ and calliope. He read a lot. His biography says that he stopped going to high school to join the circus. When the carnival was not active, he played organ in burlesque houses. He then worked as a police photographer in San Francisco, though this has been questioned."
Church of Satan.
"In the 1960s, LaVey began giving lectures at his house to a group of people he called his ""Magic Circle."" A member of this Circle told him that his ideas could become a religion. He agreed, and founded the Church of Satan in 1966. In 1969, he published ""The Satanic Bible"". ""The Satanic Bible"" was a collection of writings he had published in the past years that outlined his philosophies and the basics of the religion. It was influenced by Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, and other authors and philosophers. In 1971, LaVey published ""The Compleat Witch"" (later released as ""The Satanic Witch""). ""The Satanic Witch"" was a manual of magic. In 1972, LaVey published ""The Satanic Rituals"". This contained instructions for performing rituals. In the 1990s, LaVey published two books of essays, ""The Devil's Notebook"" and ""Satan Speaks""."
Death.
"LaVey died on October 29, 1997. His death was caused by pulmonary edema (fluid in his lungs). This was brought on by his heart disease."
Hurricane Ike
"Hurricane Ike was one of the most damaging tropical cyclones in United States history, having caused about $38 billion dollars in damage. It was the sixth-costliest Atlantic hurricane in U.S. history. Hurricane Ike was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, third major hurricane and the most-intense hurricane of 2008 in terms of pressure. Ike may have caused up to 195 deaths. Most deaths happened in Haiti and the U.S. together. Haiti was still recovering from Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, and Hurricane Hanna."
Storm history.
"The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ike started near the west coast of Africa on August 28. The storm grew quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September 1, the storm formed into Tropical Depression Nine when the storm was over the central Atlantic Ocean. Later that day Tropical Depression Nine became Tropical Storm Ike."
After the storm.
"In spring 2009, the name ""Ike"" was retired due to severe damage it caused, particularly in Texas. It was replaced by ""Isaias"" for the 2014 season."
Currency
Currency is the unit of money used by the people of a country or Union for buying and selling goods and services.
"Certain currencies are said to be ""pegged"" or ""fixed"" to something, usually another currency. A fixed or pegged currency is one that has a constant value compared to what it is pegged to. For example, the Cape Verdian escudo is pegged to the Euro. If the value of the Euro goes up 1% compared to another form of currency, the value of the escudo also goes up 1% compared to that same currency."
"Many countries have used systems where their currency was pegged to a commodity rather than to another currency. Most used either gold or silver. When they did this, as the value of gold increased, so did the value of their money. This was called the ""gold standard"" or ""silver standard"". Most countries stopped using silver and gold standards in the 20th century."

Radio telescope
"A radio telescope is a type of antenna used for radio astronomy. The majority look like a huge satellite television dish. Stars shine, and the light can be seen with an ordinary telescope, but they also give off radio waves. Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars. Other things like black holes also give off radio waves, and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too."
"The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes. It can receive very faint signals, and see more details. The biggest telescope is a virtual radio telescope almost as big as the Earth, called the Event Horizon Telescope."
"The radio telescope at the Parkes Observatory, Parkes, New South Wales was used by NASA to receive messages from the Apollo 11 moon landings."
Light year
"A light year (symbol: ly) is the distance that light travels in empty space in one year. Since the speed of light is about 300,000 km per second (about 186,000 miles per second), then a light year is 9.46 trillion kilometers (about 5.87 trillion miles), for AU, one light year is 63,241 AU. A light year is not a length of time."
"The light year is used in astronomy because the universe is huge. Space objects such as stars and galaxies may be hundreds, thousands or millions of light years away."
Example.
"Think of a star at a distance of 100 light years from us on Earth. Light leaves the star and takes 100 years to get to us. When we see the star's light, we are seeing that star as it was 100 years ago."
Korea
"Korea is a peninsula in northeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula. Korea became a country (or state) in 918."
"In 1948, it split into two countries: North Korea and South Korea. North and South Korea and their allies fought against each other in the Korean War."
"People have lived in Korea for about 15,000 years. In the past, some of modern Manchuria and Siberia was governed by Korea. Korea is known for its fine silk. In the 7th century, the people of China sought after gold-workers from Korea. Europeans had little knowledge about Korea until the modern era."
"South Korea has over 50 million people, and North Korea has more than 23 million. South Korea's biggest city is Seoul, the capital of South Korea. The city has more than 10 million people and the region of Seoul has more than 15 million people. North Korea's biggest city is Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. It has fewer than 4 million people."
Korean people speak the Korean language. Many people in South Korea study English and other languages such as Chinese and Japanese at school.
"South Korea is an advanced country with large cities, high-speed rail trains, high-speed internet, and many television and radio networks. Many Korean television dramas are popular around the world. But there are still poor areas, even in South Korea. The Korean farmers are not rich and struggle to compete with cheap food from other countries."
History.
"Gojoseon is the first state in Korean history. It was established in 2333 BCE. Its real name is Joseon, but it is called Gojoseon to make it different from other Joseon in Korean history. Go is a Korean prefix meaning 'old'. The founder of Gojoseon is said to be Dangun. The Korean people believe that Dangun established the country on October 3rd, and still celebrate that day. In Korea, October 3rd is a national holiday, which is named Gaecheonjeol (The day heaven opened). It is said to be the day that Dangun's father whose name is Hwan-ung came from the sky on October 3rd 2457 BCE. Gochosun was destroyed by the Chinese Han Dynasty in 108 BCE."
"After Gojoseon had been destroyed, there were many confederations in the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria: Mahan, Byeonhan, Jinhan, Buyeo, Dongye, Okjeo, Goguryeo, and so on. The ancient confederation countries later merged into three more powerful kingdoms and an advanced confederation country."
Outstation (Aboriginal community)
"In Australia, the outstation movement is the movement of Australian Aboriginal people from large towns to much smaller communities, called outstations. It is mostly seen in the Northern Territory and amongst the people of the Western Desert."
"Before the 20th century, most Aboriginal families lived by themselves or in groups of 20–30 people. They were nomadic (moving from place to place), hunting and foraging across the deserts. As Euro-Australians started to build roads, towns and farms on Aboriginal lands, the native people were forced out. They had to move off their lands into towns or missions. There, the government would give them food, water and clothes."
"This way of life did not suit them. In the towns, there were many conflicts between different ethnic groups, people became addicted to alcohol, and many of them died from foreign diseases. Many groups were also far away from their traditional homelands, which were important to them and their spirituality. From the 1970s, many families started to move away from the towns. They returned to the places they grew up, and set up smaller communities."
"One of the main reasons behind the movement is for Aboriginal people to get back autonomy and self-sufficiency. The communities manage themselves, as nomadic groups (or ""tribe"") did many years before. Hunting and foraging – getting their own food, and food for everybody – is still important."
Santa Catalina rattlesnake
"The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake (""Crotalus catalinensis""), also known as the """"Santa Catalina Island Rattlesnake"", is a species of venomous Pit viper found only on Santa Catalina Island in the Gulf of California. There are currently no subspecies recognized."
Description.
"The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake is a small and slender species of rattlesnake. It can grow up to the length of 73.1 centimeters (28.8 in), and is known for being one of the few rattlesnakes which don't have a rattle on the end of their tail. Some Santa Catalina Rattlesnakes are light cream in color with reddish-brown blotches down their back, while some are ash gray with dark gray blotches on them."
Behavior.
"While other rattlesnakes of the genus ""Crotalus"""" are mainly terrestrial (live on land), the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake's small size makes it very good climber. In July, the hottest month on Santa Catalina Island, the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake is found on branches of bushes and trees so they can escape the heat on the ground."
Feeding.
"Since the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake lives mainly in trees, scientist first thought this rattlesnake eats birds, but scientist have now found out that around 70% of the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake's diet is made up of small mammals like the Santa Catalina Deer Mouse, and around 30% is made up of lizards like the Santa Catalina Desert Iguana and the Santa Catalina Side-blotched lizard."

Youth Riding a Rooster (Epiktetos)
Youth Riding a Rooster is a red-figure plate painted by Epiktetos about 520–510 BC. Its diameter measures 7 3/8 in. (18.7 cm). The plate is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It shows a boy riding a rooster. It was a rare subject among ancient artists. It probably references homosexual relations between older men and youths. It also references the practice among Greek males of giving a rooster as a love gift.
"The vase scholar Sir John Beazley wrote in 1918 in ""Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums"" (p. 18): ""The best of [Epiktetos] is in his plates. You cannot draw better, you can only draw differently. Epiktetos' people are all lightness and fairy grace, as if they belonged to a world where passion and pain were unknown, to those 'woods of Athens' where Oberon reigned in the days before 'the middle summer's spring'""."
"The plate was discovered in Vulci in 1828. Twenty years later it became the possession of the second marquess of Northampton. On July 2, 1980, his great-great-grandson, the seventh marquess, sold it with other pottery at Christie's in London."

He finds the palace of a beast who wants to kill him, and makes a deal with the beast, to have his daughter in exchange. The daughter goes to live in the Beast's castle; the two fall in love; and the beast turns into a prince."
"The story has been published and revised in many versions, most notably Madame Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's 1740 retelling and its revision in 1756 by Madame Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont."
"It was the inspiration for many other stories, as well as a 1980s TV series starring Linda Hamilton and Ron Pearlman. Several movies have been based on it, most famously Jean Cocteau's 1946 version and the 1991 animated version by Disney, which was nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award and inspired a long-running Broadway musical."

Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve
"Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve (15 April 1793 – 23 November 1864 (Julian calendar: 11 November)) was a German-born Russian astronomer. He was born in Altona (now an area of Hamburg), Germany, but later lived in Russia. He was an expert on double stars and one of the first astronomers to measure stellar parallax (closely related to the work by Friedrich Bessel)."
"While director of Dorpat Observatory (1817–39) he wrote ""Stellarum Duplicum et Multiplicum"" (1837), which proved that double stars are not exceptional and that star systems are governed by the laws of gravity. Struve added a lot to the study of galactic structure and also engaged in notable geodetic operations such as the triangulation of Livonia and the measurement of an arc of the meridian. In 1839 he became director of the new Pulkovo Observatory and was one of the first three astronomers who almost simultaneously obtained an approximate stellar parallax. (One of the others being Bessel)"
"In 1822 he published the first of many double-star catalogues, the identifying numbers of which are still used today. Struve's stars, however, are now often named in his honor (for example, Struve 2398), whereas the original catalogue prefix was the Greek letter sigma. In 1833 he moved to Russia to set up the Pulkovo Observatory near St. Petersburg, of which he was director until his retirement in 1862, when his son took over in the post. In total, Friedrich Struve produced 272 astronomical works and 18 children; his great-grandson Otto, by contrast, produced 907 works but zero children."
"The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) is an African-American civil rights group. The SCLC was very important in the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King, Jr. was its first president."
"Today, the SCLC says it is ""a nonprofit, non-sectarian, inter-faith, advocacy organization that is committed to nonviolent action to achieve social, economic, and political justice."" This means the group is open to people of all faiths and religions, not just Christians."
Creation.
"The SCLC was created in 1957, after the Civil Rights Movement's successful Montgomery Bus Boycott. On January 10, 1957, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. invited about 60 black pastors and leaders to Atlanta, Georgia. Their goal, at the time, was to end segregation on buses in the Southern United States. However, they agreed that they would only use non-violent ways of protesting and trying to make change. Their motto was: ""Not one hair on one head of one white person shall be harmed."""
"About a month later, the group met again in New Orleans, Louisiana. They decided that their goal would be to end segregation everywhere not just on buses. They also chose Dr. King as their president, and chose the name ""Southern Christian Leadership Conference."""
"The SCLC also chose a group of leaders called the Board of Directors to be in charge of making final decisions and planning strategies. At first, some churches and civil rights organizations joined the SCLC. However, it was difficult to get churches to join. Groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens' Council used violence and terrorism to attack civil rights activists. So did the police in many states. Some churches which joined the SCLC, or did civil rights work, were bombed or set on fire."

"In 1954, civil rights activists started ""Citizenship Schools."" These schools taught African-American adults to read so they could get driver's licenses; fill out forms; open bank accounts; and pass literacy tests that only black people had to pass to sign up to vote. The program spread across the South. They called themselves the ""Highlander Folk School."""
"In 1961, the state of Tennessee took the Highlander Folk School's land and property away. In that year, the SCLC rescued the Citizenship School program. The Schools' teachers pretended to be teaching adults to read. Secretly, they were teaching about democracy, civil rights, leadership, getting people together to protest, politics, and protest strategies. All of these things would be very important in the Civil Rights Movement."
"Eventually, close to 69,000 teachers taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South. Most of these teachers were volunteers who were not paid. Many of the Civil Rights Movement's adult leaders went to or taught Citizenship Schools."
Work in the Civil Rights Movement.
The SCLC's work in the Civil Rights Movement included:
1968-1997.
"Ralph Abernathy became the President of the SCLC after Dr. King's murder. Under his leadership, the SCLC:"
"Abernathy was President until 1977. Joseph Lowery replaced him, and was President until 1997."
1997 today.
"Since 1997, some of the issues the SCLC has worked on include:"
Chivalric romance
"Chivalric romances are stories, poems or songs. They were written about marvel-filled adventures. Knights having heroic qualities went on quests. It is the emphasis on love and courtly manners which distinguishes it from other kinds of epic. Other types of epic are about masculine military heroism."
Romances were written in European languages of the Middle Ages.
"The best known romance was King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is another example."
Comet Swift–Tuttle
Comet Swift–Tuttle (109P/Swift–Tuttle) is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 133 years. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with a period between 20 and 200 years. It was independently discovered by Lewis Swift and Horace Parnell Tuttle in July 1862. It has a well-known orbit and has a comet nucleus 26 km in diameter.
"Chinese records show that in 188 AD the comet reached apparent magnitude 0.1. In 1862, the comet was as bright as Polaris. The comet made a return appearance in 1992, and became visible with binoculars. In 2126 it will be a bright naked-eye comet reaching about apparent magnitude 0.7."
"It is the parent body of the Perseid meteor shower, perhaps the best known shower and among the most reliable in performance."
Near-Earth orbit.
"A close encounter with Earth is predicted for the comet's return to the inner Solar System in the year 4479, around Sept. 15; the closest approach is estimated to be 0.03–0.05 AU, with a probability of impact of 1, or 0.0001%."
"Comet Swift–Tuttle has been described as ""the single most dangerous object known to humanity"". However, the probability of Earth impact per orbit is about a million to one against. It is estimated as 2 (0.000002%). It is the largest Solar System object that makes repeated close approaches to Earth with a relative velocity of 60 km/s."
An unusual aspect of its orbit is that it is captured into a 1:11 orbital resonance with Jupiter; it completes one orbit for every 11 of Jupiter.
Punishment
"Punishment is when something is done to a person (or animal) that they do not like. It may be because they broke a rule. There are many kinds of punishment, from a death penalty for very bad crimes, to things that parents may do to punish children, like spanking them or taking away their toys. People are often sent to prison as punishment for a crime."
Punishment can be seen as good in society to prevent people from doing bad things. It can also be seen as cruel and unnecessary. It can also be seen to do more harm than good.
Om
The two letters OM can mean
Blue whale
"The blue whale (""Balaenoptera musculus"") is a marine mammal of the suborder of baleen whales (called Mysticeti). They grow to be about 30 meters long. The biggest blue whale found was 190 tons and measured 98 feet long. Larger specimens have been measured at 110 feet, but never weighed. This makes blue whales the largest animals ever to be on Earth, even bigger than the largest dinosaurs."
"The blue whale eats mostly very tiny creatures, like krill. These inch-long, shrimp-like crustacean swim in swarms. In the Antarctic summer, there are so many of these krill that they turn the waters orange. A blue whale can eat eight to ten tons of krill every day."
"The blue whale's body is long and slender. It can be various shades of bluish-grey above and somewhat lighter underneath. There are at least three distinct subspecies: ""B. m. musculus"" of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, ""B. m. intermedia"" of the Southern Ocean and ""B. m. brevicauda"" (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. ""B. m. indica"", found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small krill."
"Blue whales were once abundant around the world. In the nineteenth century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers. They were finally protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, located in at least five groups. More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an underestimate. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic group of Blue Whales can be seen in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park near Tadoussac QC, Canada."
Cetacea
"The order Cetacea are marine mammals that live in oceans, seas and even a few rivers around the world. Whales, dolphins and porpoises are part of this group. These common names refer to size: whales are the largest, porpoises the smallest. How and what they eat is a better guide to their relationships. The study of cetaceans is called cetology."
"Cetaceans are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related order Cetartiodactyla because their ancestors were even toed ungulates."
Scottish Gaelic language
"Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig, pronounced ""Gah-lick"") is a Celtic language. It is commonly called just Scots Gaelic in Scottish English. It is a sister language of Irish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic; all three are Goidelic languages. These are related to the Welsh language, Cornish language and the Breton language (these three are Brittonic or Brythonic languages)."
History.
"In past times, the Scottish Gaelic was spoken across all of Scotland except for the Northern Islands (Orkney and Shetland). In the later part of the Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland began to speak Scottish English and looked down on the Scottish Gaelic. After the union of England and Scotland, the Scottish Gaelic was snubbed and looked down on even more, and Scottish English took over."
Today.
"Scottish Gaelic today is basically spoken in the Outer Hebrides and on Skye. Generally speaking, the Scottish Gaelic spoken across the Western Isles is similar enough to be classed as one major dialect group, but there is some regional variation."
"A census in the United Kingdom in 2001 showed that a total of 58,652 (1.2% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) in Scotland could then speak some amount of Scottish Gaelic. Only the Western Isles have more people who can speak the Scottish Gaelic than not (61% of the people there speak Scottish Gaelic). The place in Scotland with the largest percentage of speakers is a village called Barvas on the Isle of Lewis, where, 74.7% of the people there speak Scottish Gaelic."
"Children in Scotland do not have to learn Scottish Gaelic in schools, but it is becoming a more popular subject as Scottish Gaelic is an important part of their Scottish culture."
"Scottish Gaelic is also used overseas. It is estimated that 1,000–2,000 in Nova Scotia, Canada, can speak some Scottish Gaelic."
Scottish language
Scottish language can mean:
West Germanic languages
"The West Germanic Languages are a branch of Germanic languages first spoken in Central Europe and the British Isles. The branch has three parts: the North Sea Germanic languages, the Weser-Rhine Germanic languages, and the Elbe Germanic languages. The most spoken languages in the branch are English, German, and Dutch."
Legends.
The Moirang Shayon legends from the backbone of the Moirang Kangleirol.
"""Moirang Shayon"" (lit. ""Moirang incarnations"") is a genre of the seven incarnations of a God and a Goddess, induced under the direction of Lord Thangjing, in the ancient Moirang kingdom."
The list of the seven pairs of incarnations are:
Habutae
"Habutae is a type of silk. There are different kinds of ""habutae"" silk such as plain or striped ""habutae"". ""Habutae"" is traditionally used for kimono and undershirts. Recently, it is also used for general goods, works of art, and clothing. ""Habutae"" is smooth to touch, glossy, and soft. It has been said ""The quality of silk fabric begins with habutae and ends with it."" ""Fukui"" is a suitable region to produce ""habutae"" as the dryness and wetness of the air are well-balanced throughout the whole year."
History.
"In 1871, Kimimasa Yuri, who was a lord of ""Fukui"" Domain (region), brought some silk goods from Europe to Fukui when he joined a study tour in Europe. He showed the goods to people who studied silks in ""Fukui"" and they started doing technical research on weaving ""habutae"". In 1887, basic technology for weaving ""habutae"" silk was completed in ""Fukui"" city. The economic boom of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and World War I boosted progress and production of ""habutae"" in ""Fukui"". In the early 1900s, production of ""habutae"" in Fukui earned 1.7 million dollars, up to 60% of the total exports of ""habutae"" in Japan. The demand for ""habutae"" made in ""Fukui"" has kept increasing in Japan, and it is still used in many kinds of daily goods such as clothing."
Weaving Process.
"Most of the process of making Fukui ""habutae"" silk is the same as the process of making ""habutae"" in other areas, but the weaving process of Fukui ""habutae"" silk is different from the weaving process of ""habutae"" in other areas. Also, the weaving process is the most important part of making Fukui ""habutae"" silk. Fukui ""habutae"" silk is made in a process called ""nureyoko(濡れ横)"". ""Nureyoko"" is a weaving method of weaving warps and wefts which is the two basic components of weaving thread into fabric after wetting wefts with water. Threads are made from raw silks that are imported from other countries such as China and Brazil. This process makes the cloth tight, elastic, and strong. It takes one day to weave 20 meters of ""habutae""."

National Diet Building
"The National Diet Building (国会議事堂, Kokkai-gijidō) is the building where both houses of the Japan's government, the Diet, meet. It is located at Nagatachō 1-chome 7–1, Chiyoda, Tokyo."
Sessions of the House of Representatives take place in the left wing and sessions of the House of Councillors in the right wing.
"The Diet Building was completed in 1936 and is made of only Japanese materials, except for the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system."
History.
"Plans for a Diet building began in 1881. The planners hoped to finish it by 1890, when the Diet would meet for the first time. They realized they could not build a very impressive building in time, so they decided to make temporary buildings at first. The first Diet building was a Western-style building made of wood. It burned down in 1891. Another wooden building was made and finished in 1891. It burned down in 1925. A third building was made. The Diet used it until 1936, when the current Diet building was finished."
Current Diet building.
"In 1910, the Finance Ministry started a planning group to take control over the new Diet Building design from the Home Ministry. Prime Minister Katsura Tarō chaired the commission, which recommended that the new building should be made in the Italian Renaissance architectural style. Many other people did not like this idea."
"The ministry had a public design competition in 1918. 118 architect teams sent designs. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, produced a design similar to Ende and Böckmann's."
"The Diet Building was built between 1920 and 1936 with a floor plan based on Fukuzo's entry. The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they mixed European and East Asian architecture. The actual source for the ""Pyramid"" roof remains unclear, but Japanese historian Jonathan Reynolds suggests it might have come from from Shinshichi. Historian of Africa studies Zoe Strother says Shinshichi's design resembles the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was a model for some prominent Western designs in the early 1900s, such as John Russell Pope's 1911 award-winning House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. and the downtown Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928."

Panthoibi Khongul
"Panthoibi Khongul ()(literally, ""in quest of Panthoibi"" or ""Panthoibi's footprint""), also spelt as Panthoipi Khongkul, is an ancient Meitei literary work (puya), narrating about the quest of goddess Panthoibi. The text highlights the love saga of Panthoibi and her ultimate lover Nongpok Ningthou, after leaving her husband's house. Many scholars believe the work to be written during the 12th century AD."
The text also talks about how the festival Lai Haraoba was begun after the union of the two lovers.
Khongjomnubi Nongarol
Demonic is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Testament. It was released in 1997. The lyrics deal with occult themes more like their 1980s efforts instead of the political topics covered on more recent releases.
"Musically, Testament takes a slower, almost death metal oriented approach with grinding guitar riffs and Chuck Billy's vocal work consisting primarily of death growls."
"This album also marked the first time, as Testament, that the band used the old Legacy pentagram graphic."

Rainbow (band)
"Rainbow (also known as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow or Blackmore's Rainbow) were an English hard rock band, controlled by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore from 1975 to 1984 and 1994 to 1997. It was originally established with former Elf members, though over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. In addition to lead singers Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet, Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White, the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neo-classical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group."
"Rainbow was ranked #90 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock""."
New Taiwan dollar
"The New Taiwan dollar () (currency code TWD and common abbreviation NT$), or simply Taiwan dollar, is the official currency of Taiwan. It was used since 1949, when it replaced the Old Taiwan dollar. It was first printed by the Bank of Taiwan, it has been printed by the Central Bank of the Republic of China since 2000."
Crown of thorns
"The crown of thorns (also known as Christ plant, or Christ thorn, called Corona de Cristo in Latin America) is a woody, succulent species of Euphorbia native to Madagascar. The species name commemorates Baron Milius, once governor of Réunion, who introduced the species to France in 1821. It is suspected that the species was introduced to the Middle East in ancient times, and legend associates it with the crown of thorns worn by Jesus."
Joseph Romm
"Joseph J. Romm (born June 27, 1960) is an American physicist, writer and environmentalist. He has an interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. He is also interested in energy security through energy efficiency and green energy technologies."
"Romm's 2006 book was """"."
"In December 2008, Romm was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In March 2009, ""Rolling Stone"" magazine named Romm as one of ""100 People Who Are Changing America"". In September 2009, ""Time"" magazine named him one of its ""Heroes of the Environment""."
A Child of Our Time
A Child of Our Time is an oratorio by Michael Tippett. It was composed between 1939 and 1941.
Why Tippett wrote this oratorio.
"Tippett composed this oratorio at the beginning of World War II. He had already lived through World War I and he was very upset about all the evil in this world. He wanted to write a musical work about it. He did it by taking the story of the beginning of World War II as a basis of the oratorio, but he also made the work speak in general about the evil of this world."
"In 1938 a 17 year old Jewish boy Hershel Grynspan, who lived in Paris, desperately wanted to attack the Nazis because of the cruel way his parents in Germany had been treated. He therefore murdered a Nazi diplomat in France. The Nazi’s in Germany were so furious that they attacked and murdered lots of Jews in Germany. This terrible attack became known as the ""Kristallnacht"". This series of events can be found in the words of Tippett’s oratorio. Tippett wrote the words himself."
"The title comes from Ödön von Horváth’s novel, ""Ein Kind unserer Zeit"" (A Child of Our Time), written in 1938 and published in English in 1939. Tippett began composing it on 5 September 1939, two days after Britain declared war against Germany."
"In 1958 Tippett arranged the five negro spirituals so that they could be sung by unaccompanied chorus. They are often performed like that, separately from the oratorio."
"Tippett uses a similar structure to the Passions of Bach. This meant that he used a narrator (like the evangelist in Bach’s Passions) who tells the story. Instead of Bach’s Lutheran chorales he adds five negro spirituals which add an emotional comment to the events. The music of these spirituals blend very cleverly into the style of Tippett’s music. The whole oratorio, which lasts a little over one hour, has three parts. This idea is based on the three parts of Handel's ""Messiah"". Tippett calls the three parts: 1) Prophecy; 2) Narrative; 3) Meditation."
The story in the oratorio.
Part One.
"Part one opens with a picture of the world in darkness. The alto solo shows what the person’s soul is feeling. The bass (narrator) tells of the purges in Russia, the lynching in the USA, the terrible poverty in Britain. The chorus tell of their despair."
Bristle
"A bristle is a stiff hair or feather. Also used are synthetic materials such as nylon in items such as brooms and sweepers. Bristles are often used to make brushes for cleaning uses: common examples are the toothbrush and toilet brush. The bristle brush is a common household cleaning tool, often used to remove dirt or grease from pots and pans."
Le Roy le veult
"""Le Roy le veult"" (""The King wills it"") or ""La Reyne le veult"" (""The Queen wills it"") is a Norman French line used in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to show that a public or private bill has received Royal Assent from the Monarch."
History.
"The practice of giving Royal Assent came from William the Conqueror to show that the King intended for something to be made law. Norman French came to be used as the normal language of the educated classes and of the law, though Latin continued to be used with it. The work of the Parliament of England was conducted entirely in French until the latter part of Edward III's reign (1327–1377) and English was only rarely used before the reign of Henry VI (1422–61, 1470–71). Royal Assent was sometimes given in English, though more often in French. The practice of recording Parliamentary statutes in French or Latin stopped by 1488 and statutes have been published in English ever since."
"During the period of the Protectorate, when the Lord Protector (Oliver Cromwell and later his son Richard) governed the country, assent was given in English. The old practice of giving assent in Norman French was resumed following the Restoration in 1660 and has continued ever since. There has only been one attempt to remove it, when the House of Lords passed a bill in 1706 ""for abolishing the use of the French tongue in all proceedings in Parliament and courts of justice."" The bill failed to pass the House of Commons. Although the use of French in courts was later abolished in 1731, Parliament's practice was not affected."
Usage.
"The line is used to show that the Monarch has granted their Royal Assent to a bill in order to make it become law. It is used by the Clerk of the Parliaments in the House of Lords. It is only used after the Lord Chancellor with the Lords Commissioners, has read out the Letters patent for the bill. The Clerk of the Crown then reads out the short title of the bill and the Clerk of the Parliament responds by saying the line 19 times towards the House of Commons at the bar of the House. The line is also written on the paper of the bill to show that the Monarch granted Royal Assent to the bill."
"The line has been used wrongly on other bills, same as the wrong line has also been used for government bills. There are a few occasions where this has happened, most notably on the Act of Supremacy 1558 where """"Soit fait comme il est désiré"", the line used for personal bills, was used instead of ""La Reyne le veult""."
"If the Royal Assent is refused, the line ""Le Roy / La Reyne s'avisera"""" would be used, though in practice no British monarch since Queen Anne has not given royal assent since a dispute over militia in Scotland in 1707."
George Herriman
"George Joseph Herriman (August 22, 1880 – April 25, 1944) was an American cartoonist. He is best known for his comic strip ""Krazy Kat"" (1913–1944)."
Sam Champion
"Samuel James ""Sam"" Champion (born August 13, 1961) is the weather anchor of ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and weather editor of ABC News. Champion was born in Paducah, Kentucky. He has a B.A. in broadcast journalism from Eastern Kentucky University. He worked on ""Good Morning America"" as a weatherman, making reportedly $1.5 million per year. On April 7, 2012, he debuted as host of ""Sea Rescue"", an educational and informational television program that focuses on the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of animals back into the wild."
"Champion is active in many charitable organizations in the New York City area including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, March of Dimes, and ""Stopping AIDS Together"". He co-hosted the New York City Project's 2002 ""Courage Awards"". On 20 February 2013 ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported that a former Mets teammate of baseball player Mike Piazza's said in 2000 that Piazza and Champion were involved in a homosexual relationship. Piazza denied this in 2002. Champion and his longtime partner Rubem Robierb were married on December 21, 2012."
"Champion left ""Good Morning America"" in December 2013, and later moved to The Weather Channel hosting ""AMHQ"" from March 2014 until October 2015."

Pokémon Black and White
"Pokémon Black Version and White Version are two role-playing games (RPGs) in the ""Pokémon"" series made by Game Freak for the Nintendo DS. The games were released in Japan on September 18, 2010, in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011, and in Australia on March 10, 2011. The games have 156 new Pokémon, which brings the total to 649. These games introduce the largest amount of Pokémon in any generation."
Gameplay.
"""Pokémon Black"" and ""White"" are role-playing games where the player captures creatures called Pokémon. They can use them to battle against other Pokémon. One of the new features in the games are triple battles, which allows players to battle three Pokémon against three Pokémon. Alongside triple battles are Rotation Battles. Players still send out three Pokémon, but only one can battle at a time. The player can switch the position of their Pokémon during their turn. Also new is that the seasons change, and areas in the game have falling leaves in the fall, and snow in the winter."
Plot.
"""Pokémon Black"" and ""White"" take place in the Unova region, which is based on New York City and its surrounding area, unlike past games being based on regions of Japan. The plot of the game follows a new Pokémon trainer who is on a journey to become a Pokémon master. They do this by battling other trainers such as Gym Leaders, and finally the Elite Four. During this journey, the player meets an evil team known as Team Plasma, who look like knights. Team Plasma wants to make a new world where Pokémon are away from humans. After taking them down, the player must track down the first members, the Seven Sages, and battle them."
Adolf Anderssen
"Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (Breslau, 6 July 1818 – Breslau, 13 March 1879) was a German chess master, and a teacher of mathematics. He was recognised as the best player in the world for much of the time between 1851 and 1870."
"Anderssen won three great international tournaments: the first in London 1851, then London 1862 and Baden-Baden 1870. Anderssen lost matches in 1858 to Paul Morphy and, narrowly, to Steinitz in 1866. He was also a chess problem composer.p16"
"Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the Baden-Baden 1870 tournament, which is comparable to modern strong GM tournaments. His last success was at Leipzig in 1877 where he came second equal with Zukertort, behind Paulsen. He was then nearly 60."
"He is still famous for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the 'Immortal Game' (1851) and the 'Evergreen Game' (1852). He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration."
His status.
"Anderssen was never world champion because ""there was as yet no concept of a formal championship, or of the means by which one might be awarded... The world championship proper was the creation of Wilhelm Steinitz (18361900)... The first match for the world championship was in 1886""... Also: ""Wilhelm Steinitz... was the first person to use the title of Champion of the world...""."
Mathematician.
"Anderssen was a teacher of mathematics in Breslau (now Wroclaw). He became a professor in about 1862, and in January 1865 was awarded honorary degrees of PhD and MA. These honours were not for chess, but not much is known about the teaching part of his career."
Bayesian network
"A Bayesian network is a kind of graph which is used to model events that cannot be observed. This can then be used for inference. The graph that is used is directed, and does not contain any cycles. The nodes of the graph represent random variables. If two nodes are connected by an edge, it has an associated probability that it will transmit from one node to the other."
"Bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of (unassisted) machine learning. They have been used where information needs to be classified. Examples are image, document, or speech recognition, and information retrieval."
It is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes' discovery in the 1740s called Bayes' theorem.
History.
"The term ""Bayesian networks"" was made by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize three aspects:"
"In the late 1980s, the seminal texts ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems"" and ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems"" summarized the properties of Bayesian networks and helped to establish Bayesian networks as a field of study."
"Informal variants of such networks were first used by legal scholar John Henry Wigmore, in the form of Wigmore charts, to analyse trial evidence in 1913. Another variant, called path diagrams, was developed by the geneticist Sewall Wright and used in social and behavioral sciences (mostly with linear parametric models)."
African plate
"The African Plate is a major tectonic plate. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as the oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Since the continent of Africa includes the African Plate and the smaller plates to its right, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole."
"Between 60 million years ago (mya) and 10 mya, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift."
One hypothesis suggests a mantle plume beneath the Afar region. Another hypothesis suggests the rifting is just a zone of weakness as the plates to its east move northwards.
The African Plate's speed is about per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate. There is subduction where oceanic crust meets continental crust (in parts of the central and eastern Mediterranean).
"Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate."
"The African, Somali and Arabian Plates were once all part of the great southern supercontinent Gondwana, as was the Indian subcontinent."
OpenStep
"OpenStep was an operating system by NeXT. It is an x86 version of the NeXTStep operating system, which was also by NeXT."
Rhapsody (operating system)
"Rhapsody was the name given to Apple Computer's next-generation operating system. Apple got the Rhapsody operating system when they bought NeXT Inc. from Steve Jobs for $425 million. The same year Apple released Rhapsody to software developers so they could create versions of their software for the next release of the Apple operating system. But a key software vendor, Adobe Systems, did not like Apple's plan for the new OS. Without Adobe supporting them Apple decided not to go ahead with Rhapsody. Rhapsody was replaced by OS X, scheduled for 1999."
Palmchat
"The palmchat (""Dulus dominicus"") is a small passerine bird. It is the national bird of the Dominican Republic."
Arabian bustard
"The Arabian bustard (""Ardeotis arabs"") is a bird native to North Africa and the Middle East. It lives in the Sahel region (Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan), South Sudan, Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen."
"As in all bustards, the male Arabian bustard is much larger than the female. Males have been found to weigh , while females weigh . The record-sized male Arabian bustard weighed . These birds stand from tall in females to tall in males."
National Bohemian
"National Bohemian Beer is an American beer first made in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a premium Bohemian-style beer. Many people call it ""Natty Boh"" as a nickname."
History.
"In 1885, the National Brewing Company created National Bohemian beer. The first factory was in Baltimore, Maryland. The brewing stopped from 1920 to 1933 due to Prohibition. This was the period when nobody could drink alcohol in the US. In 1933 under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the factory of Natty Boh opened again. During the 1940s the factory of National Bohemian was the first in the US to adopt the six pack. In the 1970s, the Hoffberger family sold the brand name. During the next three decades, the brand of this beer was bought and sold by different companies. The copyright of the beer was purchased first by Stroh, then by G. Heileman Brewing, and then by Pabst, in 1999. Since the Hoffberger family sold the beer it has been brewed in North Carolina. From 1996 until 2011, National Bohemian wasn’t available directly from the bar, but only by cans or bottles. In 2014, an American citizen born in Russia, Eugene Kashper, bought the entire Pabst Company, so also National Bohemian."
Relationship with Baltimore.
"Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger, Natty Boh was first associated with the city of Baltimore. In 1953, Jerold Hoffberger helped to bring the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore where they became the Baltimore Orioles. He made National Bohemian the main sponsor of the baseball team. About twelve years later Hoffberger bought the team. Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the Orioles won two World Series and four American League pennants. Nattty Boh was served at the stadium. This was the period when National Bohemian became the beer of Baltimore because people identified the Orioles’ wins with the beer. Although the beer is not brewed in Maryland anymore, 95% of sales are still in Baltimore. This is why is it called ""the beer of Maryland""."
Mr. Boh.
"In 1933, the logo of this beer, Mr. Boh, was introduced. Mr. Boh is a one-eyed man with a black mustache. Thanks to the popularity achieved by National Bohemian with the Orioles, Mr. Boh became a symbol of Baltimore. His big face is still visible at the top of the old building where it was once brewed. Through the years, people started collecting gadgets with the logo of National Bohemian. Around Baltimore, several pubs serve Natty Boh as the main beer. These pubs are decorated with different gadgets of Mr. Boh."
Service animal
"He was born on 9 January 1834 at Courtfield, Ross, Herefordshire, England, second son of the fourteen children. Five of his brothers also became priests. Herbert, the eldest, became a cardinal and archbishop of Westminster, and John, the youngest, auxiliary bishop of Salford. Another brother, Reginald, married Julia Shanahan, sister-in-law of Sir Patrick Jennings. Four of his five sisters became nuns."
"Because of his health he was educated at home in a religious atmosphere. In 1850 he was sent to St Gregory's College at Downside near Bath. His mother's death in 1853 made him think of a religious life and on 12 September he joined the Benedictines, becoming Brother Bede. In 1855 at his father's request and expense, he was sent to Rome for further study under the guidance of the Italian scholar and reformer, Angelo Zelli-Jacuzzi. He was ordained priest by Cardinal Patrizi in the basilica of St John Lateran on 9 April 1859."
Neighborhood of Make-Believe
"The Neighborhood of Make-Believe is the fictional kingdom where hand puppet lived in. They were characters on the children's television series ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" which aired on PBS, from 1968–2001. Principal puppeteer Fred Rogers created many of the puppet characters in the 1950s for Josie Carey's program, ""The Children's Corner"". It was filmed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
Characters in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe were portrayed by both hand puppets operated by puppeteers and actors. They would occasionally talk to the viewers in specific episodes.
There is a TV show about the Neighborhood called Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.

Allen Dulles
"Allen Welsh Dulles (April 7, 1893 – January 29, 1969) was an American diplomat and lawyer who became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). He was its longest-serving director so far."
"Dulles was head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War. He oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, Operation Ajax, the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dulles was one of the members of the Warren Commission."
"Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer. His older brother, John Foster Dulles, was the Secretary of State during the Eisenhower Administration."
Exosome complex
"The exosome complex is a protein complex which can degrade RNA strands (~stop them working). In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus."
"The core of the complex has a ring structure consisting of six proteins that all belong to the same class of RNases, the 'RNase PH-like proteins'."
"Exosome complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea. In bacteria a simpler complex called the ""degradosome"" carries out similar functions."
Royal National Lifeboat Institution
"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is an agency which rescues people at sea in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, as well as on some large rivers."
"The RNLI is a charity. Two-thirds of its funding comes from money left in people's wills. Most of its crew members are volunteers. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and 444 lifeboats. These are boats that travel from the shore to rescue people at sea, rather than lifeboats that are used for escaping from a ship. Their crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. The RNLI also provides beach lifeguards and flood rescue teams."
"The RNLI cannot be called for help directly. In the event that someone is in danger at sea, the coastguard of the country or territory should be called on 999 or 112. The coastguard organize the search for those in danger. They will then call the RNLI if their help is needed. Not all lifeboats in the UK and Ireland are run by the RNLI; there are some independent lifeboat agencies."
Puppeteer
"A puppeteer is a person who makes an inanimate object that might be shaped like a human, animal, legendary creature, or another object to create the illusion that the puppet is ""alive"". The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs."

Guilt (law)
"In criminal law, a person is guilty if a court has decided they have done something illegal. If a person has broken a law by stealing, for example, they are guilty of a crime."
A person is guilty if a court says they are. The court has blamed them for doing something wrong. A guilty person is punished. The punishment is called the sentence.
Length
"Length is a measurement. A ruler can measure length. The length of something is the distance between two ends of the thing. Short means a small length. Long means much length. Short and long are opposites. For two dimensional things, length is usually the longer side."
Length of Time.
Length also describes time.
Time Example.
"John sits down at one o'clock, or 1h. John waits until three o'clock, or 3h. John stands up at three o'clock, or 3h. John was sitting for 2 hours. The length of time John was sitting was two hours."
Weight
"The weight of an object (or the weight of an amount of matter) is the measure of the intensity of the force imposed on this object by the local gravitational field. Weight should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of mass. For small objects on Earth, the weight force is directed towards the center of the planet. For larger objects, such as the Moon orbiting around the Earth, the force is directed towards the center of mass of the combined system."
"In common language, the weight of something is typically understood to be the value measured at or near the Earth's surface. Unfortunately the common terms used to describe the weight of an object are units of mass such as kilograms or pounds. For almost all of human history, weight has been measured on the surface of the Earth. Here, the weight is proportional to the mass. Objects which have the same mass have the same weight. An object with the twice the mass of another will also have twice the weight. As a consequence it is common practice to use the two words, mass and weight, as if they mean the same thing and to use kilograms and pounds as the units for both mass and weight. Using the same terms to describe and measure the two different properties has led to confusion between these two properties, mass and weight. Mass and weight are not the same thing."
Units of weight.
"The unit of weight in the International System of Units is the newton, which is represented by the symbol 'N'."
"Other units have been in use in the past but have been abandoned, such as the dyne (the unit of force in the old CGS system) or the kilogram-force, which is the force exerted on a"
kilogram of matter by a 'standard' Earth: a body with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 9.81 N at sea level.
Measuring weight.
"The weight of an object, or of an amount of matter, is typically measured with an instrument such as a spring scale. The scale includes a spring which provides a force to oppose the gravitational force on the object which is being weighed. The gravitational force pulls down, the spring pushes or pulls upwards. Typically, the scale has a readout which gives not the weight (which is a force) but rather the mass of the object. Spring scales are made with the assumption that they are being used on the surface of the Earth. If a spring scale was taken to the Moon it would give a misleading reading."
A balance style weighing scale is a device that compares the weights of two object in the same gravitational field: it determines whether one object is heavier or lighter than the other.
Weight is variable.
Weight is not an intrinsic property of matter because the local gravitational field that generates the force called weight is variable in space and time:
Truth
The truth is what is true. It may be everything that is true (reality) or just a part of it (a fact). It may also be a statement that is true: a truth. Things or statements that are not true are untrue or false. True things exist (or have existed); false things do not (or never have).
"Aristotle said: ""To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true."" However, a statement may be about how things once were; this would be a true statement if it is clear that it is not a statement about how things are now. Most often, the tense of the verb will indicate this, but there may be other ways in which the statement is qualified: for example, by saying when the statement was true."
"Truth is a noun, and the corresponding adjective is true. The word ""true"" also functions as a noun, a verb and an adverb. The English word ""truth"" is from Old English ""tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ"", Middle English ""trewþe""."
Most of the discussion on truth is about one of two things:
Many philosophers have given opinions on these issues.

Hurricane Ida (2009)
"Hurricane Ida was the last storm in the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed in the southwestern Caribbean on November 4 after being in that area for a few days. After becoming a depression it quickly got stronger and became a tropical storm and a hurricane shortly before it struck Nicaragua. Over Central America, Hurricane Ida weakened very fast, becoming downgraded to a tropical depression before the end of the day on November 5."
"By November 6, Ida went back into the Caribbean and later became a hurricane again. Its strength changed a few times before it died on November 10 off the coast of Alabama. Reports show that Hurricane Ida caused $5.6 million in damage and caused 2 deaths."
Storm history.
"Ida was tracked back to a tropical wave that entered the western Caribbean Sea on November 1. A low soon formed near the tropical wave. This low did not move very much and it also got a lot of clouds near the middle of it. There was hardly any wind shear, which allowed for more clouds to form."
"On November 4, the tropical wave National Hurricane Center began call it Tropical Depression Eleven. The new tropical depression quickly got stronger and became Tropical Storm Ida soon after that. An Aircraft went into Ida and soon found winds at 65 miles per hour, which meant it was nearly a hurricane."
"Continuing to the northwest, Tropical Storm Ida was upgraded to Hurricane Ida when winds got to 80 miles per hour; at the time, it was put at only 75 miles per hour. Soon after this, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Nicaragua on November 5. Ida weakened quickly over land and was downgraded to a tropical storm just after landfall. Near the end of the day on November 5, Tropical Storm Ida weakened to a tropical depression."
"Tropical Depression Ida survived its passage over land and went back into the Caribbean on November 6. Over the western Caribbean, it quickly became a tropical storm again. After moving north, Tropical Storm Ida became a hurricane again. &lt;ref name=""update11/7/09""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its highest winds on November 8 while it crossed between Cuba and Mexico; they were measured at 105 miles per hour, making it a category 2 hurricane. Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were not warm enough to keep Ida at this strength. so it quickly weakened back to a tropical storm."
"For only six hours, it became a hurricane again before it became extratropical on November 10 while it was just south of Alabama. At the time, it looked like it stayed as a tropical storm and made landfall in Alabama, this was later noted as incorrect. Its remnants formed a strong nor'easter that affected some of the states of the East Coast of the United States."
Impact.
"Damage in Nicaragua was near $2.1 million and there were no people killed. In El Salvador, it seemed at first that killed over 100 people, this was discovered as a mistake later on."

The Rugby Championship
"The Rugby Championship is an annual rugby union competition between the national teams of the sport's four strongest Southern Hemisphere nations—New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Argentina. It began in 1996, a year after the sport became professional, as the Tri Nations. At the time, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa competed for the Tri Nations Trophy. Beginning in 2012, Argentina joined the competition."
"During the Tri Nations era, the contest began in July, during the Southern Hemisphere winter, and ran through September. For most of that era, each team played every other team twice, once at home and once away. Later on, each team played the others three times. When the competition added Argentina, it returned to a pure home-and-away format, with a total of 12 games played. Also, due to a slight change in the sport's calendar, The Rugby Championship now begins in August and runs through October. This format is used except in years in which the Rugby World Cup is played (every four years, in the year before the Summer Olympics). In those years, each team plays the others only once, with a total of six games played."
"Teams are awarded competition points for a win, but can also earn 'bonus' points. At the end of the series, the team with the most competition points wins the trophy. The team that wins the competition is usually considered to be the best rugby union team in the Southern Hemisphere for that year."

TNA King of the Mountain Championship
"The TNA King of the Mountain Championship is a professional wrestling championship in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). The championship was debuted on the October 23, 2008 episode of ""TNA Impact!"" and was originally called the ""TNA Legends Championship"". It was considered the second highest-ranking title in TNA. It was declared defunct by the (storyline) TNA Executive Director Kurt Angle on July 3, 2014. The title was reactivated under the new name ""TNA King of the Mountain Championship"" on June 25, 2015."
History.
"Booker T revealed the championship after he took it out of a steel briefcase that he had been carrying around in the weeks leading up to the reveal. He named it the ""TNA Legends Championship"" and declared himself as the first champion. A.J. Styles defeated Booker T at Destination X on March 15, 2009 to win the championship."
"Winning the title made Styles the first-ever TNA Grand Slam Champion after he had won the World Heavyweight (NWA or TNA), the World Tag Team (NWA or TNA), and the TNA X Division Championship along with the Legends Championship. The Management Director of TNA Jim Cornette announced that the Championship became an official TNA sanctioned championship because Styles defeated Booker T for it legally by the contract the two had signed to make the match official."
"When Eric Young held the championship, he renamed it the ""TNA Global Championship"" on the October 29, 2009 episode of ""Impact!"" and said that he was not going to defend it against any American wrestlers or on American soil. Young was defeated by Rob Terry during a live event in Cardiff, Wales on January 27, 2010."
"Terry lost the championship to A.J. Styles on the July 22 episode of ""Impact!"". Styles renamed it the ""TNA Television Championship"" on the July 29 episode."
"On July 3, 2014, the TNA Executive Director Kurt Angle declared that the Television Championship would become inactive."
"On June 25, 2015, the championship was reactivated under the new name ""TNA King of the Mountain Championship."" It was announced by TNA that there would be a new champion crowned in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary.

Fight or flight response
"The fight-or-flight response (or acute stress response) is a set of physiological changes that occur when an animal is threatened. The changes include increased heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure."
This response was first described by W.B Cannon. He found that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system. This leads to changes such as those mentioned above. The changes prepare the animal for fighting or fleeing. This response is the first stage of a general adaptation that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms.
Evolutionary perspective.
"Since the ovules are protected by carpels, it takes something special for fertilisation to happen. Angiosperms have pollen grains made of just three cells. One cell drills down through the integuments, to make a passage for the two sperm cells to flow down. The megagametophyte is a tiny haploid female plant which includes the egg. It has just seven cells. Of these, one is the egg cell; it fuses with a sperm cell, forming the zygote. Another cell joins with the other sperm, and forms a nutrient-rich endosperm. The other cells take auxiliary roles. This process of ""double fertilisation"" is unique, and is common to all angiosperms."
Evolution of flowers.
"Flowers are modified leaves. They are only present in flowering plants (angiosperms), which are relatively late to appear in the fossil record."
"Early fossils of flowers and flowering plants are known from 130 million years ago, in the Lower Cretaceous. However, flowers had a much longer history, the extent of which is not yet fully known. There were flowers from the early Jurassic, 50 million years earlier than was previously thought."
"The flowering plants were thought to have evolved from within the gymnosperms. However, the known gymnosperms are a clade which is distinct from the angiosperms. Apparently, the two clades diverged (split) some 300 million years ago. That is about the boundary of the Carboniferous period with the Permian period."
Uses of flowers.
As decoration.
"Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists."
As a name.
"Some parents name their children, most often girls, after a flower. Some common flower names are: Rose, Lily, Daisy, Holly, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Blossom."
As food.
"People eat some types of flowers. Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Dandelion can be made into wine."
"Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named by the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers, such as chrysanthemum, rose, and jasmine, can be used to make tea."
Special meanings.
"Flowers were used to signal meanings in the time when social meetings between men and women was difficult. Lilies made people think of life. Red roses made people think of love, beauty, and passion. In Britain, Australia and Canada, poppies are worn on special holidays as a mark of respect for those who served and died in wars. Daisies made people think of children and innocence."

Square kilometre
"A square kilometer (sometimes written ""km²"") is based on the SI unit of measurement of area, the ""square meter"". It is the area inside a square that has each side equal to 1 kilometer (1000 meters). This way of talking about area is often used to say how much land there is, on a farm or in a city, for example."
One square kilometer is just less than 0.39 square miles.
Judge
A judge is a person who is in control of a court of law.
"The way to become a judge depends on each country. In some countries, judges must work with the law (often as a lawyer) for a number of years before they can ""sit as a judge"" in a courthouse. Judges are supposed to conduct the trial in an open courtroom and impartially."
"In many English speaking countries, judges cannot make some decisions on their own. In these countries, juries are used, but not for all cases. The modern jury trial first developed in mid-12th century England during the reign of Henry II. Today, the details differ between one country and another."
"If there is a jury, the judge has the job of making sure the person taken to court is treated in a fair way. Some courts will have more than one judge. For important decisions about the laws of a country, countries may have a ""supreme court"" or ""high court"" with many (nine or more) judges in it. In the United States, judges on a supreme court are called ""justices"" and are led by a ""Chief Justice""."
"In many countries, judges wear special clothes while being in court. Often this is a black robe or cloak. Supreme or High Court judges often wear a red cloak. Judges in some countries also wear a special long wig. They also used to put a piece of black material on their head when they sentenced a person to die."
The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.
Led Zeppelin
"Led Zeppelin was an English rock band. The group was started in 1968 and broke up in 1980. The members were Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (lead guitar), John Paul Jones (bass), and John Bonham (drums). Led Zeppelin ended in 1980 after the accidental death of John Bonham. After Bonham's death, the band believed that nobody could take his place and decided not to continue. The band played together again in a tribute concert in London on 10 December 2007 with Jason Bonham, John's son, playing the drums. The band is one of the most influential rock bands of all time and one of the most successful music artists in history, selling 300 million albums around the world."
USB flash drive
"A USB flash drive (USB stands for ""Universal Serial Bus"") is a popular way to store digital information. Flash drives are an easy way to share data (information). A USB flash drive can be attached to a USB port, and provides a certain amount of storage space, which can be used to store data. USB flash drives are used with devices found in homes, workplaces and schools. Below are some examples of these devices:"
"They are called ""flash drive"" because they use flash memory to store files. Flash memory is a type of computer chip. The first flash drives had 8 megabytes of storage. Each year, larger flash drives will become available. In April 2012, 256 gigabyte flash drives were introduced to the market."
"Other common names for a flash drive include jumpdrive, pendrive, thumbdrive or simply USB."
"USB flash drives have some advantages over other portable storage devices. They are physically much smaller and more rugged than floppy disks. They can read data faster, and store more data than floppy disks. Floppy disks have become obsolete when the price of USBs has become cheaper."
Uses.
"Flash drives are used to store any type of data file, or to move data from one computer to another. USB flash drives have a lot of storage space. It is often easier to use a flash drive than to carry many CD-ROMs. Some computer programs can be run from a USB flash drive. These special versions of programs are called ""portable"" versions."
"Computer administrators, or people who manage the computer systems, sometimes use flash drives. Sometimes flash drives are also used to run a computer virus scanner. They are often used to repair a computer system that was damaged or faulty."
Police in the cyber division can use flash drives to take evidence.
Booting operating systems.
Most computers today can boot from a USB drive. Special operating systems can run from a bootable flash drive. They are called Live USB versions.
Audio players.
Many companies make small digital audio players (usually called an mp3 player). These are actually flash drives that can make sound. Examples include the Creative MuVo and the iPod shuffle. Some of these players are real USB flash drives as well as music players; others just play music.
Many of the smallest players are powered by a permanently fitted rechargeable battery. The battery power can be charged from the USB port.
Music storage and marketing.
Digital audio files can be moved from one computer to another. The files can be played on a software media player. Many home and car music systems have a USB port. A USB flash drive can be connected to play music files.
"Music artists have sold or given away USB flash drives. The first time this happened was in 2004—the German band WIZO released the ""Stick EP"", only as a USB drive. It contained five high quality MP3s; it also included a video, pictures, lyrics, and guitar tablature."
"Since then, artists including Kanye West, Nine Inch Nails and Ayumi Hamasaki have released music and promotional material on USB flash drives."
In arcades.
"In the arcade game ""In the Groove"" and ""In The Groove 2"", flash drives are used to transfer high scores, screenshots, dance edits, and combos throughout sessions. In later versions, players can also store custom songs and play them on any machine on which this feature is enabled. While use of flash drives is common, the drive must be Linux compatible, causing problems for some players."
"In the arcade games ""Pump it Up NX2"" and ""Pump it Up NX Absolute"", a specially produced flash drive is used as a ""save file"" for unlocked songs, as well as progressing in the WorldMax and Brain Shower sections of the game."
"In the arcade game ""Dance Dance Revolution X"", a special USB flash drive was made by Konami, letting players link the Sony PlayStation 2 version."
Brand and product promotion.
"Flash drives are very cheap to produce. So, they are sometimes used to promote a product. At most technical trade fairs, many exhibitors will promote their products by giving away free drives."
"In other situations, they may be sold at less than wholesale price, or included as a bonus with another product."
"Usually, such drives will be stamped with a company's logo, as a form of advertising ."
"The drive may be blank drive, or already have documents or software loaded on to it. These are called preloaded drives."
Nigger
"Nigger is a racist insult against black people. It can also be referred to as the ""hard R"", due to the word ending in 'er' instead of 'a', like the word with a similar meaning - ""nigga"". Like the word ""nigga"", it can be used in pop culture slang. However, it is mainly used by those who believe that white people are better than everybody else."
"The word came from a slang pronunciation of ""negro"", which is the word for the color black and for black people in Spanish and Portuguese. Before 1865, most black people in the United States were slaves. During this time, the word ""nigger"" usually meant a slave. Writers such as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens used it."
"Today, the word is an offensive racial slur in English, and is often thought as hate speech. ""Nigger"" has become so offensive to say that most people do not use the word; instead, they call it the ""N-word""."
Biography
"A biography is the story of a person's life. The word comes from the Greek words ""bios"" (which means life) and ""graphein"" (which means write). When the biography is written by the person it is about, it is called an autobiography."
A written biography is a part of literature. Biographies can also be made as movies (often called biopics) or told as stories.
"The oldest written biographies that historians have were written to record rulers' lives. Some were written in Assyria, ancient Babylonia, ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. Biographies were an early form of history. Another early form of biography was called ""hagiography,"" meaning writing about holy people."
"In ancient China, a biography was one of the basic forms of a history book. In India, biographies of Buddha and his reincarnated lives were written. In ancient Greece, people wrote biographies of people that were not rulers too. Xenophon wrote a biography of Socrates and gave this book the name ""Memorabilia"" (Memories). During the Roman Empire, Plutarch wrote ""Parallel Lives"" about ancient Greek and Roman politicians, and Suetonius wrote biographies of the Roman emperors. The Gospels were also biographies of Jesus Christ."
"In West Africa, griots tell histories which often include biographies."
Many written biographies today are released by publishers as products for sale.
Ralph Nader
"Ralph Nader (born February 27, 1934) is an American attorney, politician and political activist. He is best known for working for the rights of consumers, for his third party runs for President of the United States, and for helping George Bush get elected in the 2000 presidential election. He ran for president in 1996, 2000 and 2004, but failed to win. In the 2008 election, Nader placed third overall, with 660,094 votes, or about .38%. Nader was born in Winsted, Connecticut. His parents, Nathra and Rose Nader, were Lebanese immigrants. He is a fluent and native speaker of the Arabic language."
Jamie Farr
"Jamie Farr (born July 1, 1934) is an American actor of Lebanese descent. He is best known for his role as Corp./later Sgt. Maxwell Q. Klinger on the 1970s TV show, ""M*A*S*H"". His real name is Jameel Joseph Farha and he was born in Toledo, Ohio."
"Farr also appeared in movies like ""The Blackboard Jungle"" (1955) and ""The Cannonball Run"" (1980), was a regular ""celebrity judge"" on ""The Gong Show"" and has a golf tournament named after him."
Free software
"Free software is software (computer program) that anyone may run, share and change, at any time, for any reason. In this case, ""free"" means ""freedom-respecting"" (we say ""free as in freedom""). The opposite of free software is proprietary software."
"In 1984, Richard Stallman started the free software movement when he began the GNU project. Examples of free software are Linux (the kernel), Blender, OpenBSD, Inkscape and others. Wikipedia also uses free software."
Free software and open source.
"Free software is very similar, but different from open source software."
People who use the name “free software” think that computers should be more ethical and should try to help people who use computers. They think every human should have four basic rights for their programs. These are the rights to:
The Free software movement also says that all software should be free (as in freedom). It is because even a very small program that is proprietary can be very dangerous (it can for example spy on the user).
"People who use the name “open source” refer to the same software following the same rules, but the community isn't as strict and doesn't say that everything should be open source. They avoid the ethics and instead say the rules are good because they help companies make business."
How free software works.
"An author who wants to make his computer program free must allow other people to use it for anything (which doesn't break the law), study it, change it and share it without limits. The author does this by using a free license."
"The author must not prohibit even selling his program by others or using his program for dangerous things or using it by people he doesn't like. This is not because the author supports bad things, but because he thinks that limiting user's rights is dangerous for them."
Free software and freeware.
"On 17 June 2018, North Macedonia and Greece agreed to the Prespa agreement which would see the country change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. The government started completing the constitutional change needed to change the country's name, which was completed on 12 February 2019."
Politics.
North Macedonia is a democratic country with a parliament.
Anorexia nervosa
Anorexia nervosa (usually just called anorexia) is an eating disorder.
"People with anorexia think that they are fat, or desperately fear becoming fat even if they are very skinny. To try to lose weight, anorexics do not eat enough. When they do eat, they do not eat the amount of food their body needs, in an effort to avoid gaining weight. This causes them to lose too much weight too quickly. This is very harmful to a person's body. There are various treatments for anorexia. One example is the Maudsley Method. This type of treatment is for patients who are 18 or younger. Two thirds of adolescent anorexia patients are 'recovered' at the end of this treatment. People with anorexia are more likely to die than people with any other mental illness."
Diagnosis.
"Doctors use the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" to make a medical diagnosis and decide if a person has anorexia or not. Four signs of anorexia are listed in the manual. People do not have to show all four signs for the doctor to decide that they have anorexia."
Causes.
"There is no single cause of anorexia. Researchers believe that it is caused by a combination of biological and environmental factors. It has been linked to the media. Many people think that anorexia is caused by wanting to be thin like models in magazines. However, it is not that simple."
"People who develop anorexia tend to be perfectionistic. They are also more likely to have problems socializing. There has been research about the link between anorexia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a disorder that involves problems with socializing. Another symptom of autism spectrum disorder is OCD, which has also been linked to anorexia. Starvation is known to create antisocial behavior so there needs to be research that compares those traits in anorexics with people who have recovered."
Madness
Madness (or Insanity) is a word that can have different meanings:
"Being able to tell right from wrong is the base of a working society and of law; for this reason, the law treats those people differently who are not able to make this distinction. In the law, when people who can’t understand that their crimes are crimes it’s called the insanity defense."
Rabies
"Rabies is a neurotropic (referring to the nuerons) virus, viral zoonotic disease (can spread to humans by animals) that causes acute encephalitis."
"The disease is almost always fatal (people and animals die from it) when the symptoms start. There is no treatment and cure for it when the symptoms occur. However, people (and pets) who are treated with vaccines soon after becoming infected have a very good chance to survive."
"The disease is transmitted through the saliva and the blood. The usual form of getting it is a bite of a rabid mammal. Pets, like dogs need to be vaccinated against it, in most countries."
Treatment.
"There is no cure for rabies. There is a vaccine (medicine to try to prevent rabies) against it. The vaccine was first developed by Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux in 1885. This vaccine used a live virus grown in rabbits, and weakened (through drying it). The first person to be vaccinated was Joseph Meister (a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a dog). Vaccines similar to this are still used today, but other vaccines (growing the virus using cell cultures) are more used."
"There is also a form of treatment that can be done once a person has been bitten. It needs to be done within 6 days of being bitten. There is no way to know whether someone is infected, until it's too late. Treatment starts with washing the wound. This is done to reduce the number of virus particles that enter the body. Often patients are given one dose of immunoglobulin and a certain number of vaccines, over a determined period of time, usually a month."
Tirana
"Tirana ( or ""Tirana"") is the capital city of Republic of Albania. It is the largest city in that country. According to 2011 census, the population of the city was 621,286 people. Other people think there may be up to 1 million people who live in the city. Tirana was founded in 1614. It became Albania's capital city in 1920."
"The origin of the city name is unknown. According to one of the versions, its name comes from Tyrkanos Castle, which was near the current location of Tirana."
John Forbes Nash Jr.
"John Forbes Nash Jr. (June 13, 1928 – May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician who worked in game theory and differential geometry. He was born in Bluefield, West Virginia. He shared the 1994 Memorial Prize in Economics with two other game theorists, Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi."
Early life.
Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum
"The Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum (Vietnamese: Lăng Hồ Chí Minh) is a large memorial to Vietnamese independence leader Hồ Chí Minh. It is located in Ba Ðình Square in Hà Nội. This is where his body is kept for people to pay their respects. President Hồ Chí Minh did not want a mausoleum at all. In his will, he said he wanted to be cremated and to have his ashes buried in the hills of the north, center, and south of Việt Nam. He said that he liked cremation because it was healthier than burial or a mausoleum and saved farmland. His successors did not let him have this wish. The government kept that part of his will secret. The government also pretended he died a day after he really did, because he really died on Independence Day and they did not tell anyone."
"Many aspects of ""Uncle Ho's"" last will and testament were altered or, as stated above, ignored. In his last days he was surrounded by those who formed what is now Vietnam's political system, while those loyal to him and his wishes were systematically kept or chased away. Others were put on a bus and executed."
Meng Tian
"Meng Tian (; ? - 210 BC ) was a Chinese general of the Qin Dynasty under Emperor Qin Shi Huang. His grandfather, Meng Ao, and his father, Meng Wu, were generals as well. After the unification of China, Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered Meng Tian leading 300,000 armies to attack the Xiongnu and build the Great Wall of China. Meng Tian was forced by the eunuch, Zhao Gao, to kill himself by drinking poisonous wine after the death of Emperor Qin Shi Haung."
Kippah
A kippah (Hebrew) or yarmulke (Yiddish) is a small cloth cap worn by Jews.
"Traditionally it was worn only by men, but in modern times the push for equality between the sexes in the practice of Judaism has led some women to wear yarmulkes. Some Jews only wear yarmulkes while praying; others wear yarmulkes the entire day, making sure not to walk more than four cubits without head covering (especially outside)."
The basis for wearing a head covering is a story in the Talmud (tractate Shabbat).
"Often, the color and fabric of the ""yarmulke"" can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement. The Israeli National Religious community is often referred to by the name ""kipot srugot"" כיפות סרוגות, literally ""woven yarmulkes"". Similarly, some Haredi sects are referred to by the name ""kipot shkhorot"" כיפות שחורות, literally ""black yarmulkes""."
Etymology.
"The etymology of ""yarmulke"" is unclear. Linguists (e.g. Max Vasmer) maintain that the Yiddish word is derived (via Russian or Polish) from the Turkic """", meaning 'raincoat'."
"Traditionally, ""yarmulke"" is considered to have originated from the Aramaic phrase """""" (in awe of the Lord), in keeping with the principle that the yarmulke is supposed to reflect someone's fear of heaven. Or perhaps, ""yira malkah"""" (fear of the King)."
Judeo-Arabic dialects
"Judeo-Arabic languages are a collection of Arabic language dialects spoken by Jews living or formerly living in Arabic-speaking countries. Just as with the rest of the Arab world, Arabic-speaking Jews had different dialects for the different regions where they lived. Most Judæo-Arabic dialects were written in modified forms of the Hebrew alphabet, often including consonant dots from the Arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the Hebrew alphabet."
"In retaliation for 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jews in Arab countries became subject to increasingly insufferable discrimination and violence, causing virtually all of them to flee en masse to Israel. Their dialects of Arabic did not thrive in Israel, and most became extinct, replaced by the Modern Hebrew language."
"In the Middle Ages, Jews in the Islamic diaspora spoke a dialect of Arabic, which they wrote in a mildly adapted Hebrew script (rather than using Arabic script)."
This phenomenon is called Judaeo-Arabic and may be compared to both Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) and Yiddish (Judaeo-German).
"Some of the most important books of medieval Jewish though were originally written in Judaeo-Arabic, as well as certain halakhic works and biblical commentary. Only later were they translated into medieval scientific Hebrew so that they could be read by the Ashkenazic Jews of Europe. These include:"
The Clangers
"The Clangers is a British children's television series. The first episode was broadcast on the BBC on 16 November 1969. The series is about a family of aliens who live under the surface of the Moon in caves. They looked like small, pink, knitted mice. Other characters include the Froglets and The Soup Dragon, a dragon that gives out soup. The family uses a US flag as a table cloth."
London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham
"The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is a London borough in West London but is part of an area called Inner London. House prices are more expensive than most parts of England. The borough has three famous football teams: Fulham F.C., Queens Park Rangers F.C. and Chelsea F.C."
1 E9 m²
"1 E9 m² is a term used to group together areas of similar size. It is used for places that are between 1,000 km² and 10,000 km² in area. The term is based from the scientific notation for 1 x 109m²."
Suryavanshi
Suryavanshi refers to a person belonging to the Solar Dynasty of the Rajputs .
The Suryavanshi clans are:
Some other castes are also Suryavanshi like:-
Chandravanshi
"Chandravanshi or Candravaṃśa is a legendary principal house of the Kshatriyas varna, or warrior–ruling caste mentioned in the ancient Indian texts. This legendary dynasty was said to be descended from moon-related deities (Soma or Lunar). The Hindu deity Krishna is believed to be born in the Yaduvanshi Ahir branch of the Lunar dynasty."
"According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, Pururavas was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururavas's great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Vedic tribes as described in the Vedas."
"According to the Mahabharata, the dynasty's progenitor Ila ruled from Prayag, and had a son Shashabindu who ruled in the country of Bahli. The son of Ila and Budha was Pururavas who became the first Chandravanshi emperor of the planet. Ila's descendants were also known as the Ailas"
"In Hindu texts, the Kurukshetra war that forms the subject of the Indian Epic Mahabharata, was largely fought between rival branches of the Lunar Dynasty, famously resulting in the hesitation of Arjuna away from war and the reprimand of his mentor Krishna. Krishna reminds Arjuna that Dharma stands above everything and the text forms an integral cultural cornerstone for all four Kshatriya houses."
By the conclusion of the Kurukshetra war most of the Yadhuvanshi lineage is in peril. The sinking of Dwarka sees the destruction of the entire Yaduvanshi lineage with the exception of Vajranabh who was saved by Arjuna &amp; later becomes the King of Mathura.
"As the only surviving grandson of Krishna, all branches claiming descent from Krishna (Krishnaut Yadavas) descend from him."

The story is a modern retelling of George Bernard Shaw's play ""Pygmalion"" and George Cukor's 1964 movie ""My Fair Lady"". It was one of the most popular teen movies of the late 1990s and reached No. 1 at the box office in its first week of release. In April 2015, it was announced that the movie will be remade by The Weinstein Company."
Plot.
"Zack and Douglas Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard) are two of the most popular people at their Southern California highschool. Zack's girlfriend, beautiful Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), who is also very popular, breaks up with him so she can instead be with Brock Hudson (Owen Wilson), who is famous after being on a reality television show. Zack is sad but tells himself, he could make any girl in the school popular by making her his girlfriend. Zack and Douglas's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr. (Paul Walker), does not believe him and makes Zack bet that he can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks, and Douglas's childhood friend Donald Hamilton (Richard Hammond) believed that Zack could turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks. But Dean chooses Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook), an unpopular art student, who prefers to spend time by herself."
"Zack and Douglas tries to make friends with with Laney, but she ignores them and walks away. Zack and Douglas's sister Mac (Anna Paquin) tells them to try again, but to learn what Laney is interested in and cares about. Zack and Douglas go to the restaurant where Laney works, and with the help of Laney's friend, Jesse Jackson (Elden Henson) gets her to give them a chance. Laney takes them to a small theater where she will be performing in a drama show. To embarrass him, Laney has Zack and Douglas called on stage to perform. Zack manages to make up a performance, telling a story while kicking a Hacky Sack which he happens to carry in his pocket, while Douglas plays guitar while plays harmonica at the same time. Laney is impressed, but rejects them again after he tries to charm her."
"Zack, Douglas and Donald make friends with her brother, Simon (Kieran Culkin), to be close to her. To get Zack and Douglas to stop Laney agrees to go to the beach with him and Douglas once.

Public domain
"Public domain is a phrase that describes something that belongs to all people in general: the public. The public domain contains works (such as books, films, or paintings) that are not under copyright protection."
"The ""opposite"" of ""public domain"" is copyrighted material, which is owned either by the creator of the work or their estate. The term ""public domain"" is only used to describe things that can be copyrighted, such as photographs, drawings, written articles, books or plays, or similar works of art. As a general rule, all intellectual property works, after enough time has gone by, will become part of public domain. Examples include the works of Leonardo da Vinci, William Shakespeare and Ludwig van Beethoven, and the books of Isaac Newton."
A work can enter the public domain in many ways.
"In some cases, if a work enters the public domain after copyright expiration, anyone using the work may still be required to note who created the work. Even if some works are in the public domain due to not being copyrighted, there may be still non-copyright usage restrictions. For examples, even though the design of national currencies may be ineligible, or be unsuitable, for copyright, counterfeiting them for fraud is widely a very serious crime. Another example are logos and images that only have text or simple shapes. These logos aren't copyrighted in the United States, but they are often protected by trademarks."
Child
"A child (the plural is children) is a person below the age of puberty (biologically) or below the age of majority (legally). A person can be called his or her parent's child, no matter how old he or she is, a synonym for the word 'child' is ""kid""."
"In rich countries, children go to school. Small children may go to nursery school, preschool or kindergarten. Playing with small toys and using their imaginations are important for child development. But often in a developing country, children sometimes work in factories or in the fields with their parents or guardians."
"When two people get married and one (or both) of them have children with someone else before this marriage, that child is called a ""step child"" by the child's non-birth parent. If both people had children, the children of each parent are ""step brothers"" or ""step sisters"" of each other. A child whose parents have died is an orphan. Orphans with no parent may be raised by grandparents or other relatives. Otherwise they may go to live in an orphanage. They may be adopted by another adult or couple wanting a child. They will then be able to grow up in a new family."

Brittle star
"Brittle stars are Echinoderms of the Class Ophiuroidea. The adults are superficially like starfish, but they are a different group, with different larvae. Like other echinoderms, they do have a skeleton of calcareous plates, and radial symmetry. There are about 1500 different species."
"Usually they have 5 ""arms"", which can grow long, up to 60 cm, in the largest species. The central disk of brittle stars can be three to eight inches in diameter. Unlike starfish, they live deeper in the ocean. Ophiuroids are known even from abyssal (&gt;6000 m) depths. However, brittle stars are also common members of reef communities, where they hide under rocks and even within other living organisms. Generally, brittle stars live below 500m of depth."
"There are two related groups of Ophiuroids: the ""Ophiurida"" (brittle stars) and the basket stars (""Eurialida""). Basket stars usually live in the deeper parts of the range. Brittle stars are mostly scavengers and detrivores, able to catch some small prey on occasion."
Description.
"Many brittle stars are more fragile than starfish, which is how they got their name. When they are picked up, their arms may fall off. This might make the animal seem brittle, but they often do this as a defense to escape from predators."
Movement.
"Brittle stars do not use their tube feet for movement, but instead use muscles in their long, thin arms to go around rocks. Ophiurids move quickly when disturbed, and are faster movers than starfish. In living ophiuroids the plates are linked by longitudinal muscles. Ophiurid arms only move horizontally. The way their plates interlock prevents the arms from moving in any other plane.p64 In contrast, basket star arms can move vertically. These movement patterns are distinct, and separate the groups."
"Ophiuroids in general are mostly scavengers or detritivores. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents."
Basket stars.
"Basket stars (Euryalids) are large brittle stars with many rays. Their arms branch, and can be moved in any direction. This distinguishes them from the Ophiurids. Basket stars may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. The arms form so many branches that they are almost feathery on the ends. They get their name because when they stretch their rays out to catch plankton, they look like the bottom of a basket."
"Basket stars can be large and heavy, the biggest Ophiuroids. The largest, ""Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni"", weigh up to 5 kg (11 lbs) and has arms 70cms long, with a disk diameter of 14 cm."
Bivalve
"The bivalves are a large class of molluscs, also known as pelecypods."
They have a hard calcareous shell made of two parts or 'valves'. The soft parts are inside the shell. The shell is usually bilaterally symmetrical.
"There are over 30,000 species of bivalves, including the fossil species. There are about 9,200 living species in 1,260 genera and 106 families. All of them live in the water, most of them in the sea or in brackish water. Some live in fresh water. All are filter feeders: they lost their radula in the course of evolution. A few are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae eaten by other bivalves."
"The best known examples of bivalves are clams, mussels, scallops and oysters."
Shell.
"Bivalves have two shells or valves connected by a hinge with hinge teeth. They are made of a calcareous mineral, calcite or aragonite. The valves are covered by a periostracum, which is an organic horny substance. This forms the familiar coloured layer on the shell."
The shells are usually held shut by strong adductor muscles. Scallops can use their muscles to flap the valves and swim.
Food.
A bivalve takes in water that has plankton and other things floating in it.
"Some (but not all) molluscs have a part of their mantle known as the siphon (a tube). Siphons, if they exist, come in pairs, one to suck in, one to expel."
"Anything that is small enough to fit inside the hole of its incurrent siphon enters the bivalve. When the floating material comes in, it gets stuck in slimy mucus that is on the surface of the bivalve's gills. The food is moved down to the mouth, which is on the other side of the siphon. Food is digested in the bivalve's stomach and intestine, and everything that is not digested goes out through the other siphon, with water."
"The siphons are an adaptation of burrowing molluscs. Those that live above the substrate (sediment), such as scallops and oysters, do not need them."
Feeding types.
"There are four feeding types, defined by their gill structure:"
Movement.
Digging.
"As a group, the bivalves are adapted to penetrate into, and to move along horizontally along, soft ground such as mud and sand. Common examples of this are razor shells, which can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape enemies, and cockles."

Highland Football League
"The Highland Football League (HFL) is a league of football clubs operating not just in the Scottish highlands, as the name may suggest, but also in the north-east lowlands (Moray and Aberdeenshire). It is one of the three 'senior' non-leagues (that is a league that is not the Scottish Football League (SFL), Scottish Premier League or one of the Scottish Junior Football Association's leagues) in Scotland. The HFL is a full member of the Scottish Football Association."
History.
Formation.
"The HFL was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman's Club. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Ross County were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics), and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle."
Recent History.
"Many of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup. However, from the 1990s onwards, the HFL has been a victim of its own success, with various teams defecting to other leagues. Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area, such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as well as the Old Firm to the South, and to an extent English football. However, the lack of Premier League, and to a lesser extent First Division, teams in the area, has worked in its favour, with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland."
"The league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. This happened in 1994 when Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs, with which it continues to operate."
"In 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. If both teams were to join, the Highland League would have a total of 17 teams. An even team league is preferred, so only one club's application was likely to be successful. Whichever team is successful in their application was planned to join in the 2009–10 season. However Banks O' Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied, giving the potential for an 18 team Highland league in 2009-10 if three of these four clubs were elected."
"On February 25 2009, Formartine United, Turriff United and Strathspey Thistle were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O' Dee being the unsuccessful club."
Results from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 1997–98 season.
"The Highland League is the subject of a song of the same name by the popular music ensemble I, Ludicrous."
Linked Competitions.
The HFL also administer several other competitions contested by some or all of the clubs. These competitions are:
Meselson–Stahl experiment
"The Meselson–Stahl experiment was an experiment done by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958, using ""E. coli"" DNA."
"With their experiment, they found that DNA replication was semiconservative. The DNA consists of two helices that are combined. When the two helices are copied, each will have one part coming from the original cell. The other part will be newly made. In chemistry, that is called ""synthesis""."
There are three different way this replication could happen:
"Meselson and Stahl found that DNA employs semi-conservative replication. They put the bacteria in an environment with a Nitrogen isotope. They first used N15. The bacteria then integrated this isotope into their DNA. Later they used an environment that contained N14. They then looked at which of the isotopes the bacterial DNA contained. They found that it contained both isotopes of nitrogen, which implies that conservative replication is not the correct conclusion. By having a closer look they could then also rule out disperse replication. Some helix strands were all v. Other helix strands from the time in the N15 environment had N14."
Woodford tube station
"Woodford is a London Underground station in Woodford in the London Borough of Redbridge, United Kingdom."
The station is on the Central Line between South Woodford and Buckhurst Hill. The station is also a terminus (an ending point) for services from Hainault by way of Chigwell.
History.
"The Baluchistan States Union existed between 3 October 1952 and 14 October 1955 in modern southwest Pakistan. It was formed by the states of Kalat, Kharan, Las Bela and Makran with the capital at the town of Kalat. The area of the Union was roughly the western half of the modern province of Balochistan. The Union was separate from the Chief Commissioners Province of Baluchistan which comprised areas to the northeast of the Union. The Union did not include the enclave of Gwadar City which was part of the Sultanate of Oman. The four state rulers continued in office but some matters became the responsibility of the Council of Rulers."
Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)
The Chief Commissioners Province of Baluchistan was a former province of British India. It was in the northern parts of the modern Pakistani province of Balochistan.
Interwar period
"The interwar period was a time in history from 9 November 1918 to 1 September 1939, between the two world wars, World War I and World War II."
"The period began with many changes internationally. The League of Nations was created, which was made to bring peace to the world, but did not prevent problems with Nazi Germany, which soon left the League. Also occurred was the growing threat of Japan, which invaded China. Soon the Soviet Union and Italy had begun to rise as international powers. All of that happened in the 21 years and soon triggered World War II."
Modernism
"Modernism was a cultural movement of the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It changed art, literature, music, architecture and drama."
"Modernism rejected tradition. It was interested in new ways of doing old things. Also, there was a belief that science and technology could change the world for the better. The details differ greatly, and the term covers some movements which are somewhat contradictory."
Art.
"Modern art replaced classical art. It included abstract art, cubism, pop art, minimalism, and Dadaism. It affected sculpture quite strongly, though at the beginning sculptors like Rodin and Epstein made both traditional and modernist works. Henry Moore is one of the most famous modernist sculptors."
"Typical modernist painters were Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Kandinsky and Mondrian."
Music.
"Composers such as Stravinsky, George Antheil and Schoenberg are modernists. Stravinsky's ""The Rite of Spring"" (""Le Sacre du Printemps"") is a landmark work."
Dance.
"Ballets such as ""The Rite of Spring"" and ""Les Noces"" (""The Wedding"") mark the arrival of modernism into this traditional dance form. Modern dance outside of ballet started with Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller and Ruth St. Denis."
Literature.
"James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" is the classic example of modernism in the novel. ""Ulysses"" (1922) has been called ""a demonstration and summation of the entire Modernist movement"". Franz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" (1915), ""The Trial"" (1925) and T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Waste Land"" (1922) are also prime examples. Looking back, it is clear that: Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" (1866) had a great influence on other writers."
"The arrival of magic realism is part of modernism. The novels and short stories of Mikhail Bulgakov such as ""Diabolidad"" and ""The Master and Margarita"" are examples."
Architecture.
"Modernism in architecture is found in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius the founder of Bauhaus, and Mies van der Rohe. Le Corbusier's famous remark ""A building is a machine for living in"" shows how different his thinking was to architects of the 19th century. The skyscraper, such as Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York (1956–1958), became the archetypal modernist building."
Criticism.
"A criticism of the modern movement is that it does not value tradition, and goes in for change for the sake of change. What modernists want most is freedom of expression, or, perhaps, freedom of experimentation. This is why many modern paintings avoid making visual copies of real things. In modernist literature, an author may leave out plots or narrative or characterization in books."
"These experiments were not random. They drew on the ideas of their day: mass media, science and technology, Marxism, Freudian psychology, and so on. There was a general search for new materials, new methods and new ideas. There was often a rejection of elitism, and a love of populism and popular culture."
Another criticism was of the connection between modernism and socialism. Certainly many modernists were also socialists. In the early days of socialism it seemed to offer hope of a new future without the baggage of the past. This also explains their rejection of tradition.
Victorian era
The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was a time of Queen Victoria's rule from 1837 to 1901. This time was very prosperous for the British people. Trade was at its best. A well educated middle class ruled the country and the British Empire. Other countries also prospered but Britain became the greatest great power.
"The Industrial Revolution continued to increase productivity and prosperity, especially in the middle and later parts of Victoria's reign. Making iron and steel was a basic industry. The furnaces were fired with coal. Shipbuilding was a major industry. Canals and steam railways connected all parts of the country, and British steamships connected the world. Cotton and wool were made into cloth and exported. Ceramics were also a major industry."
"The word “free” in “free software” means ""freedom"", not ""price"". People are allowed to sell Free software, but the person who buys the software can change it, give it away or sell it too."
"The words “free software” are sometimes used in English to just mean software that can be downloaded without paying money, which is confusing. Sometimes this software lets people make their own copies for other people, however it may not let people do all the things that they can do with real Free software, such as change it or sell it. In this case “free” means “free of charge”. To make the difference more clear, software that does not cost money should be called freeware; it is almost always proprietary software."
1812
1812 was a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar.
Zookeeper
"A zookeeper is a worker in a zoo, responsible for the feeding and daily care of the animals. As part of this, they clean the exhibits and report signs of bad health. They may also be involved in scientific research, and in public education, conducting tours or simply answering questions put by members of the public."
"Qualifications and pay of zookeepers both vary widely. A junior keeper in a small zoo may have no qualifications other than an affinity for the job, while a senior keeper in a large zoo would most probably have both a relevant college degree and extensive experience."
"Generally, a liking for animals and outside work and willingness to undertake moderate and sometimes dirty physical work are required. Many animals are themselves heavy and strong-smelling, as is the food some of them eat. Handling such is part of the job at times."
Cage
"A cage is a box which is made to keep something inside of, without it being able to get out (such as an animal). Cages are usually made of many metal bars."
"A cage which has birds in it is called a ""birdcage""."
Toddler
"A toddler is a very young child who is learning how to use their hands, stand and walk, and also how to communicate with others."
Most children are toilet trained while they are toddlers.
"Even when toddlers can walk, they are often transported in a stroller, buggy, or pushchair when the walk is a long distance or when they're tired. Toddlerhood typically begins after age one and is over by the time the child is 4, but this can differ depending on the child."
Ronald McDonald
Ronald McDonald is an American clown character who is a mascot of the McDonald's fast-food restaurant.
"He wears yellow and red stripes and has wacky hair. He lives in McDonaldland, with lots of his friends. The first actor to play Ronald McDonald was famous weatherman and Bozo the Clown actor Willard Scott. Later the actor for Coco the Clown, Michael Polakovs, redesigned Ronald McDonald's outfit and make-up, which is the version still used by today's Ronald McDonald actors. The fictional character is a heroic magical adventurer that stands up good and freedom, such as saving the rain forest and supporting Ronald McDonald House Charities."
Actors.
"McDonald's has many actors employed to portray Ronald McDonald in restaurants and events. It is assumed, however, that the company uses only one actor at a time to play the character in television commercials."
This is a list of these main actors:
"An actor by the name of Joe Maggard stated in an interview of The Guardian in 2014 that he portrayed the Ronald McDonald character from 1995 to 2007. However, It was stated in a 2003 article by The Baltimore Sun that Maggard was only a stand-in actor for one commercial shoot in the mid 90s and stated that ""he is definitely not Ronald McDonald"", as Jack Doepke and David Hussey were the real current portrayers as Ronald throughout the time period Joe claimed he did. In 1998, he was charged of carrying a weapon in the New Hanover County, N.C., McDonalds and the next year he was convicted in making harassing telephone calls posing as Ronald. The judge ordered him to take anger management classes."
Bob Marley
"Robert Nesta ""Bob"" Marley (February 6, 1945 - May 11, 1981) was an important Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician in the 1970s and 1980s. He made the style of reggae music very popular all over the world. His music told stories of his home and the Rastafarian religion that he followed. Some songs were about religion and some songs were about politics like Get Up Stand Up."
"Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1945 in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica to a black teenager, Cedella Booker, and a white man named Norvall Marley. When he was young, his friends gave him the nickname, ""Tuff Gong"". He started his music career in the 1960s with his group the Wailing Wailers (or simply the Wailers), that he formed with two friends, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. In 1962, Bob Marley and the Wailing Wailers recorded their first two songs called ""Judge Not"" and ""One Cup of Coffee""."
"Bob married Rita Anderson in 1966 and she joined the group as a back-up singer. They had five children together. One is Ziggy Marley, who is also a well-known reggae performer."
"He was also honored with the Award of the Yugoslavian Radio-Television (Ohrid, 1972), awards of the City of Belgrade for the best concert in the previous concert season (1976, 1981, 1986), as well as with 7th July Award (1962), the state’s highest award for the arts."
State awards.
"In 2007, upon recommendation of the Expert Committee of the Ministry of Culture, he was awarded Special Acknowledgement for the Highest Contribution to the National Culture of the Republic of Serbia. In 2010 the Association of Musical Artists of Serbia awarded him with The Lifetime Achievement Award."
Performance career.
"During his long career, Stefanovic performed throughout Europe, Africa and North America. Stefanovic recorded for the leading radio and television stations in the country and abroad: United Kingdom, Italy, France, USSR, Germany, etc. As a soloist, member of various chamber groups and orchestras, he worked with distinguished Yugoslavian and international artists, including Anton Nanut and many others."
He was one of the few artists honored to perform Copland’s Clarinet Concerto under the baton of Maestro Aaron Copland (1961).
He was a long-time principal clarinetist of the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra (1954-1976).
Stefanovic also played jazz – as a soloist and member of the Belgrade Jazz Trio and Markicevic Quintet.
"He has a number of personally dedicated clarinet works by prominent Yugoslavian composers: Dejan Despic, Aleksandar Obradovic, Petar Bergamo, Dusan Radic, Petar Ozgijan, Miodrag Ilic."
Stefanovic was the chair of the committee in numerous Yugoslavian and international competitions.
Compositions.
Stefanovic wrote numerous jazz compositions and some film music.
Teaching career.
"He taught at the Josip Slavenski School of Music, University of Pristina and University of the Arts in Belgrade. His former students hold teaching positions in music schools and universities and play in orchestras in Europe, Asia, Australia and North America. Stefanovic wrote several textbooks for the clarinet students."
He served as the Vice-Chancellor and member of the Board of Trustees of the University of the Arts in Belgrade.
Affiliations.
Stefanovic is an honorary member and former president of the Association of Musical Artists of Serbia.
Death.
"Stefanović died on 25 July 2022 in Belgrade, Serbia, aged 92."
Flash memory
"Flash memory is a memory storage device for computers and electronics. It is most often used in devices like digital cameras, USB flash drives, and video games. It was developed in the 1980s from the earlier and similar EEPROM."
"Flash memory is different from RAM because RAM is volatile (not permanent). When power is turned off, RAM loses all its data. Flash can keep its data intact with no power at all. A hard drive is also permanent (non-volatile) storage, but it is bulky and fragile. Flash memory is one kind of Non-volatile random-access memory. It is slower than RAM but faster than hard drives. It is often used in small electronics because of its small size and lack of moving parts."
"The main weakness of flash memory is that it is more expensive than hard drives for the same amount of storage. Another weakness is the number of times that data can be written to it. Data can be read from flash as many times as desired, but after a certain number of ""write"" operations, ""write cycles"", it will stop working. Most flash devices are designed for about 100,000 - 1,000,000 write cycles."
"EEPROM has the same limitation that flash does: ones made in the 20th century could only survive about 100,000 write cycles, later increased to about a million. It is more expensive than flash, so it is rarely used for storage greater than 128kB. The main difference between EEPROM and flash memory is that most EEPROM devices can erase any byte of memory at any time. Flash memory can only erase an entire chunk, or ""sector"", of memory at a time. Both EEPROM and flash are subject to the limitation that only bytes in an 'erased' state can be written, which means that if the user wants to change only one byte of flash, the entire sector must be erased and re-written. This means that flash memory can wear out faster than EEPROM. Some flash memory can store hundreds of gigabytes, or even terabytes. Many are in the form of a pen drive."
"Flash memory is used in USB Drives, solid-state drives, computer RAM (occasionally), hybrid drives (small SSD + hard drive), graphics cards, and memory cards."
Bottrop
"Bottrop is a city in west central Germany, on the Rhine-Herne Canal, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Nordrhein-Westfalen). Bottrop is in the Ruhr industrial area, It is next to Essen, Oberhausen, Gladbeck and Dorsten. The city had been a coal-mining and rail center. There are factories producing coal-tar derivatives, chemicals, textiles, and machinery. The population is currently 119,655. Bottrop grew as a mining center beginning in the 1860s and was chartered as a city in 1921. In 1975 it was put together with the unification with the neighbor communities of Gladbeck and Kirchhellen, but Gladbeck left in 1976."
History.
"The place is first heard of in 1150, as ""Borthorpe"". This name means ""village on the hillside"". In the year 1423, Bottrop is awarded the status of a market town. In 1786 the first cotton mill opens. Coal mining starts in 1856. The city gets town privileges in 1919. In 1953, the population passed 100.000 people for the first time."
Digital camera
"A digital camera is a camera that stores pictures in electronic memory instead of film. Because of this, a digital camera can hold many more pictures than a traditional film camera. A digital camera can sometimes hold hundreds or thousands of pictures. Many use a memory card to store them. Most digital cameras can use a USB cable that connects into a computer to send pictures that are in the camera to the computer."
"Digital photography is a kind of photography where a digital camera is used to take photos. Digital cameras use an image sensor instead of photographic film. Very often, they also use a memory card to store the photos in a digital format. Most photography is digital, though some photographers still use the old film cameras."
"The majority of cameras are part of a mobile phone, called a ""camera phone"". They can send their pictures to other phones and other devices. Most camera phones do not make as good pictures as larger separate cameras do, especially where light is not bright."
Most digital cameras can serve as Video cameras. Some have a direct link to another computer where the data may be stored.
Data storage.
"When you take a picture or a video, it is saved on a memory device. The memory device can be internal - flash memory inside the camera, or external - memory cards, microdrives and so on. The most used method for saving pictures and videos from a camera is a SD card."
"The picture can be saved in a compressed file (JPEG, TIFF) or in an uncompressed, proprietary RAW file. The compressed picture is lower quality but the RAW picture has to be processed with a special computer program."
"A video is usually saved as an AVI, MPEG or MOV file format (it depends on the producer of the camera)."
"Most modern cameras also put Exif information in the picture file. This metadata information usually includes the date of taking the picture, the camera type, and its settings. Some cameras include GPS coordinates."
Cheers
"Cheers is a long-running American sitcom made by Charles-Burrows-Charles Productions in association with Paramount Television for NBC. The show premiered on September 30, 1982 and had its widely watched series finale on May 20, 1993, followed by a long and ongoing run in syndication. In eleven seasons, there were 270 episodes."
Setting.
"""Cheers"" was set in a Boston bar. This bar was where a group of friends would come to sit, drink alcohol, complain, and make practical jokes on a rival bar in town."
"The show's main theme in its early seasons was the romance between Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) and ex-baseball pitcher and bar owner Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Long's departure from the show in 1987 shifted the emphasis to Sam's relationship with a new character, Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley). Diane returned for the finale."
"The show also created the character Frasier Crane. Frasier got his own show (""Frasier"") the season after ""Cheers"" ended. Frasier's love interest Lilith Sternin appeared on both shows but Frasier and Lilith were no longer married in ""Frasier""."
"The producers, not wanting the show to be construed as promoting drinking, had Sam's character written as an ex-alcoholic. Most of the early episodes took place entirely within the confines of the bar. When the series became popular, some scenes were outside the bar."
"The outer shots of the bar were actually the Bull and Finch pub, north of Boston Common, which has become a tourist attraction because of its association with the series. It is said to be the bar that the series creators saw and wanted to model the bar in their show after. It has now been renamed Cheers on Beacon Hill, though its interior is quite different from the TV bar."
Ratings.
It was nearly cancelled during its first season (in which it ranked dead last among 63 shows). But it eventually became one of the most popular shows on TV because it had a top-ten rating during seven of its eleven seasons. The show earned 26 Emmy Awards out of a total of 111 nominations.
Jackie Chan Adventures
"Jackie Chan Adventures is an animated television series. Episodes were first broadcast on the WB television network, and later syndicated on other networks such as the Cartoon Network. It features fictionalized Jackie Chan and his niece Jade on their adventures trying to stop evil."
Stapler
"A stapler is an office tool that is used to place thin items such as paper together. It uses a small piece of wire (a staple) to put them together. The ends of the staple are pointed and go into the paper. There is also a chain of stores called ""Staples"", which sell office supplies."
"When you press the stapler down, it will release a staple. The staple is pressed into the paper, and then bent. That way the pieces of paper get stuck together."
Pixar
"Pixar Animation Studios, or simply Pixar, is an American computer animation studio. It is known for its advanced CGI productions. It has been a partner of Disney for many years. In 2006, Disney bought the company."
Katsuyama Castle Museum
"Katsuyama Castle Museum (勝山城博物館, ""Katsuyama-jō Hakubutsukan"") is a museum that is in the city of Katsuyama in Fukui Prefecture in Japan. The museum was finished on July 19, 1992. It is considered to be the tallest castle in Japan, at 57.8 meters, but it is not a castle because it does not have a ""tenshu"" or ""tenshukaku""–a “keep tower” (tower to defend from enemies). It was built to look like the Himeji castle. The museum also stands out because it has dragons cut into its foundation stone, which is unusual for a Japanese castle."
History behind the construction.
"During the Edo period in Japan, the territory of modern Katsuyama City belonged to the Echizen-Katsuyama Domain (region). During that time, the city was planning to build a ""tenshu"". However, for different reasons, such as the laws that were in place at that time, the city was never able to finish it. Kiyoshi Tada, who was born in Katsuyama and who was the founder of Sōgōtakushi, a taxi company that is nowadays divided into many different taxi companies, decided to build a castle, and put into life the long wish of people for a ""tenshu"". Instead of a usual castle he built a museum that looks like a castle, where different items from his own collection are displayed nowadays, including various samurai armor, swords, and traditional folding screens. The museum was built close to another gift to Katsuyama from Kiyoshi Tada--""Echizen Daibutsu"", a complex of buildings built in a traditional Japanese style with a huge Buddha statue in it. The cost of construction was 10 billion yen."
Modern times.
"Since the opening, the museum has been managed by the Tada Kiyoshi Cultural Educational Commemoration Foundation (""多田清文化教育記念財団"", ""Tada Kiyoshi Bunka Kyōiku Kinen Zaidan""). In 2014, the Katsuyama Castle Museum started working together with the Katsuyama City government."
"In addition to Kiyoshi Tada’s own collection, the museum also displays a collection of more than 800 articles of embroidery of the Qing dynasty in China. There is also a collection of works by famous calligrapher Goseki Nishiwaki shown in the museum."
"Many events are held on the museum territory throughout the year, including tea ceremonies, haiku competitions, various concerts, and collaborations with the government and other museums. (Please check the information before visiting there as the event may be canceled or changed due to the influence of the coronavirus."
"In 2019 alone 12,5000 people visited either the museum and/or the ""Echizen Daibutsu""."
You can overlook the city of Katsuyama from the observation room on the top floor.
We can get to the museum for about 15 minutes from Katsuyama station by bus. This museum closed on Wednesday and open from 9:30 to 16:30 except Wednesday.
Sylvirana mortenseni
"The Koh Chang Island frog or Mortensen's frog (""Sylvirana mortenseni"") is a frog from Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos. Scientists have seen it as high as 800 meters above sea level."
Rabeya Khatun
"Rabeya Khatun (27 December 1935 – 3 January 2021) was a Bangladeshi novelist. As of 2008, she wrote over 50 novels and more than 400 short stories. Her works include essays, novels, research, short stories, religious history and travelogues. She was awarded Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1973, Ekushey Padak in 1993 and Independence Day Award in 2017 by the Government of Bangladesh."
"Khatun died 3 January 2021 at her residence in Gulshan, Dhaka."
Lyft
"Lyft is a taxi service which is publicly traded and based in San Francisco, California, USA. Lyft allows users to find, through a website or mobile app, drivers who are partnering with the service and are ready to give them a ride for a reasonable fee. Lyft's motto is “your friend with a car”. According to the company, their service allows its clients to travel by Lyft at a cost 30% lower than using traditional taxis."
The service operates in 644 cities in the United States and 12 cities in Canada.
Lyft started in the summer of 2012.
Ucanha
"Ucanha is a place in northern Yucatán, Mexico, where scientists dig up Mayan ruins. It used to be a town where Mayans lived. People lived in Ucanha during the Late Preclassic period (ca. 300 B.C. — ca. A.D. 250). It was about 2.2 square kilometers in size. There were about 400 households. It was connected to a larger town, Uci, by a wide stone causeway. Uci is 13 km to the west of Ucanha."
"A large brightly colored stucco mask was discovered in Ucanha in 2017. It is about two meters tall and was found in a building near the center of Ucanha. Although masks like this one have been found in other Maya sites, this is the only one known for this part of Mexico."
The mask has been repaired so it looks the way it did when it was new. The archaeologists buried the mask again to preserve it and because the site is not legally protected.
Insemination
"For organisms that reproduce sexually, insemination is the transfer of male gametes (usually sperm) into the female reproductive tract, for the purpose of generating offspring. In mammals, this is the uterus, in birds, this is the oviduct. Insemination happens naturally during sexual intercourse, or copulation. It can also be done artificially, in which case it is called artificial insemination."

Bumblebee
"Bumblebees or ""bumble bees"", or ""humble bees"") are a group of social and semi-social bees, of the genus Bombus. The genus contains about 250 different species, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. They can also be found in New Zealand and Tasmania. They occur practically everywhere on the Eurasian landmass."
"Most bumblebees live in small groups, which generally last only for a year (though the queen lasts longer). They collect pollen as protein for their young, and themselves eat nectar. They are extremely hairy, with a covering of soft hairs called a ""pile"". It is the female worker bee which one sees out collecting pollen. The pollen is packed into two ""baskets"" on its hind, very noticeable when full. The baskets are just hairs specially adapted for this function."
"Most of them have the same social structure as honey bees do, there is a ""queen"", and there are ""workers"" and ""drones"". The usual size of a colony is under 50 members, though some tropical species live in larger colonies."
"Bumblebees carry aposematic warning colours, usually some combination of black, red, yellow and white. This is the usual Müllerian mimicry found in bees and wasps. Bumblebees are extremely hairy, and that also is a defence against birds. Young birds, particularly, find them difficult to handle. Some birds are regular predators of bumblebees: the great grey shrike (""Lanius excubitor"") and the bee-eaters for example."
Life cycle.
"Fertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state. They start a nest in the Spring. The nests are smaller, usually much smaller, than those of hive bees. The queen stores sperm from her mating, and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the oviduct to the vagina. The females are diploid, the males are haploid. This is the common method of sex determination throughout the Hymenoptera."
"Only fertilised eggs grow into females, unfertilised ones grow into males. To develop, the larvae are fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein."
"Queens suppress their female workers egg-laying by aggression and pheromones, until late in the season, when the workers do start to lay eggs. The eggs develop into males (drones) if they are not fertilised (haploid), and females if they are diploid."
"Thus the queen will be the mother of all the first males. New queens (those fertilised eggs which are fed on nutritious food) and males leave the colony when they are mature. They mate and the new queens search for a place to overwinter. Then they are dormant over the winter period, starting a new nest in the Spring. That completes the cycle. The queens live a number of years. The workers (unfertilized females) live about a season. Drones live away from the hive(s). Queens do not mate with drones from their own hive."
"Bumblebees can fly very high. In 2014, ""National Geographic"" said bumblebees can fly higher than Mount Everest."
Nest size.
"Nest size ""according to the species"" is between 50 and 400 individuals. Colonies have been fiund as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees."
Nest types.
"Many species nest underground in old rodent burrows or sheltered places. They avoid direct sunlight, where nests might overheat. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. Stone-boring bees are found in limestone walls and cliffs, and sand borers are found in compact sand cliffs."
"A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter."
Parasitic bees.
"About ten species are called cuckoo bumblebees. These are nest parasites: they specialize in invading and taking over the nests of other bumblebees. In these species, there are no workers. Once such an animal has invaded a nest, it will force the workers to feed it and its offspring. Once the offspring are ready, they will leave the hive, to mate and take over other hives."
Sting.
"All bumblebees have a sting, as hive bees do. However, the bumblebee sting does not damage it when used, and they can sting several times. However, they rarely do sting, unless really threatened."
"They have an additional type of defence against birds, and that is their mechanical toughness. Birds usually do not swallow bees whole. If they eat bees at all, they manipulate them to eat the thorax alone, for its wing muscles. This is hard to do with a bumblebee, and time-consuming. Generally, they are left alone."
Bumblebees in England.
The BBC has made a number of field reports for its regular Naturewatch and Spring watch programs. The short film clips have information on:
Italia 1
Italia 1 is an Italian commercial television station on the Mediaset network.
It is oriented especially at young people.
"Muharraq is Bahrain's second largest city and is also called the ""Place of Ashes""."
1997 Qayen earthquake
"The 1997 Qayen earthquake was a large earthquake that struck in Northern Iran's Khorasan Province on May 10, 1997. It was also known as the Quayen, Ardekul or Qaen earthquake. It was the largest in that area since 1990 and measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale. It was the third earthquake in 1997 that caused a lot of damage. It killed 1,567 people and injured over 2,300. It also left 50,000 homeless by damaging over 15,000 homes. There were 155 aftershocks that added to the damage, which was guessed to cost about $100 million."
The United States Geological Survey said that it was the most deadly earthquake in 1997.
Wind turbine
"A wind turbine is a rotating machine that transfers kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy. If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as for pumping water, cutting lumber or grinding stones, the machine is called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is instead converted to electricity, the machine may be called a wind turbine generator (WTG), wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator."
Turning the generator.
"The wind turbine's blades are turned by the wind. This turns a shaft turning slowly, at about 10-20 rpm with a high torque. The shaft goes into a reduction gearbox with a ratio of about 1:50, although some wind turbine gearboxes can have a ratio of 1:100 or more. Some wind turbines may have no reduction gearbox at all, and have a ratio of 1:1. The gearbox turns the generator more quickly, at around 1000 rpm, at a low torque. The generator creates electricity. This electricity is combined with any other wind turbines that may be in the same wind farm. This combined electricity may be used locally, or adjusted to match the electricity in the power grid and sent to the power grid."
Environmental Impact.
"Although wind turbines are a renewable source of energy and don't pollute the environment as a result of generating power, they have an environmental impact. Some people think that wind turbines create a lot of noise and look unappealing. However, wind turbines are placed no closer than 300 meters from residential homes. At that distance, a wind turbine is no louder than an average household air conditioner."
Wet-tail
"Wet-tail or proliferative ileitis, is a disease in rodents kept in cages, mainly hamsters, but can include rabbits, gerbils, rats, and mice. It is caused by stress. Even with treatment, the animal can die within 24–48 hours. Baby hamsters are much more likely to get the disease than older hamsters. It commonly is found when the hamster is being weaned at about four weeks of age."
Causes.
"Wet-tail is a disease in the animal's intestines caused by the bacteria, ""Lawsonia intracellularis"". Wet-tail is stress related. The stress can be caused by:"
Symptoms.
"The symptoms may not appear for several days. The main symptom is the animal has a wet tail, matted with faeces. Other signs of the disease are:"
Treatment.
There are drugs to treat wet-tail which can be bought from pet shops. A vet may choose to give the animal other drugs. The sick animal should be kept in a cage by itself so that others do not catch the disease.
Luxury box
"The luxury box or luxury suite is the North American term for a special seating section in arenas, stadiums and other sports venues. In the United Kingdom and Australia the terms used are corporate box, executive box, sky box and private box. They are usually in the mid-section of the stadium. The seats have usually the best views of the sporting event. Some have glass panels that can be opened, in order for the spectators to feel closer to the action of the sporting event. The inside of a luxury box usually has a bar, several televisions sets, a row of seats and a private bathroom. The boxes are usually catered. The lease to a box also comes with a personal parking space, and a private entrance. The boxes usually generate more revenue than regular seating."
Contactless smart card
A contactless smart card is a kind of smart card with integrated circuits that can process and save data. Most cards are as big as a credit card. They can receive information which is processed and delivered through radio. There are two main kinds of contactless smart cards.
"Many people believe contactless smart cards have a read-only RFID inside it. This is not true, but they do have a re-writable smart card microchip inside them. Contactless smart cards can be used for identification, authentication, and saving data."
Pericles' Funeral Oration
"Pericles' Funeral Oration is a famous speech from Thucydides' ""History of the Peloponnesian War"". The speech was delivered by Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE). He was a famous Athenian politician. The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war."
"At that time, people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war. The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent, where offerings could be made for the dead."
Queen Esther discovered the plot by Haman and worked to stop it. She invited the king to dine with Haman present so she could tell him about the plot. But her courage failed her and she said nothing.
"She again invited King Ahaseurus and Haman to dine and this time she told the king of Haman's plot. The king, furious, stormed out and Haman begged Esther for mercy. When the king returned, he mistakenly believed Haman had molested his queen, and had him hanged on the same gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai. In the end, thanks to Esther's courage and influence, the king changed the law and saved the Jewish people."
Clay
"Clay is a fine-grained silicate mineral made when rocks break down. Wet clay is soft and can be shaped to make pottery, bricks and other things. When it is shaped and then fired in a kiln to make it hard, it becomes pottery."
Clay often contains some water because the water molecules stick to the tiny grains. There may also be some organic materials in the clay.
"There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth, they make muds stick together ('cohesive'), or able to flow ('plastic'). The thixotropy of clay sometimes causes landslides."
"Quartz, feldspars, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral. The formation of clay is well understood. It can come from soil, volcanic ash, and glaciation. Ancient mudrocks are another source, because they weather and disintegrate easily."
"Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. A clay particle is about 1/1000th the width of a sand grain. This means a clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity, thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement. Where the grains are more than a few millimeters wide, the material is called silt, not clay."
Rifle
The rifle is a gun with a stock to brace against the shoulder and a barrel with twisting grooves. The grooves are called rifling and make bullets spin as they fly through the air. Rifles are made to shoot many different sizes of bullets using different amounts of gunpowder. Rifles are usually made to be able to hit targets at long ranges. Modern rifles are made for many different purposes. Some are made for hunting animals. Some are made for soldiers to use in war. Others are made for police to have in case they need them. Some rifles are made for target shooting.
Types.
"Rifles can work in different ways. Some rifles have what is called a bolt action. A small handle is used to move a part of the rifle called a ""bolt"". By moving the bolt backward, then forward, allows the shooter put a bullet in the chamber ready for firing. It also ejects any spent shells still in the chamber from any previously fired rounds. The rifle in the picture above is a bolt action. Some rifles are semi-automatics, where a bullet is loaded (automatically) and fired each time the trigger is pulled. Some are fully automatic, which work like semi-automatics but allow the shooter to fire more than one bullet at a time by holding down the trigger. The automatic rifle stops firing when the trigger is released or it runs out of ammunition."
Deuterocanonical books
"[WARNING, THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN ERRORS]Deuterocanonical books means ""second canon"" in Greek. It usually means the parts of the Bible that are only used by some Christian churches (mostly Roman Catholic and Orthodox). The books only exist in Greek language manuscripts that were written by the Jewish people living in Greek speaking areas of the Mediterranean Sea between 250 and 50 BC, as were all of the books of the Old Testament. It was not until circa 900 AD that the Old Testament as known in Jewish and Protestant religions was written in Hebrew and limited to the current so-called ""canons"".[citation needed, see dead sea scrolls]"
"The books are not part of the Jewish Tanakh (also called the ""Hebrew Bible""), although they were quoted as Scripture well into the Middle Ages as is found in the Jewish Mishna and later Rabbinical writings, even into the 6th century AD. The current Jewish canon was closed by the time of the Masoretic Text in the 10th century AD."
Some books considered deuterocanonical by Catholics are:
"The ""Book of Daniel"" and the ""Book of Esther"" are longer in Catholic Bibles than in Protestant Bibles because they have more stories."
"Many, but not all Protestant churches do not accept these books as inspired by God and use the derogatory term for them: Apocrypha. Martin Luther considered these books good to read while John Calvin read and studied them but did not think they should be part of the Bible. The Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church,"

Sidekick
"A sidekick is someone who regularly travels with, and helps, another person. In fiction, the other person is often a crimefighter or superhero, such as Batman and his sidekick Robin. Some people consider Sancho Panza, Don Quixote's ever-faithful companion, to be a type of sidekick, even though the book was written long before the word sidekick was invented. Annabeth Chase is nobody's sidekick."
Jurist
A jurist (from medieval Latin) is someone who researches and studies jurisprudence (theory of law).

Slavery.
"Slavery has long been practiced in Africa, just like the rest of the world. But two new slave trades would create a much bigger and more violent version of slavery."
"Between the 7th and 20th centuries, the Arab slave trade took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan routes and the Indian Ocean. Between the 15th and 20th centuries (a period of 500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the Americas. While some Africans collaborated with European and Asian slave traders, many were strongly opposed to slavery and avoided, protested, or fought it violently."
"Africans who had been captured and sent to the French colony of Saint Domingue on slave ships played an important role in ending the Atlantic slave trade. They began the Haitian Revolution, which created Haiti, the first country to permanently ban slavery. After this revolution, European empires began to reduce slave trading and abolitionism became more popular. Between 1808 and 1860, the British Navy captured approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard."
Colonialism.
"In the late 19th century, the European powers occupied much of the continent, creating many colonial and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states: Liberia and Ethiopia (which the Europeans called “Abyssinia"")."
"Egypt and Sudan were never formally made a part of any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922."
Modern history.
"African independence movements had their first success in 1951, when Libya became the first former colony to become independent. Modern African history is full of revolutions and wars, as well as the growth of modern African economies and democratization across the continent."
"A civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, it has killed an estimated 5.5 million people."
Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.
Climate.
"From north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north:"
"Running north-east to the south is the East African Great Rift Valley. This has mountains, volcanoes, deep rifts and valleys, rivers and lakes."
"In fact, Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types."
Rainfall.
"Much of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa, there are few rivers or other water sources. Underground water sources are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert."
"In that part of the world, the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau block the monsoon rain and prevent it from getting to North Africa. Also, the Atlas Mountains near the north coast"
of Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow.
These two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert.
"Conditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rainfall near the equator. The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics:"
Plants and animals.
"Africa has a lot of wildlife. There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large mammals. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are antelope, buffalo, zebra, cheetah, elephant, lion, giraffe, rhinoceros, apes, hyaena, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers."
Politics.
"The African Union (AU) is an international organisation. It aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial, and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP and then gaining majority support in the PAP."
"Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire. There are 54 UN member states in Africa."
People.
Africa was the homeland for the first people.
"People who come from Africa are called Africans. People in the north are called North Africans and people in the south are called South Africans. Languages in eastern Africa include Swahili, Oromo and Amharic. Languages in western Africa include Lingala, Igbo, Hausa and Fulani. The most popular language in Northern Africa is Arabic."
The most populated country in Africa is Nigeria.
African diaspora.
Countries with significant African descendents outside Africa:
Programming.
"HBO Asia has licensing deals with two major Hollywood conglomerates and their film studios: Time Warner (Warner Bros. Pictures; New Line Cinema, HBO Films, Castle Rock Entertainment; Warner Independent Pictures, Franchise Pictures) and Viacom (Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks; Paramount Vantage). It also licenses movies from Columbia Pictures and many independent distributors such as Village Roadshow Pictures, Morgan Creek, Screen Gems and Universal Studios"
Channels.
"The HBO multiplex channels are divided into special packages. In Hong Kong, now TV's package is HBO/MAX PAK Premium while in the Philippines, SkyCable Platinum's package is THE HBO PAK. In Indonesia, First Media's package is HBO MAX PAK In Singapore, StarHub TV's package is called HBO PAK."
Censorship.
"Since HBO Asia headquarters is in Singapore, HBO Asia has to follow Singapore Law, which means that cuts have to be made to programs such as ""Sex and the City"" and ""The Sopranos""."
"The HBO-made series ""Entourage"" was taken off-air for three weeks by one cable operator in the Philippines pending clearance by MTRCB. The entire series continued to air without disruption on all other Philippines cable operators."
"Every movie with content which is considered to oppose or distort the Vietnam War, the Vietnam Communist Party or Communism is replaced by a black screen. In addition, if the Ministry of Culture and Information considers a movie has contents of a serious sexual or horrific nature not conforming with Vietnamese society, it will not be aired."
HBO in South Asia.
India.
HBO Asia airs a separate PAY TV feed with commercial breaks for viewers in South Asia. The channel is labeled as HBO South Asia and often referred to as HBO India since it specifically caters to the Indian market. All movie promos in this beam are according to IST The channel is also available to viewers in Bangladesh and the Maldives. HBO South Asia took over the rights for DreamWorks movies from STAR Movies in June 2008.
Pakistan.
"In Pakistan, HBO is available as HBO Pakistan. It is a simulcast of HBO India with slight modifications and running in PST. Diwali ads and other adverts targeted towards India are filtered out in this beam. This beam can also be called the +0.30 version of HBO South Asia since all the programs aired on this beam are aired with a thirty minute delay."
Discovery Channel (Southeast Asian TV channel)
"Discovery Channel (formerly The Discovery Channel) is an Asian satellite and cable TV channel which provides documentary programming. Its documentaries focused mainly on popular science, technology, history and culture, similar to that of the National Geographic Channel and History."
"It is owned and operated by Discovery Networks Asia, a division of Discovery Communications. Discovery Channel SE Asia now divided into two channel feeds."
National Geographic (Asian TV channel)
"The National Geographic Channel, also known as Nat Geo, is an Asian subscription television channel. It has non-fiction, programming involving nature, science, culture, and history. These programs are made by the National Geographic Society, just like History and the Discovery Channel."
History.
"The channel was launched on August 1, 1994 in partnership with STAR TV. Star TV is a Hong Kong-based satelite television service for Asia and the Pacific. It is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Nat Geo replaced the NBC Asia channel on July 1, 1998. , the Asian version of National Geographic Channel was available in over 56 million homes. NGC Asia has eight different channels feeds."
Gifted education
Gifted education is a term for special ways to educate (teach) children who have been identified as gifted. There is no definition of a gifted student which everyone agrees on.
"Gifted and talented education has a long history of thousands of years. Plato (c. 427–c. 347 BCE) was in favour of providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women. In China's Tang Dynasty (580-618 CE), child prodigies were summoned to the imperial court for specialized education. Throughout the Renaissance, those who showed creative talent in art, architecture, and literature were supported by both the government and private patronage."
"In 2011, the National Association for Gifted Children published a position paper that stated what a gifted student is. The word ""gifted,"" describes people who demonstrate outstanding aptitude or competence in one or more domains. An ""aptitude"" is defined as an exceptional ability to learn or reason. ""Competence"" is defined as documented performance or achievement in the top 10 percent of the population."
Sport England
"Sport England is the name for the English Sports Council. It is a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It works with national governing bodies of sport to grow the number of people in sports. Their goal is to keep these people in the sports. Sport England also helps more talented people do well by identifying them early, nurturing them, and helping them move up to the top level."
"Sport England has two statutory, functions: (1) a lottery distributor for sport; and (2) it must be consulted on planning applications that affect playing fields. The funding it distributes comes from both H.M. Treasury and the National Lottery. Since 1994, it has invested over £2bn of lottery funds and £300 million from the Exchequer into sports in England."
Tie votes.
"Normally, appellate courts (or panels) are staffed with an odd number of judges to avoid a tie vote. Sometimes and in some jurisdictions, when judicial positions are vacant or a judge has recused (excuse) himself or herself from the case, the court may be stuck with a tie. In this situation the decision of the lower Court stands."
Writ
"In English common law, a writ is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial jurisdiction. In modern use this generally is a court. Writs are issued by courts directing the person to whom they are addressed to do something or to not do something. Writs may also be used to direct other courts or public authorities. The authority for a court to issue a writ is given by the All Writs Act which is a United States federal statute originally a part of the Judiciary Act of 1789."
History.
"In its earliest form a writ was simply a written order made by the English king to a specified person to undertake a specified action. For example in the feudal era a military summons by the king to one of his tenants-in-chief to appear dressed for battle with his knights at a certain place and time. An early usage survives in the United Kingdom. Also in Canada in a writ of election. This was is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, the Governor General) to local officials (High Sheriffs of every county in historical UK) to hold a general election. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to Parliament."
Types of writs.
There have been a great many kinds of writs. Some of the more common types still in use are:
Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Eleventh Amendment (Amendment XI) to the United States Constitution was passed by Congress on March 4, 1794 and ratified by the states on February 7, 1795. It deals with each state's sovereign immunity and was adopted to overrule the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ""Chisholm v. Georgia""."
Lawsuits against states.
"The idea of sovereign immunity originated in English common law. It was also proposed by political theorists like Thomas Hobbes and Jean Bodin. The founding fathers of the Constitution were aware of the traditional doctrine that states were immune from private lawsuits. Several Anti-Federalists were afraid that Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, which declares that the federal judicial power extends to suits ""between a State and Citizens of another State"", would override that doctrine."
"The Eleventh Amendment was a direct reaction to an unpopular ruling by the Supreme Court in ""Chisholm v. Georgia"" (1793). In ""Chisholm"" the Court said federal courts had the power to hear lawsuits brought by citizens against US states. Also, that states were not immune to these cases. The Eleventh Amendment reversed this decision and does not allow cases brought against a state by a citizen of another state or country. It says nothing about a citizen bringing a suit against their own state."
"In ""Ex parte Young"", the Supreme Court decision allowed suits in federal courts against officials acting on behalf of states of the union to proceed despite the State's sovereign immunity, when the State acted unconstitutionally."
The Eleventh Amendment is one of five amendments that overturned earlier Supreme Court decisions.
Johnnie Cochran
"Johnnie L Cochran, Jr. (October 2, 1937 – March 29, 2005) was an American lawyer. He is best known for his part in the acquittal of O. J. Simpson for the murder of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. Cochran also represented many different celebrities and victims. Cochran became known as an early advocate for the victims of police brutality. Cochran helped Sean Combs win an acquittal after being indicted on stolen weapons charges and bribery in 2001. After the case, he decided to retire."
"On March 29, 2005, Cochran died from a brain tumor in his home in Los Angeles, aged 67."
Crypt
"A crypt is a room, or group of rooms, underneath a church where bodies are put after a person dies. It usually has coffins, religious items, and other trinkets for the dead."
Pokémon Sun and Moon
"are two role-playing video games. They are published by The Pokémon Company and developed by Game Freak. They were released for the Nintendo 3DS. The games were released on 18 November 2016 in North America, Australia and Japan, and 23 November 2016 in Europe, commemorating the ""Pokémon"" franchise's 20th anniversary."
"On February 25, the games' existence was leaked after the trademarks were found on the EU's Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market's website. ""Sun"" and ""Moon"" were officially announced in a Pokémon Nintendo Direct."
Story.
"Pokémon Sun and Moon take place in a region called Alola. Alola has warm weather and is made up of four large islands. The player is given a Pokémon and goes on a journey around Alola. The player can catch and raise other Pokémon as they explore. While exploring, the player sometimes has to fight Team Skull. Team Skull are a group of people who want to destroy things and cause trouble. And some Pokémon have a special Alolan form!"
Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern
"The exact definitions of what is domestic violence vary by country. In general though, the legal definitions only include the acts, and their punishment. People from sociology and psychology also look at the motivations (why the person became violent)."
"Like other forms of violence, domestic violence often has a repeating pattern, known as cycle of violence, or cycle of abuse. If violence is unreported, it may get worse over time."
"The person becoming violent often wants to get more power and more control over another person. When the cycle of violence starts people are said to be ""losing their temper""."
Domestic violence can be a cause for becoming homeless.
"Most of the time, the victims of domestic violence are women. They may experience more severe forms of violence. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 1 in 3 of all women are subject to domestic violence at some point in their life. Women are also more likely than men to use intimate partner violence in self-defense."
"Some countries do not have good laws covering domestic violence. In these countries domestic violence may be permitted, especially in the case where the woman is suspected of infidelity. There seems to be a correlation between the level of gender equality, and the level of domestic violence. Countries with less gender equality have higher rates of domestic violence."
"Very often, incidents of domestic violence are not reported; this is true for both men and women. There is a social stigma: Most people believe that women are victims of domestic violence, most of the time. That way, healthcare providers often overlook men who are victims of domestic violence."
Children.
"If we go back a century or two, we find that in some countries, children were often beaten, both at home and at school. Now that is much rarer, and may be forbidden in law. The key term to search for this topic is ""corporal punishment""."
Forms.
"There are different forms of domestic abuse, not all of which are violent:"
Emersons Green
"Emersons Green is an area with lots of houses, just to the north of Bristol, in England."
"It used to be just farming land between Mangotsfield and Downend, but in the 1990s houses, schools and shops were built."
Emersons Green is in South Gloucestershire.
"There is a large shopping area in Emersons Green, including Sainsbury's, Boots, Lidl and Argos. There are also restaurants, three pubs and some cafés."
Archaeopteryx
"Archaeopteryx is one of the most important fossils ever discovered. It is a flying dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic, about 150 million years ago. It shows the evolutionary link between non-avian theropod dinosaurs and birds, but it is not the ancestor of modern birds."
"The first ""Archaeopteryx"" was found in 1860 near Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. Today, ten skeletons and one feather of ""Archaeopteryx"" have been found."
"""Archaeopteryx"" was a small carnivorous dinosaur with feathers and wings. It had a mouth with teeth, claws on the hands and a long tail. Today, it is known that dromaeosaurs, and possibly most other extinct theropods, looked like birds and that many had feathers. When they are born, today's South American hoatzin have claws on their wings when they are young, just like ""Archaeopteryx""."
Analysis.
"Thomas Henry Huxley (""Darwin's bulldog""), who was a comparative anatomist, made a study of this nearly 150 years ago. He compared ""Archaeopteryx"" with a small theropod dinosaur, ""Compsognathus"". Both of the fossils came from the same place: Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period, about 144 million years ago. He showed that both were very similar except for the front limbs and feathers of ""Archaeopteryx"". E.D. Cope also came to the same conclusion."
"Huxley's study showed the basic relationship between birds and reptiles. He united them under the title of Sauropsida. His papers on ""Archaeopteryx"" and the origin of birds have been of great interest ever since. Huxley concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs."
Status today.
"""Archaeopteryx"" used to be considered the first bird. Nowadays, it is not the only fossil of a bird-like dinosaur. A similar species called ""Anchiornis huxlei"" lived from 160 to 155 million years ago. It had feathers on both front and rear legs, and could probably glide. It may or may not have had some ability to fly. This discovery means we cannot say ""Archaeopteryx"" is the first known bird, but its contribution to science has been huge. We now know for sure that a whole group of small theropod dinosaurs had feathers, and that flight was a later, secondary, use of feathers. The first use of feathers was temperature regulation, and probably also signalling (see ""Epidexipteryx"")."
"Many scientists nowadays do not consider ""Archaeopteryx"" a true bird (=a member of the lineage Aves). They only consider it a relative of birds. This classification does not reflect a different evolutionary hypothesis, it simply defines Aves (birds) less broadly."
Directly ancestral or not?
"It may be that ""Archaeopteryx"" is not directly ancestral to modern birds, but it is still a fine transitional fossil."

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS)
"Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is the name of a disease that normally begins in childhood. It causes Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics. The symptoms begin very suddenly. If it is not treated at the beginning the disease can be there also in adults. The reason for PANS can be a bacteria called ""Group A streptococcus"" (PANDAS type) or an immunologic reaction to other pathogens like certain bacteria or viruses. (PITANDS type)."
Signs and symptoms.
Patients suffering from PANS show sudden begin OCD and/or tics and at least two of these symptoms:
Similar conditions.
"PANS shares symptoms with other diseases. Therefore diagnostic tests must be done to exclude other conditions like Sydenham's chorea, lupus erythematosus, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Tourette syndrome. Proof of acute rheumatic fever would exclude a PANS classification."
Treatment.
There is no direct treatment for PANS available yet. This means today only some of the symptoms can be treated. But scientists are already working to develop treatments with antibiotics and immune-based therapies that can heal the disease. Nevertheless early and consequent treatment of the symptoms seems to be important. Otherwise the disease can become a lifelong problem.
Province of Cattaro
"The Cattaro (Italian province), called in Italian ""Provincia italiana di Cattaro"" was an administrative section of the ""Governorate of Dalmatia"", created during World War II by the Kingdom of Italy with ""Regio Decreto Legge"" of May 18, 1941."
Characteristics.
"The newly created province had approximately the borders of the Albania veneta, that was part of the Republic of Venice until 1797 in southern Dalmatia."
"In the province of Cattaro there were the cities of Cattaro, Perasto, Risan|, Teodo and Castelnuovo di Cattaro. The province had a small territory around the ""Bocche di Cattaro"" (Boka Kotorska) of 547 km² and nearly 39,800 inhabitants. The island of Saseno in Albania was annexed to the province, after separating it from the province of Zara (since 1920 this little island was part of Italy)."
"The population was mostly Slav, but there were nearly 3,000 autochthonous Italians, descendants from the Dalmatian Italians since Roman times: they were concentrated in the areas of Cattaro and Perasto."
History.
"Italian General Vittorio Ambrosio conquered in a few days all the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, and occupied the area around Cattaro (called ""Kotor"" since 1919) in April 1941."
"The new Italian province of Cattaro was created by order of Italian leader Benito Mussolini the next month, with the ""May 19 Treaty between Italy and Croatia"". Francesco Scassellati Sforzolini was named ""Prefect"" of the Cattaro province, serving from June 1941 to June 1943."
The governorship of the Cattaro province (and all the Governorate of Dalmatia) was held by Giuseppe Bastianini until January 1943 when he was recalled to Italy to join the cabinet; his place as governor was taken by Francesco Giunta.
"In summer 1941 the Italian government started a policy of Italianization in all the Governorate of Dalmatia. New Italian schools were opened in the ""Bocche di Cattaro"" (now called Boka Kotorska). Administrative personnel from Italy moved to Cattaro city (nearly 6,700 Dalmatian Italians took refuge in Italy after the creation of Jugoslavia in 1919, and many of them were offered work if they returned to settle with their families in the Governorate of Dalmatia). Bastianini started needed public works, building hospitals, sewage and roads in the area."
"Some 500 Jews took refuge in the Cattaro province, after escaping the Ustasha and Nazi German persecution in their areas of former Jugoslavia."
"The province was spared the bloody guerrilla, that happened in the rest of Italian-occupied Montenegro, until mid-September 1943 when Germans took control of the area and the Italian province of Cattaro disappeared. The Italian Division ""Emilia"" of the ""XIV° Corpo d'Armata"" fought the German occupation of the Province of Cattaro, having 597 deaths e 963 wounded soldiers, from September 9 until September 16, 1943."
"""Comuni"" of the Province of Cattaro."
"These were 15 ""comuni"" (municipalities) in the Italian Province of Cattaro. The first name is in Italian, the second in Montenegrin-Serbian and the third in Croatian:"
A.N.T. Farm
"A.N.T. Farm is an American sitcom. The first episode played on television on May 6, 2011. It continued as a regular series starting on June 17, 2011. The pilot episode, ""TransplANTed"" aired after the last episode of ""The Suite Life on Deck"". The show was created by Dan Signer. He was a screenwriter and co-executive producer of ""The Suite Life on Deck"". He also made the YTV series ""Mr. Young"". Disney Channel approved the show in mid-November 2010.

Kappa
"Kappa (uppercase/lowercase Κ κ) is the letter of the Greek alphabet used to represent the ""k"" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 20. Letters that came from it include the Roman K and Cyrillic К."
"The letter κ always stands for the sound ""k"" in Greek. It is customary to transliterate (re-write) κ as ""c"" in English, but this is somewhat problematic since c is pronounced as ""s"" before e, i and y (which does not happen in Greek)."
"In mathematics, the lowercase formula_1 is used to represent the curvature of a curve, while the uppercase Κ is used to represent an ordinal number which is also a cardinal number."

Văn Cao
"Văn Cao (born Nguyễn Văn Cao; 15 November 1923 – 10 July 1995) was a famous Vietnamese composer. He wrote the Vietnamese national anthem, """". He, along with Pham Duy and Trinh Cong Son, is widely considered one of the three most important people in modern (non-classical) Vietnamese music."
Kojiki
"Kojiki or ""Furukotofumi"" (), also called in English the ""Records of Ancient Matters"", is the oldest book known in Japan. It was written 712 CE, and dedicated to Empress Gemmei. The Kojiki is a book about Japanese mythology (Shinto), legends, songs, genealogies, oral traditions, and semi-historical accounts down to 641 BCE. The book mixes the legends of first emperor of Japan and several others with stories about the gods. Therefore, it is difficult to know which parts of the Kojiki are real and which parts are legend. According to legend, all the emperors of Japan are descended from Amaterasu, the sun goddess."
"The Kojiki is written in Chinese, but the way the Japanese wrote it is by using the pronunciation of the Chinese characters and not the meanings of them. In other words, a person who can read Chinese will not be able to read the Kojiki unless they also know how to speak Japanese. It includes many Japanese names and some phrases."
Sections.
"The Kojiki is divided into three parts: the , the and the ."
Hindu philosophy
"There are mainly six branches of Hindu Philosophy. These six schools of philosophy have been the result of ancient Indian thought and usually termed as ""Sad Darsana"". These are:"
"Among the above six schools of Hindu Philosophy, Vedanta is by far very popular. The Vedanta accepts the authority of the knowledge portions of the Vedas, called Upanishads."
Guru
"In the Sanskrit language, guru means teacher. Eastern religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and newer movements such as Transcendental Meditation use ""guru"" as a title. They give it to a teacher (or guide) of religious matters."
"In Western usage, any person who has followers may be called a guru, even if he is followed for things other than religion or philosophy. A person with knowledge or expertise may be called a guru if he influences by personal teaching. Modern terms which have a rather similar meaning are mentor and tutor."
Satguru.
"Many Hindus have a satguru as well.The word ""guru"" means the one who removes the darkness from our heart. Satguru means true guru or true teacher. The title means that his students know that the guru can be trusted and will lead them to enlightenment. A satguru is a great soul who has realized God and is able to lead others along the path. God shines out from the satguru more brightly than from other people because he is very pure and enlightened. The satguru is devoted full time to religious life, is unmarried and has given up all possessions, personal life, family and friends. He has received an initiation from his satguru that gives him great spiritual power and authority. He can teach parents how to raise children, adults how to avoid problems and overcome any challenge in life, and in general he can make people feel close to God."
Moksha
"Moksha is the ultimate goal of personal spiritual development for some schools of Hinduism. It is the equivalent of Nirvana in Buddhism. In the Sanskrit language, ""moksha"" means freedom. It is as a state of eternal bliss and emptiness. According to Vedanta life is an endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth into a physical universe. Hindu scriptures describe Moksha as the spiritual liberation from this cycle and the achievement of an eternal and blissful emptiness that transcends all of the joys, pain, and sorrow of the physical body or corporeal life. It is the goal of Hindu practitioners to achieve Moksha (freedom/liberation from the material world) through the practice of Yoga viz Jnana Yoga(knowledge), Karma Yoga(work), and Bhakti Yoga (through reciting prayers and worshipping God)."
"Moksha is a Vedic term. Scholars disagree about the precise relationship between the Moksha of Vedanta Hinduism and the Nirvana of Buddhism, but there is agreement that they are closely related historically and philosophically. Similarities can be found between Moksha and some concepts found in the Upanishads. Hindu texts explain the Moksha as Sat-Chit-Anand [True blissness of soul by separating the soul from the physical body by practising Dhyan and Yoga ]. Moksha originates from the Sanskrit word, moksa."
Overcharge
"Overcharge is an economic term used in legal discourse about price fixing violations. An overcharge is the difference between what a buyer or seller ""actually"" paid for a good purchased from a cartel and what the buyer or seller ""would have"" paid in the absence of a price-fixing cartel. The total amount of the overcharges paid by customers of a cartel is the major component of damages that can be recovered by plaintiffs in private antitrust suits. Under U.S. federal antitrust law, buyers injured by cartel overcharges are entitled to triple the overcharges that they are able to prove in court."
"The overcharge has a one-to-one relationship to the Lerner Index, the most common measure of market power in economics. Both measures employ the same numerator (PM - PC), where PM is the observed market price and PC is the competitive benchmark price, but use different denominators. The overcharge ratio is (PM-PC)/PC, whereas the Lerner Index is (PM-PC)/PM. Both ratios are zero when a market is perfectly competitive or a cartel is ineffective in raising prices. The Lerner Index has an upper limit of one when the pure monopoly price is charged in a market. The overcharge has no upper limit."
Rye House railway station
"Rye House railway station is in Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire, England. It is on the Hertford East branch of the West Anglia Main Line, and train services are provided by Abellio Greater Anglia."
Services.
"The typical off-peak service is two trains per hour to London Liverpool Street via Tottenham Hale, and two trains per hour to Hertford East."
List of London Underground stations
"The London Underground is a metro system in the United Kingdom. It serves Greater London and the nearby districts of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. London Underground was first opened in 1863 which makes it the oldest underground metro system in the world."
Stations.
"This list includes all stations on the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway. Listed for each station is the line or lines serving it, the local authority and London Travelcard zone in which it is located, the date it opened, previous names and passenger usage statistics in millions per year."
"There are three instances where two separate stations share the same name: Edgware Road, Hammersmith and Canary Wharf. Although the Hammersmith &amp; City line platforms at Paddington are on the other side of the mainline station from the platforms of the other Underground lines, it is treated as a single station. It is currently shown this way on the Tube map, but has been shown as two stations at times. Canary Wharf has separate Jubilee line and Docklands Light Railway stations, which are shown as one station on current tube map."
Ratatat
"Ratatat is a Electronic Rock/Electronica duo with guitarist Mike Stroud and synthesizer driver and producer Evan Mast. The two met as collee students in Skidmore, started working together in 2001 under the name ""Cherry"". In 2004 they published their debut album Ratatat which includes songs such as ""Seventeen Years"", ""Germany to Germany"", and ""Desert Eagle"". Following, in 2006, Classics, then LP3, in 2008 was released."
"Other works done by Ratatat are single albums and remixes of other musicians. Single albums include ""Seventeen Years"", ""Germany to Germany"", ""Wildcat"", ""Lex"", ""Loud Pipes"", ""Shiller"", ""Mirando"", and ""Shempi"". Their most recent remix album ""Ratatat Remixes No. 2"" featured 14 remixes featuring: Young Buck, T.I, Ludacris, The Notorious B.I.G, Jay Z, Z-Ro, Devin the Dude, Juvenile, Beanie Sigel, Despot, Memphis Bleek, Slim Thug, Bun B, Young Jeezy, Kanye West, Beans, Saigon, and U.G.K."
The band is known for their unique use of eletronica style music that emphasizes guitar towards the front while keeping the beat flow in the background.
Their songs were featured in various media. Some examples would be :
"""Seventeen Years"" was featured in the 2008 movie ""Cloverfield""."
"""Loud Pipes"" was featured in the PlayStation game ""MLB 07: The Show""."
"""Dura"" was used in CSI Season 9, Episode 7 ""Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda""."
"""Montanita"" was used in Season 2 - Episode 2 of the NBC show Chuck"
"They have currently gone through their spring 2009 US tour, and their next upcoming show is scheduled to be in Arendal on June 23, 2009."
Binary form
"Binary form (also know as AB Form or movement of continuity) is a type of form of music pieces. The word Binary means ""in two parts."" The word Form is a kind of guideline for composers when they write a piece of music. So, binary form means ""An outline in two parts."" A musical piece in binary form is a musical piece with two sections."
Binary form was popular in the Baroque times and was often used for movements in sonatas for keyboard instruments. Each part of a binary form piece of music are usually repeated.
Minuets.
"Binary form was most commonly used in the Baroque era for short dances called minuets. The minuet's two parts are usually labeled as ""A"" and ""B."" In the A section of a minuet, the exposition is stated. This section almost always is repeated a couple times. The beginning part of the B section develops a slightly new musical idea, usually going to the dominant key, to add variation. Then it returns to the ""A"" key at the end. Some famous composers of minuets include Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel."
"The notion of ""experience"" has been criticised."
"The term ""Religious empiricism"" is seen as highly problematic. Karl Barth saidf that the term was wrong altogether. Some influential modern scholars holding this liberal theological view are Charles Raven and the Oxford physicist/theologian Charles Coulson."
"Robert Sharf points out that ""experience"" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of ""experience"" introduces a false idea of duality between ""experiencer"" and ""experienced"". In kensho there is no duality of observer and observed. ""Pure experience"" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a given tradition may even determine what ""experience"" someone has; this means that this ""experience"" is not the ""proof"" of the teaching, but a ""result"" of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by ""cleansing the doors of perception"", would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence."
Bangladesh A
"The Bangladesh A cricket team, simply known as Bangladesh A, also known as Bangladesh Emerging cricket team, is a cricket team representing Bangladesh, and is the second tier of international Bangladeshi cricket below the full Bangladesh national cricket team."
Bangladesh Cricket Board
"The Bangladesh Cricket board (, also known as BCB, is the governing body of cricket in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Cricket Board first became an associate member of the International Cricket Council in 1977 and on 26 June 2000 became a Full Member. The board has its headquarter at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka."

Flydubai Flight 981
"Flydubai Flight 981 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Dubai International Airport, in the United Arab Emirates, The Boeing 737-800 crashed while landing at Rostov-on-Don Airport in Russia. There were no survivors, a total of 62 people between passengers and crew lost their lives in the tragic accident."
Crew.
"The captain was 37-year-old Aristos Sokratous, from Cyprus. He had over 6,000 hours of total flying time, including 4,905 hours on the Boeing 737. Sokratous was promoted to captain a year and a half before the crash. At the time of the crash, he had intended to quit the airline after accepting a job from Ryanair, which would allow him to be based with his family in Cyprus. His wife was due to give birth to their first child a few weeks after the crash. According to several Flydubai staff members, Sokratous decided to leave the airline mainly because of fatigue and lifestyle issues."
"The first officer, 36-year-old Alejandro Cruz Álava, was from Spain. He had more than 5,700 hours of flying time, with 1,100 of them on the Boeing 737. He started flying with Flydubai in 2013, two years before the crash, and had previously flown two regional airlines in the Spanish Canary Islands – Binter and Naysa – before joining the company."
"According to the final report by the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), the accident flight was both pilots' first ever flight to Rostov. The captain had experience flying into other Russian airports, but the first officer did not."
List of programs broadcast by Toon Disney
"This is a list of television programs that have been broadcast by Toon Disney (now Disney XD) in the United States. The channel was launched on April 18, 1998, as a spinoff of Disney Channel, and aired mostly syndicated animated programming, ranging from action to comedy."
"The first program broadcast on Toon Disney was the Mickey Mouse segment from ""Fantasia"" titled ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"". It was followed by a sampling of other Mickey Mouse shorts and episodes of ""Timon and Pumbaa"", ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"", ""Goof Troop"", ""TaleSpin"", and ""Aladdin""."
"The list does not include the programs that were introduced as Jetix, a block on Toon Disney that ran from 2004 to 2009."
European wars of religion
"In the Protestant Reformation, a number of people criticizes the Roman Catholic Church. People such as Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli or Jan Hus were reformers: In the end, each of them had followers which started their own church. Today, most of these Churches are known as Protestant. In the European wars of religion, countries, but also local leaders fought for influence. Most of the time one side of the warring fraction was Catholics, the other was Protestants."
Examples of these wars:
Hot air systems.
"Hot air systems use hot air to heat the floor, similar to the Romans' systems. However, air does not hold heat very well, and these systems aren't recommended for residential use."
Hot water systems.
"Hot water systems are the most popular and cost-effective systems for cold climates. In this type of system, water is heated by a boiler and pumped through pipes laid underneath the floor. Hot water systems can also be combined with solar thermal energy to make them more environmentally friendly. Solar thermal energy uses sunlight to heat water, which can then be used in the underfloor heating system."
"Hot water systems can also be run in reverse by running cold water through the pipes to cool the building. However, this technology is difficult to use properly and can result in condensation on the floor, which can ruin hardwood floors or rugs and make people more likely to fall."
Electric systems.
"Electric systems are made of electric cables that are laid underneath the floor. Electricity is then used to heat the cables, and this type of system can be turned on or off much faster than a hot water system. However, these systems are often more expensive than hot water systems because of the high prices of electricity, especially if the hot water system includes the use of solar thermal energy. The high cost of an electric heating system can be reduced if the floor can be set to heat during non-peak hours, such as late at night, and is left turned off during the day. Electric systems are also less environmentally friendly because electricity is usually produced by burning fossil fuels, which increases carbon emissions."
Underfloor installation.
"Underfloor radiant heating systems can be installed as either wet or dry systems. Wet systems are laid down and then concrete is poured over them. Concrete floors hold heat very well, but can take a long time to absorb the heat. Dry systems run in open air space between the foundation and the floor, but can be less efficient because they have to heat the air too. However, dry systems are much easier to reach if the system breaks or leaks."
"Any kind of flooring can be used with underfloor heating, but ceramic tiles are the most popular floor material because they transfer and store heat well. Materials like wood, carpet, or linoleum tile decrease the heat transfer from the underfloor system and the system must be set at a higher temperature if any of these materials are used."
Wall and overhead heating.
"Wall and overhead radiant heating systems are usually made of aluminum panels hung on the walls or ceiling. Like underfloor radiant heating, these panels can be heated by either hot water or electricity. However, panels heated by hot water often leak, so electric panels are the most common. These panels can't heat as much area as an underfloor system, but they can be quickly turned on and off when a person enters or leaves the room. Electric panels can reduce energy costs if panels are left turned off in empty rooms."
Outdoor heating.
"Using radiant heating outdoors is much more practical than heating air because the air is always moving outside. Outdoor radiant heaters are almost always electric devices, and usually portable, although it is possible to have underfloor radiant heating installed under a patio."
74 (number)
Seventy-four is a number. It comes after seventy-three and before seventy-five.
Top Gear
Top Gear is a television show on the BBC. The show is all about cars and other vehicles. They test new cars to see how fast they go. They also test really old cars and do crazy stuff with them. They usually rate cars that the normal person wouldn't be able to afford. The show started as a regular car show but has changed over time to what it is now. It uses comedy to attract viewers which are now estimated to be 350 million.
Segments.
Races.
The show often has long distance races. They usually race a fast car against a different form of transportation like trains and boats. They are called 'epic' races.
They also have smaller races where they match up cars of different times to see which one outperforms the other.
Challenge.
The challenge part of the show is about different stunts of the most ridiculous things the show can come up with. One time they jumped a bus over a row of motorcycles (instead of the motorcycle jumping over buses).
"Recently, the show has started using the phrase ""How hard can it be?"" for the challenge segment. They put themselves in different situations that a normal person probably wouldn't get a chance to experience."
Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car.
Once during every episode (except some specials) they bring a celebrity on stage. They show footage of the celebrity driving an average car around a racetrack. They put the time it took for them to complete a lap of the track on a board with the names of all of the other celebrities who drove the same course.
Power Laps.
Power laps are one lap around the Top Gear Test Track. They will take any car that can drive and will see how fast it can make it around the track. The vehicles must be cars and they must be road legal.
Billy Preston
"Billy Preston (September 2, 1946 - June 5, 2006) was an American R&amp;B musician. He is best known for his piano and organ playing."
"Preston began playing piano when he was three years old. He worked with many other musicians including Aretha Franklin, Sammy Davis Jr., Quincy Jones, Eric Clapton, the Jackson 5 and the Rolling Stones."
"He worked on The Beatles's last album, ""Let It Be"", in 1969, including the song ""Get Back"". Many people thought that Preston would join the group, but the Beatles broke up shortly afterwards. He later worked with George Harrison, who had been a Beatle."
"Preston's biggest success also came from working with another musician. He did a duet with Syreeta Garrett on ""With You I'm Born Again"" in 1979. It sold over a million copies and reached Number 2 in the United Kingdom singles chart."
Preston was gay. He died of respiratory failure after being in a coma from a heart infection.
Pop
A pop is an onomatopoeic term for a quick sharp explosion.
Pop or POP could also mean:
Computer virus
"A computer virus is a program that is able to copy itself when it is run. Often, computer viruses are run as a part of other programs. Any program that is affected by the virus is ""infected"". Biological viruses also work that way, as they copy themselves as part of other organisms. This is how the computer virus got its name."
"In addition to copying itself, a computer virus can also execute instructions that cause harm. For this reason, computer viruses affect security. They are part of malware."
"Very often, the term is also used for other kinds of malware, such as trojan horses and worms. Even though this is wrong, it may be difficult to tell the difference between different kinds of malware; they often occur together, and only an expert may be able to tell them apart. Such programs also fit more than one category."
"Computer viruses are created for a cause, sometimes they are created to spread political messages and they are also created to hack some system files."
"Computer viruses are spread through many ways. Some of the common ways of spreading are through downloads, email attachments, removable hardwares, and so on. Most viruses are very dangerous kind of malware."
Kinds of computer viruses.
There are different kinds of computer viruses:
Limited user rights can limit the spread of a virus.
"In the beginning, operating systems on personal computers (or PC) did not have the concept of access control. There were no ""users"", everyone could do everything. Modern operating systems have the concept of access control. There can be more than one user and some users may have more ""privileges"" than others. Certain users may only have access to certain files and are unable to access others. Other users may be able to modify or delete certain files. These privileges can be specified for each file."
"The damage a virus can cause is influenced by the rights the user has; if the user has no rights to write to certain places in the system, the virus will not be able to spread to those places."
"Another problem is that sometimes the system for rights management may be available, but that it is not used by default. This is the case with systems such as Windows NT or Windows XP, where by default all users have same rights."
Antivirus software.
"Antivirus software can protect computers against known viruses. Some antivirus software scan files and compare a hash code for each file with its database of hash codes (or ""signature""). If the code matches, it has likely found a virus. This way of doing things has created some problems. It will only protect against viruses whose hash code is known. The companies that wrote the antivirus need to keep the virus signatures up-to-date and need to give this information to the PC to be protected."
"There are two possible modes of scanning: Either the file is scanned ""on demand"" (or ""manually""), or it is scanned when the system registers an access to the file called ""on access""."
"Antivirus software cannot offer full protection, even in the case the virus is known. Some viruses use something called polymorphic code to change their signature every time they move. No matter how many signatures the company has, they will not be able to stop these types of viruses."
"Another way that antivirus software can protect against viruses is to use heuristics. Instead of knowing each virus by its signature, heuristic antivirus software look at the behavior of other software. If a software does something that seems bad, the antivirus software steps-in to stop it. Since every step needs to be watched, this is a slow way to do things."
"""Live system""."
"The best protection against viruses can be obtained by using a system that boots off a read-only medium, such as a compact disc (called CD), digital versatile disc (called DVD), or USB flash drive (called USB) that does not allow write access to hard disk (or other removable media). This limits the usability of the computer as it is not possible to save documents or install new programs. Only -R media (not -RW) should be used, and the media should be finalized to prevent creating a new session that might possibly contain a virus."
Mac
"Harold Pinter CH CBE (10 October 1930 – 24 December 2008) was a British playwright, screenwriter, director and actor. Pinter was Jewish. He was born and raised in Hackney, east London."
"His plays include: ""The Birthday Party"", ""The Homecoming"" and ""Betrayal"", all of which he adapted into movies. His adaptations of others' works include: ""The Servant"", ""The Go-Between"", ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"", ""The Trial"" and ""Sleuth""."
"The critic Irving Wardle called Pinter's early plays ""comedies of menace"". He meant that the plays begin with an apparently innocent situation. The situation becomes both threatening and ""absurd"" as Pinter's characters behave in strange ways. Pinter acknowledged that Samuel Beckett influenced his early work. They became friends, sending each other drafts of their works in progress for comments."
Pinter was married to Vivien Merchant from 1956 until they divorced in 1980. He was married to Antonia Fraser from 1980 until his death. He was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in 2001 and died from the disease in London seven years later when it metastasised to his liver.
Structured settlement
A Structured settlement is an insurance or financial arrangement that is negotiated to end a lawsuit. It is a legal agreement through which an insurance company agrees to make regular payments to a specific individual over a period of time.
"Structured settlements created as a way for insurance companies to payout settlements in installments as opposed to large lump sums. Structured settlements may benefit injured people whose settlements might result in their owing taxes, by allowing them to reduce or delay tax payments. They may also benefit younger people or disabled people by providing periodic payments of money over an extended period of time."
"Structured settlements require the paper holder (a name for the person who receives payments from the settlement) to wait before they will get money, by spreading payments over a number of years. However there are companies offering to buy such a structured settlement for upfront money. For example, a company might offer to buy a settlement that would be paid in 20 yearly payments for a one-time payment of lower value. Such financing may need to be approved by judge and the insurance company."
"In the United States, the sale of a structured settlement may result in tax liability under the Internal Revenue Code."
Die Fledermaus
"Die Fledermaus () is an opera by Johann Strauss II. Its first performance took place on April 5, 1874 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, Austria. The opera has been presented on New Year's Eve in Vienna since the early 1930s. ""Die Fledermaus"" is based on the French play ""Le Réveillon"" (1872) by Meilhac and Halévy."
Term life insurance
"Term life insurance or term assurance is life insurance that provides coverage for some sum of money during a given period of time. After the term stated in original contract expires, the sum of money paid to insurance company will need to be renegotiated and will often increase. Term insurance is the cheapest way of buying life insurance."
"Term life insurance is the original form of life insurance and is different to permanent insurance because its rates will not go up, and there is a fixed term contract, which will end in the future. Permanent life insurance contracts can last until the death of insured person, but the rates will slowly increase over time."
"Because term life insurance is only death insurance, it is used to cover mortgages (guarantee that the bank will receive their money), payment to the families (upon death of insured person his family will usually receive repayment for funeral costs and in some cases will get some money), repayment of debts."
"The simplest form of term life insurance is a one-year contract. The death benefit will be paid if the insured dies. If he does not die during this the coverage period no claims are paid, and a new contract must be written."
"Term life insurance is the most affordable type of life insurance because it is temporary and builds no cash value inside the policy over time. Term life is “pure protection”, not an investment."
Level term life insurance is a type of term life insurance plan that has guaranteed level rates and amounts of coverage for the entire term of the policy.
"Level term life plans may offer coverage with level rates for a period of 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. Some term life insurance plans provide life insurance to age 65 or 70, but your rate will increase after the “level term” period."
Eisteddfod
The Eisteddfod is a Welsh festival of literature and music. The idea of the festival goes back at least to the 12th century.
Denbighshire
"Denbighshire is a shire in northeast Wales, in the United Kingdom. It has over 90,000 people. The largest town is Rhyl."
Rhyl
"Rhyl (), pronounced ""Rill"", is a seaside resort and community in Denbighshire in North Wales. It is in the historic county of Flintshire and the preserved county of Clwyd. In 2011, the town's population was 25,149. This makes it one of the largest settlements in North Wales."
"The town was once an elegant Victorian resort. Influences from Liverpool and Manchester, both cities in England, after World War II changed the town. By 1990, the town had declined. However, since then the town has had major regeneration."
Veal
"Veal is the meat of young cattle (calves), as opposed to beef from older cattle. Though veal can be made from a calf of either sex and any breed, most veal comes from male calves of dairy cattle breeds. Veal has a tender texture."
As food.
"Veal has been an important ingredient in Italian and French cuisine since ancient times. The veal is often in the form of cutlets, such as the Italian cotoletta or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel. Some classic French veal dishes include: fried escalopes, fried veal Grenadines (small thick fillet steaks), stuffed paupiettes, roast joints and blanquettes. As veal is lower in fat than many meats, care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough. Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce. Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian-American dish consisting of breaded veal cutlets."
Animal welfare.
Veal is a controversial issue in terms of animal welfare.
"Many animal welfare groups, who strongly focus on factory farming, try to educate consumers about several veal production procedures that they consider to be inhumane. This education has been successful in creating pressure on the industry, resulting in recently announced changes in the methods used by the veal industry."
"A strong animal welfare movement about veal started in the 1980s with the release of photographs of veal calves tied up in crates where they could barely move. After people saw these photographs, people started buying less veal. They have not started buying more again."
Many veal farmers listened to the concern of their customers and have started improving conditions in their veal farms.
"The American Veal Association has announced they plan to stop the use of crates by 2017, which is often the main focus of controversy in veal farming. Strauss Brands is the first veal packer in the US to raise veal calves completely tether free and group raised since December 31, 2008."
"Though a lot of people think the crates are bad because the calves can't move much and get sick, the Veal Quality Assurance Program &amp; Veal Issues Management Program industry fact sheet, and the Ontario Veal Association say the crates are important for keeping out diseases and keeping the calves from getting hurt. They also state that it lets veal farmers provide more personal attention to veal calves."
"Other uses for male dairy calves include raising bob veal (slaughter at 2 or 3 days old), raising calves as ""red veal"" without the harsh food restrictions needed to create pale meat (resulting in fewer antibiotic treatments and fewer slaughtered calves), and as dairy beef."
"When it comes to the centuries-old method of free raised veal, calves never experience the stress of confinement, separation from their mothers and herd-mates, or an unnatural diet. Many veal producers are realizing this, and the demand for free raised veal is rapidly increasing."
"In 2007, less than 5% of veal calves were raised in a group environment. In 2009, this had increased to 35%."
Veal crate bans.
"The following shows where veal crates have been banned, or are currently in the process of being banned:"
Europe.
"Veal crates became illegal in the UK in 1990, and a full ban has been placed for the entire European Union, as of 2007. Switzerland, with its substantial dairy industry, continues to use crates."
"Veal calf production as such is not allowed in many Northern European countries, such as in Finland. In Finland it is illegal to give an animal food the caretaker knows is bad for it, and it is also illegal to not give the animal enough food."
USA.
"Crates are slowly being banned in the United States. As stated above, several large veal producers are working on getting rid of veal crates, as well as the American Veal Association."
State-by-state veal crate bans are as follows:
Current active legislation in:
Hyssop
"Hyssop (""Hyssopus"") is a genus of about 1012 species of herbaceous or semi-woody plants in the family Lamiaceae. They are native to the east Mediterranean to central Asia."
"They are aromatic, with upright branched stems up to 60 cm long covered with fine hairs at the tips. The small blue flowers are on the upper part of the branches during summer. By far the best-known species is the herb hyssop (""H. officinalis""). It is widely grown outside its native area in the Mediterranean."
"The anise hyssop, ""Agastache foeniculum"" (also called blue giant hyssop) is a very different plant and not a close relative, although both are in the mint family. Anise hyssop is native to much of north-central and northern North America."
Origin of name.
"The name 'hyssop' can be traced back almost unchanged through the Greek word (""hyssopos"") and Hebrew word (""ezov""). The Book of Exodus in the Bible records that the blood of the sacrifices was applied to the doorposts using hyssop on the night of Passover. Its vomit-inducing properties are also mentioned in the Book of Psalms. In the New Testament, a sponge soaked in sour wine or vinegar was stuck on a branch of hyssop and offered to Jesus of Nazareth on the cross just before he died. Both Matthew and Mark mention this but refer to the plant using the general term (""kalamos""), which is translated as ""reed"" or ""stick."""
Seeds.
"Slangs for oral sex is common in Western cultures, for example: ""going down on"", ""giving a blowjob"", ""giving head"", or ""eating out"". The technical term for oral sex is fellatio if performed on a male and cunnilingus if performed on a female. When a man performs fellatio on himself, it is called autofellatio, and autocunnilingus if a woman performs cunnilingus on herself. Few men and women are able to do this."
"People can get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex, such as herpes (which can be passed between the mouth and groin), HIV and even oral cancer."
Anal sex.
"Anal sex is when an erect penis or other device made for sexual pleasure is inserted into a sexual partner's anus. Anal sex with a female does not lead to pregnancy by itself, however, semen can leak out of the anus and enter into the vagina, and pregnancy may rarely occur. Anal sex can still pass sexually transmitted diseases from one partner to another. It can also be very unhealthy for the body because the skin around the anus can tear, bleed and get infected with bacteria. For safety and pleasure, partners often use condoms, female condoms and/or lubrication."
Painful sexual act.
"A painful sexual act is a condition of repeated or persistent genital pain before, during, or after sexual intercourse due to physical and/or emotional causes. Doctors call the condition ""dyspareunia"". It occurs in women and men. The condition affects up to one-fifth of women at some point in their lives."
Ctenophore
"The phylum Ctenophora, the comb jellies, is a phylum of marine invertebrates. They are part of the plankton, and there are also pelagic species. The phylum includes the sea gooseberry (""Pleurobrachia pileus"") and Venus' girdle (""Cestum veneris"")."
The phylum was grouped with Cnidaria (jellyfish) in the former Coelenterata phylum. Ctenophores are the most basal known type of animals.
"Even though they look like jellyfish, they are zoologically not related to them. They lack the characteristic nematocysts (stinging cells), but have ""colloblasts"", sticky cells that snare small victims. They have eight rows of cilia which look like the teeth of a comb, hence Ctenophore = comb-bearer. Ctenophores have connective tissues and a nervous"
"system. There are about 150 described species of ctenophora spread throughout the world's oceans, from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea."
"Although there are a few benthic species, most are gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire planktonic biomass worldwide. A few species, such as the sea gooseberry, native to the North Sea, have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen's nets, while of other species only a few examples are known. The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult. For this reason their lifespan is not known, but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age."
Colour and light.
"Many planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect, which is not caused by bioluminescence but by ""diffraction"", the scattering of light, as the cilia on the combs beat. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only been seen in darkness. However some groups appear incapable of bioluminescence."
Croats
"Croats () are a South Slavic ethnic group mostly living in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and nearby countries. There are around 5 million Croats living in the southern Central Europe region, along the east bank of the Adriatic Sea and an estimated 9 million throughout the world. Large Croat communities exist in a number of countries, including Chile, the United States, Argentina, Australia, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa. Croats are noted for their unique culture, which comes from their location on the edge of the Western world which subjected them to various non European influences. The Croats are predominantly Catholic and their language is Croatian."
Poles
"The Polish people, or Poles (, singular ""Polak"") are a Slavic nation and ethnic group native to Poland, they are bounded by the Polish language, which belongs to the Lechitic subgroup of west slavic languages of Central Europe, living mainly in Poland. Their religion is mainly Roman Catholic. They use modified Latin alphabet."
"There are about 60 million Poles in the world. Besides Poland, many live in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and elsewhere."
"The most famous Poles are Pope John Paul II, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Nicolaus Copernicus and Lech Wałęsa."
"Polish names often end with ""-ski"", ""-ska"", ""-cki"" or ""-cka""."
The most popular Polish surnames are Nowak and Kowalski.
Histories (Herodotus)
"The Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus is considered the first work of history in Western literature. Written about 440 BC in the Ionic dialect of classical Greek, ""The Histories"" tells the story of the Greco-Persian Wars between the Achaemenid Empire and the Greek city-states in the 5th century BC."
Thracians
"The ancient Thracians were a group of Indo-European tribes who spoke the Thracian language - a rare branch of the Indo-European language family. Those peoples lived in Thrace: the eastern, central and southern part of the Balkan peninsula, and the adjacent parts of Eastern Europe. The Pomak claimed to be descendants of this old Trachians. Today People from Thrace, no matter if they are Turks, Bulgarians, Greeks, Pomak or Xoraxane Roma, said simple we are Thracians."
Reproduction.
"Most oomycetes produce two types of spores. The main dispersing spores are asexual, self-mobile spores called zoospores. These do chemotaxis toward a food source in surface water. A few oomycetes produce asexual spores that are distributed by wind. Oomycetes also produce sexual spores, called ""oospores"". These are translucent, double-walled, spherical structures which can survive harsh conditions."
Hurricane Helene (1958)
Hurricane Helene was one of the most powerful Atlantic storms of 1958. The storm's peak winds were 135 miles per hour. This hurricane moved north of the West Indies and brushed the United States' east coast. Helene was the only hurricane to affect the United States in 1958.
Garter snake
"The garter snake (""Thamnophis sirtalis"") is a Colubrid snake."
"It is common across North America between Alaska/Canada and Central America. It is the single most widely distributed genus of reptiles in North America. It is famous for its resistance to the poison produced by the rough-skinned newt. Garter snakes are actually venomous, just not to humans, since the amount of toxin in their saliva is too weak to really cause damage to a human. The worst they could do to you is musk on you or bite you and leave a harmless rash. In fact, cat bites are probably more serious than garter snake bites. They prey on rodents, small fish, small birds, salamanders, earthworms (not red wigglers, as they are bad for them) insects, and insect larva. They are attracted to water sources and hiding spots. You can identify a garter snake because almost every species has a stripe running down its back, the color varying and depending on the species, as there are many different species of garter snakes. They are incredibly common animals, settling in backyards and local woods. As you read this, there is probably at least one garter slithering in the nature-filled area behind you, whatever that may be. All snakes like to hide, and garters are no exception, even if they are incredibly common and small. They hide under leaves, trees, bricks and rocks stacked up, plants, sticks, and anything they can find. If you are trying to ""catch"" a garter, look for them under these places, and you just might find them. Like most snakes, female garters tend to be longer than the males, so that's one form of sexing them."

"The ""evolutionary tree"" shows the relationships among various biological groups. It includes data from DNA, RNA and protein analysis."
"Tree of life work is a product of traditional comparative anatomy, and modern molecular evolution and molecular clock research. Below is a simplified version of present-day understanding."
Precursors.
Lamarck.
"Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) produced the first branching tree of animals in his ""Philosophie Zoologique"" (1809). It was an upside-down tree starting with worms and ending with mammals. However, Lamarck did not believe in common descent of all life. Instead, he believed that life consists of separate parallel lines advancing from simple to complex."
Hitchcock.
"The American geologist Edward Hitchcock (1763–1864) published in 1840 the first tree of life based on paleontology in his ""Elementary Geology"". On the vertical axis are paleontological periods. Hitchcock made a separate tree for plants (left) and animals (right). The plant and animal trees are not connected at the bottom of the chart. Furthermore, each tree starts with multiple origins. However, they were not ""evolutionary"" trees, because Hitchcock believed that a deity was the agent of change."
Vestiges.
"The first edition of Robert Chambers' ""Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation"" was published anonymously in 1844. It contained a tree-like diagram in the chapter 'Hypothesis of the development of the vegetable and animal kingdoms'. It shows a model of embryological development where fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) represent branches from a path leading to mammals (M)."
"In the text this branching tree idea is tentatively applied to the history of life on earth: ""there may be branching"".p191"
Darwin's tree of life.
"Charles Darwin (1809–1882) was the first to produce an evolutionary tree of life. He was very cautious about the possibility of reconstructing the history of life. In ""On the Origin of Species"" (1859) Chapter IV he presented an abstract diagram of a theoretical tree of life for species of an unnamed large genus (see figure)."
"In Darwin's own words: ""Thus, the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera."""
"This is a branching pattern with no names given to species, unlike the more linear tree Ernst Haeckel made years later."
"In his summary to the section as revised in the 6th edition of 1872, Darwin explains his views on the Tree of Life:"
The tree of life today.
"The model of a tree is still considered valid for eukaryotic life forms. Research into the earliest branches of the eukaryote tree suggests a tree with either four supergroups, or two supergroups. There does not yet appear to be a consensus; in a review article, Roger and Simpson conclude that ""with the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life, we should proceed with caution""."
"Biologists now recognize that the prokaryotes, the bacteria and archaea have the ability to transfer genetic information between unrelated organisms through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Recombination, gene loss, duplication, and gene creation are a few of the processes by which genes can be transferred within and between bacterial and archaeal species, causing variation that is not due to vertical transfer."
There is emerging evidence of HGT occurring within the prokaryotes at the single and multicell level and the view is now emerging that the tree of life gives an incomplete picture of life's evolution. It was a useful tool in understanding the basic processes of evolution but cannot explain the full complexity of the situation.
Three's Company
Three's Company is an American situation comedy. It aired on the ABC network. It began in March 1977 and ended in September 1984.
"The show is a remake of the British sitcom ""Man About the House"". Nowadays the domestic distribution rights are handled by creator Don L. Taffner's estate and the international rights are handled by FremantleMedia (whose company Thames originated the sitcom ""Man About the House"")."
"The show is set in Santa Monica, California. It is about a man pretending to be gay so his landlord won't evict him, it is also about financial struggling such as the roommates not being able to pay their rent. The sitcom heavily relies on innuendo and sexy misunderstandings. It is also a comedy of errors. The show had two spinoffs also based on Britcoms: ""The Ropers"" (""George &amp; Mildred"") &amp; ""Three's a Crowd"" (""Robin's Nest"")."
"The series was later the subject of the made-for-TV movie """". The movie showed how cast changes led to the show ending."
Filmation
"Filmation Associates or Filmation Studios was an American production company that produced animated television series and live action programming during the late 20th century. Founded in 1963, the company was in Reseda, California."
Theriodont
"Theriodonts are a major group of therapsids. They are a clade which include not only the traditional theriodonts, but also their descendants the mammals as well (in the same way that theropod dinosaurs include the birds as a sub-clade)."
"They can be defined in traditional terms as a suborder of Synapsida that lived from the Middle Permian to the Middle Cretaceous. Theriodonts appeared about 265 million years ago, in the Middle Permian. Even these early theriodonts were more mammal-like than their relatives."

Kwanzaa
"Kwanzaa is a week long celebration held in the United States to honor universal African heritage and culture. People light a kinara (candle holder with seven candles) and give each other gifts. It takes place from December 26 to January 1 every year. It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. The holiday greeting is ""Joyous Kwanzaa""."
History and name of the holiday.
Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage.
"The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase ""matunda ya kwanza"", meaning first fruits of the harvest."
"During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun. However, as Kwanzaa became more popular, Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included. He stated in the 1997 ""Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture"", ""Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday."""
Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.
Principles and symbols.
"Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or ""Nguzo Saba"" (originally ""Nguzu Saba""—the seven principles of blackness). Karenga said that this ""is a communitarian African philosophy,"" . It consists of what Karenga called ""the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world."" These seven principles comprise ""Kawaida"", a Swahili term for tradition and reason. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:"
"Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, corn and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a kinara, a communal cup for pouring libations, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles."
"During Kwanzaa, families also decorate their households with objects of art. They use colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women. Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used. It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice (""a shared cup""), ""Kikombe cha Umoja"", passed around to all people present. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (Karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is ""Habari Gani?"" which is Swahili for ""What's the News?"""
"Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry."
Interventional Radiology
"Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin (for example an injection) or carried out with the least damage by x-rays, sonography, and so on."
"Some of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes, while others are done for treatment purposes. Images are used to direct these procedures, which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters. The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases."
Chess Olympiad
"Chess Olympiads are chess events open to all national teams. They have been run since 1927 by the world chess organisation, FIDE. Since 1950, they have been run every two years. Earlier events were all-play-all. Then, as numbers grew, a system of qualifying sections were used. In recent times, the format has been a Swiss system. This, in chess terms, is a method whereby opponents are chosen each round to have similar scores. It has been widely used for individual tournaments."
Recognised sport.
Chess is a recognized sport by the International Olympic Committee with FIDE being the recognized International Sports Federation for chess since June 1999.
"As a member of the International Olympic Committee, FIDE adheres to its rules, including controversially having doping tests. The prospects of chess becoming an Olympic sporting event at some future date remain unclear. The naming of FIDE's team championship as the ""Chess Olympiad"" is of historical origin and implies no connection between this event and the Olympic Games."
The next Chess Olympiad will be held in 2014 in Norway.
Kings Island
"Kings Island is a amusement park located northeast of Cincinnati in Mason, Ohio, United States. The park is owned and operated by the Cedar Fair company. It operates from April to December. The park features 48 rides total and has 14 roller coasters including Banshee, The Bat, Mystic Timbers, , Diamondback, and other attractions. The park opened to the public on April 29, 1972. Great Wolf Lodge nearby, is next to the amusement park."
The newest ride at Kings Island is Orion.
Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)
"The Symphony No. 94 in G major is a symphony by Joseph Haydn. It was first performed in London on 23 March 1792 under Haydn's direction. It is nicknamed the Surprise Symphony. The symphony's nickname is derived from the sudden loud chord played by the entire orchestra in the second movement. This movement is a set of variations on a sweet, gentle theme. The chord was Haydn's afterthought; it does not appear in the manuscript. One theory suggests Haydn inserted this loud chord saying, ""That will make the ladies jump!"". Another theory suggests he inserted it to wake up the music lovers who had dozed off after their dinners and drinks. Another theory suggests he inserted it to make the symphony memorable in light of the competition he faced from a series of London concerts directed by Ignaz Pleyel."

"The site's stated aim is ""education, background reading and general interest"" with an intended audience ""physicians, other clinical healthcare workers and students of these professions"". The editor of the site is stated as Malcolm H Duncan, a UK qualified medical doctor."
Organization.
"The Diseases Database is based around a collection of concepts related to human medicine. These concepts include diseases, drugs, symptoms, physical signs and abnormal laboratory results. These are referred to as 'items'."
"There are around 8,000 items within the database."
EMedicine
"eMedicine is an online research tool for clinical studies. It was founded in 1996 by two medical doctors, Scott Plantz and Richard Lavely. The website is searchable by keyword. It has about 6,800 articles, each of which is associated with one of 62 clinical subspecialty textbooks. Pediatrics, for example, consists of 14 subspecialty textbooks (endocrinology, genetics, cardiology, pulmonology, etc.). For example, 750 articles are the textbook on emergency medicine. Each article is authored by board-certified specialists in the subspecialty to which the article belongs. The article's authors are identified with their current jobs. Each article is updated yearly and the date is published on the article."
History.
It was sold to WebMD in January 2006.
"The site is free to use, requiring only registration. More than 10,000 contributors from several countries participated in the creation of the articles. It is operated as an e-book, the articles can be downloaded into a palm top device."
"It was originally conceived in 1996 as an emergency medicine textbook but its content has expanded a lot since then to include allergy and immunology, cardiology, clinical procedures, critical care, dermatology, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology. genomic medicine, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, oncology, pathology, perioperative care, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, pulmonology, radiology, rheumatology, and sports medicine. Surgical subspecialties include neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, (ENT) and facial plastic surgery, plastic surgery, thoracic surgery, transplantation, Trauma, urology, and vascular surgery."
Nanna (Norse deity)
"In Norse mythology, Nanna is the goddess of joy and peace. She is a wife of Baldur."
Nanna is also the Norse goddess of the Moon. She dies of a broken heart after Baldur is killed because of Loki convincing Höðr to kill him.
"Oh, I see."
"uh, but, uh, we did a lot of fishing when we were up there."
"But down here, I have a brother that likes to go over on the east, in East Texas, and do fishing."
"I can't remember what the name of the lake is,"
and he was just here this past weekend.
"I could have,"
"I, I think he mentioned it again,"
but I couldn't remember what it was.
"Uh, I want to call it Salt Fork, or Lake Fork."
"I, I can't remember,"
but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places.
"Oh, oh, oh, uh, I think I know where, uh, Lake Caddo, or something like that."
"I, you know,"
that may be it.
That may be it.
"If it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places. They hold tournaments there, and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and he said that he has never gone anywhere before,"
"and he's fished all over the United States, in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen."
So I would love to go over there.
"They were talking about going over there, and, and some time in the spring,"
"and I was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing, and, uh, and catch some bass."
"I would love to do that,"
"but they have snakes over there,"
"and I'm not too welcome around,"
"I don't, I really don't want to share a boat with a snake."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I just, I, I, I don't see it."
Yeah.
Right
"and, and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of,  um, women don't feel like they need to get married anymore."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
I was twenty-seven when I got married
"and I just at the time, um,"
my husband actually even jokes about it.
Uh-huh.
He was twenty-three when we met
"an I was at a point where it was like, I didn't date,"
"I mean, I just, I went out to have a good time,"
Right.
but I didn't have to have male companionship.
"Right,"
right.
"Um, and a lot of the, um, friends that I had in school at that point, who had gone back and gone to law school, or M B A programs, um, which I also had done, had just, you know, they were very sad."
Uh-huh.
"But then by the time I got married, um,  it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"So, I guess that's a big change in terms of, just, um, the attachments that women feel like they need to have, the dependency,  their self-identity is stronger."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's, it's just really not there anymore."
Yeah.
"And that, that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and other women seeing, uh, women seeing other women, you know,  out in the corporate world."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"That's like, oh, I can do that."
"You know, maybe,  I don't need to get married."
Yeah.
"Gosh,"
I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area
but you're right.
Yeah.
I grew up in a real small town in Florida.
Oh.
I mean a real small town
"And, uh, I think it was just"
"of course it was back in the, in the fifties"
and I think it was real prevalent back then.
"I I think people thought more of others than they do now. You know, as far as doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it."
Yeah.
"Well,"
"and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back. Um, if we've lost some of that"
"and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um, that's true,"
"maybe that's a way,"
"if, if young people had to do it um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country. Um,  is helping others"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
I do to.
I do to.
"I'm not sure that, that today's kids would go for it though."
I think you would have to start younger.
Yeah.
"I, I don't know how young you'd have to go"
"but I think by the time they're, oh, early teenagers anyway, I think it's too late now. At least around here."
"Yeah,"
"I think, uh, I think it does help, um, even preschoolers, you know"
"they're, um, things even just starting around the home.  You know"
Right.
little ones can do a little bit to help the family.
you can just go and vote
Right.
"and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks,"
the hours are good
and they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays.
Uh-huh.
"And so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in Houston, it's, uh, the lines are long."
"Yeah,"
"I'm in Dallas,"
and they're long here too.
"So, uh, but, uh,"
"Yeah,"
I voted absentee one year.
I really was going to be gone.
"So, I did it,"
"but, uh, it was nice."
I would be tempted to do it again.
"Well, uh, I recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line"
Right.
"and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day."
Yeah.
I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
"Um, yeah,"
"I've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the Republican party."
"And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots,"
"but, uh, my mind has gone blank."
"I've been all evening How they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for"
"Uh-huh,"
"you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on,"
And  I love it.
Ah.
And I would get another one in a minute.
"Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, you know, a little Corvette or something like that."
And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car.
And I'd love an expensive one
"but I probably,  can never afford it"
so
"Uh, well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles."
"Uh, I currently have an eighty-seven, five liter Mustang G T that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, uh, handle and perform better,"
Uh-huh.
"and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, uh,"
"the best car I could get regardless of money, uh, I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I'm a nurse here"
and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.
"A, a three twenty-eight G T S?"
And I couldn't tell you
but it's just beautiful.
And I go out and I love to touch it
but I can't even do that because of the alarm.
You just go hunting?
"So, I just look at it a lot"
Go out and lust after it.
Really
Exactly.
But it sure is a pretty thing
So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?
No.
I'm working on it
"No,"
"That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family."
"Yeah,"
Is it really?
Yeah.
except that mine are a little bit older
"and, and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,"
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.
Uh-huh.
You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.
That's right.
That's right.
"Well, that's what she said to us."
"She said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?"
"And, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college."
"And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know."
And that was kind of our view on it.
"It just costs too much,"
"you just can't do it, you know."
"So, I don't know,"
"it's, it's,"
"I don't, uh,"
"it just amazing,"
"it amazes me how much the, the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years."
I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.
"And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them."
"Uh, I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,"
"Oh, goodness."
"and I said, that's wonderful."
I applaud that.
"Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, and I'm,"
"I,"
"I'd,"
"I know it is, I know it is where I, where I work."
"But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. Uh, you know, by law that it has to be paid."
"Paid, right."
"Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger company."
"But, but there are certainly some, Some that, some that wouldn't, uh,"
Uh-huh.
Some that may decide not to.
"yeah,"
"Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget."
"Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure."
Uh-huh.
It's only getting worse exponentially it seems.
Yes.
Exactly.
"Um,"
"There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do"
"and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course,"
"but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"Oh, which state is that?"
"Uh, State of Minnesota."
Uh-huh.
"So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages."
"I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it"
Uh-huh.
so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.
Right.
Right.
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"Uh, I work in metal fab"
"and tenths of inches are, are normal."
"And, you know, you know, it is broken up in, you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for, in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch."
"Well, have, have you, do you, are you involved in any other, uh, metric type things like ..."
"Yes,"
I am.
"I, I have a Suzuki motorcycle"
"and, and I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years"
and the metric system comes easy to me.
But my ...
"I think it's interesting you you know, when you go out there"
and you're looking for a wrench
and you want the next size larger.
"I've got, I inherited some, some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds."
Right.
"Well, now that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch."
"But some of them, like, like, twenty-seven"
"and, and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that, that, uh, don't translate."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"To go from, from eighths to sixteenths to, uh, thirty seconds and remember where it falls, it ..."
Yeah.
"and, and you've got to go over there and try it"
"and I suppose, you know, I need a larger one."
I need a smaller one.
"I mean obviously you can look at it and say well, anyway."
"I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't,"
"I don't know,"
"do you, do you drink adult beverages?"
I do miss that.
Around here in Plano there are very few trees
"and it's pretty flat and, and kind of barren"
"and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in Texas, is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall"
"and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is, you know, in the north. Um, or even where you are."
"Uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here."
"A lot of leaves to rake up too, I bet."
Yes
but fortunately the home owner's association does all that.
"Does that,"
"well, see, that's another plus."
"Yes,"
I don't have to worry about that
"and this is the time of year we're starting to lose,"
they're all falling now.
"That's right,"
"that's right,"
they are.
I'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done.
"We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but, not, not much. Just, just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks"
"and if you didn't do anything about it, then they'd probably the leaves just blow away"
Right.
It's not too bad.
"Okay,"
do we have to speak for a certain amount of time?
"No,"
I don't think so.
Okay.
Okay.
It was really nice speaking to you.
It was good to speak with you too.
"Okay,"
Yeah.
"So now they're like marking, uh,"
"they're,"
"I don't know,"
"there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics"
"and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is."
Yeah.
So I guess that makes it easy to recycle
"and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic"
so that that makes it easier I guess.
Uh-huh.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I'm, you know,"
"unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't,"
"they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that"
"or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection"
Right.
"and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that"
Where does your friend go to to recycle?
She lives in Garland
"and I'm not sure where, what she does."
"But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that"
and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
Uh-huh.
"Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house."
Yeah.
"Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing."
And she does make a lot of sense.
Yeah.
Just her whole house is like wow.
"I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear  from another person"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, course it, it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness, one, to, to work during the summer or, or part time. And two, uh, to, to take out loans to assume, uh, debt after college."
That's right.
"There's,"
"The, the responsibility of that."
"And, uh, uh, uh, they could, they could work and earn money towards college."
"Also if they stay within their state, you get a lot more financial aid"
"or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school, uh,"
Yes.
"and, like I said, if they was willing to work, uh, in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third"
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is.
"By the time, I have an eleven year old is my oldest,"
"so, it's not too far away,"
"but it's,"
Mine is twelve.
"Oh, okay."
"But it's getting there,"
"I mean, we still have, definitely can put away the money for college now."
"Uh, I would advise that, that they did not have a car at college."
"They would,"
"That's my gut feeling, too."
"I,"
my son is certainly not persuaded of that
Hello?
"Yes,"
I'm here.
"Oh, yeah, uh,"
"yes,"
I didn't have a car in college.
"I think it's more an a burden to, to provide for."
No.
"I think so, too."
Right.
Yeah.
"And I suspect it, in cases like,"
"I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil."
Is that right?
"Well, I, I, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, I think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage"
"and I think that may be where jury use is overdone,"
"I mean there are cases where they could be settled,  maybe  out of court a little more efficiently."
Right.
"But the lawyers are really, uh,"
it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible
"so. Uh, I was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that."
But I am in favor of it for criminal cases
so there's a difference of my view there for those two.
Right.
Right.
"Yeah,"
well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that
Have you ever had to serve jury duty?
well I was called once when I was nineteen
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me"
"and, I was doing school and things like"
"they, they let me out."
Uh-huh.
I've never had to it since
"actually they, they fold, so when you get in tight situations, you can fold them back."
"Yeah,"
But they're
"well, see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them,"
"at first we were going to get a pick up truck, with a camper on the back of it, of it,"
uh-huh.
"but then that gas mileage was just atrocious,"
"I mean it's, unreal,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it just practically don't get any."
"Well, they have got, some of the newer ones they, you know, with the aerodynamic features,"
"you can get pretty, pretty decent gas mileage."
Yeah.
"And then, uh, he talked about a van,"
"and I said, well, you know, I don't know, I don't know how the gas is on most of these."
And another thing was
"that's the reason I said you know, there was such a big difference you know, in a little economy car,"
but I said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But really and truly the safety features
"but I wouldn't get one that,"
"if it had, the seat belts on the door now I wouldn't get it."
Yeah.
Period.
"Ford now announced I think in ninety-two, they're going to put, uh, air bags in their, in their vans."
Oh that would be good.
"So, uh, and I think, I, I believe safety,"
"I, I, I, I really do believe in this stuff, uh,"
"and I, I think it can go, ,"
"I'm not,"
I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
"Oh, that's right."
I work for a law firm
"I, I'm serious."
And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
Right.
"You know, if someone is"
Well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
Well.
Plea bargaining is something completely different.
"That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up."
"Well, I know."
That's what I'm saying.
"But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard."
"I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they,"
I don't know how it works exactly
"but  you know, they get lesser sentences"
Right.
"and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something."
Right.
"But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it."
Huh.
you know what I'm saying?
"That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment."
Right.
"And, uh I, I think they should."
We do
"I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people"
"and, uh, you know, all"
Right.
"they, they're caught dead to rights."
"I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life"
"so I bought one that's more like living in a,"
"once you're inside, you don't know you're in a town home."
"Oh, that sounds lovely."
It is.
They're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side
Uh-huh.
so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you.
Uh-huh.
"So in, in your area then there's probably a lot of, um, career type people that have those type homes"
and
"Yes,"
definitely.
"uh-huh,"
"and, um, the area that we're settled in is, um, definitely young, young families with, with kids."
"They're still doing, um, a lot of building in the neighborhood."
"So the people that move here seem to move from all over the country, which we're from, um, the northeast,"
"and, um, seems like a people just don't, or also don't have any family around."
"So it, um, also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors,"
"and you know, um But, um ,"
"Well, we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want the heat of the, the cold of the northeast"
Uh-huh.
so they settle sort of in-between.
"Right,"
right.
Uh-huh.
"Now it's, um, is it very wooded around where you are,"
"there lots of pretty trees and,"
Yes
Yeah.
"as a matter of fact this is a, uh, this particular community that I live in is very wooded."
"Oh, how pretty."
It is nice.
the air bags are a good deal
"but, uh, surprisingly, uh, they're, uh,"
"you really need to do,"
"you need a combination of both the air bags and the, uh, and the seat belts"
"Oh I think so too,"
"so,"
I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now.
Yeah.
I'm
but I think you need the shoulder thing
Yeah.
"I think you need the thing around your waist,"
"but, I think you need that bag to pop out too."
Yeah.
"You know, because I know so many people, here that have been killed in head on collisions, where maybe if they had, had that, that air bag, they may still be walking around."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But, uh, I think it's fantastic."
I wish they required it in everything.
"Every new car that came out, I wish they would require it in it."
"It would be that would do to our insurance rates, you know, if, if, uh, if the insurance companies says it, says we're not going to pay, you know, a claim, if, if the car doesn't have, uh, air bags."
Would be interesting wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"Uh, that wouldn't be fair"
"but, uh,"
"Well, no because what they would do is, that's what they're going to plan on, you know,"
"they would have to do it,"
the insurance company would have to do the same thing.
"They're given like, a ten year time limit where,"
Yeah.
okay.
"These cars, I guess they figure all the old cars, will be off the roads or something by the, in ten years"
"it's mainly for flower bed,"
"so I'm not going to, no I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there."
All right.
"But, I,"
"yeah,"
I do want to have a raised bed.
"I've never,"
my flower gardens are always been like on the ground.
Right.
"They don't, it just looks so much better when it's up against the house, tiered up."
"Well, you can see it a little better"
and it stands out.
"Yeah,"
this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch
"and I can tell you there's nothing around it, cement foundation all the way around it. Not a shrub, not a bush."
Um.
"There was a lilac tree,"
"and the landlord cut it down and said, Yeah, that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding"
"And I'm looking at him like, Jeez."
People would kill to have a lilac bush
and he's cutting it down
So. That's all right.
Flower beds are all right.
"Anything, as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding."
"Rub up against the siding. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"that's what he's worried about. The trees, or a bush, because lilac bushes, they, they grow fast."
"Some people, uh, would really like to have them,"
"and then the people that do have them, they spread, and they sprout all over their lawn."
Uh-huh.
"So, they're kind of a pain,"
"but, you know, people who don't have them think they're great."
"and she's, uh, suffering from, uh, well, uh, progressive Alzheimer's Disease"
Uh-huh.
so she doesn't remember anybody
Right.
"and, uh, she remembers things,"
but they are things back whenever she was real young
Right.
"and so, with,"
she was living by herself
"but my, uh, uncle has moved in with her to take care of her"
Uh-huh.
and it's creating a lot of problems.
"Right,"
especially for your uncle I bet.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer.
Do they have anything like that in Dallas.
"In Dallas,"
"uh, yeah."
"I've, I've heard of several things"
"and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them,"
"but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or, uh, to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up."
Right.
So they are pretty limited.
Right.
"Oh, another interesting thing,"
"another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives. To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities."
Oh really.
Uh-huh.
"I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be."
"Uh-huh,"
so I guess we better get off.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
It was good talking to you.
Alright.
Bye-bye now.
Bye.
"Well, Wayne, I've never done any, uh, auto repairs myself at all."
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something"
"but, uh, I personally haven't done anything."
"Maybe I've, uh, changed wiper blades or something"
"but I have noticed since, uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs,"
"but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else."
"I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it,"
and he'll do it.
"So, he, he hates the time that he takes,"
"but he has changed, um, the brakes"
and he has done all of the tune-ups
and the like that
and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car.
I was really impressed with that
"We had to have it to get the car inspected,"
it wouldn't pass inspection
"and, and so, he priced around"
and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it
"so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars, which he did"
"and then, he did it"
"and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up,"
"what, uh, what's your experience been like?"
"Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars."
"I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette"
They don't make mistakes.
That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive
Right.
and they were not.
"And I haven't heard of any,"
now I'm not in personnel or anything.
Yeah.
"But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not."
"In other words, there's very few mistakes,"
"and that, of course, has got to be critical."
"It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program,"
"it's got to be with a very, very good agency."
You don't just have some local group do it.
It's got to be a highly qualified agency.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
not just some doctor's office somewhere.
"No,"
you don't want to do that.
It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.
And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.
"And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing."
"It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course."
"Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere,"
"but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us."
Oh really.
Yeah.
"Huh. Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,"
or do they fire them right away.
"Oh, no."
They're not fired.
"They are, they have one chance to then go in a program."
but it's something like that.
"Yeah,"
years ago.
"They sort of move up to levels,"
"and, and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough,"
"and as it turns out, you know, they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that."
Oh.
So you can guess the rest of the plot.
"It actually, it's, it's really funny because they run through, you know, what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives."
"Oh, yeah."
And then defend it.
And that's pretty good actually.
"Well, I guess that's where the title comes from then."
Yeah.
And it's
you actually have to go up there
"and you have a, they have an attorney for, you know, attorney for you and attorney,"
"a defense and a prosecution,"
"and you know, the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level,"
"and the defense's job is to make sure that you, you do, you know."
"It's, uh, it's a neat little story actually."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"I was, I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great,"
and then I actually came away thinking it was really pretty good.
"So,"
"It's funny,"
"we've got a couple of movies out recently, GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, that have to do with, uh, after life, I guess."
Yeah.
"And it kind of makes you wonder,"
"I'm also, besides working at T I, I'm a graduate student at North Texas and working on master's in communication."
"It's the behavioral science part of communication,"
Do they like to listen to other people recollect though?
My grandmother doesn't
"She, she wants to to tell you about her story over again"
so
Right.
"which is fine, you know,"
"so,"
"Well, that is good because we,"
"Um, so what do you think?"
"Um,"
"I lived, I lived in Sweden for two years."
Uh-huh.
And in Sweden they have socialized medicine.
And so I saw some of the good
and also I saw some of the bad that results from such a program.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, some of the, some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care."
Right.
"So it's a very, it's a very, uh, comfortable,"
"I mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that, you know, there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life."
Right.
"Um, the bad was more apparent I think at least for me"
"because I think it affected people's lives on, in a way that you could see."
"One, one thing that I noticed is it's very, very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden."
"Oh, really?"
Because it's treated as a disease.
"Now I don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine,"
"but, uh, if you're, if you're alcoholic, then you're treated as if you're on disability, long-term disability"
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that.
Huh.
"Also, um, another thing that, that I noticed that was very strange,"
"I was, uh, I would go down all these, uh, uh,"
"as you said for someone who, you know, a more, you know, who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them."
"Or, it's also a good environment,"
"it may be good for someone who already has self discipline, who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own, that,"
"Yeah,"
and want to develop that.
"And, that,"
"yeah,"
the
it's the same.
Uh-huh.
It can benefit different people different ways.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But, uh, you know, I, I agree with that, because I see people that I know again, from high school, that I still keep in touch with, that didn't go to college Same patterns of behavior, same, uh, same socializing, same exact crowd that they hang with"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"The same patterns of behavior, you mean?"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"and it's like, it's like frozen time, you know."
"Exactly,"
"it's I find it kind of sad,"
I really do.
It is.
"It really is that they haven't found anything, anything better that, uh,"
"or their, their experiences haven't been broadened at all, to, to you know, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it's a, it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a, in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions"
and you hear all these different sides of the story that you never thought of
Yeah.
Right.
"and, uh, that's another big thing I think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point, differing points of view, you know, or different opinions."
and they wrote that it's kind of weird
"they have bats in their roof,"
but the bats eat the bad spiders
"so they leave the bats, you know."
So.
Yeah.
"It's a whole, whole different culture"
"or, It, it's weird down there because there's always lizards and things running around that people live there,"
Uh-huh.
"they just, they take it for granted"
"and it's like we go down there on vacation,"
"it's like oh, how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house?"
Yeah.
"I think their policy with them that though, is, uh,"
"I don't know,"
"I think,"
"I wish we would have just,"
I'm not that up on the policy of ways.
"I know that's kind of old,"
"but I don't know,"
"I just, I'm glad that the Sandanistas aren't in power anymore because I think that they were very wicked. And, uh, probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen,"
"and I feel like most of the leaders in Latin America are probably,"
"you would be safe to say that they were just very very, you know, big into drugs."
"Very very corrupt, like the Panamanians are, were very corrupt."
Right.
"The thing about it though is the Panamanians is, a lot of servicemen down there."
"A lot of, a lot of American servicemen are involved,"
Uh-huh.
"because I guess there was a big, big, uh, scam that, that all these guys up."
"Thousands of servicemen, got caught for running a drug ring."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

He relates the story of the Great Flood and also the Tower of Babel. After he tells his stories, his two wives decree that he is their king and god. Belshazzar asks what can break their bond, and Daniel informs him that “The Hand of God,” can break up Belshazzar, Vanity, and Idolatry. Belshazzar gets upset with Daniel and threatens his life. Daniel says that God will save him. Vanity and Idolatry tell Belshazzar that Daniel is annoying them and they want to leave. As they leave, Belshazzar tells Daniel he owes his life to the two queens, not to God. The Thought tells Daniel that he has learned a valuable lesson – by invoking the hand of God, his life can be spared in future situations."

Death is upset about only being allowed to show himself to and warn Belshazzar and not take his soul. He calls for Thought. Thought joins Death and is scared of him. Death asks Thought where Belshazzar is. Thought tells Death that Belshazzar is with his two wives in the garden. Death asks Thought to take him there. Thought does because he doesn't have the courage to say no."

It is Death approaching that none of the trio can see. Death shows himself to Belshazzar who is shocked and terrified. He asks Death who he is; Death tells Belshazzar that he is a creditor here to collect a debt that Belshazzar owes. Thought rethinks his decision to lead Death to Belshazzar. Belshazzar asks what he owes. Death shows him a book that has the debt listed, but Belshazzar states that the book is one he lost. Death says the debt was written down by Belshazzar himself. He reads back what Belshazzar wrote about owing his life to Death. Death tells Belshazzar that today is not the day that he has come to collect the debt, but that the day is coming. Death exits."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, Vanity, and Thought are still together. The two queens want to know what is troubling Belshazzar. He says he is not sure – some phantom visited him. To please Belshazzar, the queens take turns complimenting each other. They all sit down and Idolatry fans Belshazzar with the feather from her hat while Vanity sings to him about his greatness to continue to soothe him."
"Death is angry because the queens have soothed Belshazzar into a sleep. Death says he will haunt Belshazzar in his dream. The queens leave the garden and Thought also falls asleep. Death sees Belshazzar asleep and decides to kill him. He draws his sword, but Daniel enters and says, “No,” while holding back the arms of Death. Death inquires why he cannot kill the king. Daniel says Belshazzar has not lived his whole life and it is not time yet for him to die. Death argues that Belshazzar's life is a mockery to both God and Death."
"While Belshazzar is asleep, in his dream the queens enter with a Statue – it is Belshazzar as a god. The queens praise Belshazzar and build him up. The Statue warns Belshazzar in his sleep that he needs to leave Idolatry and Vanity behind or else he will suffer because of them. The Statue tells the dream queens that the great God decrees them gone. Belshazzar wakes up and is troubled by what he saw and felt in his sleep. He starts to question keeping so much stock in Idolatry and Vanity. However, Idolatry seduces him again and he returns to his former self. Thought suggests Belshazzar throw a feast to shake off all of the melancholy. Belshazzar calls for the gold wine glasses and wine reserved for presenting the Eucharist to be used, because he deserves the best. Idolatry and Vanity set the table for the feast while Thought sings."
"Death comes to the feast in a disguise and makes a plea to God to loose his hand in order to kill Belshazzar due to his sacrilegious behavior against the Eucharist on top of his sins of Idolatry and Vanity. Belshazzar demands wine, and Death, being mistaken for a servant, brings him a golden cup of poisoned wine declaring that in the cup is both Life and Death. Belshazzar toasts himself, drinks the wine, and then there are several increasingly loud thunder claps. A hand appears in the clouds and writes nonsense words that neither Idolatry, Vanity, Belshazzar, nor Thought can decipher. Idolatry says Daniel can read them and calls him to do it."
"Daniel comes and interrupts the words that translate to mean that: One, God has numbered Belshazzar's days on earth. Two, Belshazzar has been weighed in the balance and been found wanting. Three, Belshazzar's kingdom will be a wasteland ravaged by his enemies when Belshazzar dies. All this because Belshazzar has profaned the sacred golden sacramental cups meant only to be used for the Eucharist. Death tells Belshazzar know that there was “death,” or poison, in the cups. Belshazzar cries out for Idolatry to save him, but she cannot. He calls out to Vanity to help him, but she cannot. Belshazzar asks Thought to help him, but Thought reminds him that he did not take heed of the warnings he received. Belshazzar finally calls on Daniel. Daniels says he is God's agent and Belshazzar must take his punishment. Belshazzar wonders who could save him – Death says no one. Death says “Die, thou sinner,” draws his sword, and stabs Belshazzar in the heart. As Death and Belshazzar wrestle, Belshazzar calls out a warning to all men. Idolatry lays down her worship of all other gods for God Himself, asks for forgiveness for Calderón's faults, and says that his intentions as the playwright was to point back to God."

"Angelica Rock is a small barren rock island emerging from Buzzards Bay, within the town limits of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. The rock is privately owned and is located southwest of Sconticut Neck and Wilbur's Point. The island is home to a number of sea birds as well as a nonfunctional windmill structure."
"The Town of Fairhaven refers to it as ""Angelica Island,"" while official nautical charts refer to it as ""Angelica Rock."""
"In the early 1970s, the island was purchased by Dr. Aris T. Papas, a clinical psychologist and professor who intended to build a summer home there. Papas and his son constructed the windmill by hauling materials via rowboat, and the windmill was functional until it was destroyed by a storm months later. However, the summer home plans were abandoned and a concrete slab from the project remains there today."
"A family member tried to sell the island in the mid 1990s for about $100,000, but had no buyers. The island has been described as a local landmark and is a frequent subject for photographers. The property is still owned by the Papas family."

"Matthew Rhys Holland (born 11 April 1974) is a former professional footballer, who played as a central midfielder. He began his career at West Ham United and subsequently joined Bournemouth, before spending long spells at Ipswich Town and Charlton Athletic, where he retired in 2009."
"He represented the Republic of Ireland from 1999 to 2006 at international level, earning 49 caps and scoring 5 goals. He was included in their squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup."
"Since ending his football career he has worked in the media, including with the BBC, Setanta Sports, Talksport, BT Sport and RTÉ."
Initially rejected by Arsenal for being 'too small' he went to West Ham United where he moved up the ranks of the academy but did not play for the first team. He joined Football Conference side Farnborough Town during the 1992–93 season and made twenty-one appearances.
"In order to gain first team football, he joined South Coast side Bournemouth in January 1995. He played a total of 104 games, scoring 18 goals whilst at Dean Court, and also became captain."
"In the summer of 1997, Holland joined Ipswich Town for a fee of £800,000. He again became team captain and"
"captained the club into the Premier League by winning the First Division play-offs in 2000. He captained the club to a fifth-place finish and qualification for the UEFA Cup in their first season in the Premier League in 2001. Though Ipswich were relegated in 2002 he stayed with the club after he turned down a £4 million move to Aston Villa. His spell at Ipswich is remembered for the consistency he showed, after playing 223 consecutive games and only missing one league match (due to international duty) in the six years he was at Portman Road."
"After Ipswich failed to win promotion in 2003, Holland moved back to the Premier League by joining Charlton Athletic on a four-year contract for an initial £750,000 fee, which later rose to £900,000. Again with this move he assumed the captain's armband and was ever-present in his first season for the club. One of the longest-serving Charlton players, he claimed more than half the entire vote for the 2007–08 Fans' Player of the Year. His final match came in a 2–2 draw with Cardiff on 21 April 2009, and the club released him after relegation to League One at the end of the season."
"In July 2009, Holland trained with Colchester United following his release from Charlton in order to keep himself fit."
"Although born in England, Holland qualified to play for the Republic of Ireland through his grandmother who hailed from County Monaghan. He made his international debut on 9 October 1999 in an away Euro 2000 qualifier against Macedonia, playing the last five minutes as a substitute for Mark Kennedy. His first goal came on his fifth cap, the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Portugal on 7 October 2000 in qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Holland captained the side in three internationals, the first on his 28th cap, a 2–0 friendly defeat to Scotland."
"He went with the Republic of Ireland to the 2002 World Cup scoring the equaliser against Cameroon in their opening game. Ireland were eliminated from this tournament in a Second Round penalty shoot-out against Spain, with Holland among those who missed. Following Ireland's failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, he announced his retirement from international football on 5 February 2006 having made 49 appearances and scoring five goals. Manager Steve Staunton had attempted to persuade Holland to continue."

"In the 13th century, (this conflict formed the backdrop for some of Dante Alighieri's ""Divine Comedy"", completed in 1320)."
"A crossroads near the rue Camollia. On the outskirts of Sienna, the banned Guelphs and the reigning Ghibellines fight. The Guelphs are led by Orso who had been banished for having dared to throw a garland to the Ghibelline Cordelia Saracini. From the battle the guelfes emerge victorious at the portcullis of the Saracini palace. Orso demands that Cordelia appear at the balcony and open the gates to the town. Cordelia replies to him: « … now is not the time to open the gates, when thieves are in the town! » Orso give orders for an assault, the gate rises and he enters the Saracini palace bent on vengeance. Rather than throw Cordelia from the window as the screaming crowd demands, he drags her half-strangled back into the palace."
"Premier tableau – a great hall in the Seigniory palace. Despite their apparent victory, the Guelphs only control but half of the city. Among the dead on the Ghibelline side is Andreino, the fifteen-year-old son of Uberta, Cordelia's old nurse. The Guelphs request a truce in order to tend to the injured and bury the dead : plague is feared. The Saracini palace is on fire. Cordelia comes back, alive, but tells her brothers Ercole and Giugurta, as well as her nurse, that she has been raped by a man of whom all she can remember is the voice."
"Deuxième tableau – the cathedral square. Guelphs and Ghibellines attend the solemn mass for the Virgin in the cathedral. At the point of coming to blows, the Bishop Azzolino steps forward and upbraids them : « Siennois, is this what you call a truce for the Virgin ? Church is God's house alone ! – Faithless and unworthy Christians put your weapons down or I will close these doors and will open them only to admit your coffins! » They defer in the face of the threat; Orso only speaking a word but it is enough for Cordelia to recognize as she follows the men into the church."
"Premier tableau – a cloister. While Cordelia recognizes Orso as her torturer, Uberta learns by chance that the killer of her son is also Orso ! The two women argue over which should kill him. Cordelia decides with her plea : « You only mourn a death; I, I mourn myself, alive! ». Cordelia strikes Orso, and he falls to the ground, his throat cut with a dagger thrust. As a fight ensues, his men carry him, still breathing, to the shade of a church porch. When Cordelia and Uberta retrace steps to finish their vengeance, they cannot find the body and wonder if he was only injured. Cordelia cries out : « God of vengeance ! let him be dead ! I will not finish the task ! »."
"Deuxième tableau – the square. Cordelia discovers Orso in agony and pleading for a drink. Faced with this suffering, she pities him and pours fresh water on his lips."
"Premier tableau – a room in the Saracini palace. Cordelia has concealed Orso in the burnt palace. Giugurta, beaten, must flee the town. He wants to leave the palace by the gardens but to do that must pass through the room where Orso is hiding, convalescent. Cordelia puts him off with such insistence that Uberta becomes suspicious. A horrific explanation finally reveals the truth to Uberta, but Cordelia asks for mercy in the name of Andreino who would have condemned this bloody sacrifice. Cordelia and Orso find themselves alone. Two images alternate in the mind of Orso : the woman who stabbed him and the woman who saved him. The two make one victim of him; his repentance bursts forth and to restore her honour he asks to marry her. Cordelia replies that he is also guilty to his country riven by war. Orso promises her : « You will see me again when I have triumphed over discord and vanquished hatred! » He leaves the palace and it is announced that Giugurta has been arrested by the Guelphs, masters of the city."
"Deuxième tableau – ruins of the old Seigniory palace. The captured Ghibelline prisoners including Giurgurta are about to be executed. Orso enters and proposes to the people that the prisoners be freed, in order to march against the Emperor laying siege to the city and demanding 50,000 florins to lift the siege. The people accept. As they set off for battle Giugurta catches a glance and words from Cordelia to Orso, and says that he will return and question her after the battle."
"Sienna cathedral. The Siennese return victorious. Cordelia, frightened by her brother's threats has taken refuge in the cathedral. Giugurta find her there having extracted the information before killing Uberta. After proud protests, Cordelia faints on the altar steps, and he takes advantage to make her swallow poison. The victors come in with Orso at their head. Cordelia has convulsions which are mistaken for the plague. The crowd disperses in horror, and Orso takes Cordelia in his arms. So doing, he condemns himself to be trapped with her in the place tainted by the plague. At their pleas, Azollino joins them in marriage. Alone, they exchange parting words : Orso's wound has re-opened, and the two lovers die side by side."

"Bryan Keith Cox (born February 17, 1968) is an American football coach and former player. His most recent position was as the defensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Western Illinois University, a small college football program, but received attention for his aggressive style of play. Although Cox was a relatively late fifth-round pick by the Miami Dolphins in the 1991 NFL Draft, he rose to prominence as a standout linebacker during his twelve NFL seasons from 1991 through 2002. He was a three-time pro bowler with the Miami Dolphins, and was also a member of the New England Patriots club that won Super Bowl XXXVI."
"Cox was a member of the East St. Louis High School Flyers high school football team, where he was coached by Bob Shannon."
"Cox attended Western Illinois University and was a mass communications major and a letterman in football. In football, he was a four-year letterman and a two-year starter. As a senior, he was named as a first-team All-America selection by the ""Football Gazette"" and was a first-team all-conference selection. As a junior, he was named the Western Illinois Most Valuable Player. As a sophomore, Cox played in every game, and finished his sophomore season with 54 tackles, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, two interceptions and three blocked kicks. As a freshman, Cox was a reserve nickel-back and finished the season with 30 tackles."
"Cox was drafted by the Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft, chosen 113th overall. As a rookie, Cox started 13 games as the Dolphins right outside linebacker, racking up a total of 61 tackles along with two sacks. Miami finished out the season 8-8. In his sophomore campaign, Cox blossomed and helped lead the Dolphins to an 11-5 record and the AFC Championship Game. He made his first Pro Bowl and was named to the All Pro team after recording 127 tackles, 14 sacks and five forced fumbles. Miami switched to a 4-3 defense in 1993 and Cox was moved to right linebacker. The team started out 9-2, but lost their last five to miss the playoffs. Cox again led the team with 122 tackles, four forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries. He also collected five sacks and an interception."
"Cox earned his second Pro Bowl selection in 1994, starting 16 games at middle linebacker, leading the team with 100 tackles. Miami finished the season 10-6, winning the Wild Card Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, 27-17 before losing the Divisional Playoff to the San Diego Chargers, 22-21. In 1995, Cox was selected to his second consecutive Pro Bowl, and third overall. He again started every game at middle linebacker, finishing the year with a team high 119 tackles, 7.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. The Dolphins went 9-7 before bowing out in the Wild Card Game to the Buffalo Bills, 37-22. The defense tied for the AFC lead by allowing only seven rushing touchdowns. Overall, Cox spent five years with the Dolphins playing both outside and middle linebacker, starting 75 out of a possible 78 games."
"Cox would go on to play seven more seasons in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, New York Jets, New England Patriots, and New Orleans Saints. In a career encompassing 165 games, Cox recorded 764 tackles, tallied 51.5 quarterback sacks, caught four interceptions and forced 22 fumbles. Among his most famous plays was a 27-yard interception-return touchdown against the Patriots in September 1999 while playing with the Jets; another famous play came with the Patriots in September 2001 in a game against the Indianapolis Colts; Cox hit receiver Jerome Pathon in the first quarter, a hit that briefly knocked Pathon out."
"Throughout his NFL career, Cox was easily recognizable on the field due to the unusual headrest- or ""surfboard""-style neck roll he wore and colored to match his uniform jersey."
From 2004-2005 he worked as an analyst for TVG Network. Cox also co-hosted an afternoon drive radio program for Fox Sports Radio in 2006 alongside Chris Myers.
"He was an assistant defensive line coach for the New York Jets for three seasons (2006–08) under Eric Mangini. After Mangini was fired and became the coach of the Cleveland Browns in January 2009, he brought Cox with him, where Cox was the defensive line coach."
"On February 21, 2011, Cox was hired by the Miami Dolphins as their pass rush coach."
"On February 17, 2012, Cox was hired to become a defensive assistant at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was hired the same day as Bill Sheridan."

It differs from the pentagrammic antiprism by having opposite orientations on the two pentagrams.
This polyhedron is identified with the indexed name U as a uniform polyhedron.

"= = = Short, sharp shock = = ="
"The phrase ""short, sharp shock"" means ""a quick, severe punishment."" It is an example of alliteration. Although the phrase originated earlier, it was popularised in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1885 comic opera ""The Mikado"", where it appears in the song near the end of Act I, ""I Am So Proud"". It has since been used in popular songs, song titles, literature, as well as in general speech."
"John Conington's 1870 translation of the ""First Satire of Horace"" includes the following lines:"
"In Act I of the 1885 Gilbert and Sullivan opera ""The Mikado"", the Emperor of Japan, having learned that the town of Titipu is behind on its quota of executions, has decreed that at least one beheading must occur immediately. In the dialogue preceding the song, three government officials, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush, discuss which of them should be beheaded in order to save the town from ""irretrievable ruin"". Pooh-Bah says that although his enormous ""family pride"" would normally prompt him to volunteer for such an important civic duty, he has decided to ""mortify"" his pride, and so he declines this heroic undertaking. He points out that since Ko-Ko is already under sentence of death for the capital crime of flirting, Ko-Ko is the obvious choice to be beheaded."
"The three characters then sing the song ""I Am So Proud"". In the last lines of the song, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush contemplate ""the sensation"" of the ""short, sharp shock"" caused by being beheaded:"
"The phrase is particularly popular in music. For example, the phrase is used in the song ""Us and Them"" (from Pink Floyd's 1973 album, ""The Dark Side of the Moon"")."
"""Short Sharp Shock"" is also the name of a 1984 album by Chaos UK. It also appears in the title of an album, ""Short Sharp Shocked"", by Michelle Shocked and the EP ""Shortsharpshock"" by Therapy?. Short Sharp Shock is the name of a crossover thrash band from Liverpool, England.

= = = Jiggs Donahue = = =
"John Augustine Donahue (July 13, 1879 – July 19, 1913) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman and catcher with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Milwaukee Brewers / Baltimore Orioles, St. Louis Browns, Chicago White Sox and the Washington Senators between 1900 and 1909. Donahue was born in Springfield, Ohio. He batted and threw left-handed."
"Donahue had his greatest success from 1904 to 1908, after switching to first base for the Chicago White Sox. Donahue's defensive skills were a key to the White Sox' 1906 World Series championship team, and he led American League first basemen in fielding percentage, assists, and putouts for 3 consecutive seasons, from 1905 to 1907. In 1907, Donahue had 1,846 putouts, which is still the major league record for putouts by a first baseman. He also holds the major league single season record for most chances accepted per game with 12.65 in 1907."
"Though known mostly for his fielding, Donahue was also a decent hitter from 1905 to 1907. In 1905, he was among the American League leaders in batting average (.287), on-base percentage (.346), RBIs (76), and stolen bases (32). In 1906, Donahue was among the league leaders in stolen bases (36) and sacrifice hits (36) and was one of only three White Sox starters to bat over .250 for the 1906 World Champion ""Hitless Wonders."" Donahue hit for a .278 average (5-for-18) with 2 doubles, 1 triple and 4 RBI."
"On October 10, 1906, Donahue broke up a World Series no-hit bid by Cubs' pitcher Ed Reulbach with a single in the 7th inning."
"In 1907, Donahue led the league in games played (157) and at bats (609) and was among the leaders in hits (158) and RBIs (68)."
"In Detroit on May 31, 1908, Donahue recorded 21 putouts in a nine-inning game."
"In 9 seasons, Donahue played in 813 games with 731 hits, 319 runs scored, 327 RBIs, 143 stolen bases, 90 doubles, 31 triples, and a .255 batting average."
"Donahue contracted syphilis and died in 1913 at age 34. He was survived by a brother, Pat Donahue, a major league catcher in the years 1908-10."
= = = Hanstead House = = =
"Hanstead House or Hanstead Park is a country house estate in Hertfordshire, England. Hanstead is near Bricket Wood, about three miles from Radlett and five miles from St Albans, within the green belt around London. It forms part of the civil parish of St Stephen, Hertfordshire within St Albans District Council. The park has been a stud, a college, and a corporate training centre, and is now owned by a property development firm. The current building, though in the Georgian style, dates from 1925. The property was mentioned in the Domesday Book."
"The house was built for the Yule family. Sir David Yule (1858–1928) was a Scottish entrepreneur who went into the family business, which was trade with India, then the ""jewel in the crown"" of the British Empire. He was involved with many additional businesses. The ""Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"" judged him ""arguably the most important businessman in India"" and quoted his obituary in ""The Times"" as ""one of the wealthiest men, if not the wealthiest man, in the country""."
"A later owner of the property wrote: ""In 1925 Sir David decided to build for himself a mansion on this 1200 acre [4.9 km²] estate, located only five miles [8 km] from the northwest edge of London. Prior to this he had built a 'modest' two-story house of some 14 rooms to live in during construction of the mansion. It was later to become the guest house."""
"Yule had married his cousin Annie Henrietta, oldest daughter of his uncle Andrew Yule of Calcutta. They had one child, Gladys. He died only three years after the construction of the house, and ""lies buried in an admirably designed carved stone tomb, covered overhead by a stone and wood canopy, enclosed by an ornate iron fence inside a small wooded park, the whole being encircled by another iron fence."" The Mausolea and Monuments Trust says that the sculpture itself is a draped chair with inscription from Kipling's ""Jungle Book"" and a box tomb showing his Indian jute mills and plantations."
"The two women lived the rest of their lives at Hanstead. The new main house became the home of the daughter, while her mother lived in the guest house (see dower house). They were world travellers who reportedly shared an interest in big game hunting and a love of animals. Hanstead House was said to have been adorned by a large stuffed bear which they had killed in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. On the grounds they kept a seal, penguins, and wallabies."
"In 1925 they expanded their interests to the breeding of Arabian horses. The two women used their considerable fortune to build stables, purchase breeding stock, and establish a stud. Despite its relatively late start, Hanstead was soon considered ""second only in importance to"" Crabbet Arabian Stud, whose founders, husband and wife team Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt, had introduced the breed to England in 1878, and from whom the Yules bought and leased horses. A third stud, Courthouse, was also held up to be of the same level, and the three competed against each other at the annual show at the Roehampton Club"
"Gladys Yule died within a year of Judith Blunt-Lytton (Lady Wentworth), who had inherited Crabbet from her parents and run it for 40 years. The deaths of these two only children, at a time of high inheritance tax, meant that in 1957 a substantial number of British-bred Arabian horses left the country, improving the breed's bloodlines elsewhere. The Hanstead horses were appreciated in the United States and in South Africa."
"Following the death of Gladys Yule in 1957, Hanstead Park was put on the market, where it remained uncared for over a considerable period of time. Many country houses were being demolished at this time."
"In 1959 it was brought to the attention of the American evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong, who had arrived in England looking for a larger office for the British branch of his Radio Church of God. He bought the house and land as the site for his second Ambassador College campus. By the time of the purchase the guest house had already been sold separately to another buyer, who used the property as a private home like an island within the campus. Armstrong wrote in Chapter 72 of his autobiography that Trans World Airlines (TWA) had been considering Hanstead House as a school for stewardesses. ""Yet this mansion, with these outstanding gardens, the aviary, greenhouses, cedars of Lebanon, all finally came to us for £8,000 ($22,800) - the not uncommon price of a five- or six-room cottage on a forty- or fifty-foot lot in America, - and that on terms that gave us several years to pay."""
"In 1959 Hanstead House was renamed Memorial Hall in memory of Richard David Armstrong, Herbert's deceased son. The college at Bricket Wood began its first freshman year in 1960. (The first Ambassador College opened in 1947 at Pasadena, California; in 1964 a third college opened in Big Sandy, Texas which for a brief time became Ambassador University. All three colleges have since closed down.) From the radio studio of Ambassador College, daily broadcasts of ""The World Tomorrow"" were heard around the world on hundreds of stations. There was also a sizeable printing establishment on the site. Improvements were made to the grounds: tennis courts, track, gymnasium, and an Olympic standard (imperial measurements) indoor swimming pool."
"When Ambassador College closed its doors in 1974, the sports facilities were sold separately from the main buildings and eventually became part of a sports centre. The pool, one of the most modern in the area, became home to Verulam amateur swimming club in 1979."
"The college became a corporate training centre, first for the Central Electricity Generating Board and then, from 1993, to the banking group HSBC. In 2004 a volunteer-led community woodland was established on land given by the bank; Hanstead Wood has won a Green Flag Award."
"Lambie was known for his eccentricity, cigar smoking and fondness for pigeons. An occasion when he instructed for a concussed player to be told he was Pelé and sent back onto the pitch is one of the most famous quotes in British football."
"Born in Whitburn, Lambie played for his hometown junior team Whitburn before signing for Falkirk in 1958, where he turned professional and switched position from inside forward to full back. In August 1969 he joined St Johnstone, where he played in the October 1969 Scottish League Cup Final (1–0 loss to Celtic) and took part in the Perth-based club's first European campaign (reaching the third round of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup)."
"After retiring as a player in 1974, Lambie joined the St Johnstone coaching staff, and later moved to Hibernian. He became assistant manager at Hamilton Academical to his former Hibs colleague Bertie Auld, and succeeded him as manager in 1984. He led the ""Accies"" to the First Division title in 1985–86 and won away at Rangers in the next season's Scottish Cup."
"In 1988, Lambie was appointed manager for the first time at Partick Thistle, but a year later returned to Hamilton, before going back to Partick in 1990. He led the ""Jags"" to promotion to the top flight in 1992 and left in 1995 for his former club Falkirk, but quit his post in March 1996. ""The Herald"" wrote in 2002 that ""It is odd how, despite Lambie playing over 200 games for Falkirk, and scoring a decent haul of goals as a defender, he is only remembered for his disastrous managerial reign""."
"Lambie returned for a third spell at Partick in 1999, with the club now in the third tier, and got them into the Scottish Premier League in 2002 via back-to-back promotions. Also in 2002, he guided the club to the Cup semi-finals, where they lost 3–0 to Rangers at Hampden Park. The final stages of the season were chronicled in the BBC Scotland fly on the wall documentary ""Grasping the Thistle"", known for Lambie's use of profanity."
"In January 2003, Lambie announced that he would retire at the end of the season as he did not agree with new regulations in football; he had attempted to sign Nathan Lowndes and Steven Ferguson on loan from English clubs but was barred by FIFA as they had both recently played in Scotland for other teams. On 17 May 2003 he made his farewell in his last game at Firhill Stadium, a 1–0 loss to Dundee United, having already guaranteed survival in the SPL on a considerably lower budget than their competitors. He became a member of the club's board and had a brief fourth spell as manager from December 2004."
"Lambie is remembered for his reaction when Partick player Colin McGlashan suffered a concussion; he ordered his assistant Gerry Collins to ""Tell him he's Pelé and get him back on"". A book of football quotes titled ""Tell Him He's Pelé"" was released in 2010. He is also remembered for taming Chic Charnley, a player sent off 17 times in his career, whom he signed once for Hamilton and three times for Partick."
Lambie was known for his love of pigeon racing and cigars. He spoke of the importance of his Christian faith in his life. He was a member and activist for the Scottish National Party but said that he was not a suitable candidate to seek elected office.
He was awarded the position of Honorary Vice President of Partick Thistle F.C. in August 2006. He was inducted into the Halls of Fame at both Falkirk and Partick Thistle.
"Lambie had three daughters with his wife Mamie, from whom he was separated at the time of his death at the age of 77 on 10 April 2018."
= = = Psyclon Nine = = =
"Psyclon Nine is an American band formed in 2000 in San Francisco, CA, known for their unique blend of electronic, industrial metal and black metal. Originally, Psyclon Nine's music was aggrotech. However, the band has since evolved a more industrial/black metal sound."
"Psyclon Nine's main music contributor is lead vocalist, lyricist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Nero Bellum, who is the only remaining original member. In 2009, Psyclon Nine's fourth album We the Fallen was the band's first and only album to chart on the Billboard Charts."
"Psyclon Nine began in 1999 when roommates, Marshall Goppert and Josef Heresy created an industrial metal music project called ""Defkon Sodomy"", influenced by bands like KMFDM and Ministry. The band only performed under that name twice before changing it to Psyclon Nine. The name was a malapropism of Zyklon B, the trade name of hydrogen cyanide used in the gas chambers during the Holocaust. The “Nine” was used because of the number's significance in Aleister Crowley’s numerological writings. Around this time, Marshall and Josef took on their stage names as Josef Heresy, and Nero Bellum. Nero's name was taken from the Roman Emperor Nero Caesar, and Bellum is Latin for war."
"Bellum met with European NoiTekk record label executive Marco Gruhn at a San Francisco Grendel show, and persuaded him to sign Psyclon Nine. The band's first album Divine Infekt was recorded shortly thereafter, produced and engineered by Da5id Din of Informatik. The title track was remixed by Tactical Sekt and the album was released on September 15th, 2003."
"Psyclon Nine toured lightly on the west coast in the United States and in Europe. They supported acts such as Dismantled, Nocturne, and Martin Atkins."
"Bellum later said in an interview for Vampirefreaks about the Divine Infect remix, ""Tactical Sekt's remix left a bad taste in my mouth"", and attributed that to Anthony Mathers of Tactical Sekt in which his philosophical beliefs made him not want to collaborate with anyone outside of Psyclon Nine again."
"In 2004, Psyclon Nine signed with the American industrial record label Metropolis and returned to Da5id Din's studio for mixing. INRI was released on April 26, 2005 on both Metropolis and NoiTekk Records. The album featured thirteen tracks of dark, aggressive electro focused on religious themes. The album also featured a cover of the Ministry song “You Know What You Are.”"
"In 2005, Nero Bellum met Rotny Ford of the industrial metal band Nocturne on the social networking site LiveJournal. The two discussed musical ideas which led to the band using guitars and drums in their live performances. Ford joined the band on keyboard and guitar."
"Psyclon Nine made several major live appearances following the album's release, including several dates opening for Mindless Self Indulgence. The tour gained the band a fan base. Psyclon Nine returned to Europe for another tour that included a spot on the world's largest Gothic festival, Wave-Gotik-Treffen. It was around this time when drummer Abby Nex, who was also from Nocturne, joined the band as a live drummer."
"At the end of 2005, the band had dropped from their European label NoiTekk and Eric Gottesman quit the band. Gottesman was replaced by members of the industrial rock band Columbine: keyboardist VII and bassist Daniel Columbine."
"With the release of Crwn Thy Frnicatr in 2006, Psyclon Nine began to stray from their early aggrotech sound into a darker black metal / industrial metal approach."
"In late 2006, the band was featured on the cover of the German Gothic magazine Orkus."
"Psyclon Nine went on their first headlining US tour, which eventually led to creative differences between the band and Columbine bassist Daniel. Daniel decided to leave the band at the end of the tour. Abbey Nex replaced him on bass, and Mushroomhead drummer Daniel Fox was used as a live fill-in drummer."
"In early 2007, the band opened for Mushroomhead's 'Savor Sorrow' North American tour which gained the band huge attention among the underground extreme metal / industrial dance scene."
"In May 2007, Psyclon Nine did a European tour that included a spot again at Wave Gotik Treffen. After the European tour, Rotny Ford decided to leave the band for personal reasons."
"In October, the band opened for Mushroomhead again on their second North American tour with Josef on guitar and keys, Abbey on bass, VII on synth, and Daniel on drums."
"In early 2008, the band released its first music video of the fan favorite track 'Parasitic' directed by Mushroomhead's Richard Thomas."
"After the tour with Mushroomhead, Josef Heresy decided to leave the band to go back to college, and VII left to return to his band Columbine. Daniel Fox continued with Mushroomhead. At this time, Nero Bellum decided to move to Los Angeles, CA to begin writing a new album."
"Nero Bellum appeared on the internet channel NoisescapeTV in 2008 and said that he was in the studio working on an album entitled We the Fallen, and has decided to stray away from the harsh EBM music style and incorporate a more black metal meets dark ambient sound."

"Plum Grove Junior High School was built in 1961 for the cost of $1.1 million; the school was opened in September 1962. It started as a 28,000 square foot, one-story, K-8 school with a partial basement. The school was designed for 380 students at the time. Gene Shull was chosen to be the first principal of the school, a position he held until 1969. It was heated by a main boiler and was ventilated by opening windows and doors. Fresh air was reduced for students and staff when fire codes demanded that doors be kept closed. In 1966, a $1.9 million referendum allowed the building to double in size and add newer classrooms that were equipped with small unit ventilators. The school reopened in the fall of 1968. In 1970, it was made exclusively a junior high school."
"In 1988, the junior high's heating and ventilation systems were upgraded. In 1993, a 6.5 million dollar renovation project at Plum Grove added a second floor, cafeteria, resource center, elevator, office, and student service area. This renovation doubled the school's size, making it 98,000 square feet."
"In June 1993, asbestos contractors started to remove the asbestos insulation and tiling. About 90 students had classes in these rooms; 10 students and teachers complained of odors in them. The district consulted TurnKey Environmental Consultants of Mount Prospect, Illinois, to sample the air for contaminants. In 1993, TurnKey submitted a report stating that the levels of alkanes were 133 times lower than the permissible exposure limit set by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The floors were sealed again but odor complaints still resumed. Students and teachers were moved out of these rooms and the floors were shot blasted and sealed with latex-epoxy paint."
"In 1994, The Chicago Tribune found that five employees had died from various forms of cancer, primarily breast cancer, between 1982 and 1994, and four current staff members had been diagnosed with cancer, three of which had been working in the building for ten years. In addition to that, teachers, staff, and students complained of bronchitis, colds, flus, asthma, and allergies. Incidents of asthma were so severe for students that some decided to transfer to different schools. The teachers wrote to the school board asking for an investigation. The administration immediately agreed to investigate the concerns. At this time, media coverage was heavy, placing pressure on the school district to take immediate action."
"A team, including Northwest Community Hospital and TurnKey Environmental Consultants were chosen to investigate the concerns. While the investigation by Northwest Community Hospital and Turnkey Environmental was going on (expected to end in late June), the Classroom Teachers Council (CTC), said it would push to conduct its own tests if the district's team found no problems. This statement was largely due to the revelation that yet another Plum Grove teacher had been diagnosed with cancer."
"In late June, the district announced that the results of the much anticipated investigation would be delayed three weeks. The teachers sent a formal request to the district to get the raw data from the environmental samples to conduct their own investigation. Although ties were found between ingesting certain types of common mold aspergillus and cancer, Dr. Peter Orris, a medical director the district hired for the investigation, denied that mold at the school had any link to cancer in a letter sent to teachers. However, teachers and parents were still concerned that Orris was basing his conclusions in part on a British Medical Journal published in 1976. In late August 1994, it was found by the investigation that there were no cancer-causing agents in Plum Grove, but the air quality of the building was very poor."
"On August 6, 1994, an unknown vandal pried open the school's doors and scattered chemicals and specimens in the science lab."
"In 1997, Plum Grove was recognized by the United States Department of Education as a National Blue Ribbon School. The school was also recognized by the Illinois Honor Roll with its Academic Excellence Award from 2007-2012."
"Each year, Plum Grove participates in a fundraiser for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) called ""Pennies for Patients"". During the fundraiser, organized by Maura Reid, students are encouraged to bring in donations in the form of pennies and other coins; the class with the donation that weighs the most is awarded a prize. Several activities are also held during the fundraiser to support the LLS. The school has participated in the fundraiser since 2002 and has been featured on CBS and in the ""Daily Herald"" for these actions. As of 2015, Plum Grove has raised over $143,000 for the charity."
"Plum Grove is featured in the book ""Code of Silence: Living a Lie Comes With a Price"" by Plum Grove alumnus Tim Shoemaker as the school at which the main characters attend. As a result of the popularity of the book and Shoemaker's success, he visited Plum Grove during the 2014-2015 school year to talk to the students about writing as a career."

"Abhay Deol had a falling out with music company T-Series after the composers from his film Shankar Ehsaan Loy were asked to sign, what they believed to be illegal clauses which would hand over their [the author's] rights to royalty over to the music company. Abhay Deol took to social media and blamed T-Series for delaying the music launch of his film as well as not promoting the movie due to him and the composers not agreeing to sign the documents. This allegation was denied by T-Series who claimed that they had uploaded 3 songs from the movie on its YouTube page and claimed ""In the absence thereof [of appropriate agreements], we cannot be expected to release music when there is no clarity with respect to the rights granted to the producer"" In another statement, T-Series expressed the fact that they had been assured by the company Viacom 18 that they owned all the rights (including the music rights) and that they did not understand why they were being dragged into this dispute which should be between Mr. Deol and Viacom 18. T-Series eventually relinquished their hold on the music rights after a campaign was run by the composers and artists against the music company. Eventually the music for the film was launched after music companies Crecendo and Unisys who took over, with the former releasing the physical copies and the latter releasing the digital copies of the music online. The music was released 5 days before the films theatrical release."

"George Emil Eminsang (ca. 1833 – May 1898) was a prominent Euro-African merchant and political leader on the Gold Coast, who played a prominent role in the last years of Dutch colonial rule on the Gold Coast. After the Dutch Gold Coast was transferred to the United Kingdom, Eminsang became a diplomat for the Netherlands and later for the United States and the Congo Free State. Together with James Bannerman Hyde and James Hutton Brew, Eminsang was one of the first so-called ""country lawyers"" on the Gold Coast."
"Eminsang was an important leader of the No. 10 Akrampafo ""asafo"" ward of Elmina and owner of the most famous hotel of Elmina, St. George's Hotel. Besides his native Twi, he spoke and wrote Dutch, English, Portuguese and German."
"Eminsang was born in Elmina to Joseph Emil Eminsang, a merchant and innkeeper, and an unknown lady from a prominent Dutch/Fanti Euro-African family. He was educated in the Netherlands and Germany, before returning to teach for several years at the Elmina Castle School, where he had completed his primary education."
"In the 1850s, Eminsang established himself as a merchant on the Gold Coast. In 1859, while doing business in Kumasi, Eminsang had a conflict with the Asante chief Kwasi Brantuo, whose porters lost five textiles from a shipment Eminsang had ordered from Anomabu. Asantehene Kwaku Dua I Panyin ruled in favour of Eminsang and ordered that Brantuo pay 15 Engels compensation to Eminsang. Eminsang still refused to pay the wages of the porters, however, leading Brantuo to complain to Asante chief Akyempon Yaw, who regulated Elmina affairs in Kumasi. The conflict became so heated that the Dutch agent in Kumasi, Pieter de Heer, offered to pay Eminsang's debt from his own pocket, but Eminsang flatly refused and swore a Coromantee oath that no payment would take place. After Eminsang started to insult the Asantehene, he was arrested and imprisoned. Eventually, Pieter de Heer managed to persuade Asantehene Kwaku Dua to release Eminsang to send him for trial by the Dutch governor in Elmina."
"Eminsang played a prominent role in colonial affairs in the last years of Dutch rule on the Gold Coast. When in 1868 the Fante Confederacy tried to take Elmina in the aftermath of the redistribution of Dutch and British forts on the Gold Coast, Eminsang was sent by the Elmina government to the Netherlands to plead the case for Elmina with Minister of the Colonies Engelbertus de Waal. After meeting with Eminsang, De Waal proceeded in replacing governor George Pieter Willem Boers with the experienced former governor Cornelis Nagtglas, who as a government commissioner was tasked with finding a solution for the conflict with the Fante."

= = = Competitive Tax Plan = = =
"The Competitive Tax Plan is an approach to taxation, suggested in the United States, that would impose a 10–15% value added tax (VAT) and reduce personal and corporate income taxes. The plan was created by Michael J. Graetz, professor at Columbia Law School and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy. Graetz states that the plan would generate enough revenue so that families with $100,000 of annual income or less — almost 90% of all current filers — would not have to pay income taxes or file tax returns. The Competitive Tax Plan would provide a new payroll tax offset to replace the Earned Income Tax Credit and to protect low and moderate income workers from any tax increase under the new system. Under the initial proposal, households with an annual income of more than $100,000 would be taxed at a flat 25% rate and the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 25%. Graetz argues that reducing the corporate tax rate ""would make the United States an extremely attractive nation for corporate investments for both U.S. citizens and foreign investors"". In 2013, Graetz presented an updated version of his plan for 2015."
"Michael J. Graetz is professor at Columbia Alumni of Tax Law. He was born at November 20, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is married and has five children. He is also a leading expert on national and international tax law. He has taught at University of Virginia Law School, University of Southern California, California Institute of Technology, and Yale Law School, and also worked as assistant to the secretary and special counsel for the Department of the Treasury. Graetz won the Daniel M. Holland Medal by the National Tax Association. He has written more than 80 articles on a wide range of tax, international taxation, health policy, and social insurance issues."
"In his work we can see that in comparison to OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) , he call the U.S. as a ""Low Tax Country"" , meant as the total federal, state and local tax revenues as a percentage of GDP( Gross Domestic Product) are much lower than the one of OECD. What can be interesting is that the Income Tax in the U.S. in comparison to EU27 and OECD is equal or even higher. The U.S. has according to Graetz's data from 2010 low consumption taxas a percentage of total taxation. Further he mentions that the U.S. has been the only OECD country without a VAT in comparison to more than 160 countries all over the world that has already have a VAT. This needs to change according to his work. So he came with the so called "" the five pieces of competitive tax plan"" The steps are:"
There are some basic principles in the proposal for the goods and service tax:
Proposed VAT is 12.9%.
"The next point in the competitive tax plan is to shrink the income tax. He proposed to limit the income tax only to high income earners in order to ensure federal tax progressivity. Another step is to provide a Family Allowance of $100,000 for married couples ($50,000 for singles, $75,000 for heads of households). This step will eliminate great part of income tax return( more than 120 million), and it also will resulted in fewer than 20 percent of all U.S. tax units will be required to file income tax returns. He stated specific levels of income tax rates. For example, for married couples it will be:"
"The next step of the Proposal is to ""Reduce and Reform the Corporate Income Tax"". Proposed tax rate is 15 percent. This step should solve the problem with international income taxation as it reverse current law’s incentives to locate deductions here and income abroad. It will also repeal the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. It should simplify small businesses taxation."
"Another part of the plan is to protect low and middle income families in the way that delivering new child credits through debit cards that can be used at the cash register. All children qualify for $1,500 per child( but for married couples with more than $150,000 ($75,000 singles and heads of households), these credits phase-out at a rate of 5%*). For low and moderate income workers it will be even more."
"Next to protecting low and middle income families, the plan also speaks about protecting low and moderate income workers by providing a Payroll Tax Credit of 15.3 percent for wages up to $10,000 and $1,530 per worker for all workers with earnings between $10,000 and $40,000. This credit eliminates all payroll taxes for workers with $10,000 or less of earnings, also it eliminates at least the employees’ share (half) of payroll taxes for workers with earnings below $20,000. Above $40,000 this credit phases out at a rate of 7.65 percent."
No formal bill for the Competitive Tax Plan itself is in Congress; however Senator Ben Cardin's Progressive Consumption Tax Act has many similar features.

"U.S. Coast Guard Air Station San Diego (CGAS San Diego) is a Coast Guard Air Station based in San Diego, California, United States, across the street from San Diego International Airport. CGAS San Diego operates three MH-60T Jayhawk helicopters off the Coast Guard ramp."
"CGAS San Diego is also adjacent to Sector San Diego which houses two 41-foot Utility Boats, two USCG rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB's), one RB-HS and three RB-S. Being implemented are two Special Purpose Craft-Law Enforcement (SPC-LE), which are USCG vessels used for maritime Law Enforcement. The SPC-LE's have three Mercury Marine engines along with some of the most advanced electronics systems in existence. Also at the station are two USCG Coastal Patrol Boats. The air station is physically separated from the rest of the airfield, such that USCG fixed-wing aircraft must cross a busy, 6-lane city street to reach the runway; street light activation opens the locked gates to the airfield and the air station, and also stops traffic while aircraft are traversing the street."
"Lindbergh Field opened on October 16, 1934 on the Pacific Highway. The San Diego International Airport East Terminal opened on March 6, 1967, and the West Terminal opened July 11, 1979. A new Commuter Terminal opened July 23, 1996. It is self-contained, full service facility with four gates used by seven commuter airlines to handle 25,000 passengers each day. Construction of the expansion of the West Terminal ended in November, 1997. Almost 14 million passengers travel through Lindbergh Field each year. The 27 passenger and cargo airlines operate more than 500 flights each day from the runways."
"On December 11, 1935 negotiations between the City of San Diego and the U.S. Government were concluded which provided of tideland for the construction of a Coast Guard Air Station adjacent to Lindbergh Field, the Municipal Airport. This project had the strong support of many people and agencies, and particularly the Harbor Commission and Department of San Diego and the Chamber of Commerce. The area for this station was deeded to the Coast Guard at no cost, after approval by citizens of San Diego, at a municipal election held in April 1935."

= = = Rising of the North = = =
"The Rising of the North of 1569, also called the Revolt of the Northern Earls or Northern Rebellion, was an unsuccessful attempt by Catholic nobles from Northern England to depose Queen Elizabeth I of England and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots."
"Elizabeth I succeeded her half-sister Mary I as queen of England in 1558. Elizabeth's accession was disputed due to the questioned legitimacy of the marriage of her parents – Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Under Henry VIII and his advisor Thomas Cromwell, power was gradually shifted from regional institutions to royal control. This course was encouraged by Elizabeth's counsellors such as William Cecil and a policy of centralization was the approach favoured by Elizabeth herself at least in regards to the northern border region."
"Opponents of Elizabeth looked to Mary, Queen of Scots, the descendant of Henry VIII's sister Margaret. The claims were initially put forward by Mary's father-in-law, King Henry II of France, and Mary upheld them after her return to Scotland in 1561."
"Many English Catholics, then a significant portion of the population, supported Mary's claim as a way to restore Roman Catholicism. This position was especially strong in Northern England, where several powerful nobles were Roman Catholics; there had been similar risings against Henry VIII; the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536 and Bigod's Rebellion of 1537. Supporters of Mary hoped for aid from France (among Scots) and possibly Spain (among English). Mary's position was strengthened by the birth of her son, James, in 1566 but weakened again when she was deposed in July 1567."
"The rebellion was led by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland. Seven hundred knights assembled at Brancepeth Castle. In November 1569 Westmorland and Northumberland occupied Durham. Thomas Plumtree celebrated Mass in Durham Cathedral. From Durham, the rebels marched south to Bramham Moor, while Elizabeth struggled to raise forces sufficient to confront them. But, hearing of a large force being raised by the Earl of Sussex, the rebels abandoned plans to besiege York, and captured Barnard Castle instead. They proceeded to Clifford Moor, but found little popular support. Sussex marched out from York on 13 December 1569 with 10,000 men against the rebels' 6,000, and was followed by 12,000 men under Baron Clinton. The rebel earls retreated northward and finally dispersed their forces, fleeing into Scotland."
"A questionable role in the rebellion was played by Leonard Dacre, an early sympathiser of Mary. At the outbreak of the rebellion, he travelled to Elizabeth's court at Windsor to claim the heritage of his young nephew, the 5th Baron Dacre. After the latter's untimely death in 1569, this had descended to his sisters, all married to sons of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Dacre returned to Northern England, ostensibly a faithful partisan of Elizabeth, but his intentions remain unclear."
"After the retreat of the rebels, he seized Greystoke Castle and fortified his own Naworth Castle, where he gathered 3,000 Cumbrian troops and tried to keep up the appearance of good relations with the Queen. He held out against a siege of the royal army under Baron Hunsdon but then attacked the retreating army at Gelt River. Though Hunsdon was outnumbered, he charged Dacre's foot with his cavalry, killing 300–400 and capturing 200–300 men. Dacre escaped via Scotland to Flanders, where he died in exile."
"Two of the rebellion's leaders, the Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, had fled into Scotland. Northumberland was captured by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and turned over to Elizabeth in 1572, who had him beheaded at York. After having been hidden at Ferniehirst Castle, Westmorland escaped to Flanders, where he died impoverished. His family lost their ancestral homes and his wife, Jane Howard, also fled to the Continent. She lived the rest of her life under house arrest. Her brother, the Duke of Norfolk, was first imprisoned, then pardoned. He was imprisoned again following the Ridolfi plot in 1571 and finally executed in 1572. Norfolk's treason charges included ""comforting and relieving of the English rebels that stirred the Rebellion in the North since they have fled out of the realm."" Altogether, 600 supporters of Mary were executed, while many others fled into exile."
"Queen Elizabeth declared martial law, exacting terrible retribution on the ordinary folk of the Yorkshire Dales, despite the lack of any popular support for the Earls' Rising, with her demand for at least 700 executions. The victims of this purge were, as a contemporary account said ""wholly of the meanest sort of people"", so that hardly a village escaped the sight of a public hanging. (Source: )"
"In 1570, Pope Pius V had tried to aid the rebellion by excommunicating Elizabeth and declaring her deposed in the papal bull ""Regnans in Excelsis"", but the document did not arrive until the rebellion had been suppressed. The bull gave Elizabeth more reason to view Catholics with suspicion. It inspired conspiracies to assassinate her, starting with the Ridolfi plot."
"In 1587, Elizabeth brought Mary, Queen of Scots, to trial for treason; she was convicted by the court and executed."
"The Rising of the North is the main conflict in the historical drama film ""Mary Queen of Scots"" (2018)."

It rarely uses its call sign, instead calling itself B97 FM. The studios and offices are located at the 400 Poydras Tower in Downtown New Orleans. The station airs the syndicated Kidd Kraddick Morning Show from KHKS Dallas on weekdays."
"WEZB has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for FM radio stations. The transmitter site is off Behrman Highway in the city's Algiers neighborhood. The signal covers much of Southeastern Louisiana and Southwestern Mississippi. WEZB broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD2 subchannel carries Entercom's Channel Q service, primarily for LGBTQ listeners."
"On September 1, 1945, 97.1 signed on the air. This was WRCM, the FM simulcast of AM 990 WJMR (now WGSO) and sister station to WJMR-TV 12 (now WVUE channel 8), all owned by George J. Mayoral. Then, around 1966–67 after the TV station had already been sold, the Supreme Broadcasting Company bought the two radio stations and changed the call signs to WNNR and WNNR-FM. At the time, the stations were located in the Jung Hotel at 1500 Canal Street in downtown New Orleans. WNNR-FM had a power of only 20,500 watts from an antenna 310 feet atop the building, a fraction of its current wattage and antenna height."
"On January 2, 1972, EZ Communications acquired the FM station. It became WEZB, part of a chain of Beautiful Music stations such as WEZC Charlotte, WEZR Washington and others owned by EZ. While it was profitable, it was not able to best WWL-FM (now WLMG) in the easy listening format. Briefly in the 1970s when disco music became a popular genre, 97.1 became ""Disco 97 FM"" on Thursday, February 8, 1979. But the disco era was short, with WEZB switching to a rhythmic contemporary sound, called """"FM 97, The Rhythm Of The City!"""" ""We had a big party in the Atrium at the Hyatt Regency Hotel"" says Jimmy Roberts, B97 FM's first BJ, the station's version of a DJ.

"The #19 engine, also known as the ""Lew Brown"", features a propane-fired boiler and has a total weight of 25 tons (engine and tender). Like its older brother engine, the #12, it is a scale replica of The General. The engine is painted green and was originally named Simon Kenton, after a famous Ohio frontiersman."
"Kings Island maintains a total of 12 open air passenger cars, arranged as 6 cars on each engine. 6 of the cars are painted green, and are typically matched with the No. 19 engine. The other 6 cars are painted red, and are matched with the No. 12 engine. Capacity per completed train (6 cars) is 465 park guests. Each passenger car has a series of seals depicting Native American Tecumseh and frontiersman Simon Kenton (after whom the engines were originally named) with the railroad name."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad features two train stations. Losantiville station is considered the line's main station, and is located in the Rivertown section of the park, next to the entrance of White Water Canyon and Mystic Timbers. It is a covered station and platform. There is also a station located at the entrance to Soak City Water park, which is an uncovered concrete pad station that, unlike the Losantiville station, is a curved station."
"Each train is manned by a total of four associates; an Engineer, Fireman, Front Conductor, and Back Conductor (position of back conductor may be eliminated with the operation of a scaled down train of three passenger cars, rather than the regular six). The Engineer is in charge of the operation of the locomotive, while the Fireman watches over the boiler pressure levels, and maintains the fire and water levels in the boiler. The Front Conductor is in the charge of the movement of the train, as well as the entertainment and wellbeing of the passengers aboard. Additionally, each station must be manned by a Station Master who is responsible for the safety of passengers in the station, helping passengers load and unload, as well as keeping capacity."
"Each morning, the train crew (Engineer and Fireman) prepare the engines for operation at the engine house, located near the Losantiville station. Once the first train of the morning reaches the Losantiville station, the front conductor and back conductor board the train. Once the train is staffed completely, the train must do a full test cycle around the track before passengers can be loaded. During the morning hours, only one engine is in service. Midway through the day, the second train is brought into operation. Opening procedures for the train brought out second differ slightly, in that the front and back conductors board the train in the engine house, rather than at the Losantiville station."
"The Front Conductor is in charge of the movement of the train. During a normal passenger loading procedure, the station master must clear the station platform with a thumbs up signal, at which point the Back Conductor must clear the Front Conductor for movement with a hand signal known as a ""Highball"". Once the Front Conductor verifies the Highball from the Back Conductor and the clear from the Station Master, the Front Conductor will ""Highball"" the Engineer, who then proceeds with operation of the locomotive. ""Highball"" hand signals are also given at two locations along the train route, between the Front and Back Conductor, to signal that everything is clear on all six passenger cars."
"After the water park closes, the park resumes one-train operation for the rest of the night. The last train leaves at park closing and backs the train into the locomotive garage (engine house). After the last cycle has completed for the night, the Engineer and Fireman proceed to back the other train into the engine house from the Losantiville station."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad has some private grade crossings for the private roads where the workers go on. The private grade crossings have one or two crossbucks. There is also a public grade crossing that has four railroad crossing signals, two gated signals with bells and lights for the public path and two gateless signals with just lights for the private road. This crossing is right next to the Soak City station."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad operates during the entire season. Throughout most of the season, it entertains guests and serves as transportation to and from Soak City. During the park's annual Halloween Haunt event, which occurs on weekend nights in September and October, it was transformed into a haunted maze known as ""Tombstone Terror-Tory"". The attraction had a western-theme and utilized the exit path of White Water Canyon. When Kings Island began construction of Mystic Timbers in 2016, the exit path was shortened significantly, and Tombstone Terror-Tory was removed from the Halloween Haunt lineup."

= = = Galwan River = = =
"The Galwan River flows from the disputed Aksai Chin region in southern Hotan County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang of China to Ladakh of India. It originates in the area of Samzungling on the eastern side of the Karakoram range and flows west to join the Shyok River at . It is one of the upstream tributaries of the Indus River."
"The river is named after Ghulam Rasool Galwan, a Ladakhi explorer from Leh, who first explored the course of the river. In 1899, he was part of a British expedition team that was exploring the areas to the north of the Chang Chenmo valley, when ran into this previously unknown river valley. Harish Kapadia states that this is one of the rare instances where a major geographical feature is named after a native explorer."
"The river's length is about 80 kilometers, and it is fast-flowing."
"The Galwan river is to the west of China's 1956 claim line in Aksai Chin. However, in 1960 China advanced its claim line to the west of the river along the mountain ridge adjoining the Shyok river valley. Meanwhile, India continued to claim the entire Aksai Chin plateau."
"These claims and counterclaims led to a military standoff in the Galwan River valley in 1962. On 4 July, a platoon of Indian Gorkha troops set up a post in the upper reaches of the valley. The post ended up cutting the lines of communication to a Chinese post at Samzungling. The Chinese interpreted it as a premeditated attack on their post, and surrounded the Indian post, coming within 100 yards of the post. The Indian government warned China of ""grave consequences"" and informed them that India was determined to hold the post at all costs. The post remained surrounded for four months and was supplied by helicopters. According to scholar Taylor Fravel, the standoff marked the ""apogee of tension"" for China's leaders."
"By the time the Sino-Indian War started on the 20 October 1962, the Indian post had been reinforced by a company of troops. The Chinese PLA bombarded it with heavy shelling and employed a battalion to attack the post. The Indians suffered 33 killed and several wounded, and the company commander and several others were taken prisoner. By the end of the war, China reached its 1960 claim line."
"Anita Baldwin sold the land to the County of Los Angeles for $92,000 in 1918. A sand green golf course appeared following the closure of the school and Arcadia citizens took it over and operated it as a highly successful club."
"In 1935, through an act of Congress, the United States Department of War deeded 185 acres to Los Angeles County with the provision that it be used as a park and recreation center. The redevelopment of Ross Field was a Works Progress Administration project that included not just the golf course but a swimming pool, tennis courts, two baseball fields, a children's playground, and a lawn bowling complex."
"The Santa Anita Golf course opened in two stages. Nine holes were opened in April 1938 and the complete 18 opened on October 12, 1938."
"1938 also saw the birth of the Santa Anita Open—held each year until 1955, in the middle of October, to celebrate the opening of the Golf Course and to start the official Winter Golf Tournament season in Southern California. Prize money that first year was $1,000. Frank Moninger personally underwrote the first two tournaments. The Santa Anita Golf Club with the help of a few individual golfers underwrote the next few events. The County donated the Golf Course for the Santa Anita Open. The Course Record established in the days of ""The Open"" is 62 - held by Ellsworth Vines. Lloyd Mangrum won the first and second Opens with 274 and 278. Par at that time was 70."
In the 1960s the 9th hole was altered to make way for the construction of a baseball field at Arcadia Park. The original tee box was re-positioned to the South West of its original location and the hole was lengthened and turned into a par 5 thus changing par at the course to 71. The original dog leg left configuration and chute of trees has been lost and the hole now plays due east and relatively straight. Additionally significant changes were made to the short 281 yard par 4 17th hole where the large expanse of sand on the left side (south) was replaced with grass. The hole retains its name from the time (Desert) but has lost much character and altered the strategic challenge of its original configuration. Other changes from the era include the removal of several bunkers on the Par 5 Third hole and the sandy waste area between the 10th and 18th holes.
As part of the change in management in 1986 commitments were made to increase secondary facilities (clubhouse and dining) as well as substantive changes to the course itself during 1990-1991. The first hole and the driving range were swapped for safety reasons as errant shots from the range threatened cars on Santa Anita Avenue. The original dog leg left 1st hole was shortened from 409 yards to the current 367 yards. The 18th Green was moved forward to make way for clubhouse construction but the total yardage remained the same as the tee box was lengthened.
"During the 2000-2010 period small modifications were made to return a single bunker to the right of the 3rd hole (where the original design had three) and a large bunker in the center of the fairway of that same hole. Tee boxes on the 4th, 7th and 17th holes were modified. The detached tee boxes on 7th and 17th are seldom if ever used in open play though are occasionally used in tournament play."
"The current record is held by Blake Moore of Monrovia, California who shot a 9 under par 62 on Sunday, July 20, 2003. Moore is attributed with the current record as mentioned above several holes have been changed since ""The Open"" era and the course is now a par 71 rather than the original par 70."

"Palanisamy Sathasivam (born 27 April 1949) was the 40th Chief Justice of India, holding the office from 2013 to 2014. On retirement from his judicial career, Sathasivam was appointed as the 21st Governor of Kerala from 5 September 2014 to 4 September 2019. Sathasivam is the second judge from Tamil Nadu to become the CJI, after M. Patanjali Sastri. He is also the first former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to be appointed as the Governor of a state. He is the first Governor of Kerala to be appointed by the Narendra Modi Government."
"Sathasivam was born to Palaniswamy and Natchiammal in Kadappanallur near Bhavani in Erode district. He graduated from Government Law College Chennai after completing his BA degree Ayya Nadar Janaki Ammal College, Sivakasi."
"Sathasivam enrolled as an advocate on 25 July 1973 at Madras. He was then appointed to the post of Additional Government Pleader, and later as the Special Government Pleader in the Madras High Court. He was appointed a permanent judge of the Madras High Court on 8 January 1996, and transferred to the Punjab and Haryana High Court on 20 April 2007. He was elevated to the post of Judge of Supreme Court on 21 August 2007. During his tenure as Chief Justice, he was the Chairman of the General Council of the Gujarat National Law University. He succeeded Sheila Dikshit as the Governor of Kerala in August 2014."
"Justice Sathasivam authored several path-breaking judgments including the Reliance Gas Judgment (May 2010) where he observed that ""in a national democracy like ours, the national assets belong to the people"" and ""the government owns such assets for the purposes of developing them in the interests of the people""."
"He also delivered the verdict in the controversial triple-murder case of Stains and upheld the conviction of Dara Singh. On 19 April 2010, he delivered the judgement in the Jessica Lal murder case of 29 April 1999. Along with Justice B. S. Chauhan, Sathasivam delivered the judgement in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case, sentencing Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt to five years' imprisonment under the Arms Act. Dutt was asked to serve out the remainder of his sentence. According to ""The Hindu"", ""In a number of judgements, he [Sathasivam] cautioned the courts against awarding lesser sentence in crimes against women and children and showing undue sympathy towards the accused by altering the sentence to the extent of period already undergone."""
"In January 2014, a three-judge panel headed by Chief Justice of India Palanisamy Sathasivam commuted sentences of 15 death-row convicts, ruling that the ""inordinate and inexplicable delay is a ground for commuting death penalty to life sentence"". Supreme Court of India ruled that delays ranging from seven to 11 years in the disposal of mercy pleas are grounds for clemency. The same panel also passed a set of guidelines for the execution of a death row convict, which includes a 14-day gap from the receipt of communication of the rejection of first mercy petition to the scheduled execution date, after going through the Shatrughan Chouhan vs Union of India case."

"The 2013–14 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team represented Wichita State University in the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They played their home games at Charles Koch Arena, which had a capacity of 10,506. They were in their 69th season as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. They were led by seventh-year head coach Gregg Marshall. They were the last team to finish the regular season and enter the NCAA Tournament unbeaten until Kentucky did it the next year."
"The 2013–14 season was arguably the best season in Wichita State's 108-year basketball history. After defeating Missouri State on March 1, 2014, Wichita State became the first men's Division I team ever to finish the regular season 31–0 (Kentucky matched it the next year) , the first team to finish 18–0 in conference play in the Missouri Valley Conference since the 1985–86 Bradley Braves, as well as the first to finish the regular season undefeated since Saint Joseph's in 2003–04. The team's 35–0 start was the best men's Division I start ever (before Kentucky started 38-0 the next year), beating the 1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels who began the season 34–0 and the best Missouri Valley Conference start ever, beating the 1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores, who went 33–0 to start the season. They spent most of the season in the top 10 of both major polls, rising as high as #2 in late February. They continued their run by winning their first MVC tournament title since 1987, and were ranked second in both final major media polls, the highest final national ranking in school history. Though some analysts noted that Wichita State's schedule was relatively easy compared to previous teams that finished the regular season primarily because none of their opponents throughout the season were ranked when they played them, as well as only beating one opponent that was ranked at any point in the season (Saint Louis, who also had a lack of quality wins)."
"They entered the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament undefeated at 34–0. The Shockers beat Cal Poly, 64–37 for their NCAA-record 42–game winning streak to start a season. Two days later, and playing their 5th and final straight game at St. Louis' Scottrade Center, Fred VanVleet's three-point attempt at the end-of-game buzzer against Kentucky bounced harmlessly off the rim, and so went their attempt to become the first men's team in 38 years to win the title undefeated."
"In the 2012–13 college basketball season, the Wichita State University Shockers, under sixth-year head coach Gregg Marshall, finished the season 30–9 and 12–6 in Missouri Valley play to finish in second place. They advanced to the championship game of the Missouri Valley Tournament where they lost to Creighton. They received an at-large bid to the 2013 NCAA Tournament, receiving a 9 seed in the West Region, where they defeated 8 seed Pittsburgh and 1 seed Gonzaga to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the West Region semifinals they defeated 13 seed La Salle and 2 seed Ohio State in the regional finals to be crowned West Region Champions and advance to the Final Four for the second time in school history and first time since 1965. In the Final Four, they lost to eventual-champion Louisville, 72–68. Wichita State was ranked #4 in the final Coach's Poll of the 2012-13 season."

Peace and Rhythm is the second album led by jazz drummer Idris Muhammad which was recorded for the Prestige label in 1971.
"The Allmusic site awarded the album 3 stars stating ""Parts of the second solo album by Prestige Records' house drummer, Idris Muhammad, are an even poppier affair than ""Black Rhythm Revolution"", with a mellow soul-jazz feel replacing the slight Latin tinge of the earlier album... ""The Peace and Rhythm Suite"" is a side-long suite consisting of two long, spacy compositions that predate the ambient house scene by nearly two decades yet sound entirely of a piece with that style. Long, droning, sustained chords on a variety of wind and reed instruments float above Muhammad's percussion, which ebbs and flows in a free, almost arrhythmic way through most of the piece. Fans of The Orb or Brian Eno will find it an old hat, but for early-'70s jazz, this was downright revolutionary""."

"Symptoms of NNN are similar to those of nicotine poisoning and include irritation at the point of absorption (for example, the gums when dipping tobacco is used), nausea and vomiting, sleep disturbances, headache, and chest pain. The substance is also a known carcinogen, meaning that any exposure to the substance can lead to cancer and is proven to cause esophageal and nasal cancer in animals. There is no known ""safe"" levels of NNN ingestion in humans due to its carcinogenic activity. However, in mice, the median lethal dose (LD) is 1g/kg."

= = = Supercilium = = =
"The supercilium is a plumage feature found on the heads of some bird species. It is a stripe which runs from the base of the bird's beak above its eye, finishing somewhere towards the rear of the bird's head. Also known as an ""eyebrow"", it is distinct from the eyestripe, which is a line which runs across the lores, and continues behind the eye. Where a stripe is present only above the lores, and does not continue behind the eye, it is called a supraloral stripe or simply supraloral. On most species which display a supercilium, it is paler than the adjacent feather tracts."
"The colour, shape or other features of the supercilium can be useful in bird identification. For example, the supercilium of the dusky warbler, an Old World warbler species, can be used to distinguish it from the very similar Radde's warbler. The dusky warbler's supercilium is sharply demarcated, whitish and narrow in front of the eye, becoming broader and more buffy towards the rear, whereas that of the Radde's warbler is diffusely defined, yellowish and broadest in front of the eye, becoming narrower and more whitish toward the rear. The supercilium of the northern waterthrush, a New World warbler, differs subtly from that of the closely related (and similarly plumaged) Louisiana waterthrush. The Louisiana has a bicoloured supercilium which widens significantly behind the eye, while the northern has an evenly buffy eyebrow which is either the same width throughout or slightly narrower behind the eye."
"A split supercilium divides above the lores. In some species, such as the jack snipe, the divided stripes reconnect again behind the eye. In others, such as the broad-billed sandpiper, the divided stripes remain separate."
"A supercilium drop is a feature found on some pipits; it is a pale spot on the rear of the which, although separated from the supercilium by an eyestripe, can appear at some angles to be a downward continuation of the supercilium."
= = = Adolf of Altena = = =
"Adolf of Altena, Adolf of Berg or Adolf of Cologne, (c. 1157 – 15 April 1220 in Neuss) was Archbishop of Cologne from 1193 to 1205."
Adolf was born about 1157 as the second son of Count Eberhard of Berg-Altena and his wife Adelheid von Arnsberg.
"About 1177 he became a canon in Cologne. Later, in 1183, he became Dean of the Cathedral, and in the year 1191 Cathedral Provost. After the abdication of his uncle Bruno III of Berg he became Archbishop of Cologne in 1193, as ""Adolf I"", or ""Adolf I von Altena""."
"In March 1194 he received his episcopal consecration by Hermann II of Katzenelnbogen, Prince-Bishop of Münster. In the same year Adolf was instrumental in arranging the release of King Richard I of England, whom he received with considerable solemnity in Cologne shortly afterwards, at the beginning of February 1194. He was a declared opponent of the plans for a hereditary empire of Emperor Henry VI and at Christmas 1195 refused Henry's wish for the election of his son Frederick Roger. He gave up his opposition in August 1197 for the secondary election of the candidate chosen in the meantime by the other Electors in Boppard. However, after the death of Henry VI, Adolf declared the election invalid, as the candidate was not baptised and the Emperor had put the Electors under pressure."
"In the ensuing dynastic struggle for the throne between the Hohenstaufen and the Welfs, he crowned on 12 July 1198 the Welf Otto of Brunswick in Aachen as King of the Romans (or German king). Shortly afterwards, Pope Innocent III, who had an interest in weakening the Hohenstaufen and in breaking their power (particularly in Italy), confirmed the election of Otto. On 6 January 1205 however Adolf then crowned the Staufen competitor for the crown, Philip of Swabia, as German king. Philip had already been crowned in 1198, although only in Mainz Cathedral, but he had nevertheless been crowned with the genuine Imperial Regalia and especially the Imperial crown."
"The Pope, who had reserved himself the king's question himself, was irritated by the rumor of the page change and asked Adolf himself for a report. Since Adolf did not want to sacrifice his just hard-won right of the decisive vote in the royal election, a papal presentation, he did not respond to the papal request. However, he overestimated its importance by far."
"On 19 July 1205 Adolf was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III and declared deposed. Already in July, a new archbishop was elected in Cologne. Since one was still in the Rhineland but still in the Hohenstaufen line, his successor could barely prevail against him, so that it came to a schism in the archbishopric of Cologne."
"In 1207 Adolf von Altena was in Rome, where he tried against his successor and fought for his reinstatement as archbishop - without success. Only the murder of Philip of Swabia (21 June 1208) and the changed political situation led to a submission to the pope and a recognition of his successor for himself and his followers, for which he received an annual pension of 250 marks. Adolf, from then until his death, was active in the archdiocese of Cologne as an auxiliary bishop. However his see was not returned to him."
"Dietrich I von Hengebach was deposed by the papal legate, and in March 1212 he was appointed to head the diocese. While initially holding this to be reinstated, he soon realized that it was just a provisional lead. In fact, the Archdiocese was again in the schism, especially since Adolf now argued with Dietrich von Hengebach before the Pope for reinstatement. The verdict was in 1216 and in Cologne it came again to the election of the bishop. The new archbishop became his successor as cathedral provost, Engelbert II of Berg. He was one of his relatives and had always supported him during the time of the schism, including by handing over goods from the cathedral chapter."
"Until his death, in 1220, Adolf was again active as auxiliary bishop in the archbishopric of Cologne. He died on 15 April 1220 in Neuss."

"Mr. Blotto is a jam band from Chicago, Illinois. They blend hard rock, original rock, southern rock, folk music, and country rock. They formed in 1991, and continue to tour extensively in the midwest area. Along with their seven album releases and four DVDs, they have also released four ""official bootleg"" albums of their live recordings. Their most recent release ""Live at the Leaf"" chronicles a weekend in New Orleans playing at the legendary Maple Leaf. It was released in 2018."
"The core of Mr. Blotto is the brother songwriting team of Mike and Paul Bolger, who had played together in garage rock bands throughout high school. They went in separate directions musically when they attended different colleges, Mike leaning towards the hardcore punk stylings of Hüsker Dü, and Paul focusing on the resurgence of 70s rock like Aerosmith, while eventually discovering Crosby, Stills and Nash and the Grateful Dead, who would later become huge influences. After Paul graduated he decided to pursue the life of a full-time musician while Mike opted to become a lawyer. Paul landed a gig as the house singer in a Polish club in Chicago called ""The Cardinal Club."" It was here that Paul met guitarist Bob Georges and they decided to begin playing together."
"Earlier the Bolger brothers played in the 1980s in a group called Fred, alongside future members of the Freddy Jones Band."
"Paul and Bob found drummer Alan Baster at a jazz night, and hired him on. After several auditions for a bass player yielded no results, Paul convinced Mike to be an interim bass player. The band as a four-piece started hitting Chicago area open mic nights and outlying bars, developing their roots-oriented jamband sound and weaving a large amount of reworked Grateful Dead songs into their sets to supplement the originals being penned by Paul, Mike and Bob. As their audience grew, Mike quit being a lawyer and became a full-fledged member."
"They released Parking Karma and found their way into the larger bars and venues of the Chicago scene. After the album was released, Dave Allen - an old college bandmate of Paul's - joined on keyboards, filling out the bass-acoustic guitar-electric guitar-keyboards-drums ensemble that has remained consistent through personnel changes since."
"In addition to Piano, Synths, & Hammond B-3, Dave supplied another singing voice and an ability to improvise lyrics that complemented a long-standing element of the early Blotto show, the ""Reggae Rap,"" in which Paul would freestyle over a rock-steady type of beat."
"In the mid-90s, they released a second CD, ""Bad Hair Day,"" and continued their process of steadily playing shows in the Chicago area. By the end of the decade they had built their audience to the point that they were a significant draw at local performances and festivals."
"1998 saw a third CD, Ancient Face; in 1999 Bob Georges was replaced by Mark Hague. The introduction of Mark (who had played with the Freddy Jones Band) marked a creative period for the band, and he helped pen the next generation of Mr. Blotto tunes. Paul, Mark & Mike started meeting every Monday to work on new original ideas. In these sessions, any idea would be chased down and put to tape. These songs became Cabbages and Kings, the 4th CD which (93.1) WXRT called the band's best release yet."
"Around this time, the band addressed the constant demand for a Live Record. Mr. Blotto had been, from its inception, an improvisational band and had always allowed people to record the shows. A taper path was built that included an analog to digital converter, a distribution amplifier, and an open invitation for all to enjoy the high quality of a constant gain board patch in either digital or analog. As a result, clean Mr. Blotto boots began to cross the country, often in advance of the band—this is especially true outside of the Midwest, where they rarely tour."
"Seeing as not everyone had a portable CD burner or DAT, Mr. Blotto began issuing Live Shows and Compilations. The Bootleg Series is a single CD of songs handpicked by the band for their unique characteristics, where the Just Did It series is made up of double disc sets from one particular show or run of shows."
Nagin said that his remarks were meant to be a call for African Americans to once again return to New Orleans despite the supposed belief that many of the people Uptown did not want them back.
"The Mayor apologized for the suggestion that people Uptown (a mixed neighborhood) were racist, noting the importance of that section of town in the city's recovery. He particularly stated regret for the statements about God. ""I don't know what happened there,"" he said. ""I don't know how that got jumbled up. That whole God thing, I don't know how that got mixed up in there."" Nagin concluded ""I need to be more aware and sensitive of what I'm saying... Anyone I've offended, I hope you forgive me."""

= = = August Thyssen = = =
"August Thyssen (; Eschweiler, 17 May 1842 – Landsberg Castle, Ratingen, near Kettwig, 4 April 1926) was a German industrialist."
After he had completed his studies at the Politechnische Schule Karlsruhe and a commercial school at Antwerpen he like his brother Joseph Thyssen joined the bank of his father Friedrich Thyssen.
"In 1867 Thyssen and several members of his family founded the iron works ""Thyssen-Foussol & Co"" in Duisburg. When this company was dissolved in 1870, he used the new capital to establish with his father the ""Walzwerk Thyssen & Co"" that would become the base of an industrial empire in the industrialized Mülheim an der Ruhr, where the high of iron and steel prizes contributed to the making of his fortune. Initially he managed different companies separately in a decentralized fashion, but eventually he united them through a holding company. The largest company of his was the coal mining company ""Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser"" in Hamborn (now part of Duisburg) that he had acquired in 1891."
"He built the first 500-ton blast furnace in Germany, the first 100-ton Martin furnace, and the first large tube (iron pipe size) works. Together with Hugo Stinnes Thyssen was a cofounder of RWE."
"On 3 December 1872 in Mülheim an der Ruhr he married Hedwig Pelzer (1854–1940), daughter of Johann-Heinrich Pelzer and wife Hedwig Troost. They divorced in 1885. The four children during the marriage were Fritz, August, Heinrich and Hedwig. To avoid the possibility that his divorce would lead to a partitioning of his industrial empire, Thyssen transferred the property to his children, but retained the management rights for himself during his lifetime."
"The Thyssen conglomerate became the nucleus of Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, the biggest mining and steel cartel in the world, prior to World War II. Thyssen was refounded in 1953 and joined with KruppHoesch to become ThyssenKrupp AG in 1997."
"Thyssen purchased most of Beeckerwerth, including Haus Knipp, in the early 20th century."
"He was the first in his family to start acquiring a collection of works of art, including six pieces by his friend sculptor Auguste Rodin."
"Thyssen's firm was a vertically integrated company, controlling all aspects of the steelmaking process. He owned his own fleet of ships, a network of docks and a railroad. Although he was one of the richest men in Germany, to the day he died his ethos was ""If I rest, I rust."" He lived a simple life; he ran his empire from a dingy office in Mülheim, drove an old car, wore off-the-peg suits, and was known to drink and eat with his workers. He was also an ardent republican."
Thyssen died in 1926 of pneumonia following complications from eye surgery.

= = = Swaledale sheep = = =
"Swaledale is a breed of domestic sheep named after the Yorkshire valley of Swaledale in England. They are found throughout the more mountainous areas of Great Britain, but particularly in the Yorkshire Dales, County Durham, and around the pennine fells of Cumbria."
"Swaledales are noted for their off-white wool, curled horns and white around their nose and eyes. They are used for the production of lamb/mutton, the North of England Mule sheep, and as Pedigree breeding stock. Together with the Rough Fell, Herdwick, and Dalesbred sheep, they are one of the four variations associated with the English Lake District."
"Well suited to the exposed regions in which they predominantly live, the Swaledales are very hardy, thick coated, able bodied, and bold. The ewes make excellent mothers and are known for being able to rear lambs well, even in adverse conditions. They are of a medium build, with black faces marked with bright white around the nose and eyes, and both males and females grow curled horns, however the males horns are much larger. Their coats are thick and very coarse, and are considered a uniform white or off-white colour. The wool they produce, although durable, resilient and usable for a number of applications, is worth very little, with the British Wool Marketing Board paying approximately 40 pence per kilo of wool. The marketed fleece and fibre may contain kemp that is not white, so some yarns and prepared fibres from the Swaledale are grey. The sheep are also known for their tender and good-flavoured lamb and mutton."
"The Swaledales as a breed are related to Scottish Blackface and Rough Fell sheep, both of which are also predominant in upland locations in the United Kingdom and noted for their ability to thrive in exposed locations. Although the specific origins of the breed are unknown, a non-indigenous and exotic ancestor for the Swaledale was considered by two noted names of the eighteenth century, John Naismyth and Charles Findlater. Published in 1796, Naismyth's opinion in ""Young's Annals of Agriculture"" was that the origin of the black-faced highland breeds was ""impossible to trace"". Robert Trow-Smith in his book ""A History of British Livestock Husbandry, 1700–1900"" wrote: ""... it has already been suggested that this family stood outside the main stream of ancient British sheep..."" and that the root of the Swaledale and Scottish Blackface breeds could be the Argali. This tenuous link between domestic sheep and the wild Argali has since been proved to be insupportable due to a significant difference in genetic make-up and number of chromosomes."
"Before the Swaledale, Scottish Blackface, and Rough Fell emerged as distinct breeds, their 17th-century forerunner was the Linton. It was named after the West Linton market in Peeblesshire, which specialised in selling the hardy Lintons for Scottish Highland and other upland farming. At the beginning of the 18th century, the market is recorded as having sold upwards of 9,000 sheep in a single day, numbers which surely helped establish the breed firmly in upland areas."
"The Swaledale Sheep Breeders Association was founded in 1919 and originally consisted of farmers living within a seven-mile radius of the Tan Hill Inn, on the North Yorkshire moors. The association is an active organisation point for Swaledale sales, shows, breeding, and products."
"There are approximately 1,200 flocks of pedigree Swaledale sheep in the United Kingdom. Fine pedigree tups (rams) sell for approximately £2,000 to £5,000 on average, though the highest price paid at auction for a prized ram was £101,000. Being a hardy breed, farmers are able to rear their Swaledale flocks in remote and exposed locations, generally without needing to provide indoor accommodation."
"The sheep produce commercially viable mutton and wool. Swaledale mutton has good flavour and tenderness. Wool colour and coarseness prevents Swaledale wool from fetching high prices, but its strong and durable properties make it suitable for carpets, rugs, and insulation. However, the wool is also used for spinning and knitting of clothing, though on a lesser scale to its other uses."
"The Swaledale sheep is an official symbol of the Yorkshire Dales. In 2003, plans were submitted to build a Swaledale sheep visitor centre in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, declaring Kirkby Stephen as the ""spiritual home of the Swaledale sheep"". These plans drew strong opposition from the town of Hawes, in Yorkshire, a strong competitor in terms of Swaledale sales, and which had its own plans for a visitor centre."
"A control flock of Swaledales has been used to study and develop scrapie-resistant sheep. An infectious, persistent, and spontaneous disease, animals infected with scrapie must be quarantined and destroyed. The experimental breeding involved selecting a group of Swaledale sheep with low suspectability to the disease, injecting them with the agents of the disease, and breeding from the survivors. The research has concluded that the offspring of the infected sheep are more able to survive scrapie."
"A commercially successful breed, the North of England Mule, has been produced from the Swaledale ewes, by mating with Bluefaced Leicesters. The offspring of this cross are now one of the most prolific lowland sheep."
"Swaledale cheese is an award-winning cheese that is manufactured in the Swaledale area, though not exclusively from sheep of this breed."
Burk graduated from Baylor Law School and became general counsel to the Houston Oilers.
"Burk later worked as an NFL official as a back judge (now field judge), wearing uniform number 63. He worked the game that saw Joe Kapp of the Minnesota Vikings tie his record for seven touchdown passes in one game in 1969 vs. the Baltimore Colts. Burk was also the back judge in the famous 1972 playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers. That game, played in Pittsburgh, featured the play that came to be called the ""Immaculate Reception"". From his position as back judge, Burk was the first of the officials to signal a touchdown."
"During a 1973 game between the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos, Bears coach Abe Gibron can be heard chewing out Burk throughout the contest. Gibron was miked for the game by NFL Films, and the footage was released by NFL Films Executive Director Steve Sabol in 2001."

= = = Cohoes Falls = = =
"Cohoes Falls [Kahon:ios, Mohawk for ""Canoe Falls""] is a waterfall on the Mohawk River shared by the city of Cohoes and the town of Waterford, New York, United States. Discovered by the indigenous people, the falls were called ""Ga-ha-oose"" or ""Ga-ho'n'-yoos"" by the Mohawks, which is believed to mean ""The Place of the Falling Canoe."" Cohoes historian Arthur Masten wrote in his 1880 history that the phrase might mean ""Potholes in the River,"" referring to the potholes that appear in the riverbed when it is dry. In the oral tradition of the ""Haudenosaunee"" (Iroquois), the Cohoes Falls are the site where The Great Peacemaker, performed a feat of supernatural strength, convincing the Mohawk people to become the founders of the Iroquois League of Nations or Confederacy. Some historians believe the Mohawks launched the Confederacy as early as 1142 CE, though other experts report dates ranging from 1450-1650."
"Celebrated by 18th-century travelers in letters and journals, the Cohoes Falls, also called The Great Falls of the Mohawk, were regarded as the second-most beautiful cataract in New York State after Niagara. In 1804, the national poet of Ireland, Thomas Moore, visited Cohoes and wrote a paean to the waterfall's beauty: ""Lines Written at the Cohos, or Falls of the Mohawk River."""
"In 1831, town leaders built a dam across the Mohawk River to harness the power of the falls to fuel the turbines of the city's burgeoning textile industry. Over the next several decades, the predominant company, Harmony Mills, became the largest manufacturer of cotton in the United States, thanks to its control of local water rights. When all the mills closed in the wake of the Great Depression, city leaders neglected the potential of the falls for tourism. They leased the flow rights to a series of power companies, including Niagara Mohawk and Orion Power."
"The Erie Canal was planned to overcome the navigational barrier of the Cohoes Falls. The original ""Clinton's Ditch"", the Erie Canal of 1825, was built through the city of Cohoes. The later Enlarged Canal was realigned, yet still went through the City of Cohoes. The Barge Canal, which opened in 1918, bypasses Cohoes and runs though the Village of Waterford via the Waterford Flight of Locks."
"The Cohoes Falls is 90 feet (28 m) high and 1,000 feet (305 m) wide. Its flow is most impressive in springtime, sometimes running at of water per second, but as the season changes, there is less water for the falls because so much of the flow is diverted at the Crescent Dam to the Barge Canal through Lock 6. Most of the water is still diverted for power generation; some is diverted for the Cohoes water supply. During the summer, the falls are virtually dry, revealing shale rock formations that have their own distinctive beauty. The 87-year average flow of the Mohawk River at Cohoes is 34,638 cubic feet per second, but this includes water diverted to the power plant and Erie Canal locks."
= = = Usambara Mountains = = =
"The Usambara Mountains of northeastern Tanzania in tropical East Africa, comprise the easternmost ranges of the Eastern Arc Mountains. The ranges of approximately long and about half that wide, are situated in the Lushoto District of the Tanga Region. They were formed nearly two million years ago by faulting and uplifting, and are composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks. They are split into two sub-ranges; the West Usambaras being higher than the East Usambaras, which are nearer the coast and receive more rainfall."
"The mountains are clad in virgin tropical rainforest which has been isolated for a long period and they are a centre of endemism. Historically they were inhabited by Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people but in the eighteenth century, a Shambaa kingdom was founded by Mbegha. The kingdom eventually fell apart after a succession struggle in 1862. German colonists settled in the area which was to become German East Africa, and after World War I it became part of the British mandated territory of Tanganyika."
"The Usambaras are approximately long and ranging from in width. They form part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, which stretch from Kenya through Tanzania. The range is one of the world's Biodiversity hotspots."
"The range is accessible from the towns of Lushoto in the west, and Amani in the east. The Usambaras are commonly split into two sub-ranges, the West Usambara Mountains and the East Usambara Mountains. The East Usambara are closer to the coast, receive more rainfall, and are significantly smaller than the West Usambara."
"The mountain range was formed nearly two million years ago. Due to a lack of glaciations and a relatively consistent climate, the rainforest has gone through a long term and unique evolution resulting in an impressive amount of endemism and an old growth cloud rainforests."
"The West and East Usambaras are large ranges of Precambrian metamorphic geologic formations of acid-gneisses, pyroxenes, and amphiboles. These mountains were formed by faulting and uplifting creating the drainage system of troughs that form many watersheds, which provide water to a majority of the population of northeast Tanzania."
"The Usambara Mountains are fairly unusual in East Africa with their natural regions still covered in tropical forests, which otherwise continentally remain primarily in Western Africa. Considered tremendously significant ecologically and a Biodiversity hotspot. There are many protected zones throughout the range, which are being expanded and contributed to by the Tanzanian government, associated NGO's and research teams, and donor countries such as Norway."
"Several species are endemic to the Usambara forests, including the Usambara eagle-owl (""Bubo vosseleri""), the Usambara akalat (""Sheppardia montana""), the Usambara weaver (""Ploceus nicolli""), the African violet (""Saintpaulia ionantha""), the tree species ""Calodendrum eickii""."
"Historically the Usambara Mountains have been inhabited by the Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people who were a mix of agriculturalists and pastoralists."
"A Shambaa kingdom based on Vugu was founded by Mbegha in the first half of the 18th century. His grandson Kinyashi Muanga Ike gave the kingdom a stronger political and military structure. Under Kinyashi's son Kimweri ye Nyumbai the kingdom grew to cover both the west and east Usambaras, extending down to the coast and into the Pangani River valley to the south. After Kimweri died in 1862 the kingdom fell apart in a succession struggle."
"In the late 19th century when within the Usambara District of German East Africa, German colonialists came into the area bringing with them a mix of cash crops like lumber trees, coffee, tea, and quinine, and also designated forests as reserves for either water conservation or timber use. They also brought many new Western concepts, which often were diametrically opposed to traditional beliefs, such as coexistence with the forest versus forest as a ""separate wilderness"". The result of colonialism was a massive change in the way forests were perceived in the community, and conversion of traditional agriculture to cultivating cash crops such as quinine, pine trees, bananas, maize, tea, and coffee."
"In 1882 Adalbert Emil Walter Redliffe le Tanneux von St. Paul-Ilaire (known as Baron Walter), the Governor of the Usambara District of German East Africa, collected seed and plants of a small herb which were sent to Hermann Wendland, Director of the Berlin Royal Botanic Garden. Wendland cultivated the plants and recognized them as representing a new species in a new genus, ""Saintpaulia ionantha"", with the English common name African violet. In the generic name. Saintpaulia he recognized von St. Paul-Ilaire; the specific name he assigned means violet (Gr. ion) flower (Gr. anthos). In their native Usambara Mountains cloudforests, the plants are threatened with extinction."
"The prisoners were permitted brief daily exercise in an enclosed garden. However, the windows to their rooms were painted over and they were kept in isolation from the outside. A high wooden fence was built around the outer perimeter of the house, closing it off from the street."
"About midnight on 16–17 July 1918, Commander Yurovsky entered the second-floor room of Dr. Botkin, who was awake and writing a letter. Botkin was told to awaken the Imperial family and their three remaining servants, so that the whole party could be evacuated from Yekaterinburg. The reason given was that the anti-Bolshevik White Army forces of Tsarist and moderate democratic socialists in the ensuing Russian Civil War of 1918–1921, were nearing the city and that there had been firing in the streets."
"After taking about half an hour to dress and pack, the Romanovs, Botkin and the three servants were led down a flight of stairs into the courtyard of the house, and from there through a ground-floor entrance to a small semi-basement room at the back of the building. Chairs were brought for Tsarevich Alexei and Tsarina Alexandra at the Tsar's request. The remainder of the party stood behind and to one side of the seated pair."
"After a while, Yurovsky and a party of armed men entered the basement room through the double doors. Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Maksim Gorky Ural State University, has established that the executioners were Yakov Yurovsky, G. P. Nikulin, M. A. Medvedev (Kudrin), Peter Ermakov, S. P. Vaganov, A. G. Kabanov, P. S. Medvedev, V. N. Netrebin, and Y. M. Tselms. Three Latvians refused at the last minute to take part in the execution."
"Yurovsky spoke briefly to the effect that their Romanov relatives had attempted to save the Imperial family, that this attempt had failed and that the Soviets were now obliged to shoot them all. He and his squad then opened fire with pistols on the prisoners."
"The number of people crowded into a comparatively small area led to an inefficient and messy slaughter. The women among the prisoners had diamonds and jewelry concealed in their clothing, deflecting many of the bullets. It took between twenty and thirty minutes before all were killed."
"As early as 1923, the photographs of the fenced house were disseminated in the Soviet press under the label of ""the last palace of the last Tsar"". In 1927, the house was designated a branch of the Ural Revolution Museum. It then became an agricultural school before taking on new life in 1938 as an anti-religious museum. During this period it was customary for party apparatchiks to arrive in large tour groups, posing before the bullet-damaged wall of the cellar in which the former Tsar and his family had been murdered. In 1946, it was taken over by the local Communist Party. In 1974, it was formally listed as a Historical-Revolutionary Monument. However, to the embarrassment of the government, it was steadily becoming a place of pilgrimage for those who wished to honour the memory of the imperial family."
"In 1977, as the sixtieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution approached, the Politburo decided to take action, declaring that the house was not of ""sufficient historical significance"", and ordering its demolition. The task was passed to Boris Yeltsin, chair of the local party, who had the house demolished in September 1977. He later wrote in his memoirs, published in 1990, that ""sooner or later we will be ashamed of this piece of barbarism."" However, despite this action, the pilgrims kept coming, often in secret and at night, leaving tokens of remembrance on the vacant site. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union that was complete by 1991, the Church on the Blood was built on the part of the site and is now a major place of pilgrimage."
"On one side of the church, there's an orthodox cross which marks the location of the Romanov family’s death. Even during the Soviet Era, there were crosses in that area, but it changed over time. Different crosses would be replaced by a new one as the years went by. A small wooden structure was eventually built behind the cross and still stands near the church today; it can be seen in the picture on the right."
"The house features as the setting for two plays: ""Ekaterinburg"" (the title being an alternate romanization of Yekaterinburg) and ""The House of Special Purpose"" (Heidi Thomas, 2009). Both plays deal with the time in captivity spent inside the Ipatiev House by the Romanovs and their retainers."
= = = DIN sync = = =
"The DIN sync standard, also called Sync24, defines a synchronization interface for electronic musical instruments."
"DIN sync was introduced in the early 1980s by Roland Corporation for the synchronization of music sequencers, drum machines, arpeggiators and similar devices. It has since been superseded by MIDI, in the mid to late 1980s. The DIN sync standard consists of two signals, clock (tempo) and run/stop. Both signals are TTL compatible, meaning the low state is 0 V and the high state is about +5 V."
"The clock signal is a low-frequency pulse wave suggesting the tempo. Instead of measuring the waveform's frequency, the machine receiving the signal merely has to count the number of pulses to work out when to increment its position in the music. Roland equipment uses 24 pulses per quarter note, known as Sync24. Therefore, a Roland compatible device playing sixteenth notes would have to advance to the next note every time it receives 6 pulses. Korg equipment uses 48 pulses per quarter note."
The run/stop signal indicates whether the sequence is playing or not.
"The DIN sync standard is so named because it uses 5-pin DIN connectors, the same as used for MIDI. DIN sync itself is not a DIN standard. Note that despite using the same connectors as MIDI, it uses different pins on these connectors (1, 2, and 3 rather than MIDI's 2, 4 and 5), so a cable made specifically for MIDI will not necessarily have the pins required for DIN sync physically connected via wires. In some applications the remaining pins (4 and 5) are used as ""tap"", ""fill in"" or ""reset and start"", but this differs from one device to another."
"If a device is a DIN sync sender, the positive slope of start/stop must reset the clock signal, and the clock signal must start with a delay of 9 ms."
"A detailed description on how to implement a DIN sync sender with Play, Pause, Continue and Stop functionality was published by E-RM Erfindungsbuero."
"The MIDI interface uses the same 5-pin DIN connectors, but is electrically not compatible with DIN sync. The MIDI protocol features a MIDI beat clock. MIDI beat clock also works with 24 ticks per quarter note."
"""Analog clock"" signals are equivalent to the clock signal at pin 3 of DIN sync interface. The clock rate is usually higher than the DIN sync's rate. Typical values are 48, 96 or 192 pulses per quarter note (examples: Oberheim DMX, DX, DSX; Linndrum 1 and 2)."
"""Analog trigger"" signals transfer a pulse per musical event. For instance a trigger corresponds to a step of an analog sequencer or an arpeggiator, a step in a rhythm pattern. Typical analog triggers run at four pulses per quarter note."
"The combination of DIN sync with a different clock system can be achieved either by converting the format and / or the clock rate (see list below) or by using a central unit (so called master clock), which provides multiple clock formats. The approach with a masterclock is usually chosen, especially if a synchronization with absolute time is required, such as synchronisation with a tape recorder or with video footage."
"Typical devices which can act as a master clock and provide DIN sync include the Roland SBX-80, Roland SBX-10, Friendchip SRC, E-RM midiclock⁺ and Yamaha MSS1. Many drum machines which have DIN sync and MIDI clock outputs can act as master clock for those two formats."
"Though DIN sync and MIDI clock have the same clock rate, they require a conversion of the format within a microprocessor or similar. The conversion from MIDI clock to DIN sync is available in many industrial devices. For the conversion from DIN sync to MIDI clock there is at the moment only the device 'Sync-Split2' of the company Innerclock Systems. Also two no longer produced devices do this type of conversion: Roland SBX10, Korg KMS30. On September 1st 2014, Roland introduced the SBX-1 which provides MIDI to sync24 or sync48 conversion."
"To get an analog trigger or clock from the DIN syncs clock signal one has to use digital frequency division or frequency multiplication. There are no dedicated industrial devices which provide a division. The Roland SBX10 can convert into a 48, 96, and 120 PPQN clock."
"Some devices have a DIN sync input as well as DIN sync output, other device have only a single DIN socket which sometimes can be switched between input and output."
"Note that sync48 devices can be combined with sync24 devices, if 32nd notes are programmed instead of 16th notes."

= = = Modibo Adama = = =
"Adama ɓii Ardo Hassana (1786 – 1847), more commonly known as Modibbo Adama, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior, who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fombina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adama's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in Northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region."
"Adama studied in Hausaland and earned the title ""Modibbo"" (""Lettered One"") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adama to extend his jihad east as ""Lamido Fombina"" (Ruler of the Southlands)."
"Adama raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town."
"Though he fought many more campaigns, Adama now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adama ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as lamibe (singular: lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government."
"Upon Adama's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of Southern Cameroon."
"Adama came from a respected but humble family; his father, Hassana, was a well regarded scholar of Islam and minor nobleman from Ba'ajo. Adama travelled to Bornu for his education, where he stayed for some time under the tutelage of Mallam Kiari. He continued his studies in Hausaland (modern Northern Nigeria), where legend says his teacher was the Fulani Shehu Usman dan Fodio in Degel. Adama proved a bright scholar and a pious Muslim, and he earned the title ""Modibo"", ""Lettered One"". After several years away, he returned home to Guringa around 1804. There, the news was grim. Adama's father had died in 1803 fighting the Bata."
Talk in Gurina also concerned events in Hausaland. Word had arrived that Usman dan Fodio had declared a militant jihad on the Hausa leaders. He had installed himself at Gudu and subsequently defeated non-Fulani leaders at Gobir and Kébbi. Usman had now turned his attention to Bornu and to the vast southlands of Fumbina (modern-day Northern Cameroon).
"Still, the picture seemed unclear to leaders farther from the fighting. Was Usman a ""Mujaddid"" (reformer), or was he the ""Mahdi"", a saviour figure who would create an ideal Muslim society? In 1805 or 1806, the Fulani leaders at Guringa assembled a delegation to visit Usman and find out. Adama's pious reputation and familiarity with Hausaland made him a natural fit for the mission."
"The party met Usman in 1806, probably in Gwandu. There, they learned that his intention was to extend his jihad eastward, into Fumbina. The goal was ostensibly to convert various Kirdi (pagan) peoples to Islam and to protect Muslims who already lived in the area. The jihadists were also supposed to educate the region's current Muslim population, many of whom merged Islam with paganism."
"Though not the oldest member, Adama was one of the more zealous about Usman's ideas. Usman thus presented him with a command that would change his life dramatically. The Shehu gave Adama his blessing and presented him with a flag, the symbol of command in Usman's army. The Shehu then charged Adama to carry the jihad into Fumbina and from the Nile to the Bight of Biafra. Adama also received the power to distribute flags of command to others, thus establishing more centres of Fulani Islam and spreading the war to farther reaches."
"Adama immediately began recruiting Fulani and Hausa volunteers and mercenaries. These were mainly mounted cavalrymen fighting with sword, bow, and poisoned arrow. Adama forbade them to pillage or to kill indiscriminately, but enemy nations were given two choices: convert to Islam or become a tributary state. Those ethnic groups that lacked a centralised government had but one: become slaves to the Fulani and convert to their faith."
"The non-Fulani Muslims of the Adamawa largely rejected Adama's jihad; they viewed it as little more than an excuse to spread Fulani hegemony. However, it was primarily the Fulani leaders (""ardo'en"", singular: ""ardo"") of Fumbina with whom Adama was concerned. Some of them rejected his primacy for various reasons: He was from a fairly humble background, he owned little wealth, his army was still small, and he lacked charisma. The majority, however, welcomed Adama as a military commander or religious leader at the very least. Adama's son-in-law, Jauro Dembo, had already settled in Fumbina at Malabu and became one of his lieutenants."
"The makeshift army made headquarters at Gurin, a fort at the junction of the Faro and Benue Rivers where Fulani warriors had regrouped after fighting the Bata in 1803. Adama then led his forces in a series of strikes on Bata settlements such as Pema, Tepa, and Turuwa. The victories elated Adama's men, who took numerous Bata slaves."
"The early successes convinced more local Fulani leaders to come to Adama's side. Even those ardo'en who opposed his political rule recognised the jihad as an opportunity to expand their territories. Njobdi of the Wollarbe clan is one notable example, and his major rival, Hammam Sambo, perhaps the first ardo to have settled in Fumbina, proved the major holdout. Bitter relations between Njobdi and Hammam would prove a major obstacle in Adama's quest to maintain a cohesive empire."
"After this victory the whole Italian Kingdom lied on the mercy of the Hungarians. With no Italian army to oppose them, the Hungarians decided to spend the mild winter in Italy, continuing to attack monasteries, castles and cities, trying to conquer them, like they did before they had started to be chased by Berengar's army."
"On 13 December 899 they attacked Vercelli, where the bishop of Vercelli and archchancellor of the Carolingian Empire, Liutward, trying to escape them, taking with him his treasures, accidentally stumbled upon them, so he was killed and his treasures taken away. On 26 January 900 they conquered Modena, and two days later the Abbey of Nonantola, where they burned the monastery and the church, and killed monks."
"In the meantime, on 8 December 899, emperor Arnulf died in Regensburg, so the alliance between East Francia and the Principality of Hungary lost its validity. The Hungarian envoys sent from the new home of the Hungarians, the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, to negotiate the renewal of the alliance, were seen as spies by the guardian and councillor of the new king, the 6 year old Louis the Child, Hatto I, Archbishop of Mainz and his advisers, and sent home, having achieved nothing. This started a state of war between the two political communities, so the Principality of Hungary needed the Hungarian army from Italy, which, because they became an important task in the conquest of Pannonia, which was planned by the Hungarians. They had to attack the Bavarian province from South West in the same time when another Hungarian army attacked it from East."
"Before the Hungarians left Italy, in the spring of 900, they concluded peace with Berengar, who gave them in exchange for they departure hostages, and money for the peace. After this defeat, or at the latest from 904, Berengar started to pay them tribute regularly, and until his death in 924, and in exchange the Hungarians helped him against every enemies that he had. As Liuprand writes, the Hungarians became Berengar's friends. It seems that, in time, some of the Hungarian leaders became his personal friends."
"On their way back home, the Hungarians accomplished a military performance, which was never even tried by a land army in the history. Having no ships, boats or any kind of water crafts, on 29 June 900, they ""embarked"" on a sea campaign against Venice. As ""Chronicon Sagornini"" of John the Deacon writes that with their horses and ""leather ships"" to attack first the cities from the coast, then also the city of Venice itself. The ""leather ship"" here refer to an animal skin (goat, sheep, maybe cow) tied up to form something like a huge bota bag, filled with air, tied on their horses sides, which helped the warrior and his horse to float, with which the Hungarians and the warriors of other nomadic societies usually used to cross rivers. They first attacked and burned the coastal towns like Equilio, Cittanova, Fine, Capo d'Argine, then tying the filled animal skins to their horses, they crossed the waters of the Lagoon of Venice, and sacked the island town of Chioggia, which was a part of the Dogado (homeland of the Republic of Venice). Then on the day of the martyrdom of Saint Peter and Saint Paul (29 June), on their ""leather ships"", they tried to enter Rialto and Malamocco, but before they reached the islands, on the place called Albiola the doge of Venice Pietro Tribuno met them with the Venetian war fleet, forcing them to retreat. Although they lost this unusual sea battle, the Hungarians achieved something what was never done by a land army: attacking islands lying in the sea. And although the attack from 29 June was unsuccessful, they succeeded in the attack on the island of Chioggia. This attack was not a violation of the agreement with Berengar, because at that time Venice was not part of the Italian kingdom, but was an autonomous republic under Byzantine influence."
"Historians disagree about the route taken by which the army returned to the Hungarian lands. On one hand György Szabados believes that the Hungarian army turned back home from Italy without entering Pannonia, avoiding it from the south, because in his opinion they were exhausted of continuous fighting in Italy in the last year, and were loaded up with plunders, so they would not be capable to accomplish such an important mission. The same opinion had György Györffy too in 1974."
"On the other hand, Gyula Kristó and István Bóna think that the Hungarian army returning from Italy took part in the conquest of Pannonia, but in different ways. Kristó believes that the returning Hungarian army had the task only to plunder the land, weakening the capability of the inhabitants to withstand the final attack, then crossed the Danube, turning home, and after that two new Hungarian armies, coming from East accomplished the occupation. Bóna believes that the returning Hungarian army played an active role in the conquest of Pannonia, coming from the southwest, when other armies coming from east, from the Eastern part of the Carpathian Basin, crossed the Danube, attacking it from the north and east. He thinks that the Hungarian army came back from Italy because they received an order from home to come help in the conquering of Pannonia, accomplishing it with an encircling movement."

"Project Boreas was a study conducted between 2003 and 2006 by the British Interplanetary Society to design a station on the Planum Boreum at the Martian North Pole. The project was international, involving over 25 scientists and engineers, co-ordinated by Charles S. Cockell. Pole Station was designed to operate for three summers and two polar winters. Amongst a diversity of scientific objectives the station occupants were to retrieve a deep core from within the Martian polar ice cap and search for water and habitable conditions deep in the polar ice cap. Expeditions were planned to numerous locations across the Martian north polar cap, including the Chasma Boreale and the polar layered terrains. The study involved wide-ranging investigations of the scientific priorities for a human presence at the Martian polar ice caps through to detailed architectural and design studies for the station. Studies were undertaken on mobility and communications and psycho-social issues for long-term operation at the Martian polar station."
"Project Boreas was named for the Greek god of the North Wind. Concepts for polar bases had been discussed in earlier papers The station was designed with the assumption that it would be occupied by 10 people. Although the station could be constructed at any time, the study used a timeframe of 2037 to 2042 to provide a backdrop for the design. It is likely that in the coming decades robots will explore the Martian polar caps, which were first observed by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Cassini in 1666. Project Boreas considered long-term human polar exploration on Mars."
"The crew of the station were envisaged to carry out diverse scientific studies in geology, geophysics, climatology and astrobiology. One particular advantage of humans was perceived to be their ability to run a laboratory in which complex and analytical tasks can be undertaken in polar science and exploration. The design study considered that the retrieval of a core into the polar ice cap would be one of the primary objectives of Pole Station. The core would be used to study past geological and climatological changes, including dating past Martian dust storms. The core would also be used to investigate the nature of the polar layered terrains. It would be used to study whether the ice caps contained a record of organics on Mars, to search for habitats in the ice and to study questions on the past and present habitability of Martian polar ices. The occupants also had diverse climatology objectives to undertake. The study considered Martian polar astronomy to be a potentially useful additional activity for the station crew members."
During the 1173 sol-stay on the Martian surface the crew would carry out a number of expeditions across the polar ice cap. Expeditions to the Chasma Boreale and along the polar spiral valleys were considered in detail. The study also considered the possibility of exploratory mid-winter expeditions across the polar ice cap. These expeditions would be supported by pressurised and unpressurised rovers. Trafficability issues of trans-polar expeditions were considered.
"The study carried out a trade off analysis of power, thermal control and other parameters to provide a basis for the architectural design. The station would be constructed from six linked modules of 3.5 m diameter with a smaller cache module. The modules included a galley area, science and human factors laboratories, EVA preparation area and personal quarters. The station would have a ‘garden’ area to provide some fresh food and for psychological relief. The station would be supported by nuclear power and a hybrid physico-chemical and biological life support system. Provision for in-situ resource use (ISRU) from the Martian polar regions was studied, particular emphasis being placed on the availability of water from the polar ices. The station would support a separate small drilling encampment nearby and would be surrounded by radiative panels which would sublime the 2 m of carbon dioxide snow estimated to fall at Pole Station during the winter, allowing for year-round operations."
"Project Boreas considered the use of bioinspired robots to support Pole Station. ‘Arctic fox’, ‘Arctic hare’, ‘snow bunting’ (a flying robot) and ‘lemmings’ would support science and exploration objectives from Pole Station by enabling remotely controlled data collection at many spatial scales either from the rovers or from the station. The design study investigated communications for Pole Station and satellite requirements for sustaining base to field communications. The unique psycho-social issues associated with the long and permanently dark Martian polar winter were addressed. Medical requirements for long-term operation at the Martian polar ice caps were investigated in addition to the nutrition requirements, which were used to constrain the life support system design."

"Achala Sachdev (3 May 1920 – 30 April 2012) was an Indian film actress who appeared in classic films of Bollywood. She was from Peshawar who started her career as a child actor. She later became known for mother and grandmother roles in Hindi films. Her most memorable roles were as Balraj Sahni's wife in the 1965 film ""Waqt"" and Kajol's grandmother in ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (1995)."
Achala Sachdev was born on 3 May 1920 in Peshawar.
"Achala worked for All India Radio, Lahore before the partition of India, and then at Delhi All India Radio. Achala made her film debut with ""Fashionable Wife"" (1938), and acted in over 130 Hindi films. She has acted in many Yash Raj Films, starting with Yash Chopra's first production """" (1973) and films such as ""Chandni"" (1989) and ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (1995). Her other noted films were ""Prem Pujari"", ""Mera Naam Joker"", ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" and ""Andaz"", apart from acting in English films such as the Mark Robson's ""Nine Hours to Rama"" (1963) and Merchant Ivory's ""The Householder"" (1963). However, her most noted role remains as Balraj Sahani's wife in ""Waqt"" (1965), wherein the hit song ""Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen"" was picturised on her."
"Achala became a resident of Pune after marrying Clifford Douglas Peters, who had a factory in Pune's Bhosari industrial estate, named Morris Electronics, producing small electronics parts such as diodes. The factory was later sold to the Piramal Group. In an almost filmy turn, Sachdev was introduced to Peters by Yash Chopra on the sets of a film in Mumbai. Peter's first wife had died by then and Sachdev herself was a divorcee. They married. Peters, a mechanical engineer, had a factory in Bhosari and the couple lived in a bungalow in the same area for some time before shifting to Hadapsar. After Peters died, Achala lived alone. Five years before her death, she gave away her flat in Pune to the Janseva Foundation, a charitable organization, on the condition that they should take care of her as long as she lived."

"State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 (), officially named Measures on the Management of the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas (), is an order from the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the People's Republic of China's agency charged with keeping religion under state control. Order No. 5 states that a Reincarnation Application must be filed by all Buddhist temples in that country before they are allowed to recognize individuals as tulkus (reincarnated teachers)."
"Tibetan Buddhists believe lamas and other religious figures can consciously influence how they are reborn, and often are reborn many times so they can continue their religious pursuits. These tulkus are referred to in sources translated from Chinese as ""living Buddhas"". In 2007, the Chinese government passed a decree, based on the prior Religion Work for Some Questions《中共中央、国务院关于进一步做好宗教工作若干问题的通知》published in 1991, that reincarnated lamas must be approved by the Central Government."
"On August 3, 2007, China's State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a decree that all the reincarnations of tulkus of Tibetan Buddhism must get government approval, otherwise they are ""illegal or invalid"". The decree states, ""It is an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living Buddhas. The selection of reincarnates must preserve national unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups and the selection process cannot be influenced by any group or individual from outside the country."" It also requires that temples which apply for reincarnation of a living Buddha must be ""legally-registered venues for Tibetan Buddhism activities and are capable of fostering and offering proper means of support for the living Buddha."""
"Reincarnation Applications have to be submitted to four governmental bodies for approval, specifically the religious affairs department of the provincial-level government, the provincial-level government, State Administration for Religious Affairs, and the State Council."
"The regulations are composed of 14 articles, including the principle, conditions, approval procedures, the duties and responsibilities of religious groups for reincarnation as well as punishment for those violating the regulations. They allegedly guarantee normal religious activities of Tibetan Buddhism and protect the religious belief of Tibetan Buddhism followers according to law."
"The State Administration for Religious Affairs said, ""The government only administrate religious affairs related to state and the public interests and will not interfere in the pure internal religious affairs""."
"The official Xinhua News Agency said the new rules are ""an important move to institutionalise management of reincarnation of living Buddhas"". Tulkus are indeed an important element in Tibetan Buddhism, forming a clergy of influential religious figures. It is believed they are continuously reincarnated to take up their positions anew. Often there is more than one candidate competing to be recognised as the actual reincarnation, and the authority to decide who is the true claimant carries significant power."
"The decree was implemented in response to clergy's protests about the reincarnation of living Buddhas ""against religious ritual and historical convention"", according to the Chinese government. The most high-profile dispute about living Buddhas happened between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government about the selection of the 1995 Panchen Lama, whose influence in Tibetan Buddhism is second only to the Dalai Lama. Over 1,000 living Buddhas have been reincarnated through this legal channel in Tibet and other areas in China since 1991."
"The Golden Urn was established by the Qing Qianlong Emperor to allow the Qing dynasty Emperor of China to determine the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama in case of a dispute. There are two Golden Urns issued by the Qianlong Emperor. One is enshrined in Jokhang Temple in Lhasa for choosing Dalai and Panchen Lama reincarnations, the other is in Yonghe Temple in Beijing for choosing Mongolian Jebtsundamba Khutughtu reincarnations. The 7th Panchen Lama, Palden Tenpai Nyima, used the Golden Urn for the first time in 1822 to choose the 10th Dalai Lama, Tsultrim Gyatso."
"In 1936, Golden Urn was also institutionalized in the Method of Reincarnation of Lamas《喇嘛轉世辦法》 by Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Central Government."
"Most recently, in November 1995 the Golden Urn was controversially used to name Qoigyijabu (Gyancain Norbu) as the 11th Panchen Lama. This action was approved by the Chinese government, but opposed by the Government of Tibet in Exile. In May of the same year, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso had named Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama."
"The Khalkha Mongol nobles' power was deliberately undermined by Qianlong when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal family of the eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Lama instead of the Khalkha Mongol which they wanted to be appointed. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor, but Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that he was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols."
"The 10th Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen was born Gonpo Tseten on 19 February 1938 in today's Xunhua Salar Autonomous County of Qinghai, to Gonpo Tseten and Sonam Drolma. When the Ninth Panchen Lama died in 1937, two simultaneous searches for the tenth Panchen Lama produced two competing candidates, with the government in Lhasa (who had selected a boy from Xikang) and the Ninth Panchen Lama's officials (who picked Tseten) in conflict. The Republic of China government, then embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, declared its support for Tseten on 3 June 1949. Guan Jiyu, the head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, joined Kuomintang Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang in presiding over Tseten's enthronement on 11 June as Choekyi Gyaltsen at Kumbum Monastery. The Dalai Lama's government in Lhasa still refused to recognize Gyaltsen."
"The Panchen Lama supported China's claim of sovereignty over Tibet, and China's reform policies for Tibet. Radio Beijing broadcast the religious leader's call for Tibet to be ""liberated"" into Tibet, which created pressure on the Lhasa government to negotiate with the People's Republic. In 1951, the Panchen Lama was invited to Beijing as the Tibetan delegation was signing the 17-Point Agreement and telegramming the Dalai Lama to implement the Agreement. He was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama when they met in 1952."
"The 7th Dalai Lama Kelzang Gyatso was born in Lithang of Eastern Tibet, in the present-day Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of present-day Sichuan province. At that time, the Dalai Lama's throne in Lhasa was occupied by Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso, who had been installed by Lha-bzang Khan as ""the real 6th Dalai Lama"" in place of Tsangyang Gyatso. Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso still held this position (though most Tibetans did not consider him to be a legitimate Dalai Lama) when a monk at Litang monastery, spontaneously channeling the Nechung Oracle, identified Kelzang Gyatso as the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso. Since this presented a contradiction of Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama, it was a controversial matter and potentially dangerous to the child. Subsequently, the Tibetan leader of a delegation from Lhasa covertly confirmed that the child was Tsangyang Gyatso's reincarnation. The child was quietly taken into Litang monastery for protection and training. In 1715, the Kangxi Emperor sponsored Kelzang Gyatso's entrance into Kumbum Monastery. This entrance was marked by formal ceremonies due to a Dalai Lama and thus signified a public challenge to Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama. He was ordained by Ngawang Lobsang Tenpai Gyaltsen. His reign started when he was 12."

"Too-Rye-Ay is the second album by Dexys Midnight Runners, released in July 1982. The album is best known for the hit single ""Come On Eileen"", which included the lyrics ""too-rye-ay"" that inspired the album's title."
"Shortly before recording this album, Dexys' bandleader Kevin Rowland had decided to add a violin section to the band's existing horn section, which had contributed strings (viola and cello) to the band's previous single, ""Liars A to E"". However, after violinists Helen O'Hara and Steve Brennan joined the band, the three members of the horn section, including Dexys' co-leader and album co-composer ""Big"" Jim Paterson, decided to leave Dexys and become an independent horn band (ultimately known as The TKO Horns). Rowland convinced them to stay with the band long enough to record the album and to perform in a kick-off concert debuting the album on BBC Radio One in June 1982."
"All the songs on the album were rearranged to add strings, which caused Dexys to re-record the 1981 singles ""Plan B"", ""Liars A to E"", and ""Soon"". During the rearrangement process, ""Soon"" was revised into the opening section of ""Plan B""; since both songs were written by Rowland and Paterson, the merged songs are credited on the album simply as ""Plan B""."
"The album's ""Come On Eileen"" became a number one hit in both the UK and the US. Dexys Midnight Runners is best known as a one hit wonder in the US (""Come On Eileen"" was also the first US single release by Dexys), but in the UK, ""Geno"" had previously reached number one, and ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"" and ""The Celtic Soul Brothers"" were also UK hits."
"Before ""Come On Eileen"", Dexys' only North American single was the Northern Soul classic ""Seven Days Too Long"", which Dexys' previous label EMI America had released only in Canada (with ""Geno"" as the B-side). However, on the strength of ""Come On Eileen"", ""Too-Rye-Ay"" reached number 14 in the US. Dexys' success in US was not maintained; the best performer of the band's follow-up singles in the US was ""The Celtic Soul Runners"", which peaked at number 86."
"Different releases of ""Too-Rye-Ay"" featured different versions of ""Come On Eileen"". Certain editions of the album featured a version beginning with a solo fiddle playing the first line of the folk song ""Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms"" and ending with a simple fadeout (""length: 4:07""). This version of the song is the one featured on the single release. Other editions of the album (including many of the ""re-releases"") featured a version without the violin intro and including a tag of Kevin Rowland singing ""Young Charms"" at the end, while the digital version offered by Spotify includes both front and end ""Young Charms"" tags (""length: approximately 4:32""). In addition, the most common release of the album features ""Come On Eileen"" as the final track, while the original US release features the tune as the opening track on Side 2."
"The album was re-released in 1996 on CD with 8 bonus tracks. In 2000 an enhanced edition was released with the music videos for ""Come On Eileen"" and ""Jackie Wilson Said"" as bonus material. In 2002 a US edition with bonus tracks was released. Marking its 25th Anniversary, a 2007 2-CD Deluxe Edition was released, which included the entire 14-song album kickoff performance on BBC Radio 1 that had previously been released (without ""I'll Show You"") as ""BBC Radio One Live in Concert""."

"The Threat Within by Jude Watson is the eighteenth and final book in the """" series of young reader novels. It was released on March 1, 2002. The series explores the adventures of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi prior to """"."
"Obi-Wan Kenobi is almost an adult and his Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, is very proud of him. Now they have to investigate and solve an odd terrorist threat between two work-obsessed planets. Eventually, it is discovered that a new culture is rising within the planet, which has a goal of stopping the planet's excessive relationship with work."
"The mission, while somewhat routine, sees Obi-Wan acting independently during several scenes. When a major building is nearly destroyed, Obi-Wan acts calmly, which impresses his master. Despite working somewhat separately on this mission, the master and apprentice find themselves closer."
= = = Westside High School (Omaha) = = =
"Westside High School is the only high school of the Westside Community Schools district (also known as District 66 to local residents) of Omaha, Nebraska, United States."
"Westside has used a modular schedule since 1967. Each module, or ""mod"" (as known colloquially among WHS students), is either a 20 or 40-minute period used for classes or independent study time in an instructional materials center (IMC). This allows freedom in scheduling as classes can be 40, 60, or 80 minutes long, as needed for one-to-one, small group, large group, and laboratory instruction. Classes are taught in a similar format to many universities; students meet a large group lecture once per week and have small group recitations throughout the week. An average student has at least one or two full open mods per day, to be used for studying, interacting with teachers, eating lunch, or socializing. Juniors and seniors who have met specific requirements are eligible to apply for a pass that allows them to leave the building during open mods."
"In 1985, Westside Senior Bridget Mergens was denied the ability to create an after-school Christian Bible club. The principal at the time rejected the idea since he said a religious club violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. In addition, the club lacked a school sponsor that was required when forming a club. Mergens argued that the district's decision was in violation of the federal Equal Access Act requiring that groups seeking to express messages containing “religious, political, philosophical, or other content” not be denied the ability to form clubs. In 1990,Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens was heard by the Supreme Court. In an 8-1 decision, the court said that since the club did not study school curriculum, it was permitted under the Equal Access Act."

= = = International Offshore Rule = = =
The International Offshore Rule (IOR) was a measurement rule for racing sailboats. The IOR evolved from the Cruising Club of America (CCA) rule for racer/cruisers and the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) rule.
"The IOR was superseded (in the early 1990s) by the International Measurement System (IMS) and CHS (since renamed IRC). While some IOR yachts race at club level under IRC in more or less their original form, others had major surgery to make them competitive within the new rules."
"The IOR concentrated on hull shape with length, beam, freeboard and girth measurements, foretriangle, mast and boom measurements, and stability with an inclination test. Additionally, the IOR identified features which were dangerous, or it couldn't fairly rate, and penalized or prohibited them. The measurements and penalties were used to compute the handicap number, called an ""IOR rating"", in feet. The higher the rating, the faster the boat was deemed to be able to sail. A typical IOR 40 footer (a ""one tonner"") rated 30.55 feet."
"The IOR rule encouraged wide short boats with limited stability. A narrow waterline and large beam on deck, combined with a high centre of gravity, meant that crew weight provided a significant proportion of stability at small heel angles, and boats had a relatively low angle of vanishing stability. This developed into the situation about 1977 when the boats winning in most smaller IOR categories (up to the half tonners - about 10m LOA) had all internal ballast, often with an unballasted daggerboard. The managers of the rule realised that this was not a suitable direction for seaworthy yachts, and heavily penalised boats with lifting keels, but not before the 1979 Fastnet race ended in disaster. Writes John Rousmaniere:"
"Apart from the girth measurements, all measurements were basically point measurements. This meant that the hull was often locally distorted to maximise or minimise a measurement locally, with minimal effect to the surrounding hull. This gave a characteristic ""bumped"" look to many boats, particularly at the point of maximum beam and in the stern. Also, as stability was only measured at very low heel angles (less than 5 degrees), boats were designed with a very narrow waterline and low stability in measurement trim, but a hull form that gained stability with the weight of the crew and other equipment, and with increasing angles of heel. Low stability was encouraged (up to a point) because the initial assumption was that low stability indicated a well fitted out interior, and so more of a cruising boat than a stripped out racer."

"DCE/RPC, short for ""Distributed Computing Environment / Remote Procedure Calls"", is the remote procedure call system developed for the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). This system allows programmers to write distributed software as if it were all working on the same computer, without having to worry about the underlying network code."
"DCE/RPC was commissioned by the Open Software Foundation in a ""Request for Technology"" (1993 David Chappell). One of the key companies that contributed was Apollo Computer, who brought in NCA - ""Network Computing Architecture"" which became Network Computing System (NCS) and then a major part of DCE/RPC itself. The naming convention for transports that can be designed (as architectural plugins) and then made available to DCE/RPC echoes these origins, e.g. ncacn_np (SMB Named Pipes transport); ncacn_tcp (DCE/RPC over TCP/IP) and ncacn_http to name a small number."
"DCE/RPC's history is such that it's sometimes cited as an example of design by committee. It is also frequently noted for its complexity, however this complexity is often a result of features that target large distributed systems and which are often unmatched by more recent RPC implementations such as SOAP."

= = = Birlinn = = =
"The birlinn (spelt ""bìrlinn"" in Scottish Gaelic) was a wooden vessel propelled by sail and oar, used extensively in the Hebrides and West Highlands of Scotland from the Middle Ages on. Variants of the name in English and Lowland Scots include ""berlin"" and ""birling"". The Gallo-Norse term may derive from the Norse ""byrðingr"" (ship of boards). It has been suggested that a local design lineage might also be traceable to vessels similar to the Broighter-type boat (first century BC), equipped with oars and a square sail, without the need to assume a specific Viking design influence. It is uncertain, however, whether the Broighter model represents a wooden vessel or a skin-covered boat of the currach type. The majority of scholars emphasise the Viking influence on the birlinn."
"The birlinn was clinker-built and could be sailed or rowed. It had a single mast with a square sail. Smaller vessels of this type might have had as few as twelve oars, with the larger West Highland galley having as many as forty. For over four hundred years, down to the seventeenth century, the birlinn was the dominant vessel in the Hebrides."
"A 1615 report to the Scottish Privy Council made a distinction between galleys, having between 18 and 20 oars, and birlinns, with between 12 and 18 oars. There was no suggestion of structural differences. The report stated that there were three men per oar."
"The birlinn appears in Scottish heraldry as the ""lymphad"" (a corruption of ""long fhada"" (longship)."
"In terms of design and function, there was considerable similarity between the local birlinn and the ships used by Norse incomers to the Isles. In an island environment ships were essential for the warfare which was endemic in the area, and local lords used the birlinn extensively from at least the thirteenth century. The strongest of the regional naval powers were the Macdonalds of Islay."
"The Lords of the Isles of the Late Middle Ages maintained the largest fleet in the Hebrides. It is possible that vessels of the birlinn type were used in the 1156 sea battle in which Somerled, Lord of Argyll, the ancestor of the lords, firmly established himself in the Hebrides by confronting his brother-in-law, Godred Olafsson, King of the Isles."
"Though the surviving evidence has mostly to do with the birlinn in a naval context, there is independent evidence of mercantile activity for which such shipping would have been essential. There is some evidence for mercantile centres in Islay, Gigha, Kintyre and Knapdale, and in the fourteenth century there was constant trade between the Isles, Ireland and England under the patronage of local lords. Otherwise the chief uses of the birlinn would have been troop-carrying, fishing and cattle transport."
"In some ways the birlinn paralleled the more robust ocean-going craft of Norse design. Viking ships were double-ended, with a keel scarfed to stems fore and aft. A shell of thin planking (strake) was constructed on the basis of the keel, the planks being edge-joined and clenched with iron nails. Symmetrical ribs or frames were then lashed to the strakes or secured with trenails. Over most of the ribs was laid a slender crossbeam and a thwart. The mast was stepped amidships or nearly so, and oars, including a steering oar, were also used. The stem and stern post sometimes had carefully carved notches for plank ends, with knees securing the thwarts to the strakes and beams joining the heads of the frames."
"Oak was the wood favoured both in Western Scotland and in Scandinavia, being tough and resistant to decay. Other types of timber were less often used. It is likely that the Outer Isles of Western Scotland had always been short of timber, but birch, oak and pine abounded in the Inner Isles and on the mainland. The abundance of timber at Lochaber was proverbial: """"B'e sin fiodh a chur do Loch Abar"""" (""Bringing wood to Lochaber"") was said of any superfluous undertaking."
"The tools used are likely to have included adzes, axes, augers and spoon bits, auls, planes, draw knives and moulding irons, together with other tools typical of the Northern European carpenter's kit. As in traditional shipbuilding, generally, measurements were largely by eye."
"The traditional practice of sheltering boats in bank-cuttings (""nausts"") – small artificial harbours – was probably also employed with the birlinn. There is evidence in fortified sites of constructed harbours, boat-landings and sea-gates."
"The influence of Norse shipbuilding techniques, though plausible, is conjectural, since to date no substantial remnants of a birlinn have been found. Traditional boat-building techniques and terms, however, may furnish a guide as to the vessel's construction."
"Carved images of the birlinn from the sixteenth century and earlier show the typical rigging: braces, forestay and backstay, shrouds (fore and aft), halyard and a parrel (a movable loop used to secure a yard or gaff to a mast). There is a rudder with pintles on the leading edge, inserted into gudgeons. It is possible that use was made of a wooden bowline or reaching spar (called a ""beitass"" by the Norse). This was used to push the luff of the sail out into the wind."
"Traditional Highland practice was to make sails of tough, thick-threaded wool, with ropes being made of moss-fir or heather. Medieval sails, in the Highlands as elsewhere, are shown as being sewn out of many small squares, and there is possible evidence of reef points."
"A reproduction of a 16 oar Highland galley, the ""Aileach"", was built in 1991 at Moville in Donegal. It was based on representations of such vessels in West Highland sculpture. Despite the good seagoing performance of the vessel, its design has been described as misleading because of an over-reliance in the plan on cramped sculptural images. The vessel was designed with a high, almost vertical, stern and stem. It proved difficult to fit in more than one rower per oar and the thwarts were too close together. Less constricted images from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries show vessels which are longer and larger."
"The birlinn had a significant symbolic and thematic place in Gaelic literature. Examples can be found in the songs of Màiri nighean Alasdair Ruaidh (Mary MacLeod) (c.1615 – c.1705), an important poet in the Hebridean lordship of the MacLeods. In a lament she describes a ship wrecked by storm, with the wind ripping the sail in a way that defied the strength of the crew:"
"In another song a ship is described as setting forth from ""Dunvegan of the harps"": may the crew (says the poet), from the mast-heads aloft to the halyards below, keep it close to the wind that takes it across the straits:"
"St. Raymond Academy for Girls began as a small, parish-based high school with an enrollment of 95 students. Msgr. John Corrigan, the pastor at the time, appointed Sr. Regina Angela, a Sister of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of New York, as the first principal. The school occupied the third floor of the school building built in 1952 and through the years has prided itself on serving a relatively small school population. In order to better meet its educational goals, the school was recognized with a NYS Board of Regents Charter in 1965 and with an additional accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 2003, which was recently renewed."
"The Sisters of Charity were joined through the years by the Sisters of St. Dominic Blauvelt and Sparkill, the Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of the Holy Child, and lay women and men."
"The school's program of studies is primarily college-oriented, with business, computer and science electives included in upper years. In addition to preparing students for a New York State Regents Diploma with four-year programs in English, Social Studies, Mathematics, Spanish and Science, the school also offers Advanced Placement courses in English Literature and Composition, United States History and Government, and Spanish Literature and Language."

"The ""Isku"" class motor torpedo boat () was a Thornycroft type motor torpedo boat of the Finnish Navy. The vessel was constructed in 1926 by the ""Borgå varv"", in Porvoo, Finland, and she saw service in World War II. ""Isku"" differed from the original Thornycraft design through its torpedo launching method (they were released from the sides of the hull, in contrast to dropping them from the aft). However, she was not a successful design and she only participated in the Winter War and during the first months of the Continuation War. She was stricken from the navy lists in 1942, due to extensive wear damage on the hull. She was moored at Suomenlinna and was scrapped after the war."
= = = Entheogenic drugs and the archaeological record = = =
Entheogenic drugs have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous
"historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using entheogens, chemical substances used in a religious, shamanic, or spiritual context."
"A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old."
"The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well-documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia."
"The Olmec (1200 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens:"
"The Maya (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way."
"The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b, ""Mushroom Stones of Middle America,"" in Mushrooms, Russia and History by Valentina P. Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson, eds. N.T.)"
Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi:
"""My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is based on the excavations of Kidder and Shook at the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave, discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons. Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these Pre-Classic finds can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following""...(see Shook, E.M. & Kidder, A.V., 1952. Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology & History No. 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )"
The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendants of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today.
"The Aztec entheogenic complex is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods,"" a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The Xochipilli statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs."
"There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences."
"During the Paleolithic, there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the ""Flower Burial"" in Shanidar Cave, a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from Tassili, Algeria cave paintings depicting ""Psilocybe mairei"" mushrooms dated 7000 to 9000 years before present. From this region, there are several therianthropic images portraying the painter and the animals around him as one (an often cited effect of many psychedelic drugs, Ego death or unity). One image, in particular, shows a man who has formed into one common form with a mushroom."
"There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired."
"A cave painting in Spain has been interpreted as depicting ""Psilocybe hispanica""."

"The Santa Anita Golf Course, located in the city of Arcadia, California, was operated by Santa Anita Associates for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation from 1986-2016. New operators will take over beginning September 2016."
"The upon which the golf course was built has always been devoted to recreation in some form or another. The original architect was James Harrison Smith. Originally part of the ""Lucky"" Baldwin Ranch, Santa Anita's history dates back to the days when its broad oaks sheltered places where Indians camped. Across its broad acres traveled Mission Fathers from San Gabriel on their way up Little Santa Anita Canyon for lumber needed to build the Mission."
"From 1907 through 1909 horse racing was a feature on Lucky Baldwin's famed track. The clubhouse turn was right where No. 16 is now and when you're on the hill on the backside of No. 14, that's the turn where the horses turned for home."
"During World War I, Ross Field, Named after Lt. Cleo J. Ross of the U.S. Army Air Service, housed a United States Army balloon school. Ross was an observer with the 8th Balloon Company and was killed in action in France on September 26, 1918, the only U.S. Army balloonist to die in combat. The balloon school closed in the spring on 1919."
"The Irish ""long fhada"" seems, from contemporary sources, to have resembled its West Highland equivalent, though there is as yet no archaeological confirmation."
"The ""Annals of the Four Masters"" record the use of fleets in an Irish context, often with a Scottish connection. In 1413 Tuathal Ó Máille, returning from Ulster to Connacht with seven ships, encountered a severe storm (""anfadh na mara"") which drove them northwards to Scotland: only one of the ships survived. In 1433 Macdonald of the Isles arrived in Ulster with a large fleet (""co c-cobhlach mór"") to assist the O'Neills in a war with the O'Donnells."
"In Ireland oared vessels were employed extensively for warfare and piracy by the O'Malleys and the O'Flathertys, western lords whose base was in Connacht. English officials found it necessary to counter them with similar vessels. The most famous of these local rulers was Gráinne Ní Mháille, of whom Sir Richard Bingham reported in 1591 that she had twenty vessels at her command. She, like her father, was engaged in extensive seaborne trade."
"There was constant maritime traffic between Ireland and Scotland, and Highland mercenaries were commonly transported by birlinn to Ireland."
"The birlinn, when rowed, was distinguished by its speed, and could often evade pursuers as a result. No cannon were mounted even in the later period: the birlinn was too lightly built and its freeboard was too low. It was highly suitable for raiding, however, and with experienced marksmen on board, could mount a formidable defence against small craft."
Vessels of this type were at their most vulnerable when beached or when cornered by a heavier vessel carrying cannon.
"There is some evidence that by the end of the sixteenth century new influences were affecting birlinn design. A carving made at Arasaig in 1641 shows a vessel with a lowered stem and stern. An English map of north-east Ireland made no later than 1603 shows ""fleetes of the Redshanks [Highlanders] of Cantyre"" with vessels one-masted as before but with a square sail mounted on a sloping yard arm and a small cabin at the stern projecting backwards. Two Clanranald seals attached to documents dated 1572 show a birlinn with raised decks at stem and stern, a motif repeated in later heraldic devices. If such changes occurred, they would reflect influences from the south-east and ultimately from the Mediterranean. The supporting evidence has been criticised for being slight and unconvincing, but there is pictorial evidence for similar developments in the Irish galley."
= = = Botts' dots = = =
"Botts' dots (turtles in Washington and Oregon or buttons in Texas and other southern states) are round non-reflective raised pavement markers. In many parts of the US and other countries, Botts' dots are used, along with reflective raised pavement markers, to mark lanes on highways and arterial roads. They provide tactile and auditory feedback to drivers when moving across designated travel lanes, and are analogous to rumble strips."
"Botts' dots are named after Elbert Dysart Botts, a California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) engineer credited with overseeing the research that led to the development of the markers."
Botts' dots are most commonly white but may be yellow when used to substitute for the yellow lines that divide opposing directions of traffic in North America. The dots are made of various ceramic materials or plastics such as polyester.
"On some roads, lanes are marked only with a mix of Botts' dots and conventional reflective markers, eliminating the need to repaint lane divider lines. Botts' dots are rarely used in regions with substantial snowfall, because snow plows damage or dislodge them."
"Caltrans engineers may have studied the concept of raised pavement markers as early as 1936. However, the department did not commence research in earnest until 1953, when the postwar economic boom resulted in an alarming increase in the number of cars and car accidents in California. Painted lines tended to become invisible during rain."
"The initial dots were made of glass and were attached to the road by nails or tacks, as suggested by Botts. The nails were soon abandoned: his team discovered that when the dots popped loose under stress, the nails punctured tires. Contrary to a common myth, the published record does not make clear whether Botts invented the famous epoxy that solved the problem; some sources indicate that one of his protégés was responsible for the epoxy. In September 1966, the California State Legislature mandated that Botts' dots be used for lane markings for all state highways in all non-snowfall areas."
"Today, there are more than 25 million Botts' dots in use in California, though they have started falling out of favor. In 2017, Caltrans announced that it would stop using Botts' dots as the sole indicator of lane division, due to cost and worker safety, and in order to make roadways more compatible with self-driving cars. Reflective lane markings will be wider and thicker, providing some of the tactile feedback the Botts' dots provided. In California, highway lanes may be marked either solely by Botts' dots, or dots placed over painted lines. Four dots are used for broken lines on freeways, and broken lines on surface streets may use only three dots. Reflective Stimsonite pavement markers are placed at regular intervals between Botts' dots to increase the visibility of lane markings at night. In the Las Vegas area of southern Nevada, roads with multiple lanes use four pavement markers for each broken white line, a reflective Stimsonite marker followed by three Botts' dots."
"More recently, Botts' dots have been used in the snow-free areas of Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Georgia, Washington, and Texas. Some states that do experience snow, particularly Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, use Botts' dots only during the summer months for temporary lane markings in construction zones. Typically, the dots are installed when construction starts in the spring, and they are removed when work stops for the winter."
"In New Mexico, where snow is common in most locations during the winter, Botts' dots are used along with Stimsonite markers to outline gore areas at interchanges, but the state does not use either for regular lane markings on state highways. Some local jurisdictions (notably Alamogordo and Las Cruces) use Botts' dots and Stimsonite markers for regular lane markings on local streets. Botts' dots had also been employed previously in Albuquerque, but the city has since discontinued their use in favor of reflective paint for pavement markings."
"Until the late 1990s, Botts' dots were also used extensively in the snow-free areas of Arizona, however, ADOT has since ended this practice, opting for painted stripes with Stimsonite markers instead. However, they can still be found on US Route 95 south of Yuma, as well as on some local streets in Yuma and Tucson."
"Many states in snow-prone areas of the Midwest and Northeastern United States use Stimsonite reflectors placed into protective metal castings, which allow them to be plowed over without being dislodged from the road surface. These pavement markers are usually augmented with reflective paint and delineators placed on plastic or metal posts at regular intervals along the edges of the road. In California and other locations in the Southwest United States that experience occasional but significant snowfall, the Stimsonite reflectors are placed into recessed pockets in the roadway, which allows visibility during dry weather but permits a plow blade to travel across the reflector without dislodging it, with no special protective castings needed."

"Today, the population of the Usambara Mountains region has one of the highest growth rates (about 4% compared to the Tanzanian national average of 2.1%), a staggering amount of poverty, and highest densities of people in all of Tanzania. Most of the inhabitants are subsistence farmers who rely heavily on the forests around them for timber, medicinal plants, clearing for agriculture, and fuel wood."
"70% of the original forest cover of the West and East Usambaras has been lost. Its ecosystems were significantly disrupted by foreign-controlled logging companies which carried out large-scale deforestation from the 1950s onwards. A sawmill at Tanga processed East Usambara timber, and its output was increased in the 1970s with Finnish development funding. Major land and forest degradation remains a pressing issue."
"There are still many places that attract visitors looking for experiences beyond developed tourist resorts. These include the trade town of Lushoto (German colonial era Wilhelmsthal), the once popular German resort Amani Nature Reserve and farm, and the Mazumbai University Forest, which is considered the last example of a pristine tropical forest in the East Usambaras."
= = = New York Peace Society = = =
"The New York Peace Society was the first peace society to be established in the United States. It has had several different incarnations, as it has merged into other organizations or dissolved and then been re-created."
"David Low Dodge founded the society in 1815, soon after the end of the War of 1812. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as Gibraltar and Malta, describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on Christian grounds."
"In 1828, the society merged with others in New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts to form the American Peace Society."
"The society was re-formed as an independent organization in 1837. Until 1844, it sought to prevent war against Mexico by advocating negotiation. It then dissolved. An attempt was made to re-create it, but this was short-lived."
"The society was founded anew for the final time in 1906, in the context of the Philippine–American War, the rapid expansion of American influence and military usage abroad and the rise of the Anti-Imperialist League. It was organized by Oscar Straus and Charles Levermore with the support of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie."
"The society was involved in a ""National Arbitration and Peace Conference"" in 1907. During the First World War, the society helped to organize the League to Enforce Peace in opposition to American involvement."
"In 1940, the society merged into the Quaker World Alliance for International Friendship through Religion."
= = = National Awami Party (Wali) = = =
The Wali Khan faction of the National Awami Party was formed after the 1967 split in the original NAP between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan. The Wali Khan faction was later named National Awami Party (NAP) after the separation of East Pakistan.
"The NAP was banned twice during its eight-year-long existence, the first time under Yahya Khans government in 1971 and the second time in 1975 by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government. It was then resurrected under the name National Democratic Party, from which in turn was formed the Awami National Party."
"The Party represented left wing views in Pakistan and its core politics was based on the disbanding of the One Unit, restoration of adult franchise (1967–1970), land reforms, protection of tenants' rights, redistribution of wealth through nationalisation, Pakistan becoming a confederacy as well as the holding of fair elections, protection of an independent judiciary and freedom of the press. It contested the 1970 election, winning the second largest number of seats in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the largest in Baluchistan, and a handful of seats in East Pakistan's provincial assembly. It failed to win any seats in Punjab and Sindh."
"After the division of Pakistan in 1971, NAP formed coalition governments in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan on the basis of winning majority of seats in the two provinces. Arbab Sikandar Khan was appointed Governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Ghaus Bux Bizenjo Governor of Balochistan. Sardar Akhtar Mengal was elected the first Chief Minister of Balochistan and the NAP supported Mufti Mahmud of the JUI as Chief Minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The party was disbanded in 1975 amidst a government crackdown. It was resurrected in 1976 under the National Democratic Party under Sherbaz Mazari but split in 1979 following disagreements amongst the left wing of the party against the leadership."
"A brief attempt was made to resurrect the Party by Ajmal Khattak under the name National Awami Party of Pakistan in 2000, however the party was routed in the 2002 election and much of its leadership merged back with the ANP."
"On 30 November 1967 the NAP split between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan, ostensibly because Bhashani sided with China while Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, along with Khan Abdul Wali Khan, sided with the USSR in the Sino-Soviet split."
"Following the split, the leftist members of the NAP, many of whom were active in a Kissan (peasant) Committee, decided to follow the Wali Khan faction. Soon after, the leadership of the Wali Khan faction, being landlords, decided not to allow members of the NAP to also be members of the Kissan Committee. The leftists, led by Afzal Bangash, then decided to leave the NAP and establish the Mazdoor Kisan Party."
"The NAP party leadership struggling with a rivalry between Mahmud Ali Kasuri and Mahmudul Haq Usmani for the Presidency. Ultimately the leadership backed Abdul Wali Khan as a compromise candidate. The National Council of the Party met on 30 June and 1 July 1968 at Royal Hotel, Peshawar, with Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, President of East Pakistan NAP chairing the first session. Abdul Wali Khan was unanimously elected as President of the party."
Office Bearers
"The National Awami Party was a socialist political party that advocated greater provincial autonomy and the Theory of Four Nationalities. The theory advocated by senior NAP leader Bizenjo stated Pakistan was composed of four distinct ""nations"", the Pukhtun, Baloch, Sindhi and Western Punjabi."
"The party contested the 1970 elections from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Balochistan, Sindh and East Pakistan. It did not field any candidates in the Punjab, Nationally it fielded 16 candidates from K-P, three of whom got elected, securing 18.4% of the vote, in Balochistan three out of four candidates were elected but it failed to win any seats from Sindh."
"In 1971, in an attempt to avert a possible showdown between the Military and the people of East Pakistan, on March 23, 1971, Khan, along with other Pakistani politicians, jointly met Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. They offered support to Mujeeb in the formation of a government, but it was already too late to break the impasse as Yahya Khan had already decided on a full scale military crackdown. Pakistan's increasing vulnerability and widespread international outrage against the military crackdown eventually created a situation that led to war between Pakistan and India. This war proved disastrous and culminated in Pakistan's armed forces being defeated in East Pakistan and the creation of the new state of Bangladesh. Shocked by the defeat, Yahya Khan resigned from office and the military. Under General Gul Hassan Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was brought back from America and appointed President."
"During the martial law crackdown against East Pakistan, the National Awami Party under Wali Khan was one of a handful of parties that protested the military operation. In one case, Khan helped a senior East Pakistani diplomat's son escape to Afghanistan from possible internment in West Pakistan. The military government, in retaliation against the protests, banned the party and launched mass arrests of party activists."
"In 1972, as the opposition leader, Wali Khan was contacted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who wanted to lift martial law and set up a new constitution. Wali Khan's negotiations with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto led to the NAP signing of an agreement with the government in 1972, called the Tripartite Agreement. The agreement led to the lifting of martial law and removal of the ban on the National Awami Party. This led to the formation of National Awami Party coalition provincial governments in the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. Despite the initial positive start, the agreement rapidly began to unravel due to the growing animosity between Khan and Bhutto."
"In 1972, Wali Khan was elected as Parliamentary leader of the opposition, the NAP made several initiatives to broaden its support across the country. It dropped its demand to rename the then North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Pakhtunistan, declared Urdu as the provincial language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and espoused federalism with greater autonomy for the provinces. Senior party leader Ghaus Bux Bizenjo advocated that Pakistan consisted of four nationalities and their empowerment equally would prevent the breakup of Pakistan."

= = = Manchester Square = = =
"Manchester Square is an 18th-century garden square in Marylebone, London. Centred north of Oxford Street it measures internally north-to-south, and across. It is a small Georgian predominantly 1770s-designed instance in central London; construction began around 1776. The north side has a central mansion, Hertford House, flanked by approach ways; its first name was Manchester House — its use is since 1897 as the Wallace Collection (gallery/museum) of fine and decorative arts sits alongside the Madame Tussauds museum and Wigmore Hall concert rooms as single-greatest tourist attractions of Marylebone. The square forms part of west Marylebone, most of which sees minor but overarching property interests held by one owner (through lease reversions managed as the Portman Estate) among which many buildings have been recognised by statutory protection (as listed buildings)."
Among residents figured:
"This six-house long approach fronts the east side of Hertford House (or its small public front lawn with steps, benches and paths). The first five buildings of Spanish Place are those listed, in the mainstream, initial category of Grade II. They were built c.1780-90, associated with the Duke of Manchester's development of the square, on Portman land. Their materials are brown brick, recessed slate roofs above five varying-prominence storeys with 3-window wide fronts. They have semicircular arched doorways to right; panelled doors with sidelights and fanlights; one a stuccoed Doric porch. Their windows are recessed sashes, in stuccoed reveals, under flat gauged arches. Reaching out below the first floor is a stucco plat band, painted stone or stucco cornice over the next, then a stucco cornice and blocking course marking the attic storey. Original, cast iron, geometric patterned balconies adorn the first floor. Cast iron area railings with urn finials enclose the front. №3 has a blue plaque as the home of Captain Marryat and George Grossmith."
"In 1814 and 1815 the square was the chosen setting for cheaper newspapers and, above all, their inner page articles to perpetuate a fresh round of the urban myth of a pig-faced woman."
"The cover photograph for ""Please Please Me"", the first LP by The Beatles, was taken by Angus McBean in 1963. It showed the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House here, EMI's London headquarters (now demolished). A repeat photo was taken in 1969 for the cover of their then-intended ""Get Back"" album; it was not used when the project saw release as ""Let It Be"", but was eventually used on the retrospective albums ""1962–1966"" and ""1967–1970""."
"In the early 20th century, the chemical company ICI moved into a new headquarters in the north-west corner of the square, which was designed in a modern style with classical elements. Around the rest of the square stand tall brick Georgian terraced houses, many of which are inside converted to offices."
"Manchester Square Fire Station, just over a full block north-west, in retail/leisure street Chiltern Street, was decommissioned in June 2005 by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) and, expanding further south, forms a luxury hotel and restaurant."

= = = BBC National Programme = = =
"The BBC National Programme was a UK radio broadcasting service which was on the air from 9 March 1930 – when it replaced the earlier BBC radio station 5XX – until 1 September 1939, when it was subsumed into the BBC Home Service, two days before the outbreak of World War II."
"When the British Broadcasting Company (later to be nationalized as the British Broadcasting Corporation) began transmissions on 14 November 1922, the technology for both national coverage and joint programming between transmitters did not exist – transmitter powers were generally in the region of 1 kilowatt (kW)."
"From 9 July 1924, however, the company began experimenting with higher power longwave transmissions from the Marconi company's site near Chelmsford in Essex, using the call sign 5XX. The experiments proved successful and on 27 July 1925 the Chelmsford longwave transmitter was relocated to a more central site at Borough Hill near Daventry in Northamptonshire. This provided a ""national service"" of programmes originating in London, although it remained somewhat experimental and was supplementary to the BBC's locally based services, including its main London station, 2LO."
"Initially the national programme was transmitted on 187.5 kHz longwave but this was later changed, with the opening in 1934 of a new high-power longwave transmitter site at Droitwich, to 200 kHz, which was to remain the BBC's longwave frequency until 1978, when it was moved slightly to 198 kHz. Mediumwave transmitters were used to augment coverage."
"On 21 August 1927, the BBC opened a high power mediumwave transmitter at the Daventry 5GB site, to replace the existing local stations in the English Midlands. That allowed the experimental longwave transmitter 5XX to provide a service programmed from London for the majority of the population. This came to be called the BBC National Programme."
"By combining the resources of the local stations into one regional station in each area, with a basic sustaining service from London, the BBC hoped to increase programme quality whilst also centralising the management of the radio service. This was known as ""The Regional Scheme"", and eventually resulted in the gradual extension throughout the 1930s of a separate BBC Regional Programme."
"The local stations were gradually either converted to regional relays or closed entirely and replaced by high-power Regional Programme transmitters. Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX, initially these were on three separate frequencies in order to minimise interference, but by 1939, as the Regional Programme network expanded, the National Programme's three remaining mediumwave transmitters – at Brookmans Park (for London and the South East), Moorside Edge (for The North), and Westerglen (for Central Scotland) – were all using 1149 kHz."
"The National Programme's broadcasting hours were from 10.15am until Midnight Mondays to Saturdays, with Sundays commencing broadcasting at 3.00pm, however by the mid 1930s broadcasting on a Sunday was extended to commence at around 10.30am."
"BBC News on the National Programme would not air until at least 6.00pm each day. This was in agreement with the newspapers, so to ensure people would buy a morning newspaper. The national programme did not have a dedicated news department until 1934, and only then was it used to edit and broadcast news material from other wire agencies in the country and around the world. The start of the second world war in September 1939 would see the start of a proper news service on the new BBC Home Service with morning news bulletins commencing at 7.00am each day."
"Upon the outbreak of World War II, the BBC closed the Regional and National Programmes and replaced them with a single channel known as the BBC Home Service. The main transmitter network was synchronized between just two groups, using 668 and 767 kHz, each of which could be turned off during air raids to prevent its signals being used as navigational beacons (with listeners required to retune in such an event to a low-powered single-frequency network on 1474 kHz)."
"On 29 July 1945, within 12 weeks of VE Day, the BBC reactivated the Regional Programme, but retained the name ""BBC Home Service"". On the same date, the BBC Light Programme was launched, taking over the style and much of the function, as an entertainment channel, of the BBC Forces Programme (which had begun broadcasting in 1940), as well as the Droitwich 200 kHz longwave frequency which had been used by the pre-war National Programme."
"Both the National Programme and the Regional Programme provided a mixed mainstream radio service. Whilst the two services provided different programming, allowing listeners a choice, they were not streamed to appeal to different audiences, rather, they were intended to offer a choice of programming to a single audience. While using the same transmitters, the National Programme broadcast significantly more speech and classical music than its successor, the Light Programme. Similarly, the Regional Programme broadcast much more light music than its successor, the Home Service."

"The Rule in Dumpor's Case is a common law rule of property law first set forth by Sir Edward Coke in 1578 (4 Coke 1196 [1578]). In its most basic form, it states that once a landlord has consented to an assignment of a tenant's interest in a leasehold estate, he implicitly consents to all future assignments by the tenant."
"This rule is still operative in some U.S. states and some other jurisdictions which follow English common law, but the parties may contract around the rule by putting a clause in the lease agreement which allows the landlord to reserve his right to approve or disapprove an assignment."

He has been an Honorary Professor at the National Research Tomsk State University, Russia since 2015 where a Graduate Student Award and Scholarship was named after him in 2016."
"Kecskés’ book “Foreign language and mother tongue” co-authored by his wife Dr. Tünde Papp and published by Erlbaum in 2000 was the first book that described the effect of the second language on the first language based on a longitudinal research. In his book “Situation-Bound Utterances in L1 and L2” (DeGruyter, 2003) he introduced the notion of SBU. Kecskés’ book “Intercultural Pragmatics” (Oxford University Press, 2014) is considered a groundbreaking monograph that shapes research in the field. Some of his books like “Explorations in Chinese as a Second Language” (Springer 2017) and “Key Issues in Chinese as a Second Language (Routledge 2017) contributed significantly to research in Chinese as a Second Language. His new monograph titled “English as a Lingua Franca: The pragmatic perspective” will be published by Cambridge University Press in October, 2019. Kecskés is considered to be the founder of the sub-field “intercultural pragmatics” and promoter of the socio-cognitive approach with its dynamic model of meaning that combines the intention-based, pragmatic view of cooperation with the cognitive view of egocentrism to incorporate emerging features of communication. His contribution to pragmatics, linguistics, bilingualism and second language acquisition was recognized by his peers in a Festschrift volume for his 70th birthday, “Doing pragmatics interculturally” edited by Rachel Giora and Michael Haugh and published by DeGruyter in 2017."
"Kecskés is the founding editor of the journal “Intercultural Pragmatics” (DeGruyter), the “Mouton Series in Pragmatics”, the bilingual (Chinese-English) journal “CASLAR (Chinese as a Second Language Research)” and the co-founding editor of “Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict” published by John Benjamins (co-founder Pilar Garces Blitvich)."

= = = Hypoblast = = =
The hypoblast is a tissue type that forms from the inner cell mass. It lies beneath the epiblast and consists of small cuboidal cells.
"Extraembryonic endoderm (including Yolk sac) is derived from hypoblast cells. The absence of hypoblast results in multiple primitive streaks in chicken embryos. The formation of the primitive streak, through which gastrulation occurs, is induced by Koller's sickle."
"In mouse embryo, the visceral endoderm develop from the primitive endoderm of the blastocyst during the implantation stage covering the epiblast cells and elongates to become an egg cylinder. A distinct morphological domain has been identified by Martin and colleagues, at the distal tip of the mouse egg cylinder, thus this domain was called distal visceral domain (DVE). The DVE cells will move unilaterally to the future anterior until reaching the embryonic/ extra embryonic boundary and at this point, the DVE cells are also named as anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). This migration has been proved to be essential for establishing anteroposterior axis. Besides the AVE, another cell population appears to be separated at the posterior edge of the embryonic egg cylinder, referred to as posterior visceral endoderm (PVE). However, the function of this cell population was not as well studied as AVE."
"Although the hypoblast does not contribute to the embryo, it has great influences on the orientation of the embryonic axis. For example, the AVE in hypoblast plays an important role in positioning the primitive streak at the midland of the amniote embryos. In chick, people had observed that removal of the hypoblast caused multiple, ectopic primitive streaks formation. Similarly, in mice embryo, the AVE expresses secreted molecules, including two antagonists of nodal signaling, Cerberus-like (Cerl) and a TGFβ superfamily molecule, Lefty1. It was shown that Cerberus−/−;Lefty1−/− compound mutants mice developed a primitive streak ectopically in the embryo. There is also finding suggested that the hypoblast also inhibit primitive streak formation by depositing extracellular matrix components to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Besides the role of positioning the site of gastrulation, AVE also showed other function including continued protection against caudalization of the early nervous system. Also primitive endoderm derived yolk sac has major function in guaranteeing the proper organogenesis of the fetus and efficient exchange of nutrients, gases and wastes."
"In mammals, the existence of primitive endoderm had been observed as early as the end of the 19th century as first recognized by Duval and Sobotta. However, it took long time before people realized that the primitive endoderm will be replaced by definitive endoderm which will further develop into the gut tube. The first convincing experiment was conducted by Bellairs in chick embryo with the careful observation under electron and light microscopy. In his experiment, Bellairs demonstrated that there is a transitory endoderm cell layer in the chick embryo at its ventral surface before the formation of primitive streak. This layer of cell was replaced by definitive endoderm migration from the primitive streak through ingression and de-epithelialization. Later on, more insights on primitive endoderm and definitive endoderm origin and formation have been provided in different species including rat and mouse, rhesus monkey, baboon et al."
"There is a viewing point on the ""Rotestein"" with information boards about the reservoir and the surrounding area. ""Rotestein"" means ""red rock"", the name being derived from the colour of the diabase material of which it is composed. Before the reservoir was created, these rocks dominated the old route between Hasselfelde and Rübeland where it crossed the Rappbode on a stone bridge that is now drowned by the reservoir. The ""Rotestein"" is checkpoint 54 in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network. It may be reached on foot from the car park on the B 81, around 800 metres SE."

= = = Armand Mattelart = = =
"Armand Mattelart (born January 8, 1936) is a Belgian sociologist and well known as a Leftist French scholar. His work deals with media, culture and communication, specially in their historical and international dimensions."
"After finishing his undergraduate studies Mattelart joined a community of secular monks in Brittany for one year, but went on to study Law and Political Science at the Catholic University of Louvain. Afterwards he studied demography at the Institute of Demographic Studies in Paris (founded by the influential left intellectual Alfred Sauvy, who in 1952 coined the term Third World). Upon finishing his studies he was appointed as an expert on the politics of population by the Vatican, and in 1962 was sent to the Universidad Católica de Chile. While in Chile he married Michèle Mattelart."
"While in Chile Mattelart was appointed to confront from a catholic spiritual perspective the strategic models for family planning which were at the time being pushed by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Alianza para el Progreso (Alliance for Progress—a US official aid program). The US family planning model aimed to limit the natality to ""improve the lives of the inhabitants of the continent"" and of course in conflict with the Catholic teachings. The revolutionary transformations in Latin America post-1960 require that the Church enter the ideological fray and develop communication strategies applied to ""ideological, political and social struggles"" to create ideological and political alternatives to atheist communism or the ""protestant North American imperialism""."
"While always based at the Catholic Univ. of Chile, Mattelart underwent a transformation in his thoughts and beliefs. He initiated a collaboration with the Centro de Estudios de la Realidad Nacional (CEREN) (Center for the Study of the National Reality), founded in 1968 under the auspices of the Catholic Univ. Jacques Chonchol was CEREN's director (also an important ideolog with MAPU—a left offshoot of the Christian Democrats which was also part of the Unidad Popular government). CEREN's first research conducted by Armando Mattelart, Michèle Mattelart, Mabel Paccini, et al., had to do with a structural left analysis of the liberal press, the ""celebrity"" publications, the pseudo-amorous magazines. Mattelart primarily studied El Mercurio, the principal liberal newspaper. This was the starting-point of his lifelong involvement with the history of communications."
"The Cuadernos de la Realidad Nacional (Notebooks of the National Reality), CEREN's publication, became the principal ideological generators and emitters during the social democratic government of Salvador Allende (1970–1973). The journal was similar to the French post-structuralist model, and it was primarily aimed to analyze the political economy of the mass media. Under this rubric, Mattelart and Ariel Dorfman published in 1971 the famous pamphlet: ""Para leer al Pato Donald, manual de descolonización antinorteamericana"" (""How to read ""Donald Duck"", a manual for American de-colonization""), where they provided a Marxist structural analysis of global forms of American consumer capitalism. The pamphlet denounces ""Yankee media penetration"" through an assessment of Disney as global ideological conveyor of American liberal - and increasingly neoliberal - values. The book analyzed the celebrated family of ducks and presented them as nasty agents of the North American cultural imperialism. This book enjoyed great publicity and it became one of the best-selling books in Latin America during the 1970s, largely because of American-centered interventions in Latin America and repeated efforts by American political, economic, and paramilitary assets to undermine the democratically elected government in Chile."
"After the Chilean coup of 1973, Mattelart returned to France where (at age 37) he had to restart his academic career—he became a visiting scholar at the University of Paris VIII Saint-Denis. He later became a full professor of Science of Information and Communication—a topic on which he later became a theoretician. In 1974, he worked on ""La Espiral"", a film justifying the Chilean route to socialism. Between 1983 and 1997 he has been Professor of Information and Communication Sciences at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany, and in the postgraduate program at Paris III (Nouvelle Sorbonne) -Rennes 2. Between 1997-2004, he has been Professor at the Université of Paris VIII. Since September 2004, he is Professor Emeritus."

"Writing for ""The Guardian"", historian Andrew Hussey described it as an ""elegant, entertaining and occasionally brilliant overview of France past and present"", noting that despite Robb's academic background in French literature, it is written in the style of an accomplished novelist, and lamented that the ""discovery"" of this element of French history was identified by an English writer, and was yet to be ""discovered"" by the French themselves. In the ""Boston Globe"", Richard Eder suggested that the time spent on the bicycle provided Robb with a fresh approach to telling the history of France, but the four years he spent in the library meant there was a ""conscientious pursuit"" of detail within the book, covering such a wide variety of topics such as road building, touring, postcards, seaside development, spas, cave exploration, marsh reclamation, and the mountaineering vogue, which weighed the book down and detracted from the core themes."
"On April 28, 2008, the book was awarded the £10,000 Ondaatje Prize by the Royal Society of Literature in London. It also won the 2007 Duff Cooper Prize, earning Robb £5,000."
"It has been translated into French under the title of Une Histoire buissonnière de la France, published by ""Libres Champs"" and into Dutch under the title De ontdekking van Frankrijk by ""Atlas"" and ""Olympos""."

"Counter-terrorism in Singapore is a series of detection and prevention measures to minimize the damage caused by terrorism. These measures involve the participation of all levels of society, including defence, internal security, border and infrastructure security, civil defense, and gives special focus on areas such as medical readiness and psychological preparedness."
Singapore's main counter-terrorism strategy includes cooperation with regional and international partners to achieve a transnational landscape of security. Singapore is instrumental in the passage of international initiatives such as the landmark United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 which established the legal basis for international action against terrorism. It is also at the forefront of the Southeast Asian counter-terrorism efforts and a United States partner in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) that aims to combat the illicit trade and spread of weapons of mass destruction.
"In recent years, Singapore's counter-terrorism initiatives have created political criticism from the country's Muslim population. This was particularly pronounced when Singapore joined the international community's call for Iraq's disarmament, which eventually led to the American invasion of the country."
These are the events related to terrorism and counter-terrorism in Singapore. Also listed are major terrorist incidents in the world and in Southeast Asia that have influenced counter-terrorism policies in Singapore.
"The main terrorist threat to Singapore is from Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which has links to al-Qaeda and Abu Sayyaf. Jemaah Islamiah is known to have carried out the Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, as well as the Jakarta bombing in 2004 outside the Australian embassy, killing 11 people."
"After the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, an informant revealed information to the Singapore Internal Security Department regarding Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan, a Singaporean of Pakistani descent, who was a member of a group partnered with Al-Qaeda. Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan was placed under surveillance by Singapore Internal Security Department, after which he left for Pakistan on 4 October. This man was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan. His interrogation led investigators to more Jemaah Islamiah members in Singapore."
"On 9 December 2001, 13 suspects were arrested. Soon after that, a video found in an abandoned house in Kabul, Afghanistan showed a narrator in Singapore describing how to attack Americans using explosives. Investigators found similar tapes at the residences of the arrested men. In all, 33 men were arrested in relation to this plot."
"In August 2002, another 21 members of Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested, demolishing JI's Singaporean cell. Arrests were also made in Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. As of 11 November 2005, 36 alleged members of JI or the Moro Islamic Liberation Front were being detained under the Internal Security Act."
"However, Singapore believes that Jemaah Islamiyah remains active in Southeast Asia and is recruiting new members."
"On 25 August 2005, French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière singled out Singapore along with Tokyo and Sydney as potential terrorism targets of the Al-Qaeda. The Ministry of Home Affairs later responded that it had not received any specific information on imminent terrorist threat against Singapore, but added that security measures have been taken to strengthen security at borders, key infrastructure and iconic buildings."
The Singapore Police Force has in recent years enhanced security at various locations in the country.
"On 15 August 2005, the newly established Public Transport Security Command began operational patrols on the Mass Rapid Transit network to protect the public transportation system. Personnel from the Special Operations Command (SOC) and the Gurkha Contingent (GC) have also been deployed to complement other police officers on patrol. In addition, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) stepped up its effort to inspect ferries and other vessels in Singapore territorial waters."
"On 26 October 2005, Deputy Prime Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for Security and Defence S Jayakumar announced that Singapore was developing an early warning system, called the Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning, to identify and assess new emerging threats to national security. The system, developed by the National Security Coordination Secretariat, will be put in place by mid-2007."
"At the forefront in the fight against terrorism are specialised military, law enforcement, and civil defence units, namely:"
"In May 2007, the parliament passed an amendment to the SAF Act, giving additional powers to the Singapore Armed Forces. A select group of about 2,000 SAF personnel will be trained to perform security operations in designated areas. These personnel, identified by a Military Security identification card, will be able to search, detain and use reasonable force against terror suspects."
"On 8 January 2006, a large scale emergency preparedness exercise was conducted. Codenamed Exercise Northstar V, it involved 22 agencies and 2,000 emergency personnel. An additional 3,400 commuters also participated in the exercise. The exercise involved a simulated terrorist bomb attack on four MRT stations (Raffles Place, Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh and Marina Bay) and one bus interchange (Toa Payoh). There were 500 mock casualties suffering from ""injuries"" caused by the ""explosions"" as well as chemical agents. The exercise is the largest civil emergency exercise ever staged in the country."
"The exercise started at 6:25 am local time on 8 January 2006, a Sunday, and lasted about three hours. To avoid public panic, announcements were made at the affected train stations as well as on television and radio, just before the exercise began. Prominent signages were also displayed."
"Mock explosive devices, such as thunderflashes were detonated near-simultaneously in subway trains and station platforms at four MRT stations (Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay) and in a double decker bus at Toa Payoh Bus Interchange. A chemical agent attack was then simulated at Dhoby Ghaut at 6:45 am. An undetonated mock bomb was also placed at the Raffles Place. About 3,400 commuters who were on board the subway trains were evacuated during the drill. Services at 13 MRT stations were temporarily disrupted and roads within the vicinity were also closed to traffic. Shuttle buses were used to ferry commuters affected by the exercise."
"Thunderflashes, smoke generators, and fire simulators were used to simulate the explosion and 500 simulated casualties were deployed to test emergency rescuers at the scene. These mock casualties carried tags to provide paramedics information on the extent of their injuries and this includes injuries related to bomb blasts, such as open wounds and burns. There were also some with injuries related to chemical agents. Dummy mannequins were also used to simulate casualties. 7 hospitals and 2 polyclinics were also involved in the drill as they received the mock casualties. In two hospitals, Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, healthcare workers donned decontamination suits as they prepared to treat victims of chemical agents suspected to be sarin gas."
"Officers from the London Metropolitan Police and the British Transport Police, including Chief Constable Ian Johnston, were present to observe the exercise and to provide feedback to the authorities."
"Following the crackdown on the local Jemaah Islamiyah cell, then-Deputy-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong held dialogues with the leaders of the Muslim community. Details of the investigation were shared to explain that the arrests were not targeted at the Singapore Muslim community, or Islam. In schools and workplaces, inter-racial confidence circles were formed to promote inter-racial and inter-religious understanding between the different racial and religious communities, while Islamic scholars and counselors in Singapore participated in the rehabilitation of the detained JI members."
= = = Apple Island (Massachusetts) = = =
"Apple Island was an island in Boston Harbor in Massachusetts, one of five islands that were integrated with landfill over the years to form East Boston and Logan International Airport. Noddle's Island, Hog Island, Bird's Island and Governor's Island were the others."
"Distinguished in its early years by waving elms but hard to access because of its expansive flats at low tide, the 10-acre Apple Island was initially part of the town of Boston, used for sheep and cattle grazing. It fell into the private hands of Thomas Hutchinson, father of Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson, in 1723. Hutchinson the elder willed the island to an English mariner in 1802 , and a gentleman named Mr. Marsh purchased it for $550 in 1822. Marsh died in 1833 and was buried on the island's western slope, and his home burned down two years later."
"Abandoned for years, Apple Island was reacquired by the City of Boston in 1867 and sold to private citizens. Inhabitants were known to haul wrecked steamships onto the island and burn them for their copper and iron parts. These ships included the James Adger, the Baltic (the last steamship in the Collins line), and the Ontario, built in Newburyport for the Transatlantic trade."
"In the 1940s, Apple Island was subsumed into land reclamation for the extension of Boston Airport, which added of landfill in Boston Harbor, taken from Apple, Governor's and Noddle's Islands. In 1943 the state renamed the airport as General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport after a Spanish–American War officer from South Boston."

= = = Sturge–Weber syndrome = = =
"Sturge–Weber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurological and skin disorder. It is one of the phakomatoses and is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). Sturge–Weber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected. This type is the most common. Type 2 involvement includes a facial angioma (port wine stain) with a possibility of glaucoma developing. There is no evidence of brain involvement. Symptoms can show at any time beyond the initial diagnosis of the facial angioma. The symptoms can include glaucoma, cerebral blood flow abnormalities and headaches. More research is needed on this type of Sturge–Weber syndrome. Type 3 has leptomeningeal angioma involvement exclusively. The facial angioma is absent and glaucoma rarely occurs. This type is only diagnosed via brain scan."
"Sturge–Weber is an embryonal developmental anomaly resulting from errors in mesodermal and ectodermal development. Unlike other neurocutaneous disorders (phakomatoses), Sturge–Weber occurs sporadically (i.e., does not have a hereditary cause). It is caused by a mosaic, somatic activating mutation occurring in the GNAQ gene. Radiological findings will show tram track calcifications on CT, bilaterally."
"Sturge–Weber syndrome is usually manifested at birth by a port-wine stain on the forehead and upper eyelid of one side of the face, or the whole face. The birthmark can vary in color from light pink to deep purple and is caused by an overabundance of capillaries around the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, just under the surface of the face. There is also malformation of blood vessels in the pia mater overlying the brain on the same side of the head as the birthmark. This causes calcification of tissue and loss of nerve cells in the cerebral cortex."
"Neurological symptoms include seizures that begin in infancy and may worsen with age. Convulsions usually happen on the side of the body opposite the birthmark, which vary in severity. There may also be muscle weakness on the side of the body opposite the birthmark."
"Some children will have developmental delays and cognitive delays; about 50% will have glaucoma (optic neuropathy often associated with increased intraocular pressure), which can be present at birth or develop later. Glaucoma can be expressed as leukocoria, which should include also further evaluation for retinoblastoma. Increased pressure within the eye can cause the eyeball to enlarge and bulge out of its socket (buphthalmos)."
Sturge–Weber syndrome rarely affects other body organs.
"The blood vessel formations associated with SWS start in the fetal stage. Around the sixth week of development, a network of nerves develops around the area that will become a baby's head. Normally, this network goes away in the ninth week of development. In babies with SWS due to mutation of gene GNAQ, this network of nerves doesn't go away. This reduces the amount of oxygen and blood flowing to the brain, which can affect brain tissue development."
"CT and MRI are most often used to identify intracranial abnormalities. When a child is born with a facial cutaneous vascular malformation covering a portion of the upper or the lower eyelids, imaging should be performed to screen for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis. The haemangioma present on the surface of the brain is in the vast majority of cases on the same side as the birth mark and gradually results in calcification of the underlying brain and atrophy of the affected region."
"Treatment for Sturge–Weber syndrome is symptomatic. Laser treatment may be used to lighten or remove the birthmark. Anticonvulsant medications may be used to control seizures. Doctors recommend early monitoring for glaucoma, and surgery may be performed on more serious cases. When one side of the brain is affected and anticonvulsants prove ineffective, the standard treatment is neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the affected part of the brain (hemispherectomy). Physical therapy should be considered for infants and children with muscle weakness. Educational therapy is often prescribed for those with intellectual disability or developmental delays, but there is no complete treatment for the delays."
"Brain surgery involving removing the portion of the brain that is affected by the disorder can be successful in controlling the seizures so that the patient has only a few seizures that are much less intense than pre-surgery. Surgeons may also opt to ""switch-off"" the affected side of the brain."
"Latanoprost (Xalatan), a prostaglandin, may significantly reduce IOP (intraocular pressure) in patients with glaucoma associated with Sturge–Weber syndrome. Latanoprost is commercially formulated as an aqueous solution in a concentration of 0.005% preserved with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). The recommended dosage of latanoprost is one drop daily in the evening, which permits better diurnal IOP control than does morning instillation. Its effect is independent of ethnicity, gender or age, and it has few to no side effects. Contraindications include a history of CME, epiretinal membrane formation, vitreous loss during cataract surgery, history of macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, history of anterior uveitis, and diabetes mellitus. It is also wise to advise patients that unilateral treatment can result in heterochromia or hypertrichosis that may become cosmetically objectionable."
"Although it is possible for the birthmark and atrophy in the cerebral cortex to be present without symptoms, most infants will develop convulsive seizures during their first year of life. There is a greater likelihood of intellectual impairment when seizures are resistant to treatment. Studies do not support the widely held belief that seizure frequency early in life in patients who have SWS is a prognostic indicator."
"It occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns."
It is named for William Allen Sturge and Frederick Parkes Weber.
"The Sturge-Weber Foundation's (The SWF) international mission is to improve the quality of life and care for people with Sturge–Weber syndrome and associated port wine birthmark conditions. It supports affected individuals and their families with education, advocacy, and research to promote effective management and awareness. The SWF was founded by Kirk and Karen Ball, who began searching for answers after their daughter was diagnosed with Sturge–Weber syndrome at birth. The SWF was incorporated in the US in 1987 as an International 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. In 1992, the mission was expanded to include individuals with capillary vascular birthmarks, Klippel Trenaunay (KT) and Port Wine Birthmarks."
The Hemispherectomy Foundation was formed in 2008 to assist families with children who have Sturge–Weber syndrome and other conditions that require hemispherectomy. The Brain Recovery Project was formed in 2011 to fund research and establish rehabilitation protocols to help children who have had hemispherectomy surgery reach their full potential.
"Sturge Weber UK (SWUK), formerly Sturge-Weber Foundation UK, is a volunteer run registered charity formed in 1990. The charity exists to support those affected by Sturge Weber syndrome, promote research into the condition and raise awareness of the condition amongst both public and professionals.

= = = Brothers in Unity = = =
Brothers in Unity is a four-year secret society at Yale University. It used to be a debating society.
"The Society of Brothers in Unity at Yale College was founded by 21 members of the Yale classes of 1768, 1769, 1770 and 1771. The founders included David Humphreys, who is noted in the society's public 1841 catalogue as the ""cornerstone"" of the founding class. The society was founded chiefly to combat existing class separation among literary societies; prior to 1768, Yale freshmen were not ""received into any Society"", and junior society members were forced into the servitude of seniors ""under dread of the severest penalties"". Humphreys, a freshman of the class of 1771, persuaded two members of the senior class, three junior class members, two sophomores, and 14 freshmen to support the society's founding."
"Immediately after its conception, the society's unorthodox class composition was allegedly challenged by other literary groups at Yale College. According to its catalogue, Brothers in Unity only became an independent institution after persevering ""an incessant war"" waged by multiple traditional societies who did not support the concept of a four-year debating community. It is speculated that this struggle initiated the Brothers' near 250-year rivalry with Linonia, which previously did not initiate freshman members. Within a year, however, Brothers in Unity became fully independent, its popularity influencing other societies to reconsider their exclusion of first year students. The Yale College freshman class of 1771 yielded 15 members of Brothers in Unity, while Linonia accepted four; the first noted point in which underclassmen were publicly accepted into a Yale society. The Brothers adopted the motto between 1768 and 1769."
"Between its founding and 1841, the society is said to have followed the template of other debating societies, although operating under ""Masonic secrecy,"" according to 19th century Yale historian Ebenezer Baldwin. In conjunction with Linonia and the Calliopean Society, Brothers in Unity was noted by Baldwin to discuss ""scientific questions"" and gravitate towards ""literary pursuits."" This is substantiated by the Brother's own public documentation, which denotes that the society sought ""lofty places in science, literature, and oratory"" fields, as well as general ""intellectual improvement."""
"The Brotherhood, between the years of 1768 and 1841, claims membership of 15 Supreme Court Justices (seven of which Chief Justices), 6 United States Governors, 13 Senators, 45 Congressional representatives, 14 presidents of colleges and universities, two United States Attorney Generals, and a United States Vice President. In its catalogue, the Brotherhood also asserts: ""Every President of the United States, with the exception of two, has had in his cabinet one of our members, and the governor's chair of our own state has been filled for twenty years with Brothers in Unity."" 26 Yale valedictorians after the position's 1798 founding are attributed to the Society."
"Membership to the Brothers and the Linonian Society divided the students of Yale College beginning in the turn of the 19th century. Both held expansive literary collections, which they used to compete against each other. Between 1780 and 1841, the Brothers claimed right to more volumes than Linonia, although these assertions are disputed The two societies' rivalry extended to their membership. Brothers in Unity claims membership of John C. Calhoun, who was alphabetically assigned to Linonia, but had ""undiminished attachment"" to the Brothers. However, while publications released by both societies repeatedly assert superiority amongst each other, they also express positive sentiment; denoting each other as ""ornaments"" of Yale and ""generous rivals."""
"At the time of the formation of Yale's central library, Linonia and 'Brothers in Unity donated their respective libraries to the university. The donation is commemorated in the ""Linonia and Brothers Reading Room"" of Yale's Sterling Memorial Library. The reading room contains the Linonia and Brothers (L&B) collection, a travel collection, a collection devoted to medieval history, and a selection of new books recently added to Sterling’s collections."
"Following the transformation of Yale's debating societies into the Yale Union, and later, the Yale Political Union, Brothers in Unity and the Linonian Society ceased function as literary and debating societies. Both societies continued their existence in secrecy, recanting their roles as intellectual colloquiums and instead prioritizing power and social influence as paramount. Linonia morphed into the template of other Yale secret societies, although its current existence is still questioned and its membership is not disclosed to the public as of 2012. While unsubstantiated, Linonia is said to participate in Yale's April ""tap night,"" along with the college's senior societies."
"Unlike Linonia, Brothers in Unity refrained from association with the customs of Yale's senior societies. The society is rumored to tap a small cohort of members from each class during the fall semester, a notion in line with the organization's 1768 constitution and 1841 catalogue. Internally, the society is referenced as the ""Brotherhood,"" a community stressing unilateral action amongst members to acquire power in the realms of business, politics, and philanthropy. The society is said to have implemented methods of deterrence stemming from its 1768 constitution that prevent brothers from unearthing the identities of fellow members or disclosing internal actions of the brotherhood. However, public knowledge of specific traditions, discussions, and society regulations of Brothers in Unity ended after its 19th-century turn to secrecy, rendering most modern rumor as conjecture. It is rumored that the society maintains ""taplines"" into several of Yale's most prestigious senior societies, including Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Book and Snake, Myth and Sword, Elihu, and Mace and Chain."
"Though the society no longer discloses the names of its members, its presence on campus continued through the 19th and 20th centuries, with reported activity spanning into the turn of the 21st century. It is unknown whether men exclusively fill current membership of the Brothers, due to the integration of women into Yale's societal web."

"In the process of burial, it is possible that siliciclastic deposits may subsequently be uplifted as a result of a mountain building event or erosion. When uplift occurs, it exposes buried deposits to a radically new environment. Because the process brings material to or closer to the surface, sediments that undergo uplift are subjected to lower temperatures and pressures as well as slightly acidic rain water. Under these conditions, framework grains and cement are again subjected to dissolution and in turn increasing porosity. On the other hand, telogenesis can also change framework grains to clays, thus reducing porosity. These changes are dependent on the specific conditions that the rock is exposed as well as the composition of the rock and pore waters. Specific pore waters, can cause the further precipitation of carbonate or silica cements. This process can also encourage the process of oxidation on a variety of iron bearing minerals."
"Sedimentary breccias are a type of clastic sedimentary rock which are composed of angular to subangular, randomly oriented clasts of other sedimentary rocks. They may form either"
"In the field, it may at times be difficult to distinguish between a debris flow sedimentary breccia and a colluvial breccia, especially if one is working entirely from drilling information. Sedimentary breccias are an integral host rock for many sedimentary exhalative deposits."
"Clastic igneous rocks include pyroclastic volcanic rocks such as tuff, agglomerate and intrusive breccias, as well as some marginal eutaxitic and taxitic intrusive morphologies. Igneous clastic rocks are broken by flow, injection or explosive disruption of solid or semi-solid igneous rocks or lavas."
Igneous clastic rocks can be divided into two classes:
"Clastic metamorphic rocks include breccias formed in faults, as well as some protomylonite and pseudotachylite. Occasionally, metamorphic rocks can be brecciated via hydrothermal fluids, forming a hydrofracture breccia."
"Hydrothermal clastic rocks are generally restricted to those formed by hydrofracture, the process by which hydrothermal circulation cracks and brecciates the wall rocks and fills it in with veins. This is particularly prominent in epithermal ore deposits and is associated with alteration zones around many intrusive rocks, especially granites. Many skarn and greisen deposits are associated with hydrothermal breccias."
"A fairly rare form of clastic rock may form during meteorite impact. This is composed primarily of ejecta; clasts of country rock, melted rock fragments, tektites (glass ejected from the impact crater) and exotic fragments, including fragments derived from the impactor itself."
"Identifying a clastic rock as an impact breccia requires recognising shatter cones, tektites, spherulites, and the morphology of an impact crater, as well as potentially recognizing particular chemical and trace element signatures, especially osmiridium."
= = = Asabiyyah = = =
"ʿAsabiyya or asabiyyah (Arabic: عصبيّة) is a concept of social solidarity with an emphasis on unity, group consciousness and sense of shared purpose, and social cohesion, originally in a context of ""tribalism"" and ""clanism"". It was familiar in the pre-Islamic era, but became popularized in Ibn Khaldun's ""Muqaddimah"" where it is described as the fundamental bond of human society and the basic motive force of history, pure only in its nomadic form. ʿAsabiyya is neither necessarily nomadic nor based on blood relations; rather, it resembles philosophy of classical republicanism. In the modern period, it is generally analogous to solidarity. However, it is often negatively associated because it can sometimes suggest loyalty to one's group regardless of circumstances, or partisanship. Ibn Khaldun also argued that ʿasabiyya is cyclical and directly related to the rise and fall of civilizations: it is most strong at the start of a civilization, declines as the civilization advances, and then another more compelling ʿasabiyyah eventually takes its place to help establish a different civilization."
"Ibn Khaldun describes ""Asabiyyah"" as the bond of cohesion among humans in a group forming community. The bond, Asabiyyah, exists at any level of civilization, from nomadic society to states and empires. Asabiyyah is most strong in the nomadic phase, and decreases as civilization advances. As this Asabiyyah declines, another more compelling Asabiyyah may take its place; thus, civilizations rise and fall, and history describes these cycles of Asabiyyah as they play out."
"Ibn Khaldun argues that each dynasty (or civilization) has within itself the seeds of its own downfall. He explains that ruling houses tend to emerge on the peripheries of great empires and use the much stronger ʿasabiyya present in those areas to their advantage, in order to bring about a change in leadership. This implies that the new rulers are at first considered ""barbarians"" by comparison to the old ones. As they establish themselves at the center of their empire, they become increasingly lax, less coordinated, disciplined and watchful, and more concerned with maintaining their new power and lifestyle. The ʿasabiyya, dissolves into factionalism and individualism, diminishing their capacity as a political unit. Thus, conditions are created wherein a new dynasty can emerge at the periphery of their control, grow strong, and effect a change in leadership, beginning the cycle anew. Ibn Khaldun also further states in the ""Muqaddimah"" that ""dynasties have a natural life span like individuals"", and that no dynasty generally lasts beyond three generations of about 40 years each."
"= = = Eleanor of Castile, Queen of Navarre = = ="
Eleanor of Castile (after 1363 – 27 February 1416) was an infanta of Castile and the Queen consort of Navarre.
"She was the daughter of King Henry II of Castile and his wife, Juana Manuel of Castile, from a cadet branch of the Castilian royal house. Eleanor was a member of the House of Trastámara."
"Eleanor was subject to marriage plans with Ferdinand I of Portugal in 1371 however, the King refused the match as he had secretly married noblewoman Leonor Telles de Menezes."
"A betrothal took place in 1373 in Burgos with Prince Charles, heir to his father Charles II of Navarre. The couple were married at Soria in May 1375. A testament dated at Burgos on 29 May 1374, shows that King Henry II bequeathed property to his daughter Eleanor as a part of her dowry."
"However, the newly married royal couple went through certain marital disputes. In 1388, Eleanor asked at a meeting between her husband and her brother John I of Castile, for permission to retire for some time to her homeland of Castile, in order to recover from an illness in the local climate, which she had believed to be best for her health. She took her young daughters, whom she bore her husband during the first thirteen years of their marriage. Eleanor and her children resided in Valladolid and by 1390 she bore two more daughters to Charles. Two years later, she was demanded by her husband to return because they needed to be crowned King and Queen of Navarre as her father-in-law King Charles had died. Eleanor's brother King John supported the request of Charles III. Eleanor did not contend, claiming she was ill-treated in Navarre and believed members of the Navarrese nobility wished to poison her. As a result, Eleanor remained in Castile whilst her husband was crowned in February 1390 in Pamplona. By the end of the 1390s, Eleanor had given her husband six daughters, all surviving infancy but no sons and so for this reason, Eleanor handed her oldest daughter Joanna over to Charles III as she was heiress to the Kingdom."
"0n 9 October 1390, Eleanor's brother John died and was succeeded by his minor son Henry. Charles then again requested Eleanor's return to Navarre however, she refused. Eleanor opposed her nephew's accession and she formed the League of Lillo along with her illegitimate half-brother Fadrique and her cousin Pedro. King Henry opposed the League, he besieged Eleanor in her castle at Roa around mid-1394 and obliged her to return to her husband in February 1395."
"Eleanor then returned to Charles and was very involved in the political life of Navarre. Her relationship with her husband improved and she bore him the long-awaited sons Charles and Louis however, they died young. On 3 June 1403 her coronation as Queen of Navarre took place in Pamplona. Upon several occasions when Charles stayed in France, Eleanor took to the role of regent. She also helped to maintain good relations between Navarre and Castile. As a result of the good relations, members of the Castillian nobility including the Duke of Benavente and members of the powerful families of Dávalos, Mendoza and Zuñiga settled in Navarre."
"Upon the couple's absences, their daughter Joanna acted as regent as she was heiress. Joanna died in 1413 without issue and in the lifetime of both her parents therefore the succession turned to their second daughter Blanche who would eventually succeed as Queen of Navarre upon Charles' death."
There is confusion surrounding Eleanor's death. She is believed to have died at Olite on 27 February 1415 or at Pamplona 5 March 1416. Her husband died in 1425 and they were buried together at Pamplona in the Cathedral of Santa María la Real.
"Eleanor and Charles had eight children, five of their daughters lived to adulthood:"

"Round trips are characteristic of the New Economy companies. They played a crucial part in temporarily inflating the market capitalization of energy traders such as Enron, CMS Energy, Reliant Energy, and Dynegy."
"In international scenarios, round tripping is used for tax evasion and money laundering."
"Other companies making unconventional round-tripping deals include AOL with Sun Microsystems and Global Crossing with Qwest Communications. It is alleged that when some telecommunications companies swapped capacity, they booked the value of the incoming capacity as revenue and the value of the outgoing capacity as an investment. These transactions had the effect of inflating profits. The SEC ruled that booking revenues from swaps in telecommunications capacity was improper."
"Many such companies have used round-tripping to distort the market by establishing false revenue benchmarks, aiming to meet or beat the numbers put out by Wall Street stock analysts. As a result of abusive round trips, barter between publicly held companies has become discredited among professional investors."
= = = Militia (United States) = = =
"The militia of the United States, (Not be confused with Militia of one of the several states) as defined by the U.S. Congress, has changed over time."
"During colonial America, all able-bodied men of certain ages were members of the militia, depending on the respective states rule. Individual towns formed local independent militias for their own defense. The year before the US Constitution was ratified, ""The Federalist Papers"" detailed the founders' paramount vision of the militia in 1787. The new Constitution empowered Congress to ""organize, arm, and discipline"" this national military force, leaving significant control in the hands of each state government."
"Today, as defined by the Militia Act of 1903, the term ""militia"" is used to describe two classes within the United States:"
A third militia is a state defense force. It is authorized by state and federal laws.
"Congress has organized the National Guard under its power to ""raise and support armies"" and not its power to ""Provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the Militia"". This Congress chose to do in the interests of organizing reserve military units which were not limited in deployment by the strictures of our power over the constitutional militia, which can be called forth only ""to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."" The modern National Guard was specifically intended to avoid status as the constitutional militia, a distinction recognized by 10 U.S.C. Sec 311(a)."
"The term ""militia"" derives from Old English ""milite"" meaning soldiers (plural), ""militisc"" meaning military and also classical Latin ""milit-, miles"" meaning soldier."
"The Modern English term ""militia"" dates to the year 1590, with the original meaning now obsolete: ""the body of soldiers in the service of a sovereign or a state"". Subsequently, since approximately 1665, ""militia"" has taken the meaning ""a military force raised from the civilian population of a country or region, especially to supplement a regular army in an emergency, frequently as distinguished from mercenaries or professional soldiers"". The U.S. Supreme Court adopted the following definition for ""active militia"" from an Illinois Supreme Court case of 1879: "" 'a body of citizens trained to military duty, who may be called out in certain cases, but may not be kept on service like standing armies, in times of peace'. . . when not engaged at stated periods . . . they return to their usual avocations . . . and are subject to call when public exigencies demand it."""
"The spelling of ""millitia"" is often observed in written and printed materials from the 17th century through the 19th century."
"""See article: Colonial American military history"""
"The early colonists of America considered the militia an important social institution, necessary to provide defense and public safety."
"""See article: Provincial troops in the French and Indian Wars"""
"During the French and Indian Wars, town militia formed a recruiting pool for the Provincial Forces. The legislature of the colony would authorize a certain force level for the season's campaign and set recruitment quotas for each local militia. In theory, militia members could be drafted by lot if there were inadequate forces for the Provincial Regulars; however, the draft was rarely resorted to because provincial regulars were highly paid (more highly paid than their regular British Army counterparts) and rarely engaged in combat."
"In September 1755, George Washington, then adjutant-general of the Virginia militia, upon a frustrating and futile attempt to call up the militia to respond to a frontier Indian attack:"
See New Hampshire Provincial Regiment for a history of a Provincial unit during the French and Indian War.
"Just prior to the American Revolutionary War, on October 26, 1774, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, observing the British military buildup, deemed their militia resources to be insufficient: the troop strength, ""including the sick and absent, amounted to about seventeen thousand men ... this was far short of the number wanted, that the council recommended an immediate application to the New England governments to make up the deficiency"":"
"""See article: List of United States militia units in the American Revolutionary War"""
"The American Revolutionary War began near Boston, Massachusetts with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, in which a group of local militias constituted the American side (the ""Patriots""). On April 19, 1775, a British force 800 strong marched out of Boston to Concord intending to destroy patriot arms and ammunition. At 5:00 in the morning at Lexington, they met about 70 armed militiamen whom they ordered to disperse, but the militiamen refused. Firing ensued; it is not clear which side opened fire. This became known as ""the shot heard round the world"". Eight militiamen were killed and ten wounded, whereupon the remainder took flight. The British continued on to Concord and were unable to find most of the arms and ammunition of the patriots. As the British marched back toward Boston, patriot militiamen assembled along the route, taking cover behind stone walls, and sniped at the British. At Meriam's Corner in Concord, the British columns had to close in to cross a narrow bridge, exposing themselves to concentrated, deadly fire. The British retreat became a rout. It was only with the help of an additional detachment of 900 troops that the British force managed to return to Boston. This marked the beginning of the war. It was ""three days after the affair of Lexington and Concord that any movement was made towards embodying a regular army""."
"In 1777, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, which contained a provision for raising a confederal militia that consent would be required from nine of the 13 States. Article VI of the Articles of Confederation states,"
"Some militia units appeared without adequate arms, as evidenced in this letter from John Adams to his wife, dated August 26, 1777:"
"The militia are turning out with great alacrity both in Maryland and Pennsylvania. They are distressed for want of arms. Many have none, we shall rake and scrape enough to do Howe's business, by favor of the Heaven."
"The initial enthusiasm of Patriot militiamen in the beginning days of the war soon waned. The historian Garry Wills explains,"
"The fervor of the early days in the reorganized militias wore off in the long grind of an eight-year war. Now the right to elect their own officers was used to demand that the men not serve away from their state. Men evaded service, bought substitutes to go for them as in the old days, and had to be bribed with higher and higher bounties to join the effort – which is why Jefferson and Samuel Adams called them so expensive. As wartime inflation devalued the currency, other pledges had to be offered, including land grants and the promise of ""a healthy slave"" at the end of the war. Some men would take a bounty and not show up. Or they would show up for a while, desert, and then, when they felt the need for another bounty, sign up again in a different place. ... This practice was common enough to have its own technical term – ""bounty jumping""."
"The burden of waging war passed to a large extent to the standing army, the Continental Army. The stay-at-home militia tended then to perform the important role of the internal police to keep order. British forces sought to disrupt American communities by instigating slave rebellions and Indian raids. The militia fended off these threats. Militias also spied on Loyalists in the American communities. In Albany County, New York, the militia established a Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies to look out for and investigate people with suspicious allegiances."
"Politically, the militia was highly popular during the postwar period, though to some extent, based more on pride of victory in the recent war than on the realities. This skepticism of the actual value of relying upon the militia for national defense, versus a trained regular army was expressed by Gouverneur Morris:"
"An overweening vanity leads the fond many, each man against the conviction of his own heart, to believe or affect to believe, that militia can beat veteran troops in the open field and even play of battle. This idle notion, fed by vaunting demagogues, alarmed us for our country, when in the course of that time and chance, which happen to all, she should be at war with a great power."
